Assembly Bill No. 283–Assemblymen Summers-Armstrong,
      Marzola, Peters; Bilbray-Axelrod, Carter, González,
      Brittney Miller, C.H. Miller, Nguyen and Watts
                                           CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; authorizing the Department of
    Health and Human Services to establish an incentive payment
    under the Medicaid program for doula services provided in
    rural areas; requiring the Department to seek an increase to
    certain reimbursement rates under the Medicaid program for
    doula services; making an appropriation and authorizing
    certain expenditures; and providing other matters properly
    relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
    Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
administer the Medicaid program. (NRS 422.270) Existing law requires the
Director of the Department, to the extent authorized by federal law, to include
under Medicaid coverage for certain doula services. (NRS 422.27717) Section 1 of
this bill authorizes the Department to establish an incentive payment for enrolled
doulas who provide doula services to recipients of Medicaid in rural areas of this
State. Section 1 also makes changes to reflect that federal law requires services
provided under a federal waiver to be included in a waiver document that is
separate from the State Plan for Medicaid. Section 1.5 of this bill requires the
Department to submit to the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services
on or before October 1, 2023, a request to amend the State Plan for Medicaid to
increase the rate of reimbursement which is provided on a fee-for-service basis
pursuant to the State Plan for certain services provided by a doula to an amount that
is intended to cover the cost of the services. Section 1.3 of this bill makes an
appropriation to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department and authorizes certain related expenditures for increases in
reimbursement rates and actuarial expenses associated with carrying out the
provisions of this bill.
