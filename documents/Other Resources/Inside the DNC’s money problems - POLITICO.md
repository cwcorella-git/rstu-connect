            Inside the DNC’s money problems
            Big donors have pulled back from giving to the party, and small donors are not growing enough to make up the
            gap.

            The Democratic National Committee has fallen far behind in the cash race.

            After a brutal 2024 election and several months into rebuilding eﬀorts under new party
            leadership, the DNC wildly trails the Republican National Committee by nearly every
            fundraising metric. By the end of June, the RNC had $80 million on hand, compared to

            $15 million for the DNC.



            And the gap — nearly twice as large as it was at this stage in Donald Trump’s ﬁrst
            presidency — has only grown in recent months, a POLITICO analysis of campaign
            ﬁnance data found, fueled by several distinct factors.

            Major Democratic donors have withheld money this year amid skepticism about the
            party’s direction, while the small-dollar donors who have long been a source of
            strength are not growing nearly enough to make up the gap. And the party has quickly
            churned through what money it has raised in the ﬁrst half of the year, including
            spending more than $15 million this year to pay oﬀ lingering expenses from Kamala
            Harris’ presidential campaign.

            The DNC has less cash this summer than it did at any point in the last ﬁve years.

            “I understand that donors want some kind of a reckoning,” said Steve Schale, a Florida-
            based Democratic strategist. “But I also think that the kind of state party building that I
            think [DNC Chair] Ken [Martin] wants to do at the DNC is really vital to our success.
            And so I hope people kind of get over themselves pretty quick.”

            The fundraising troubles reﬂect ongoing questions about the DNC’s direction under
            Martin, who was elected earlier this year, and comes as the DNC has faced months of
            bitter inﬁghting. Continued cash shortages could limit the party’s ability to rebuild for a
            new cycle. And the DNC’s money woes stand in particularly stark contrast to
            Republicans, who have leveraged President Donald Trump’s fundraising prowess to
            raise record sums.

            “Chair Martin and the DNC have raised more than twice what he had raised at this
            point in 2017, and our success in cycles thereafter is well documented. Under Ken,
            grassroots support is strong,” former DNC Executive Director Sam Cornale said in a
            statement. “It’s now time for everyone to get oﬀ the sidelines and join the ﬁght.
            Rebuilding a party is hard — rebuilding relationships and programs take time and will
            require all hands on deck to meet this moment.”

Inside the DNC’s money problems - POLITICO                   https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/18/dnc-fundrais...




            The DNC’s money woes stand out among major Democratic groups, POLITICO’s
            analysis found: Democrats’ House and Senate campaign arms are near ﬁnancial parity
            with their Republican counterparts, and several major donors who have withheld funds
            from the DNC are still giving to those groups.

            “Donors see the DNC as rudderless, oﬀ message and leaderless. Those are the
            buzzwords I keep hearing over and over again,” said one Democratic donor adviser,
            granted anonymity to speak candidly about donors’ approach.

            The DNC, on the other hand, touts Democrats’ success in state and local elections this
            year as proof the party’s investments are paying oﬀ. The group also began transferring
            more funds to state parties this year, and argues it is better-positioned ﬁnancially than it
            was at this time in 2017, when it also signiﬁcantly trailed the Trump-powered RNC.

            Some Democrats attribute the slowdown among donors primarily to the need for a
            break after 2024, and the challenges of being the party out of power. Large donors
            would rather bump elbows with high-proﬁle ﬁgures like a president or House speaker;
            Democrats cannot put on those kinds of fundraising events right now. The DNC also
            struggled for cash during Trump’s ﬁrst presidential term, and that did not stop
            Democrats from taking back the House in 2018, or winning the presidency in 2020.

            Still, the longer the DNC struggles to build up cash, the harder it will be to close that
            gap heading into the 2026 midterms and beyond. And the fact that other party
            committees are not seeing the same ﬁnancial struggles puts more responsibility on
            Martin and his team to ﬁgure out a way to right the ship.

            “Obviously, the sooner the DNC and other Democratic-aligned groups can get
            investment, the better. It’s better for long-term programs on the ground, it’s better to
            communicate our message early on,” said Maria Cardona, a DNC member and
            Democratic strategist. “However, I think you’re going to see donors coming into those
            things because they are starting to see Democrats ﬁghting back, and that’s what they
            want.”

            Just 47 donors gave the maximum contribution to the DNC in the ﬁrst half of the year,
            according to the POLITICO analysis of the party’s ﬁlings with the Federal Election
            Commission. Over the same period in 2021, more than 130 donors gave a maximum
            contribution. (In 2017, when the party was similarly struggling with large donors, the
            ﬁgure was 37.)

            That means dozens of the DNC’s biggest donors from early last cycle have not yet given
            to it this year — accounting for several million dollars the party group has missed out
            on this time.

            Many of those biggest donors have continued to contribute to other Democratic groups
            and candidates, indicating they are still aligned with the party and willing to dole out
            cash — though often not as much, and not to the DNC.

            preferred Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic Party chair, to Martin, who long
            served as the leader of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and also led the
            Association of State Democratic Parties.

            “If Ken [Martin] really wanted to impress donors, he’d go do 20 or 30 salon events with
            donors and let them yell at him,” said the Democratic donor adviser. “If you take that
            on the chin, make some changes, then I think we could see some movement. But [he’s]
            not going to do that.”

            With large donors lagging, the DNC has touted record grassroots fundraising from
            online donors. On ActBlue, the primary Democratic online fundraising platform, the
            group raised $33.8 million over the ﬁrst six months of the year, up from $27 million
            over the same time in 2021.

            But the total number of online donors was roughly the same in both periods —
            suggesting online donors are giving more than they were four years ago, but the group’s
            donor base has not expanded substantially.

            Most DNC donors this year were contributors to Harris’ campaign or the DNC last
            cycle, according to the POLITICO analysis. Another 14 percent of donors had no
            record of donations on ActBlue last cycle, suggesting the DNC is ﬁnding new small
            donors — but not nearly fast enough to make up for the drop-oﬀ among large donors.

            In fact, the rate of online giving to the DNC has slowed in recent months. The party’s
            best online fundraising month was March, when it raised $8.6 million on ActBlue from
            254,000 donors; in June, the party raised $4.1 million on the platform from 157,000
            donors.

            And reaching those online donors comes at a cost: The DNC has spent $5.7 million on
            online fundraising this year, according to its FEC ﬁlings. On Meta, which includes
            Facebook and Instagram, it is one of the largest political spenders this year, according
            to the platform’s data. The total spent on fundraising expenses so far is nearly as much
            as the DNC has sent to state parties this year.

            Another set of major expenses also stands out for draining the DNC’s coﬀers:

            continuing to pay oﬀ expenses from Harris’ failed 2024 presidential bid.

            Her campaign ended last year’s election with roughly $20 million in unpaid expenses,
            according to people familiar with its ﬁnances, although none of Harris’ campaign
            committees or aﬃliates ever oﬃcially reported debt. The DNC has spent $15.8 million
            total on coordinated expenses with the Harris campaign this year, including $1.3
            million in June. A party spokesperson declined to comment on future campaign-related
            payments.
