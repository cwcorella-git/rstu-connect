# Civil Self-Help Law Center Provides Legal Information, Resources for Tenants

When facing housing legal issues, many tenants feel overwhelmed by the complexity of laws, court procedures, and paperwork. The Civil Self-Help Law Center at the Washoe County Courthouse provides free resources to help people navigate the legal system, including tenant-landlord disputes.

## What is the Civil Self-Help Law Center?

### Mission and Purpose
The Civil Self-Help Law Center is a free public service that provides:
- **Legal information** (not legal advice) about laws and procedures
- **Forms and documents** for common legal matters

### Important Distinction
**Legal Information vs. Legal Advice**:

The Self-Help Center provides legal information to help you understand your options, but cannot tell you what to do or represent you in court.
