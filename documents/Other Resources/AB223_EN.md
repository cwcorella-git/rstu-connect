    in a habitable condition to file a verified complaint for
    expedited relief; revising certain provisions relating to the
    content of written rental agreements; revising provisions
    relating to the payment of rent; revising provisions relating to
    requirements for habitability; revising provisions relating to
    the remedies a tenant is authorized to pursue if a landlord

    matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
     Section 3 of this bill defines the term “loss of value” for purposes of the
provisions set forth in existing law governing the relationship between landlords
and tenants. (Chapter 118A of NRS)
     Existing law requires a written rental agreement to contain provisions relating
to certain subjects, including certain information concerning the contact
information of the landlord or his or her authorized representative. (NRS 118A.200)
Section 6 of this bill requires the electronic mail address of the landlord or his or
her authorized representative to be included in such provisions.
     Existing law provides that the absence of a written agreement raises certain
disputable presumptions, including a presumption that maintenance and waste
removal services are provided without charge to the tenant. (NRS 118A.200)
Section 6 additionally includes the provision of utility services at no charge to the
tenant in such a presumption.
     Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing the payment of rent by a
tenant and the delivery of certain signed written receipts to a tenant. (NRS
118A.210, 118A.250) Section 8 of this bill requires a landlord to provide a written
receipt to a tenant upon the receipt of each payment of rent.
     Existing law requires a landlord, at all times during a tenancy, to maintain a
dwelling unit in a habitable condition and provides that a dwelling unit is not
habitable if it violates provisions of certain housing or health codes or if it
substantially lacks certain things, including floors, walls, ceilings, stairways and
railings which are maintained in good repair. (NRS 118A.290) Section 9 of this bill
additionally provides that a dwelling unit is not habitable if it substantially lacks:
(1) doors and windows which are maintained in good repair; (2) effective measures
in place to control the presence of rodents, insects and vermin; (3) effective




   -                                                          83rd Session (2025)

measures in place to prevent exposure to unsafe levels of radon, lead paint,
asbestos, toxic mold and other hazardous substances; (4) in the dwelling unit and
any other part of the areas on the premises under the landlord’s control, locks which
are maintained in good repair on all exterior doors and all windows which are
capable of being opened; and (5) safety equipment which is required by law to be
included in the dwelling unit maintained in good working order.
     Existing law requires, if a landlord fails to comply with a rental agreement, a
tenant to deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the acts and omissions
constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will be terminated.
Existing law further authorizes, if the landlord fails to remedy the breach or make a
reasonable effort to do so within 14 days after receipt of the notice, a tenant to: (1)
terminate the rental agreement immediately; (2) recover actual damages; and (3)
apply to the court for such relief as the court deems proper under the circumstances.
(NRS 118A.350) Section 10 of this bill authorizes the tenant to terminate the rental
agreement without incurring any fee which is assessed by the landlord for the early
termination of a rental agreement and authorizes the tenant to additionally provide
the landlord with written notice of the intent of the tenant to terminate the rental
agreement on a date which is not later than 60 days after the date the notice is
provided to the landlord. Sections 11 and 12 of this bill similarly authorize tenants
whose landlords have failed to maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable condition or
supply essential items and services to terminate a rental agreement in this manner.
(NRS 118A.355, 118A.380)
     Existing law further prohibits a tenant from taking certain remedial actions if
the breach is remediable and the landlord adequately remedies the breach or uses
his or her best efforts to remedy the breach within 14 days after receipt of the
notice. (NRS 118A.350) Section 10 instead provides that a tenant is prohibited
from taking such remedial actions if the breach is remediable and the landlord
remedies the breach within the prescribed time. Existing law additionally prohibits
a tenant from taking such remedial actions unless the tenant has provided the
landlord with certain notice but authorizes the tenant to recover actual damages
without such notice if the landlord: (1) admits to the court that the landlord had
knowledge of the condition constituting the breach; or (2) has received written
notice of that condition from a governmental agency authorized to inspect for
violations of building, housing or health codes. (NRS 118A.350) Section 10 instead
authorizes the tenant to recover actual damages without providing such notice if the
landlord: (1) received written notice of that condition from such a governmental
agency; or (2) had actual knowledge of the condition constituting the breach.
Sections 11 and 12 similarly, for tenants whose landlords have failed to maintain a
dwelling unit in a habitable condition or supply essential items and services: (1)
remove language which would prohibit such tenants from taking certain remedial
actions if the landlord has failed to adequately remedy the failure or used his or her
best efforts to remedy the concern; and (2) revise the circumstances under which a
tenant is authorized to take certain remedial actions without providing notice. (NRS
118A.355, 118A.380)
     Existing law authorizes a tenant whose landlord has failed to maintain a
dwelling unit in a habitable condition to take certain remedial actions if a landlord
fails to adequately remedy the failure or use his or her best efforts to remedy the
failure within a certain period of time. (NRS 118A.355) Section 4 of this bill
authorizes a tenant, in addition to such remedial actions, to file a verified complaint
for expedited relief with the court and sets forth procedures relating to the filing,
hearing and disposition of such a verified complaint. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes
a tenant who files such a verified complaint to withhold any rent that becomes due
without incurring late fees, charges for notice or certain other charges until the

landlord has remedied the failure; (2) authorizes the court to order that such rent be
placed into an escrow account which is maintained or approved by the court; and
(3) requires the payment of all costs and official fees for any tenant who files such a
verified complaint to be deferred and later assessed against the party that does not
prevail. Section 17 of this bill authorizes a tenant to provide a copy of the notice
provided to a landlord to a district board of health for purposes of certain provisions
relating to the inspection of and administrative proceedings concerning health
hazards, in addition to any remedy provided in section 4.
     Existing law further requires justice courts to establish by local rule a
mechanism by which tenants that withhold rent under such circumstances may
deposit such rent into an escrow account maintained or approved by the court.
(NRS 118A.355) Section 11: (1) requires such rules to additionally provide for the
deposit of rent withheld pursuant to section 4; and (2) prohibits a court from
releasing any money deposited into such accounts until the time period to file an
appeal has run.
     Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, a tenant to withhold any
rent that becomes due without incurring certain charges until the landlord has
remedied, or has attempted in good faith to remedy, certain failures to maintain a
dwelling in a habitable condition. Existing law further provides that a tenant who
takes such actions does not have a defense to an eviction unless the tenant has
deposited the withheld rent into an escrow account maintained or approved by the
court. (NRS 118A.355) Section 11 instead provides that a tenant does not have
such a defense unless: (1) he or she has deposited the withheld rent minus any
applicable loss of value, into such an escrow account; or (2) the court determines, at
the time of the hearing, that the tenant has otherwise retained or is capable of
paying the withheld rent minus any applicable loss of value.
     Existing law additionally prohibits a tenant whose landlord has failed to
maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable condition from taking certain remedial
actions if the condition was caused by the tenant’s own deliberate or negligent act
or omission or that of a member of his or her household or other person on the
premises with his or her consent. (NRS 118A.355) Section 11 prohibits such a
tenant from taking such remedial actions, including filing a verified complaint for
expedited relief pursuant to section 4, if the condition was proven, by clear and
convincing evidence, to have been caused by the tenant’s own deliberate or
negligent act or omission or that of a member of his or her household or other
person on the premises with his or her consent who is not another tenant, or guest
thereof, on the premises pursuant to a separate rental agreement. Section 12
similarly prohibits a tenant whose landlord has willfully or negligently failed to
supply essential items or services from taking certain remedial actions under such
circumstances. (NRS 118A.380)
     Existing law authorizes a tenant to take certain remedial actions if his or her
landlord willfully or negligently fails to supply essential items or services and by
doing so, caused the premises to become unfit for habitation. Existing law further
provides a nonexhaustive list of certain items and services which constitute
essential items or services, including, heat, air-conditioning, running water, hot
water, electricity, gas and a functioning door lock. (NRS 118A.380) Section 12
includes in such a list a functioning window lock and functional safety equipment.
     Existing law authorizes a tenant to take certain actions and recover actual
damages or an amount not greater than $2,500 which is fixed by a court, or both, if
a landlord: (1) unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or excludes the
tenant by blocking or attempting to block the tenant’s entry upon the premises; (2)
willfully interrupts or causes or permits the interruption of any essential item or
service required by the rental agreement or by law; or (3) recovers possession of the
