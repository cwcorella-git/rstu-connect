## Policy Landscape Analysis

### Corporate Landlord Accountability

#### RealPage Algorithm Pricing Investigation ⭐⭐⭐
**Issue**: Algorithmic price-fixing by corporate landlords  
**Mechanism**: RealPage shares private tenant information (credit, lease terms, payment history) to suggest rental pricing  
**Impact**: Artificially inflated rents through coordinated pricing  
**Legal Action**: Arizona Attorney General lawsuit; Nevada advocacy for similar investigation  
**RSTU Action**: Drafted letter calling for Nevada AG investigation (August 2024)

#### Commerce Tax Exemptions for REITs ⭐⭐
**Issue**: Real Estate Investment Trusts exempt from Nevada commerce tax  
**Advocate**: Assemblywoman Venicia Considine  
**Equity Concern**: Business landlords pay commerce tax, but REIT landlords don't  
**Quote**: "It is unfair for landlords of businesses in group A to pay the commerce tax but not group B"

### Anti-Homeless Criminalization Resistance ⭐⭐⭐

#### January 2025 Reno City Council Ordinances
**Context**: Reno-Sparks housing affordability crisis response  
**Proposed**: Agenda items F1-F6 criminalizing sitting, sleeping, loitering in public  
**RSTU Response**: Coalition organizing against ordinances  
**Community Impact**: UNLV report shows Nevada renters have 2nd highest cost burden nationally  
**Quote**: "For every $100 increase in rent, we see a 9% increase in the chance of becoming unhoused"

### Legislative Strategy Observations

#### Nevada Housing Coalition Concerns ⚠️
**Issue**: "Co-opted by industry insiders" attempting to "build their way out of the problem"  
**RSTU Position**: Skeptical of development-first solutions  
**Alternative Approach**: Focus on tenant power and organizing-based solutions

#### Bipartisan Challenges
**Governor Lombardo**: Expected to veto same tenant protection bills as previous session  
**Strategic Need**: "Meet with Realtors and landlord industry groups to reach consensus"  
**Implication**: Tenant organizing must build broader coalitions for legislative success

## Key Quotes and Messaging

**Housing as Human Right**: "Housing is a human right, not a commodity, and everyone deserves control over their living situation."

**Tenant vs Housing Organization**: "We fight for tenants, not for housing. The crisis in our region is not due to a lack of housing, and will not be solved simply with more development."

**Systemic Analysis**: "Homelessness is a housing problem, not a personal or moral failing. It is devastating and difficult whenever we punish folks in response."

**Class Struggle Framework**: "The interests of landlords and tenants are fundamentally irreconcilable, and we reject any policy that attempts to paper over this conflict."

This legislative tracking framework provides the foundation for RSTU's policy advocacy work and demonstrates the organization's sophisticated understanding of Nevada's tenant protection legal landscape.
