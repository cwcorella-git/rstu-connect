         The Fight to Save Nevada's Ag Future and CABNR


         The Fight to Save Nevada's Ag Future and CABNR


         By Julie Kay Smithson, property rights researcher, London, Ohio propertyrights@earthlink.net http://
         www.propertyrightsresearch.org and http://propertyrightsresearch.blogspot.com




         The University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) is one of America's 74 land-grant institutions(1) and the only
         one in the Silver State. A proposal announced March 1, was made to close one of UNR's ten
         colleges -- the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology and Natural Resources, or CABNR -- and
         reorganize remaining programs under the College of Science, in order to trim $11 million. The UNR
         is the sum of its parts: College of Agriculture, Biotechnology & Natural Resources; College of
         Business; College of Education; College of Engineering; Division of Health Sciences; College of
         Liberal Arts; College of Science; Extended Studies; Reynolds School of Journalism; and the
         University of Nevada Cooperative Extension.(2) In the current difficult economic climate, the need to
         downsize is understandable, but one college taking a forty percent hit is lopsided.

         CABNR is one of UNR's ten academic units, but is "paying its own way" in many important areas
         (3), including an internationally preeminent publication, The Journal of Thrombosis and Hemostasis,
         February 2010 issue, which cover features the Department of Animal Biotechnology, University of
         Nevada, Reno, NV, article titled: "Clinical and molecular characterization of a re-established line of
         sheep exhibiting hemophilia A" (4) which was developed at the Main Station Field Lab. Major strides
         in research are being made at CABNR. The value of stem-cell research alone is a jewel in CABNR's
         crown.

         Part of the Academic Planning Process offers this justification for the authority to take such drastic
         action: 1. An administrative unit, project, program or curriculum may be discontinued, reduced in
         size, or reorganized for bona fide reasons pertaining to the University’s mission as a consequence
         of the Academic Planning Process, which has been approved by President Glick. ... 7. Any

         department that is the subject of a Proposal shall review the Proposal and, through the Department
         Chair, submit any data or other documentation supporting or challenging the Proposal (the
         Department’s Response) to the appropriate Dean and the Provost by March 26, 2010. 8. ... The
         College Review Committee’s recommendation and the results of the vote of the college faculty shall
         be sent to the Faculty Senate Chair and the Provost by April 9, 2010.(5)



         The proposal's timeline:


         1. The curricular review proposal is released Monday, March 1, 2010.
         2. Units respond to proposed program closing by Friday, March 26, 2010.
         3. Colleges respond and vote on the proposal by Friday, April 9, 2010.
         4. The Faculty Senate reviews the proposal and other supplied information and makes a
         recommendation to the President and Provost by May 7, 2010.
         5. The President and Provost make their final decisions and propose appropriate program closures
         to the Board of Regents by May 14, 2010.
         6. The Board of Regents decides on program closures in early June.
         7. Employees related to closing programs are notified of their termination by June 30, 2010, and
         provided with rights of reconsideration and notification.(6)


         Provost Marc Johnson said that determining which programs or departments to cut was based on
         factors such as the number of degrees granted, enrollment in the major, scholarship productivity,
         external scholarship grant awards, how important they were to the university's mission and their
         national and international uniqueness.(7)

         A March 12 telephone interview with Regent Dorothy Gallagher was troubling. She stated that it’s a
         misconception that agriculture programs at UNR could be completely eliminated. Rather, they may
         be restructured.(8)

         Nevada's economy is fueled by "the big three" -- gaming, mining and agriculture, of which the
         number two and three are doing well, though gaming has suffered.(9) CABNR, with its structure of
         teachers' budget-based pay supplanted by grant awards, means the ag college truly does help pay
         its own way, a “gift that keeps on giving” in the form of research that benefits Nevada, the nation
         and the world.

         The importance of CABNR to social networking websites was immediate: two Facebook Groups
         were established with a total over 4,000 members.(10)

         Arguments about CABNR's safety being set forth in the Nevada Constitution -- ARTICLE 11,
         SECTION 4 Sec: 4. Establishment of state university; control by board of regents. The Legislature
         shall provide for the establishment of a State University which shall embrace departments for
         Agriculture, Mechanic Arts, and Mining to be controlled by a Board of Regents whose duties shall
         be prescribed by Law. . . . ARTICLE 11, SECTION 8[...] And the Legislature shall provide that if

         through neglect or any other contingency, any portion of the fund so set apart [for a college for the
         benefit of Agriculture[,] the Mechanics Arts, and including Military tactics], shall be lost or
         misappropriated, the State of Nevada shall replace said amount so lost or misappropriated in said
         fund so that the principal of said fund shall remain forever undiminished[.](11) -- are compelling, but
         the proposal appears to attempt to skirt that.



         Interviews

         Interviews with students, alumni, parents, and Nevada's ranching community brought forth many
         reasons to oppose closing CABNR.

         Tessa Sustacha, Senior in Animal science with a minor in wildlife
         ecology:

         I have applied to Washington State University and Colorado State University Schools of Veterinary
         Medicine and am waiting to hear back from them about acceptance. I wish one day to practice as a
         veterinarian in a rural area, helping producers with herd health, wildlife disease issues as well as
         public health aspects of veterinary medicine. I chose CABNR for many reasons including that my
         dad, uncle and mom went to the University and CABNR. I also served as the Nevada State FFA
         secretary as a freshman and began my education at UNR. ... To me the college was affordable,
         offered the opportunity for scholarships and research, small class sizes and had a very well known
         pre-veterinary program with a reputation for turning out well-prepared successful applicants to
         graduate and schools of veterinary medicine. I am a 4th generation native Nevadan and I grew up
         in the Elko area. I was involved in 4-H since I was 9 years old and strongly believe in the power that
         4-H has and the importance of the services that cooperative extension and the University provide to
         rural communities. ... Agriculture has always been a huge part of my life and I believe that the
         agriculture industry faces serious issues in educating the public due to the disconnect that is
         created in this country through the availability of a safe and affordable food supply. This is ...
         seriously put in jeopardy if agriculture is not included in the curriculum at institutes of higher
         education. For this reason alone -- and the fact that Agriculturists must be provided with support
         and education, as well as the overall importance of agriculture to Nevada -- I care a great deal
         about CABNR.

         Erin Hourihan:

         I graduated from CABNR in 2007 with a bachelor's in Forestry and Rangeland Management. I
         returned to CABNR in the spring of 2009 to get a Masters in Animal Science. ... As a Master's
         student ... I am understandably outraged and appalled by the decision to eliminate the entire
         college. CABNR contains an abundance of degree and research programs, some of which are
         internationally renowned. At UNR, researchers in the Department of [Animal] Biotechnology have
         made significant advancements in the area of stem-cell research. The Department of Resource
         Economics has also gained international recognition for many significant publications. ... I feel a

         very strong connection to this university and this college. The economy of the small town I'm from,
         Challis Idaho, is completely dependant on agriculture and natural resource-based industry. There
         are farmers and ranchers, loggers and miners. Growing up, I saw how land management decisions
         -- made by people with no connection to the land -- affected these people and it greatly influenced
         my higher education choices. My mother is from a longtime ranching family in eastern Nevada. I
         chose to attend college in her home state for a variety of reasons. I knew I wanted to study natural
         resources; Nevada provided the perfect place to do this. As a master's student, the Great Basin
         provides unlimited research opportunities that are second to none. If the powers that be succeed
         with their plan to close the CABNR at UNR, a vast amount of learning opportunities will be lost. I am
         deeply saddened by the collateral damage that has already occurred as a result of President Glick's
         decision. Many well-regarded professors are looking for employment elsewhere, because they don't
         feel the University values their talents. This is not to say that all the good professors are leaving! I
         am very grateful to those that are staying, taking the risk, because they have no way of knowing
         how long they will have a job. ... It is imperative to stress the multidisciplinary focus of a degree in
         Forestry or Rangeland Management. The ability to gain employment after graduation is not dictated
         by the institution at which you choose to study, but a list of qualification standards determined by
         federal government land management agencies. These standards include specific course
         requirements. In addition to 18 course hours in specialized range management classes, the course
         requirements explicitly require 15 credit hours of courses in directly related plant, animal and soil
         science. Classes that fulfill this requirement include plant taxonomy, plant ecology, livestock
         production, and animal nutrition. Due to the fact that UNR has a severely limited plant science
         department, Range students rely heavily on the animal science department to meet the qualification
         standards for professional and scientific positions. The proposed curricular review states that one
         range ecology position will be moved into Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences in order
         to preserve the range management program. However, a degree resulting from a program void of
         all animal science related courses will be inadequate and will therefore do a disservice to its
         students. The systematic attack on CABNR will not just affect students studying animal science,
         pre-veterinary medicine and resource economics. It will also make getting a valuable degree in
         Range Ecology or Range Management impossible in a state where approximately 46 million acres
         of rangeland is facing habitat sustainability, urban sprawl and invasive species issues. Currently
         students wanting a degree Range Management from UNR are limited in their options. As a
         graduate student conducting research in Range Ecology, my major appears on my transcripts as
         Animal Science. This is because the majority of the Range professors on campus, teach in the
         department of Animal Science. This should speak to the interrelatedness of the two disciplines.
         Streamlining should not include destroying the positive elements of what currently exists. Instead
         we should focus on irrelevancies that could be eliminated and additions that will improve the degree
         program drawing students to this university ... This college has been an important part of my life for
         the last eight years.

         Kaley Volk, CABNR student and the to-be-cut Animal Science Major:

         I am a freshman trying to obtain my Animal Science and Pre-Veterinary Medicine (dual) major here
         at the University of Nevada, Reno. ... My hope is to one day be a large animal veterinarian, perhaps
         starting with the USDA and eventually working my way to opening up a private practice. ... UNR is
         the only school in the state of Nevada to offer agriculture and animal science programs (in

         relevance to a degree) and agriculture is in the top three list of income for the state to casinos and
         mining. CABNR's closing is purely based of student numbers, and because there are less students
         in the ANSC (Animal Science) programs and CABNR, they are letting go the wrong people on a
         matter of numbers. It is not about the quantity, but the quality. And seeing that Nevada needs
         specific students trained in agriculture and (especially) large animal veterinarians, in a few years
         down the road we will no longer have local people to fill those much needed positions, but have to
         look outside our own state and recruit others in, costing more money and time. The major financial
         cut of CABNR is taking its biggest hit on students in the field right now, who either have to change
         their life goals now or move elsewhere.

         Doug Busselman, Executive Vice President, Nevada Farm Bureau
         Federation:

         The contributions of Nevada farm and ranch families, economically, socially and in all other fashion,
         is part of not only the heritage and value structure of rural Nevada, we are also going to play an
         instrumental role in the future of what Nevada will become. Although UNR officials believe that we
         are insignificant enough to be disregarded as part of their future, we refuse to accept their rejection
         as mattering. ... Nevada agriculture does matter!

         Harvey Barnes, Barnes Ranch, Jiggs, Nevada:

         "I'm not speaking for the rest of the board, but as a rancher and a graduate of the College of
         Agriculture a long time ago. I realize the economic situation of our state, but I think the proposal to
         close a complete college such as CABNR is going way overboard. ... If they close the college of
         agriculture, the properties and the facilities on them in the Reno area will be gone. The Valley Road
         facility is very close to the campus. The Main Station Farm is just a couple of miles away and I think
         that was a real plus for the UNR Ag College students. ... At the meeting on March 11 ... I was a little
         disappointed in what [Provost Marc Johnson] had to tell us. I gathered that his mind was made up.
         ... Agriculture, with our processing industries, some farming, and cattle ranching, we're still a $2
         billion industry."

         Kelly Cook-Bell:

         I wonder if anyone has taken into account how this type of decision will weigh on our numerous FFA
         organizations in Nevada? What is this decision telling our kids and agricultural families in Nevada?

         Jean (last name withheld by request):

         I received a MS from the Resource Economics Department in 2000 when I was 45. It has been an
         invaluable degree for me, raising my income significantly and allowing me to work as an economist
         for the USDA. I first worked for the Economic Research Service where several colleagues were
         aware of the faculty at UNR. While a small department, the faculty is top notch and their reputation
         is probably how I got the job. Now I work for the Farm Service Agency's national office. I'm allowed
         to sit in California and telework every day because of my good skills learned at UNR.

         Sharon Hay:

         I'm shocked this extremely important aspect of the college is being closed, especially when ecology,
         biofuels, etc. is a highlight of the Obama administration, our nation & the world. ... I hope the
         university alters its stance.

         Mike (last name is withheld by request):

         With this decision, we are not just losing students, but also renowned research professors and the
         notoriety they bring. ... My brother, my wife and I all attended UNR. If this decision is final, I will be
         looking for other institutions to send my three children.

         Mike (last name withheld by request):

         My daughter is a freshman in the Pre-Vet CABNR program. She has thoroughly enjoyed her
         education and college experience. Her end goal is to attend a school of veterinary medicine, which
         we felt UNR gave her an outstanding chance to do. It is still unclear to me what level of education
         she will be losing based on this proposal. ...My assumption is she will miss out on the true hands-on
         experience of working with animals and she will miss being taught by experienced pre-vet teachers.
         She will now be attaining a general science degree that she can get at almost any university. If this
         is the case, and with ultra competition to be accepted into Vet school, we soon will be considering
         other colleges to meet her goal. This is very unfortunate for all involved.



         What you can do

         An immediate letter-writing campaign to the two individuals below is needed. Mailing addresses, fax
         numbers and email addresses have been provided. State your reasons for keeping CABNR open,
         being sure to mention your affiliation with CABNR, including CABNR graduates whose careers are
         an enhancement to their communities and Nevada's economy. Each family member should write
         his/her own letter; the numbers must prove the importance of CABNR to Nevada.


         Dr. Milton Glick, Office of the President, University of Nevada, Reno/001, Reno, NV 89557-0016.
         Fax: 775-784-6429 president@unr.edu

         775-784-6220 marc.johnson@unr.edu


         At stake, from the proponents' view: A savings of $11 million, plus over 1,000 acres of prime real
         estate in the Main Station Farm, a possible underlying motivational factor.

         At stake, from the opponents' view: Custom and culture, the only agricultural education in the state,
         a small -- but nationally and internationally significant -- degree program, and much more. The plan
         to close CABNR would have an immediate and irreversible impact on Nevada and agriculture; the
         two are inextricably woven into the state's economic and educational fabric.

                We are very grateful to the outreach work that has taken place, including the coverage
                given by the Progressive Rancher. Nevada agriculture's future research and educational
                needs are critically important and require us to be strong advocates, regardless of the
                decisions which will be made in the coming weeks and months. We need people to
                remain engaged and continue to work for accomplishing meaningful recognition for these
                needs no matter what type of structure will emerge from the process.

                Conservatives claim to be for property rights, yet also advocate laws against owning,
                buying, and selling certain products which they claim are "harmful." Conservatives, to
                their credit, tend to oppose the eﬀorts of liberals (who make no pretense to being for
                property rights) to ban guns. Conservatives tend to advocate that the government steal
                less property in taxes than liberals.

               2bhk and 3bhk, then Godrej Nirvaan Thane is giving you a good real estate property.
