Executive Summary
                                     Every fatal crash has something to teach us. That is the animating insight of
                                     this report.
                                       In North America, nearly all car crashes are attributed to human error. Yet, there
                                       are always many contributing factors that remain unidentified.
                                       Currently, there is no widely adopted approach to studying and learning from
                                       traumatic crashes.
                                       Local leaders must adopt such an approach in response to the rising number of
                                       auto-related deaths.

                                     Every day in North America, people are killed in automobile crashes. In
                                     the U.S. alone, the number is over 40,000 annually. Emergency response
                                     personnel are generally tasked with documenting what happened. They
                                     interview witnesses, draw schematics and check boxes.

Terry Binder in Meridian, Idaho.     The primary purpose of these eorts is to assist in assigning blame. Courts
                                     adjudicate and insurance companies pay claims based on the ndings in
                                     police reports. Sometimes, statistics from all those checked boxes prompt an
                                     institutional response, such as national campaigns to educate drivers on the
                                     dangers of texting while driving. Beyond that, it is rare that anything more is
                                     done, even for a fatal crash.
                                     The medical profession uses clinical mortality reviews to study and learn
                                     from adverse outcomes. The National Transportation Safety Board has a
                                     similar commitment to study each plane crash. Yet, despite the level of
                                     urgency, there is no institutional response to gain insight from automobile
                                     crashes.
                                     This is not because there is nothing to learn. And it’s not because we lack
                                     the capacity to conduct this kind of review. The most immediate obstacle to
                                     action is the lack of an established practice for analyzing and learning from
                                     fatal car crashes.
                                     In 2023, Strong Towns began conducting monthly studio sessions to analyze
                                     crashes. These Crash Analysis Studios were broadcast live through Zoom so
                                     that anyone could watch them. In each session, technical and nontechnical
                                     experts reviewed data. They examined photos and video of the scene. They
                                     worked to identify the multiple factors, large and small, that contributed to
                                     each crash. A report detailing the ndings was prepared and made publicly
                                     available for each Studio session.
                                     The immediate goal of this exercise was to demonstrate a process that
                                     cities can emulate to learn from their own crashes. These overlooked and
                                     underappreciated insights can be used by local leaders to improve trac
                                     safety. A side eect of the process was the discovery of some recurring
                                     factors. These facets were noted numerous times, despite the crashes’
                                     otherwise unique characteristics.

In the rst 18 studio sessions, participants repeatedly documented the
following contributing factors:
1. High-speed road design in urban areas, where the design of the street
   facilitated traffic speeds above what is known to be safe (noted in 16 sessions).
2. Design that inadequately accounts for people walking and biking, particularly
   in areas where street designers were clearly aware of the presence of people
   biking and walking but chose to prioritize high vehicle speeds over safety
   (noted in 14 sessions).
3. Dangerous intersection design, where streets were designed to speed — and
   sometimes even accelerate — vehicles into areas with high conflict potential
   (noted in 13 sessions).
4. Visibility and lighting issues, where the lighting used to illuminate driving
   areas obscured people biking and walking in glare and shadow (noted in 12
   sessions).
5. Deviation from the designer’s intent, where unsafe conditions unintentionally
   crept into the design during or after construction (noted in 4 sessions).

These ndings prompt Strong Towns, along with our partner participants in
this eort, to make the following recommendations to city ocials and local
leaders across North America:
1. Make safety a core organizational responsibility by empowering a person or
   team to intervene in established city processes on behalf of traffic safety.
2. Establish a Crash Response Team to gather data following a fatal or
   traumatic crash.
3. Establish a Crash Analysis Studio to identify and learn from the many factors
   that cause a crash.
4. Use temporary traffic control devices to respond quickly to dangerous
   situations.
5. Update local street standards to prioritize safety instead of traffic speed
   and throughput.
6. Conduct bike and walk audits for all projects to provide the same level
   of insight and awareness to the safety of people biking and walking as is
   routinely applied to people driving.

Since the end of World War II, American trac safety ocials have
dramatically reduced the rate of injury and death from auto crashes. Yet,
there is a persistent amount of trauma we have been unable to eliminate or
even meaningfully reduce. It’s not from lack of eort or resources.
To close that nal gap, local ocials need to take the lead. They need to
begin learning from the fatal crashes occurring on their own streets. That
knowledge can be put to work immediately to build local streets that are truly
safe.
We have the ability to learn something from each crash. The only thing we
need now is the desire to obtain that knowledge.




                                                                                       3

Factors Contributing to
Automobile Crashes
From January 2023 through June 2024, Strong Towns assisted community
members in the United States and Canada as they evaluated crashes using
the Crash Analysis Studio model. We solicited these crashes from the public
through our website. Most were nominated by Strong Towns members or
local leaders who are involved in our Local Conversations program. All but
one of these crashes involved a fatality or permanent injury.

Upon completing the Studio sessions, we examined the findings for
commonalities. We identified five factors that were common to multiple
crashes, four of which contributed to more than two out of every three
crashes examined.

                                      of safety. Drivers consistently respond to that added margin of safety by increasing
                                      speeds.

                                    Combining the low margin of error inherent in high-speed designs
                                    with the random complexity of urban areas means that a base level
                                    of violent collisions is all but guaranteed.

                                  High-speed road design in urban areas was a factor in 16 of the 18 crashes examined.

and Biking                        When people bike or walk near fast-moving trac, it takes only a very small
                                  miscalculation by one party to create a fatality or traumatic injury. Street designers
                                  can minimize this risk by designing streets for slower trac, by minimizing the
                                  amount of time that people biking and walking are exposed to trac, and by providing
                                  physical separation between vehicles and people biking and walking, especially when
                                  speeds are commonly lethal (over 20 mph).
                                  Across the crashes examined, however, municipalities consistently implemented
                                  designs that prioritized high trac speed over safety. This was often done at
                                  greater overall cost, with wider lanes, added shoulders and more right-of-way all
                                  creating extra project expense, so a lack of resources is not the problem. Even where
                                  designers anticipated people biking and walking, accommodating them was a design
                                  afterthought, something to be done after designing the roadway to facilitate high
                                  speeds.
                                  For example, in Meridian, Idaho, a housing development is located on the west side of
                                  North Ten Mile Road and a neighborhood school is located on the east side. Designers
                                  recognize that people, including young children, routinely cross this street on foot
                                  and by bike. Even so, the street is designed for high speeds (with an 85th percentile
                                  speed of 44 mph) and the only accommodation for someone outside an automobile is
                                  a crosswalk and a walk button. A typical person crossing on foot is directly exposed to
                                  dangerously fast trac for approximately 33 seconds during each crossing.
                                  Somewhat inevitably, given the degree of danger, someone was killed at this crossing.
                                  In this case, it was 16-year-old Terry Binder, who was killed on his way to school.

                                                                                                                          7

Design                                  communicate this increased risk, it gives drivers a false sense of security. This can have
                                        fatal consequences.
                                        For example, in Richmond, Virginia, a student named Mahrokh Khan was fatally
                                        struck by a vehicle while crossing from her apartment to the Virginia Commonwealth
                                        University campus. Despite the heavy presence of students and the modest volume
                                        of trac, the intersection is designed primarily for the high-speed movement of
                                        automobiles. There is one-way trac, multiple wide lanes and long through-signal
                                        timing, all of which facilitate excessive speed as drivers approach the intersection
                                        (which has an 85th percentile speed of 32 mph). The wide curb radii ensure that
                                        anyone crossing on foot is exposed to cross-trac for much longer than necessary.

                                        and/or shadow that conceals people on foot or bike.
                                        For example, in Hyattsville, Maryland, a woman named Hellen Jorgensen was fatally
                                        struck by a vehicle while she was attempting to cross the street at a marked crossing.
                                        The driver indicated that not only did they not see a person, but they didn’t even know
                                        they had struck a human. This was plausible because, while the vehicle intersection
                                        was well lit, the lighting placed anyone waiting to cross the street in shadow. The
                                        woman who was killed would have been able to clearly see the oncoming vehicle and
                                        likely felt seen in return, even though she was not.
                                        Visibility and lighting issues were a factor in 12 of the 18 crashes examined.

                                        For example, in Huntsville, Alabama, Joshua Gurley was fatally struck by a vehicle
                                        while attempting to cross University Drive on his bicycle. The sidewalk had been

                                        intersection. These upgrades addressed the transit situation, but unintentionally made
                                        it harder for someone biking to reach the crossing activation push button and added
                                        signicant confusion for someone biking through the intersection.

                                        rarely done for someone walking or biking.
                                        Deviation from the designer’s intent was a factor in 4 of the 18 crashes examined.

Key Recommendations
City officials must make systematic changes to ensure that knowledge
is gained from each fatal crash and used to meaningfully improve traffic
safety over time. While every crash has its own contributing factors and
subsequent recommendations, local governments must take the following
six steps to build a culture of traffic safety.

Recommendation #1

Make Safety a Core              Most city governments have committed themselves to improving trac safety. Yet,
                                making a commitment to safety is dierent from embedding a culture of safety within
Organizational
                                an organization. For example, in Charlotte, North Carolina, the city government
Responsibility
                                committed over $21 million since 2019 to support trac safety eorts. However, an
                                internal audit found that the city’s fatality and traumatic injury rates from car crashes
                                are actually rising.
                                The primary nding cited in the city’s report is that trac safety ocials lack any
                                meaningful authority to demand changes or create systematic accountability for
                                trac safety. In the city’s organizational chart, safety ocials are subordinate to the
                                city’s entire leadership structure. Charlotte is far from alone in this regard; few cities
                                empower ocials with the authority they need to make trac safety a real priority.
Image from Charlotte’s Vision
Zero audit report, July 2024.




                                To make trac safety a core organizational responsibility, the individual or
                                group responsible must have real authority. They must be able to raise issues with
                                the city’s design process. They must have veto power over dangerous street designs.
                                They must have direct access to whoever makes day-to-day decisions. They should be
                                responsible for reporting directly to elected ocials and should be required to sign o
                                on all transportation plans going out to bid.
                                Without authority vested near the top of the municipality’s organizational chart,
                                trac safety will continue to be an aspirational afterthought subordinate to other
                                priorities.

                                and urban design. This is particularly urgent for crashes that result in a fatality or
                                traumatic injury.
                                A Crash Response Team doesn’t need to rush to the site of an incident — that can
                                be left to the emergency response personnel. However, the team must visit the site
                                within a reasonable timeframe so as to accurately assess the conditions at the time of

                                involved in the crash experienced it.
                                The goal of the Crash Response Team isn’t to assign blame but to collect
                                measurements and make observations of the site for later evaluation.

Since its launch in January 2023, the Crash Analysis Studio has been used to
assemble multidisciplinary teams, along with affected individuals, to examine
deadly crashes across the U.S. and Canada.

Participants in these sessions don’t seek to determine blame. Instead, they ask
what changes could be made to prevent the next crash from occurring. Best of
all, some of their recommended actions have led to tangible changes, from the
reconfiguration of dangerous streets to the revision of design guidelines.

The Strong Towns Crash Analysis Studio is a tool for local leaders, both inside and
outside of government, who want to move beyond merely assigning blame and set
a new standard of care for traffic safety.

                                      On October 28, 2021, Frank Radaker was riding his bicycle, as he did on a near-
Indianapolis,
                                      daily basis, when a car struck and killed him. He was the seventh cyclist since July
Indiana                               of that same year to die on Indianapolis’ streets. In fact, in 2021, the Indianapolis
                                      Metropolitan Planning Organization reported more than 200 trac deaths, with their

  INDIANAPOLIS:
                                      “We’re on track for one of the deadliest years for trac violence in Indianapolis,
  strongtowns.org/cas-                right after setting a record last year,” said Damon Richards, executive director of Bike
  indianapolis-in                     Indianapolis. “People keep saying something has to be done, but assume someone else
                                      has to do it.”
                                      Unwilling to accept Radaker’s death as an inevitable consequence of living in
                                      Indianapolis, Connie Schmucker nominated the crash that took his life to the Crash
                                      Analysis Studio.

     “People keep saying              Radaker was killed where the Monon Trail — a Rails-to-Trails paved path that spans
                                      Central Indiana — intersects with East 86th Street, a hallmark stroad. East 86th Street
     something has to be

     done, but assume                 vehicle traveling at this speed, they would end up hospitalized at best; at worst, they

                                      road.
     Damon Richards,
     Executive director of            At a glance, however, the speed limit feels appropriate for East 86th Street. Every
     Bike Indianapolis                commercial space in the vicinity features a driveway and a parking lot. The corridor
                                      is less of a place to linger and more of a place to get through. Virtually nothing in the
                                      area is designed to be accessed by anything other than a personal vehicle.
                                      Except, “one of the best urban biking experiences in the U.S.” goes right through East
                                      86th Street. Hikers and bikers are dumped onto a road that doesn’t accommodate
                                      them and drivers are taken by surprise. This fundamental incompatibility has made
                                      this intersection a dreaded segment of every trail user’s ride. In 2021, it led Radaker to
                                      his death.
                                      The Crash Analysis Studio gave local advocates, city ocials and engineers an
                                      opportunity to confront the culpability of the intersection in his death. Rather than
                                      focus on who was more at fault, driver or cyclist, the Studio focused on how the road’s
                                      design contributed to and elevated the stakes of the crash.
“One of the best urban biking
experiences in the U.S.” crosses
East 86th Street in Indianapolis.
However, among other risk
factors, the design of the crossing
gives drivers no indication that
there is an increased risk of
collision. Now, the city is taking
the lead to address these design
shortcomings rapidly.

                           The Studio’s panelists devised several recommendations for the city, some of them
                           as simple as installing more obvious signage to alert drivers of the impending trail
                           crossing. Luckily for grieving panelists, they have allies in the city. The problem is not
                           the lack of political will, but the built-in bureaucracy that serves as an impediment to
                           incremental change. As of July 2024, however, Indianapolis is trying something new.

After the Studio           In July 2024, Indianapolis announced a program that eliminates many of the political
                           barriers that have long prevented the city from taking immediate action in the
                           aftermath of crashes. Better yet, the Community Powered Infrastructure initiative
                           encourages residents to take action themselves with guidance and tools from the
                           Department of Public Works.
                           “Community Powered Infrastructure supplements the work of our engineering team
                           by empowering residents to help make more immediate changes they would like to
                           see in their neighborhoods,” the department’s director told the local news. “When
                           residents are involved, projects are more likely to reect the true needs and desires of
                           the community.”
                           Initiatives like this fortify the city’s crisis response to a crash and lessen the chances
                           of another happening. They also have preventative value: Locals intimately know what
                           their neighborhoods need and the dangers they face. If they’re able to pioneer change,
                           they can address those needs and dangers before a fatal crash takes place.
                           These changes are bearing fruit. Already, the department has installed temporary
                           bollards along crash-prone sites as it plans and budgets for more permanent design
                           solutions.



                           On June 7, 2021, 37-year-old Joshua Gurley was riding his bicycle on University Drive
Huntsville,
                           in Huntsville, Alabama, when he wanted to make a turn onto Julia Street. He began
Alabama                    crossing when he thought the coast was clear, yet halfway across University Drive, he
                           was struck by a car. The driver didn’t see him in time to stop. Gurley was pronounced
 READ MORE ABOUT           dead at the scene.
 HUNTSVILLE:
                           The resulting police report concluded that Gurley must have failed to obey trac
 strongtowns.org/cas-      signals at the time of the collision, a miscalculation he paid for with his life. Yet, locals
 huntsville-al
                           familiar with the area refused to accept that the crash could be boiled down to the
                           slip-up of one cyclist.
                           For locals, University Drive is dangerous by design. Between 2015 and 2022, it
                           witnessed 62 pedestrian and 16 bicyclist deaths, far more than any other road in
                           Huntsville. A death toll that high should prompt a deeper investigation into why
                           this road happens to be more dangerous than others like it. That’s why Larry Mason
                           nominated the crash that claimed Gurley’s life to the Crash Analysis Studio.

  A death toll that high   During the Studio, Melany Alliston of Toole Design immediately noted that the road’s

                                       speed limit of 45 mph. One speed study even found that 60% of drivers exceeded the
                                       speed limit in a 55-minute period.
                                       At these speeds, vehicles should not be freely mixing with people traveling by foot
                                       or bicycle, yet the road supports and even encourages these modes of mobility. For
                                       one, the bus stop produces foot trac. Many of the people walking to and from the
                                       bus stop are subject to interrupted sidewalk connections, which force them to cross
                                       University Drive at regular intervals or risk walking on the road’s edge.
Between 2015 and 2022,
University Drive in Huntsville,
Alabama, was the site of 78
pedestrian and bicyclist deaths.
Sites like this are a clear starting
point for cities seeking to address
trac crashes using the Crash
Analysis Studio model.




                                       There are also residential subdivisions within a short walking distance of University
                                       Drive’s amenities, like Family Dollar and the gas station market. Many would prefer to
                                       “play Frogger,” as one local described it, by crossing where it’s convenient instead of
                                       navigating to the nearest designated crosswalk, hundreds of feet away.
                                       “If they want to keep this a highway, then other road users should be discouraged from
                                       going on it,” Edward Erfurt, Strong Towns’ director of community action, remarked
                                       after examining the road’s design. “But they have to decide whether this is for cars or
                                       people. That’s what it comes down to.”
                                       Recent investments in bus connectivity to the area make it evident that University
                                       Drive will continue to accommodate multiple modes of mobility, in which case,
                                       Huntsville needs to take steps to ensure that nondrivers are truly protected from
                                       the high speeds the road supports. A panel of concerned locals, engineers and
                                       eld experts at the Crash Analysis Studio helped devise a set of short- and long-
                                       term recommendations for the city, some of which would be temporary and yet
                                       transformative for tomorrow’s road users.
                                       Firstly, city ocials must prioritize the visibility of people walking and biking by re-
                                       striping existing crosswalks, reducing visual clutter, and installing better illumination
                                       at existing crossings. The Studio participants also suggest reducing the lane width of
                                       the center turning lane — which measures 16 feet — to accommodate a pedestrian
                                       refuge. This can be done temporarily, using the tools and protocols deployed during
                                       road work, and later made permanent through the use of concrete, for example. A
                                       center lane refuge will act as a buer between dierent road users and caution drivers
                                       to slow down as they approach the intersection. Slower speeds are ultimately what will
                                       make the road safer for everyone.

                                    At rst glance, South Goodman Street in Rochester, New York, doesn’t appear to be
Rochester,
                                    an example of unsafe design. It features wide sidewalks, a mix of low-rise retail and
New York                            residential buildings, and controlled intersections with crosswalks and overhead
                                    lighting.
                                    Yet, on December 22, 2022, Edgar Santa Cruz and his dog Rosie were struck and killed
                                    by a car while crossing South Goodman Street at an intersection with Park Avenue.
                                    The crash occurred at 5:51 p.m. on a rainy day at a four-way intersection with a trac
                                    light.
                                    An investigation by local law enforcement determined that Santa Cruz entered the
                                    intersection with a green light and a walk signal and that the driver of the car ran a red
                                    light before making fatal contact. Authorities deemed the driver’s actions the cause of
                                    the crash and charged him with various trac-related violations resulting in death.
                                    But Evan Lowenstein, the friend and colleague of Santa Cruz who nominated the
                                    crash, wanted a deeper examination of the causes, as well as action taken to prevent
                                    future tragedies. A panel including Strong Towns sta, trac engineers, city of
                                    Rochester sta, and friends and neighbors of the victim held the 2023 session.
                                    Participants immediately found it striking that the scene of the crash was so dierent
                                    from what safety advocates and planning professionals typically consider a dangerous
                                    scene, such as a suburban arterial in which high-speed car trac meshes with other
                                    road users.
                                    But when the expert panel dug deeper, it found several elements that would endanger
                                    people walking or biking. The street connected to a state road and interstate highway,
                                    resulting in through trac inappropriate for a residential neighborhood. Strong Towns
                                    member Lowenstein conducted a radar gun study of vehicle speeds in the corridors
                                    around the crash site and found that 54% of drivers traveled above the posted 30 mph
                                    limit, with 4% going above 40 mph, a speed that is almost always fatal to pedestrians.
                                    The sidewalks had outdated curb cuts that reduced protection from cars rounding
                                    corners. In addition, the overhead lighting was placed in a way that failed to highlight
                                    the silhouettes of people and obstacles in a driver’s path.
City ocials in Rochester, New

Goodman Street, earning praise
from locals.

                   This investigation showed how site-specic and ne-grained the elements leading up
                   to a crash can be, as well as the necessity for local ocials and leaders to be closely
                   involved in evaluating causes and seeking changes.
                   The panel prepared a specic set of recommendations based on its analysis of the
                   crash site and surrounding neighborhood. They included lowering local speed limits
                   from 30 mph to 25 or 20 mph, trying new low-cost congurations to reduce road
                   width, and reconguring curbs and intersections to t revised ADA standards.

                     Participants in this Studio generally had praise for Rochester
                     officials (some of whom participated in the session) as being
                     committed to improving safety. They’re united in seeking a greater
                     level of urgency at all levels of community and government in the
                     wake of a fatal crash.

After the Studio   One of the streets around the crash site was scheduled for remilling, and the panel
                   submitted its recommendations to planning ocials in time to inuence the nal
                   project, which got underway in 2024.
                   In addition, Rochester has already started modifying trac lights in the neighborhood
                   to enhance visibility to drivers, and higher visibility crosswalks are specied for future
                   remilling projects.

Statement on
Municipal Liability
A culture that prioritizes public safety doesn’t seek to blame individuals. Instead,
it encourages professionals to have open dialogue on ways to improve. This can
be very difficult. To avoid these conversations, transportation professionals often
assert that the city exposes itself to liability for damages if they discuss — let
alone acknowledge — any potential failings.

There are three responses to this assertion:

First, local governments generally have limits on their liability for traffic
crashes. Some have outright immunity. Check with your city attorney to see what
your state or province provides. In nearly all cases, the potential damages are far
too low to prompt hesitation to open dialogue.

Second, the best defense is an active program of improvement. For car crashes,
nearly every claim brought against local governments is one of negligence.
Actively working to identify and correct deficiencies is the opposite of negligence.
Courts have historically given great deference to cities when they make
discretionary decisions. Holding a Crash Analysis Studio is the best defense
against a negligence claim.

Third, what good is shielding a city from liability if the cost is measured in its
citizen’s lives? When it comes to traffic safety, the moral and ethical calling of all
local leaders is to reduce the number of fatalities and traumatic injuries. Fear of
liability should never keep local officials from openly investigating, acknowledging
and addressing the many factors contributing to automobile crashes.




                                                                                         23
