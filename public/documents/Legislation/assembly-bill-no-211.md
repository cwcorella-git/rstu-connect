          Assembly Bill No. 211–Assemblymember Considine
                                 CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to property; requiring a county or city to require a
    property owner to repair or rehabilitate or abate certain
    conditions on a residential multifamily rental property under
    certain circumstances; establishing procedures relating to a
    property owner’s failure to repair or rehabilitate or abate
    certain conditions on the residential multifamily rental
    property; authorizing certain local governments and persons
    to bring an action to require the repair or rehabilitation or
    abatement or appoint a receiver for substandard property in
    certain circumstances; establishing the powers and duties of a
    receiver appointed for substandard property; making various
    other changes relating to substandard properties; and
    providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
     Existing law: (1) requires a landlord to maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable
condition at all times during the tenancy; and (2) provides that a dwelling unit is not
habitable if it violates provisions of housing or health codes concerning the health,
safety, sanitation or fitness for habitation. (NRS 118A.290)
     Sections 8 and 27 of this bill provide that: (1) if a residential multifamily rental
property is maintained in a way that violates any applicable habitability standard,
housing code or building code, or any statute or ordinance relating to habitability,
building safety or fire safety; and (2) as a result of the violation or violations, the
condition of the residential multifamily rental property is of such a nature that the
health and safety of residents or the public are substantially endangered,
the appropriate department of the county or city, as applicable, is required to notify
the owner and order that the owner repair or rehabilitate the property or abate the
condition. Sections 8 and 27 also set forth certain requirements for the notice.
     Sections 9 and 28 of this bill provide that if the owner of the residential
multifamily rental property fails to comply with the terms of the notice and
summary order issued by the county or city, as applicable, certain actions may be
brought to have the residential multifamily rental property declared to be a
substandard property, including an action to have a receiver appointed to manage
the repair or rehabilitation of the substandard property.
     Sections 10 and 29 of this bill: (1) set forth certain findings and considerations
that must be made by the district court in order to declare a residential multifamily
rental property to be a substandard property; and (2) require an order issued by the
district court declaring a residential multifamily rental property to be a substandard
property to set forth the conditions that make the residential multifamily rental
property a substandard property and the repairs, rehabilitations and abatements that
are necessary to correct each violation of a habitability standard, housing code or
building code, or any statute or ordinance relating to habitability, building safety or
fire safety.
     Sections 11 and 30 of this bill provide that if the district court finds that there
is a condition of the substandard property which substantially endangers the health
and safety of the residents, the district court must: (1) order the owner of the
substandard property to pay all reasonable and actual costs of the board of county
commissioners or governing body of the city, as applicable; (2) order that the board



    -                                                           83rd Session (2025)

of county commissioners or governing body of the city provide each tenant with
notice of the judgment and court order; (3) under certain circumstances, order the
owner to provide or pay certain relocation benefits and compensation to the tenants;
(4) determine the date when a tenant has to relocate; and (5) make certain other
orders.
    Sections 12 and 31 of this bill set forth certain duties for a receiver appointed
for a substandard property.
    Sections 13 and 32 of this bill provide that a receiver appointed for a
substandard property is entitled to the same fees, commissions and necessary
expenses as a receiver in an action to foreclose a mortgage.
    Sections 14 and 33 of this bill require a receiver appointed for a substandard
property to prepare and submit monthly reports to the board of county
commissioners or governing body of a city and the board of county commissioners
or governing body of a city to submit the reports annually to the Director of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Legislature or Legislative
Commission.
    Sections 15 and 34 of this bill: (1) require the district court to discharge the
receiver for a substandard property under certain circumstances; and (2) authorize
the district court to retain jurisdiction over the substandard property for a period of
time not to exceed 18 consecutive months.
    Sections 16 and 35 of this bill authorize the district court to require the owner
of a substandard property to pay all unrecovered costs associated with the
receivership.
    Sections 17 and 36 of this bill provide that the remedies and penalties set forth
in sections 2-18 and 21-37 of this bill are cumulative, may not be abrogated and
are in addition to any other remedies or penalties that may exist in law or equity.
    Sections 18 and 37 provide that nothing in sections 2-18 and 21-37 is intended
to deprive any owner of a residential multifamily rental property or substandard
property any right guaranteed by the United States Constitution or Nevada
Constitution, including, without limitation, the right to due process.
    Existing law authorizes a receiver to be appointed in certain actions and the
Uniform Commercial Real Estate Receivership Act establishes provisions
governing the appointment and powers of a receiver for real property. (NRS
32.010, 32.100-32.370) Section 19 of this bill authorizes a receiver to be appointed
in an action to have a residential multifamily rental property declared to be a
substandard property that is brought pursuant to section 10 or 29 to manage the
repair or rehabilitation of the substandard property. Sections 10 and 29 also clarify
that the Uniform Commercial Real Estate Receivership Act and any rules adopted
pursuant thereto by the Nevada Supreme Court apply to a receiver appointed
pursuant to section 10 or 29, as applicable.
    Sections 2-7 and 21-26 define certain terms used in the provisions of sections
2-18 and 21-37, respectively.




   -                                                           83rd Session (2025)
