There is an error of fact in 'Direct Action Issue #1'
"The spirit of Direct Action is difficult to snuff and her title has been continued under different publications by a variety of organisations from the Socialist Worker Party to the Anarcho-Syndicalist Federation as recently as 1990".
The Anarcho-Syndicalist Federation has never published any title as 'Direct Action'.
The Socialist Workers Party appropriated the title in the 70s even going so far as to to claim the legacy of the IWW in Australia 1908-17.
The official paper of the IWW in Australia since DA, 'Rebel Worker' was first published in February 1982 by the Sydney IWW. By agreement, the Sydney IWW became the Rebel Worker Group. They continued to publish 'Rebel Worker' as no longer 'the paper of the IWW' but 'the paper of the Rebel Worker Group' from February 1983.
The RWG had their application to affiliate to the IWA rejected at the 1984 IWA Congress.
The RWG became affiliated to the ASF as ASF Sydney in January 1986 until their disaffiliation from ASF by decision of the ASF Extraordinary Congress in October 1992.
Despite the disaffiliation they continued to insist that they were the ASF until the publication of a report by member of the IWA Secretariat sent to Australia to investigate the claims by decision of the 1996 IWA Congress, in the June 1997 edition of 'Il Debato'.
In September 1997, they changed their name to Anarcho-Syndicalist Network (ASN).
The IWW Australasia is affiliated to ICL/CIT whose Spanish affiliate is taking CNT-AIT through the Spanish courts seeking one million Euros in punitive damages for defamation.
