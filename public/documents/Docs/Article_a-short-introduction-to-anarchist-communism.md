           Introduction
             The Anarchist Federation is an organisation of revolutionary class struggle
           anarchists. We aim for the abolition of all hierarchy, and work for the creation
           of a world-wide classless society: anarchist communism.
             This pamphlet will give a short introduction to what all this means and how
           we think we can do it.
           Glossary
              The following terms will be used in this pamphlet:
           Anarchism
            An economic and political system based upon removing oppressive and
            exploitative structures in society (such as capitalism and the state), and
            building a society where everyone has an equal input into decisions that
            aﬀect their life.

           Capitalism
            An economic and political system based around exploiting those forced to
            sell their labour, in which a country’s trade and industry are controlled by
            private owners for proﬁt.
           Class
             A set of people given a shared title based on something they hold in
             common. Anarchists often talk of class in terms of an economic relationship,
             which this pamphlet will examine.
           Communism
            An economic and political system based around common ownership of the
            means of production (such as factories, ﬁelds and workshops), where goods
            are made available based upon need and ensuring the well-being of all.
           Concession
            Something given in response to a demand, action, or prevailing standard.
           Economy
            The system used to work out how goods and resources are produced and
            allocated to people. The current economy is capitalist, but other forms of
            economy are possible.
           Free Market
             A proposed form of capitalism where businesses can act however they want
             without any legal restrictions. It is often proposed along with removing the
             state completely, as if the two are completely separate, however the state is
             required for capitalism to be possible.
           Hierarchical
            The nature of hierarchy. A system in which members of an organisation or
            society are ranked according to relative status or authority.
           Infrastructure
             The basic physical and organisational structures required for a project to
             function (including anything from a small team activity through to running a
             country or global capitalism).
           Institutional
             Of, relating to, or characteristic of an institution. For example: Institutional
             racism.
           Intersections
             The points at which diﬀerent things come together. Often used in anarchist
             text to talk about the interaction between multiple systems of oppression,
             discrimination and/or privilege.
           Leftist
             Used to refer to authoritarian or hierarchical left-wing organisations (such
             as trade unions and political parties), or their members.

           Means of Production
            The non-human infrastructure needed for production of items, such as
            ﬁelds, factories and workshops (and their associated tools). Keep in mind
            that workshops can include such diverse locations as kitchens, oﬀice space,
            and laboratories to name but a few examples.
           Oppression
            The state of being subject to oppressive treatment. The exercise of authority
            or power in a harmful or unjust manner.
           Pragmatism
             A way of doing things or of thinking about problems that is seen as
             reasonable and logical due to dealing with practical outcomes.
           Social Revolution
             A revolution undertaken by the majority of the working class that removes
             all class divides. Not to be confused with a political revolution, where the
             people at the top may change but a class structure remains in place.
           Solidarity
             The act of undertaking supportive activity towards other people which does
             not come with the expectation of reward, but instead comes from a sense of
             mutual aid or common interest.
           Squatting
            Occupying an abandoned or unoccupied area of land or a building and
            putting it into use without the owners permission.
           State, The
             The collected institutions that create and enforce laws created by a small
             minority of people within a given territory. Through laws the state claims
             that only it has the right to grant the use of violence. The state uses the law
             to justify and protect a capitalist economy.
           Strike
             Taking direct action against a boss, usually in the form of a picket line that
             will prevent all activity at a workplace.
           What We’re Fighting: Capitalism and Hierarchy
             Capitalism, in essence, is a system of exploitation. It is a class system where
           a majority, the working class, is exploited by a minority, the ruling class.
             The ruling class own and control the places that we work & live, the land
           that produces our food, and everything that makes life possible. They make
           the decisions about what kinds of products the factories make or what kinds
           of services are provided, and they make the decisions about how this work is
           organised. The rest of us, the working class, must work in the ﬁelds and the
           factories, the call centres and the oﬀice blocks, or else get by on beneﬁts or

           scrape together what we need to survive.
              We, the working class, build and provide everything society needs to
           function. They, the ruling class, suck proﬁt out of our work. We are the body
           of society; they are parasites sucking us dry.
              It follows from this that we don’t use the idea of class in the same way as
           many others, particularly in the press. Class is not about the fact that some of
           us earn more money than others or that we go to diﬀerent kinds of schools.
           This confusion about the idea of class is part of a wider set of tactics that the
           ruling class use to try and disguise the reality of class from us.
              Capitalism needs workers in a way workers simply do not need capitalism.
           If we were to unite around our common working class interests then we could
           do away with the ruling class and run society for ourselves. We don’t need
           them, but they need us. Because of this, the ruling class works hard to divide
           us against each other. It does this through trying to control ideas and the way
           we think about ourselves, and also through creating small diﬀerences in
           power and wealth that pit us against one another.
              One of the major tools to create these divisions to is the state. The state is
           made up of all the institutions that regulate and control the lives of ‘citizens’
           — that is you and me – for the beneﬁt of capitalism. When the so-called free
           market can’t achieve something that capital needs to grow, the state steps in
           and makes it happen. From building the legal and physical infrastructure that
           capitalism needs, through to directly attacking workers seeking to improve
           their position, the state is an essential tool of the capitalist class.
              Importantly, the state maintains organisations to directly control and coerce
           us. The army and the police most obviously use direct force to keep people in
           line, with the police breaking strikes and heads at home and the army
           enforcing capitalism abroad. Schools, whilst providing an important service,
           also indoctrinate children and prepare them for a life as workers rather than
           as human beings. Prisons, immigration authorities, dole oﬀices and more, all
           intrude into our lives and shape our actions. Some of these things, like
           schools, hospitals and welfare beneﬁts, we sometimes depend on for our lives.
           It is often this very dependence that acts to control us. Beneﬁts come with
           conditions that dictate what we can and can’t do.
              Some leftists argue that if the state were under the control of a group that
           represented the working class, usually a revolutionary party of some kind,
           then it would behave diﬀerently. This ignores the fact that the state is
           designed to govern from above – it is, by its very nature, hierarchical. This
           means that it always concentrates power in the hands of a minority. A small
           number of people give orders and a large number obey. The state is always
           hierarchical and as a result will end up furthering rather than destroying all
           the other hierarchies in society.
              The power of the ruling class comes from their control of the means of
           production, but they keep that control by manipulating a whole series of
           diﬀerent systems of oppression and exploitation, diﬀerent hierarchies. These
           systems give large sections of the working class just a little bit of privilege.
           This is enough to turn them against those they should be uniting with, enough
           to make them defend the ruling class against those oppressed by gender, skin
           colour, disability, and on and on and on.
              To get past this we need a revolutionary movement made up of many

           diﬀerent organisations. We need many diﬀerent ways in which we can take
           control of our own lives and ﬁght the diﬀerent oppressions that push us down.
           We need to completely transform society and ourselves. In the Anarchist
           Federation we believe that the ideas of anarchist communism oﬀer the best
           chance of doing this.
           Anarchist Communism
             Anarchism is a set of revolutionary ideas that are, at root, very simple.
           Anarchists believe that we are all quite capable of looking after ourselves. No
           leader can know what you need better than you do. No government can
           represent the interests of a community better than the community itself. We
           believe that everyone should have the option to take part in decisions that
           aﬀect them, wherever they take place. Only in this way can we have a fair and
           just society in which everyone has the chance to fulﬁl themselves. Everything
           in anarchist ways of thinking follows from this basic principle.
             For anarchists, taking back control over our own lives is the revolution. We
           see two ways of working as being key to being able to do this: direct action
           and self-organisation. Direct action is when those directly aﬀected by
           something take action to ﬁx it themselves, rather than asking someone else to
           do it for them. A strike that forces management to make concessions or face
           losing money is direct action where lobbying an MP or going through union
           negotiations is not. Squatting derelict land and turning into a community
           garden is direct action, whereas pressuring the council to clean up vacant lots
           is not. When we act by ourselves to achieve something that we need then we
           are taking direct action – whether that’s sharing food with others or ﬁghting
           the police in a riot.
             For direct action to be possible then there also needs to be self
           organisation. This is organising without leaders or phoney ‘representatives’,
           and it allows us to take back the power to make our own decisions. Self
           organisation allows us to break down and overcome the hierarchies that
           separate us. In self-organised groups everyone has an equal say and no one is
           given the right to represent anyone else. This kind of group is capable of
           deciding its own needs and taking direct action to meet them in a way that
           any hierarchical group based on representatives – like a political party or a
           trade union – cannot.
             Because of this we reject the use of the state – that is government,
           parliament, the courts, the police and so on – to bring about revolution. No
           one can free anyone else. We all have to free ourselves by acting together. No
           government, even a ‘socialist’ or ‘revolutionary’ government, can do this. Any
           group or party taking over the state simply becomes a new set of leaders,
           exploiting us in the name of ‘socialism’ rather than ‘capitalism’. This is what
           happened in so-called ‘communist’ Russia. Only by destroying the state, not
           taking it over, can we free ourselves.
             For anarchists, direct action and self organisation are essential tools for
           freeing ourselves. They are the way that we as a working class can confront
           the problems in our own lives collectively, working together against the whole
           system of capitalism and the ways it tries to divide us.

              These ideas have not just been plucked out of thin air. Anarchist
           communism is a living working class tradition that has worked in ways large
           and small throughout the history of capitalism. It does not come out of the
           abstract ideas of a few intellectuals but from the concrete actions of millions
           of people.
              For many, the word communism is associated only with the brutality of
           Soviet Russia, or with Cuba, China, and North Korea. These societies are
           amongst some of the worst tyrannies the world has ever seen, killing millions
           through famine, war and execution. As anarchists we don’t forget the prison
           camps, the slave labour, or the unjust trials and executions – indeed
           anarchists were often the ﬁrst to suﬀer these attacks.
              However, unlike the press who use the example of ‘communist’ governments
           to claim that revolutionary change is impossible, anarchists also refuse to
           forget the example of the millions of people who have fought against this in
           the name of true communism. These people organised themselves, without
           leaders, into groups that used direct democracy, meaning that everyone had
           an equal say in how things were run. They used direct action, ﬁrst against the
           state and capitalism, and later against the new Soviet rulers.
              The true communism that they fought for is the extension of these ways of
           working into every aspect of life. The communist slogan ‘from each according
           to their ability, to each according to their need’ sums up the idea. Nobody
           should be short of anything that they need. Individuals receive goods and
           services because of how much they need them, not because of how much they
           can pay or how much they deserve them. People give back to society, through
           the work they do, according to what they want and are able to do. Everyone
           will have the chance to do interesting and creative work, instead of just a
           minority while everyone else is stuck with boring drudge work.
              This society would be organised through local collectives and councils,
           organising themselves to make the decisions that need making and to do the
           work that needs doing. Everyone gets a say in decisions that concern them.
           We believe that in ﬁghting for this kind of future we are ﬁghting for the full
           freedom and equality of all. Only this will give everyone the chance to be
           whatever they can be.
              It is the many examples of people organising and resisting in this way that
           we call the communist tradition. The workers councils of revolutionary Spain,
           Germany, Russia, Hungary, France, and Mexico all give a small glimpse that
           we can look to when thinking about how we can ﬁght capitalism and free
           ourselves. Time and time again the world has seen ordinary people using
           direct action, self organisation and direct democracy to build new societies
           and lives for themselves. It is these ideas and successes that we try to build
           on in today’s ﬁght against exploitation.
              Anarchist communism is more than an abstract vision of the future and it is
           more than a nostalgia for the revolutionary movements of the past. It is a
           living working class tradition that lays the foundations for the future society
           in the here and now. Everything we will be after capitalism we must learn
           under it and through the ﬁght against it. The revolution is not and never can
           be a blank slate – that way lies the corpses piled up by ‘revolutionary’ terror
           (such as happened in France, Russia, and China). Instead, revolution must be
           built out of the materials to hand by those of us alive today.

           Revolution and Revolutionaries
              Revolutionaries believe that the societies we live in are basically unjust and
           unfair. It is not just a matter of this injustice or that unfairness – it is the
           whole way that society works that is unjust and unfair. Poverty, war, racism,
           sexism and all the rest of the problems we face are not exceptions to the rule
           – they are the rule. Capitalism cannot exist without creating poverty, without
           ﬁghting wars, without oppressing us based upon arbitrary traits.
              We believe that capitalism must be destroyed and a new society – an
           anarchist communist society – must be built. This is the revolution. Both the
           destruction of what exists now and the construction of something new are
           part of the revolution. As revolutionaries we work to encourage both –
           supporting opposition to those in power as well as aiding those who try to
           build alternatives.
              Because capitalism is basically unfair and unjust, revolutionaries do not
           believe in change through gradual reform. This is called reformism. This is
           not to say that a minimum wage, a shorter working day, or the right to
           abortion on demand are not important. These reforms and many others have
           made life better for us. Revolutionaries are not trying to say that life has not
           improved since Victorian times – that would be silly. What we do say are two
           things.
              Firstly, no reform is permanent. Any reform can and will be undone by
           politicians and bosses whenever they get the chance. The attacks on civil
           liberties, on working conditions, and on public services that we see time and
           time again should be enough to prove this.
              Secondly, reforms are only granted by governments when they are scared of
           something worse – a mass movement of the working class. Time and time
           again it has taken the actions of millions of people organising together to get
           even the most basic reforms. The ten hour day, rights for women and children,
           and the welfare state were all forced concessions from governments
           challenged by mass movements. There is nothing governments are more
           scared of than us ignoring them and simply doing things for ourselves.
           Governments will make almost any concession to stop us feeling that we can
           act for ourselves without waiting for permission from their higher authority.
              Because of this, revolutionaries are often attacked as utopian, as imagining
           unrealistic perfect worlds that can never be. “You should be practical,” we are
           told. “Focus on getting results here and now, not on some imaginary cloud
           cuckoo land in the future.” When people say things like this, when we are told
           to be ‘practical’ or ‘realistic’, we are usually being told to abandon our
           principles. Successive governments attack public services in the name of
           ‘pragmatism’, the unions sell out to management because it’s ‘practical’,
           authoritarian revolutionaries lie to their members and the public because
           they’re ‘realistic’.
              If this is what being practical means then that would already be enough to
           reject it. But there’s more to it than this. Being ‘practical’ in this way, making
           compromises and deals with bosses and politicians, is a sure-ﬁre way of
           making sure that you don’t get what you want. Any deals done with capitalism
           are bound backﬁre, as we’ve seen time and time again. You don’t make
           progress by negotiating with the bosses. You make progress by terrifying

           them. Anarchist communists believe that it is better to ﬁght for what we want,
           even if we don’t get it straight away, rather than ﬁghting for something we
           don’t want, and getting it.
              Mass movements making demands based on their own needs are much
           more scary to the ruling class than any number of snivelling bureaucrats
           being ‘realistic’ and asking nicely for a few scraps from the boss’s table. We
           don’t want the scraps – we want the whole meal, and the kitchen that cooked
           it, and the house it was served in, and the ﬁelds it was grown in, and the
           factories that made the plates – we want the whole world and nothing less.
           Everything the ruling class has, it has because the working class made it and
           they stole it. We refuse to ask nicely for things that are already ours. This is
           not just a matter of principle, it is practical. Those that beg for scraps get
           nothing else, and often not even that. If we work to take what is already ours
           the ruling class will be forced to concede far more than just scraps.
           Ends & Means
             The most important part of the working class tradition that we call
           anarchist communism is the refusal to make a distinction between ends and
           means. The organisations that we build while ﬁghting capitalism will be the
           basis of anything that comes after the revolution. If those organisations do not
           embody the principles of the society that we want to see then that society will
           not come about. If we want a future where everyone contributes to the
           decisions that aﬀect them, then we have to build organisations now in which
           this happens. The Anarchist Federation is one such organisation.
             This is known as preﬁguration and is one of the central ideas of anarchism.
           The idea is summed up by one important slogan: ‘Building the new society in
           the shell of the old’. What this means is that our struggle is not simply against
           capitalism. We also ﬁght, as far as is possible, to live as we wish to right now,
           to build alternatives to capitalism right under its nose.
             However, preﬁguration has its limits. For many, building alternatives to
           capitalism in the here and now means one of two things: either a lifestyle or
           individualist response, or an attempt to create a dual power situation. Whilst
           the AF is often sympathetic to these approaches and doesn’t reject them
           completely, we do not believe that they can lead to revolution on their own.
           We also have some serious criticisms of both of them. But what are they?
           Lifestylism
             The labels ‘lifestylist’ and ‘individualist’ are often used, frequently unfairly,
           as insults and so we have to be very careful when we use them. When we talk
           about ‘lifestyle’ politics we’re talking about a kind of politics that focuses in
           some way on ‘dropping out’ of capitalism, on getting ‘oﬀ the grid’ and living
           without relying on capitalist exploitation. This can mean many things. It can
           be something small-scale like living in squats and surviving by stealing from
           supermarkets or taking the perfectly good food that they throw out (‘skipping’
           or ‘dumpster diving’). Or it can be something much larger like a project to
           communally farm a piece of land or establish a new community.

             The reasons that people have for doing this kind of thing are very good
           ones. They see the harm that capitalism does every day and want no part of it.
           By stealing or taking what is thrown away they try to stop giving support back
           to the bosses that exploit us and others all over the world. More than this,
           often these kind of political lifestyle choices involve building and living in
           communities based on solidarity and mutual respect. Many involved in this
           kind of activity would argue that this is ‘building the new society in the shell
           of the old’.
             Whilst we respect many of those who make these personal lifestyle choices,
           we reject this as a useful form of political action. The main reason for this is
           that it is not something that the majority of us can easily involve ourselves in.
           Signiﬁcant debts, dependants, health problems or any number of other things
           that limit our freedom of action make it very diﬀicult, if not impossible, to
           ‘drop out’. There is no possibility for building a lifestylist mass movement.
           Indeed, despite some claims to the contrary, lifestylism does not attempt to
           overthrow or destroy capitalism; it only attempts to wash its own hands clean
           of the blood.
             This is, in fact, a huge political problem with lifestyle responses to
           capitalism. Often this form of politics leads to a kind of elitism and snobbery
           on the part of those living ‘political’ lifestyles. Ordinary people become
           ‘sheeple’, hopelessly brainwashed by their jobs and the media and as much
           part of the problem as those that own and run the economy. In its most
           extreme forms, such as primitivism, this leads to open calls for solutions that
           would lead to the extermination of the majority of the human race.
             This kind of attitude is not an inevitable consequence of dropping out, but it
           is very common, and it is the result of an individualist way of looking at
           capitalism. Capitalism does not exploit us as individuals: it exploits us as
           classes or groups. We are exploited as workers, as professionals with some
           perks or temporary workers with none, as ‘consumers’ in the West or as
           disposable labourers in the global South. We are oppressed by institutional
           racism, misogyny, ableism, and in diﬀerent ways based upon intersecting
           combinations of diﬀerent oppressive forces.
             If we respond to the damage that capitalism does to us as individuals then
           the only logical answer is to abstain. You live without a job, without shopping,
           without relying on the systems of exploitation that surround us. If this is
           impossible, then you minimise your impact. You get an ‘ethical’ job, buy
           ‘ethical’ products and reduce your contribution to exploitation that way. From
           here it’s only a short step to despising the those who aren’t as ‘enlightened’
           as you, who keep capitalism going by ‘refusing’ to abstain.
             However, if you respond to capitalism as member of a broader exploited
           class, then the logical response is collective. You can show solidarity with
           those in the same situation as you, ﬁghting where you are for better
           conditions, and for more control over the conditions of your life. A collective
           response like this is always oppositional. It always has to ﬁght capitalism
           rather than trying to go round it. It is, in potential, the beginning of a mass
           movement and the basis of a new society based on the recognition of our
           common interests.
             In the end it is this collective direct action that the ruling class are afraid of,
           not people dropping out, and it is a self-organised mass movement ready to
9 of 16 10/24/25, 10:23 AM A Short Introduction to Anarchist Communism https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anarchist-federat...
           take collective direct action that we should be helping to build.
           Dual Power
             The other typical approach to preﬁgurative politics is trying to build dual
           power. This means trying to build organisations in the here and now that will
           eventually replace capitalism. There are a number of diﬀerent approaches to
           dual power strategies.
             Some see themselves as providing examples that can be taken up by others
           and perhaps eventually become state policy. They are rarely very
           confrontational about their ideas and see themselves as reformist rather than
           revolutionary (although often do seek the end of capitalism). Others hope to
           build entire alternative economies through cooperatives, credit unions, local
           trading systems, and the like. These structures, it is argued, could eventually
           reach the point where many people are in eﬀect living outside the capitalist
           economy. Those in this tradition often, but not always, describe themselves as
           mutualists.
             Some focus on building community or people’s assemblies to take local
           decisions and sometimes seek to take over local town halls and council
           chambers through elections. These groups often, but again not always,
           describe themselves as municipalist. Others focus on building revolutionary
           unions which will confront management in the workplace to get immediate
           gains. They will also just as importantly be run by direct democracy, giving
           workers experience of taking decisions and organising. These unions are then
           seen as able to take over industry in its entirety replacing capitalism as they
           do so. This is usually described as syndicalism.
             All these approaches, and they often work in combination, see themselves
           as building a political and economic alternative to capitalism right under its
           nose. They argue that these alternatives are able to grow to the point where
           either capitalism withers away or there is a confrontation between the two
           systems which leads to revolution and the destruction of capitalism.
             There are many positive things about these approaches. They encourage
           self organisation and direct action, while providing important lessons in
           collective working and experience of direct democracy for those involved. The
           AF does not reject any of these approaches out of hand and members often
           involve themselves in this kind of project.
             However, there are important weaknesses in these approaches that limit
           their usefulness. These kinds of projects are highly vulnerable to attacks by
           the state. Laws can be passed that make most cooperatives illegal or at least
           very diﬀicult to set up. Community assemblies can be denied resources, or
           even attacked directly by the police and the army.
             Those who pursue dual power strategies are often very over-optimistic
           about their ability to avoid repression. Capitalism and the state tend to attack
           any threat sooner rather than later.
             It is not, however, direct attacks by the state that are the biggest problem
           with dual power strategies. The biggest problem is the risk of co-option. What
           this means is that movements and organisations which start out trying to
           provide an alternative are often ‘captured’ by capitalism, and end up helping
10 of 16 10/24/25, 10:23 AM A Short Introduction to Anarchist Communism https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anarchist-federat...
           to manage people’s exploitation rather than challenging it.
             For example, cooperatives often become employers in their own right, with
           full cooperative members becoming managers and their new employees
           exploited workers like any others. Community groups are approached by local
           councils, given funding and access to some power and end up administering
           the council policies they set out to oppose. Housing co-ops become landlords.
           Credit unions become banks (building societies in the UK started out as
           community schemes). Syndicalist unions can crack down on wildcat strikes.
           Those who start out trying to build alternatives end up supporting the thing
           they hate.
             Any potential alternative to capitalism in the here and now will have to
           interact with the things that it is trying to replace. A co-operative store will
           have to buy stock from capitalist suppliers. A community assembly will have
           to negotiate with the local council if it is to secure resources. Even syndicalist
           unions, a highly confrontational way of working, ﬁnd themselves having to
           negotiate with managers.
             This does not mean that we should reject completely all these ways of doing
           things. What it does mean, however, is that none of these are a road to
           revolution on their own. Instead of seeing these ways of working as a way of
           creating replacements for capitalism, we should see them as one way amongst
           others of creating a culture of resistance. It is this culture, and not any
           particular organisation, that it is important for us to build.
           Building a Culture of Resistance
             We believe that the only people capable of destroying capitalism and
           creating a world in which everyone has control over their own life are those
           directly exploited by capital today: the working class. As we’ve pointed out,
           the ruling class know this and they work very hard to keep us divided and
           lacking in the skills that we need to make this change. This is something that
           has to be overcome before revolution is possible. We have to ‘build the new
           society in the shell of the old’. However, history shows that organisations built
           by the working class for our own beneﬁt are often co-opted and turned
           against us. Trade unions, credit unions, cooperative traders and
           manufacturers – all of these and more have been used to defend rather than
           destroy capitalism.
             Authoritarian revolutionaries use this problem as an excuse to take over.
           According to them, the working class is only capable of a ‘trade union
           consciousness’, of haggling over wages and perks instead of toppling
           capitalism and building something new. What is needed, they claim, is their
           leadership. They will be the cause of the revolution, leading us — the poor
           stupid masses — into the light using any means necessary. History shows us
           that this leads only into new tyrannies.
             The alternative is for us to build a culture of resistance, a set of bonds of
           solidarity and understanding between many diﬀerent people in many diﬀerent
           places. These new relationships give us the conﬁdence and the resources that
           we need to ﬁght back wherever we are. This culture becomes a mass of tinder
           which is able to turn the spark from one struggle into a ﬂame which can

           spread.
              This culture is not a particular organisation or set of principles or anything
           like that. It is composed of many diﬀerent organisations and more than this of
           ideas, practices and attitudes that reveal to us our power as exploited but
           necessary parts of the capitalist system. This culture is as much about the self
           image and self belief in ourselves as it is about any particular set of ideas or
           organisations.
              A culture of resistance is in some way the sum of all the things that we do to
           survive and resist under capitalism. It is the big things like strikes and riots,
           occupations of factories and public buildings and huge organisations that
           ﬁght for something in particular. Just as importantly, it is the small things as
           well. The little scams at work and the residents’ groups that make life a little
           bit more bearable at home. It’s hatred of the police and the bosses and pride
           in who you are and the community you live in.
              What all of these things have in common is that they create connections
           between us. These connections of trust and common purpose work against the
           everyday logic of capitalism. Capitalism splits us oﬀ from one another. We are
           given orders instead of taking part in decisions. When we buy something,
           whatever it is, all we know is its price, not who made it and why. The media
           tells us to fear immigrants and outsiders who they claim are trying to take
           what little we have. We are forced at every turn to cut ourselves oﬀ from the
           world, to be blind to the connections that we have with others.
              A culture of resistance restores those connections, making visible what
           capitalism tries to hide from us. Every object we use in our lives is made by
           other human beings. Every piece of food we eat, every bit of power we use,
           every cup of water we drink is there because the work of others made it
           possible. Capitalism hides this behind prices and company names. It takes the
           credit for making life possible by hiding the very things that connect us to
           everyone else in the world. A culture of resistance shows us how connected
           we are to other working class people. It rolls back the deceptions of
           capitalism and shows us how powerful we really are. It is not some abstract
           ideal, but instead it reveals the concrete reality that connects us all and blows
           away the abstractions and lies that capitalism uses to isolate us.
              A culture of resistance grows in the belly of capitalism and uses the
           connections between workers that capitalism in some cases creates to build
           the beginnings of an alternative. A culture of resistance builds structures and
           ideas of cooperation and solidarity that preﬁgure the world to come. A culture
           of resistance is the school in which we learn how to be free, how we become
           through the ﬁght against capitalism everything that we will be after it.
              It is impossible to tell in advance what forms this culture of resistance will
           take. The needs and the imaginations of those involved will dictate what
           happens and how. However, it is possible to lay out the very broadest outline
           of how we can organise ourselves and ﬁght back. We can look at what has
           worked in the past and what others are doing now, and point out how direct
           action and self organisation can be applied to a number of areas of everyday
           life.
           Workplace Struggles
12 of 16 10/24/25, 10:23 AM A Short Introduction to Anarchist Communism https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anarchist-federat...
             At work the confrontation between workers and bosses is at its most
           obvious. Workers want to work as little as possible for as much money as they
           can get, whereas bosses want as much work for as little pay. This is the nature
           of capitalism. The amount of eﬀort management makes to control people at
           work points to the fact that at work we are incredibly powerful. When we
           work we create the proﬁts that the ruling class needs to exist.
             When we disrupt the smooth running of a workplace through strike action
           or sabotage, we directly disrupt the ability of the ruling class to make the
           proﬁts it depends on. For this reason, resistance at the points of work always
           has revolutionary potential, however small-scale it is. When we refuse to make
           proﬁts for our bosses we threaten their very existence.
           Social Wage Struggles
             When we talk about a social wage we’re talking about all the diﬀerent ways
           that we can receive services from the state and the ruling class that are (in
           eﬀect) part of our share of the proﬁts of industry. Healthcare, subsidised and
           social housing, transport and utilities like water and electricity, libraries and
           social services, beneﬁts, and many other things can be seen as part of the
           social wage. Like wage increases and shorter working days these services are
           often the result of previous rounds of struggle, victories won by the working
           class in the past.
             Struggles over the social wage take many forms but they usually involve a
           fairly straightforward confrontation between some arm of the state – the local
           council, for example – and a relatively clearly deﬁned group of people who
           depend on a particular service. There are many diﬀerent tactics available to
           those of us ﬁghting these kind of struggles. Petitions and appeals to
           representatives are often used, and more often than not fail, but there are
           also forms of direct action that we can use. Occupations of threatened
           buildings and services, mass protests outside (and inside) government
           buildings, blockades and disruptions to the normal running of services, street
           riots and disorder.
             Social wage struggles are often the most imaginative of all struggles in
           terms of the tactics they use as it is often much harder to hurt the proﬁts of
           those in charge. To do so we often have to question the legitimacy of the
           institutions of government themselves. At times of heightened struggle – for
           example during long lasting general strikes – this questioning can lead to a
           critical mass of people willing to take over the running of their own
           communities, providing for themselves the services they rely on. If this
           change of the social relationship can survive attempts at suppression and cooption then it can become a key feature of social revolution.
           Anti-Oppression Struggles
             These also get called identity struggles, however the word identity is really
           not up to the job of describing the kind of struggles we’re talking about here.
           Liberal (and even most radical), ways of talking about the struggles of those
           oppressed because of gender or sexuality, the struggle against white
13 of 16 10/24/25, 10:23 AM A Short Introduction to Anarchist Communism https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anarchist-federat...
           supremacy, or similar, do not recognise the relationship between these kinds
           of struggle and working class struggle. Sometimes they are seen as
           distractions and other times as ‘separate but equal’, but rarely are they seen
           as an integral part of the struggle against capitalism as a whole. For anarchist
           communists capitalism is more than just as class system, it is a system that
           uses a whole range of hierarchies to maintain the power of a minority.
           Resistance to all of these hierarchies should be seen as resistance to
           capitalism.
             This does not mean, however, that separate organisations are not needed by
           people ﬁghting patriarchy, white supremacy and so on. Just because the
           struggles of, say, women are important in the struggle against capitalism does
           not mean that those struggles can simply be folded into some ‘wider’ ﬁght
           against capitalism. Because of this it is necessary for those of us who
           experience certain forms of oppression to form our own communities, not only
           to organise together but also to talk together without having to justify what
           we say to people who do not have the same struggles. These groups provide a
           space in which we can understand what is unique about our own oppressions
           and in which we can be free of the prejudices — conscious or unconscious – of
           those who do not share the same experiences. These groups can be the basis
           of communities of resistance, where a shared understanding develops into a
           set of shared tactics and actions to take on both the state and the everyday
           prejudice and violence that can make life hell for those of us seen as outside
           the norm.
           The Role of the Revolutionary Organisation
              If people are capable of running their own struggles and of ﬁghting for
           themselves to meet their own needs then what is the point of an organisation
           like the Anarchist Federation?
              We are an organisation of conscious revolutionaries who see ourselves as
           working towards an anarchist communist revolution but, as we’ve made clear
           in this pamphlet, we don’t think that any revolution will be down to us. It will
           be the self activity of millions of working class people that makes the
           revolution, not the work of a handful of us with some nice ideas. We are not a
           revolutionary party that will lead the working class out of its ‘trade union
           consciousness’, out of reformism and into revolution. We are not the embryo
           of a workers’ council or a revolutionary union that will grow and grow until
           we eventually take over. We do not lead anyone, we do not act on behalf of
           anyone but ourselves.
              There are, however, some things that revolutionary organisations can do
           that would be far less likely to happen without them. Anarchist communism is
           a living working class tradition, but there are times when that life hangs by a
           very thin thread. In periods of defeat and division, when the working class has
           few organisations of its own and there is very little struggle, something has to
           keep the lessons that have been learned alive. The revolutionary organisation
           is an important store of knowledge and skills. It is a kind of memory that
           keeps alive a vision of the working class as united and deﬁant even when the
           class has been kicked in the head so many times it’s starting to forget its own

           name, let alone its past.
             Members of a revolutionary organisation are also militants in their own
           right and intensely involved in struggles where they live and work. The ideas
           of anarchist communism spread not just through the words of our
           organisations but also through things that we do. Whatever we are involved
           in, we push for direct action and self organisation and resist takeover and cooption by authoritarian groups.
             Our membership of a broader organisation of revolutionaries gives us
           access to the experiences of our comrades and allows us to discuss and
           debate the issues and tactics of any particular struggle without having to
           worry about the basics. The high level of political agreement within a
           revolutionary organisation allows us to worry about the crucial details rather
           than having to make the same foundational arguments time and time again.
             It is in these two main ways – preserving and spreading the memory and
           lessons of previous struggles, and supporting committed but potentially
           isolated militants in day to day struggles – that a revolutionary organisation
           contributes towards a culture of resistance. The ideas of anarchist
           communism work. When we use them to ﬁght, our chances of winning
           increase because these ideas empower us and show us our own strength
           rather than telling us to rely on some set of leaders or representatives. The
           revolutionary organisation is one important way of spreading those ideas, of
           putting them into action and using them to build a culture of resistance.
           Endnote
             Anarchist communism is a living, breathing, working class tradition that
           grows out of the actions and experiences of millions of people in the struggle
           against capitalism. The one lesson that we learn again and again is that
           wherever we are and whatever is happening to us, we will ﬁght back.
           Sometimes we win, more often we don’t, but whenever we make progress the
           principles of direct action and self organisation are usually at the heart of it.
           Our defeats are never total: there’s always something left to move forward
           and carry on ﬁghting. Our victory will never be ﬁnal: human beings will
           always seek to change and experiment, to develop new experiences and new
           ideas.
             We believe that as long as capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy and all
           the rest of it still exist there will always be those who resist. We believe that
           we have the best chance of winning when we organise using anarchist
           communist principles. As long as that resistance goes on, the Anarchist
           Federation and the many groups like us all over the world, will do whatever
           we can to put these ideas into eﬀect when we need them. Wherever people
           get exploited, they will always ﬁght back, and as anarchist communists we
           will always be there to support this as best we can.
