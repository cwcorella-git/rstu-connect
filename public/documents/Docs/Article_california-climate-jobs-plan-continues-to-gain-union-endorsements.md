, popularly known as "the Pollin Report"--which has been described as a "sholvel ready just transition/Green New Deal" plan--and was immediately endorsed by nineteen California based labor unions, including three United Staeelworkers Union locals which primarily represent refinery workers upon its unveiling has since gained the support of many additional unions. The following unions (so far) have since endorsed the plan (knowing that while the plan isn't perfect, it's at least a step in a positive direction):
November 2021:
Inland Boatmen's Union (IBU), SF Bay Region (an affiliate of the ILWU)

## Railroad Workers United

IWW San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch
February 2022:
International Lonshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) Northern California District Council (NCDC)
The council is composed of delegates from the following ILWU Locals:

## ILWU Local 6 (Bay Area Warehouse)

## ILWU Local 10 (Bay Area Longshore)

## ILWU Local 34 (Bay Area Shipping Clerks)

## ILWU Local 75 (Bay Area Dock Security Guards)

## ILWU Local 91 (Bay Area “Walking Bosses”)

## ILWU Local 14 (Eureka; combined)

## ILWU Local 18 (Sacramento; ditto)

## ILWU Local 54 (Stockton)

## Bay Area IBU (already endorsed individually)

and the pensioners from all of the above.
However, the NCDC's endorsement does not automatically mean that each of its constituent locals have individually endorsed the plan.
The more unions that endorse and take an active role in motivating the proposal either by lobbying at the California state level, engaging in public actions to promote the goals of the plan, or even engaging in workplace actions (whereaver relevant and practiceble), the greater chances the plan has of being realized.
(That said, it should be noted that this is not an IWW organizing project, although IWW members have been active in securing additional union endorsements).
A sample resolution (a copy of the text adopted by the SF Bay Area IBU) is available here.
