                and in memory of Zeitel Kaluskaya (1860–1930),

                Preface
                The city at its best is an ecocommunity. To ignore this
                compelling fact is to ignore the destruction it faces by one of
                the most serious phenomena of the modern era, the massive
                urbanization that is sweeping it away together with so many
                natural features of our planet. Urbanization is not only a social
                and cultural fact of historic proportions; it is a tremendous
                ecological fact as well. At a time when the overwhelming
                majority of people in North America and Western Europe
                regard themselves as city dwellers, we are obliged, if only for
                ecological reasons, to explore modern urbanization. We must
                explore not only its impact on the natural environment, a

                subject that has already been discussed in considerable detail
                by many writers, but, more significantly these days, the
                changes urbanization has produced in our sensibility toward
                society and toward the natural world. A social ecology of the
                city is needed today if ecological thinking is to be relevant to
                the modern human condition.
                This book attempts to lay the groundwork for such a social
                ecology. It tries to develop a concept of the city in those
                participatory terms that are uniquely characteristic of all
                “ecosystems” (or, as I prefer to call them, ecocommunities). It
                relates ecology’s participatory sensibility to the city in all its
                forms over the course of history, partly to show that the city
                was a social ecocommunity at various times insofar as it
                fostered diversity, mutualism, and connectedness. In applying
                a participatory sensibility to the city, I have been obliged to
                take the reader on a voyage into the evolution of the city, just
                as any serious natural ecologist would be obliged to deal with
                the biological development of an organism to better
                understand its life-cycle. To think about the city as an
                ecocommunity is to try to understand how it evolved, what
                forms it assumed over time, how it functioned as more than a
                mere market or center of production, and, in the last analysis,
                how member this urban ecocommunity called the city
                interacted with each other to produce a form of “second
                nature”—a humanly made “nature”—that existed in balance
                with the “first nature” we usually call the natural environment.
                Hence the citizens of a city of no less concern to me than the
                city itself, for the city at its best eventually became an ethical
                union of people, an ethical as as social ecocommunity, not
2 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                simply a dense collection of structures designed for no other
                purpose than to provide goods and services for its anonymous
                residents.
                What I wish to do is redeem the city, to visualize it not; threat to
                the environment but as a uniquely human, ethical, and
                ecological community that often lived in balance with nature
                and created institutional forms that sharpened human
                awareness of their sense of natural place as well as social
                place. My repeated references to the agrarian world could
                easily be regarded as references to the natural world as well.
                My emphasis on civic participation can be taken as the social
                counterpart of biological mutualism citizenship, as the social
                counterpart of biotic involvement if shaping the form of a
                natural ecocommunity; civic history, as the social counterpart
                of natural history. My goal, in effect, has been to redefine the
                city and the citizen in the language of social ecol ogy in the
                hope that environmentally as well as socially oriented people
                today will understand what the city and citizenship used to be
                in order to better understand what they should be in an
                ecological society.
                The real urban crisis of our time, I shall emphasize, has resulted
                not from the emergence of the city as such; rather it results
                from the emergence of a relatively new and cancerous
                phenomenon that poses a deadly threat to the city and
                countryside alike: urbanization. The nature of this threat—not
                merely as geographic sprawl but a devastating dehumanizing
                of city life, a destructing of community, and a denaturing of
                agrarian life—is the underlying theme of this book. I must leave
                it to the pages which follow for a more complete description

                and elucidation of the vast problems urbanization is creating.
                My argument runs counter to the conventional wisdom that
                city and countryside, like society and nature, are necessarily in
                conflict with each other, a theme that pervades so much of the
                writing on urbanity of western society.
                Quite to the contrary: however much city life marks a
                departure in many social respects from the more natural forms
                of human sociation such as tribal and kinship groups, the city
                has often been as much a gift to the ecology of a landscape as
                it has been a harm. To recover a feeling for the participatory
                civic institutions that Once marked city life and citizenship is to
                recover those ideals of Civic life and a civic sensibility that
                could countervail the massive destruction that urbanization
                inflicts on city and countryside alike.
                This book advances several reflections on how an ecological
                politics can be developed. In so doing, it redefines the word
                politics itself along ecological lines, much as Green groups in
                North America and Europe have been doing over the past
                years. Finally, this book makes a plea for a confederal and
                institutional politics, this is, for enlarging the democratic, grass-
                roots institutions that countervail the growing centralization of
                the nation-state, not the conventional electoral politics based
                on single issues and parliamentary tournaments.
                Much that motivated my writing of this book stems from my
                conviction as a social ecologist and environmental activist that
                there is a pressing need to view the city—more generally, the
                municipality, if we are to include towns as well as
                metropolitican areas—as an ecological enterprise, not merely a
                logistical or structural one. Hence, the largest chapter in this
4 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                book advances a programmatic agenda for recovering not only
                an ecological image of the city and an active citizenry but a
                way of looking at politics that combines the high ideal of a
                participatory citizenship—in short, ecological values based on
                participation as a mutualistic phenomena in society as well as
                in nature.
                In any case, the city is here to stay. Indeed, it has been a crucial
                part of human history and a factor in the making of the human
                mind for some seven thousand years. Can we afford to ignore
                it? Must we accept it as it is—as an entity that faces obliteration
                by a sprawling urbanization that threatens the countryside as
                well? Or can we give the city a new meaning, a new politics, a
                new sense of direction—and, also, provide new ideals of
                citizenship, many of which were in fact attained in great part
                during past times? By ignoring the city and citizenship, we do
                so at the peril of becoming isolated from the great mass of
                humanity which is threatened by the anonymity and powerless
                created by urbanization. This is a issue which all socially and
                environmentally oriented people must face and answer in their
                own way: My goal, here, is to pose the question of urbanization
                and citizenship as clearly as I can and advance some modest
                solutions based on my own concerns as a social ecologist

                Introduction
                The city has been a favorite target of hostility from biblical
                times onward—and it is no less so today. Viewed as a festering
                source of moral depravity by many people, it has been
                variously assailed as an ugly blight on a seemingly pristine
                natural landscape, as the sinful embodiment of a human
                nature that is aggressive, domineering, or even as “male” in its
                “rape” of a caring Mother Earth and “her” gentle aboriginal folk
                and animal offspring. I will leave the metaphoric, often terribly
                fuzzy ruminations of this genre of anti-city sentiment aside. A
                far stronger case can be made for an anti-city sentiment that
                regards modern, generally sprawling and formless urban
                agglomerations as sources of anomie, fear, self-interest, and a
                host of environmental problems. Urbanization, as I call this
                ever-encroaching and ever-growing phenomenon that we so
                often facilely identify with cities as such, can indeed be as toxic
                to the human spirit as it can be to a region’s natural integrity.
                But what, then, is a city? And are the people trapped in
                modern-day urban agglomerations really citizens?
                Urbanization Without Cities raises these questions in a
                reflective and hopeful way. Far from joining the chorus of city-
                denouncers, I wish to explore the enormous value of cities—
                and towns—as remarkable human creations. In responding to
                the above questions, I have tried to examine from a historical
                viewpoint the origins of cities, their role in shaping humanity as
                a highly unique and creative species, and the promise they
6 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                offer as arenas for a new political and social dispensation. I
                have tried to examine how the city evolved, what forms it
                assumed over time, how it functioned as more than a mere
                market or center of production, and how citizens of a city
                interacted with one another to produce a form of what the
                great Roman thinker Cicero called “second nature”—that is, a
                humanly made “nature”—that existed in balance with the “first
                nature” we usually call the natural environment. Hence the
                citizens of a city are of no less concern to me than the city
                itself, for the city at its best ultimately became an ethical union
                of people, a moral as well as a socioeconomic community—not
                simply a dense collection of structures designed merely to
                provide goods and services for its anonymous residents.
                What I wish to do is to redeem the city, to explore it hot as a
                corrosive phenomenon but as a uniquely human, ethical, and
                ecological community whose members often lived in balance
                with nature and created institutional forms that sharpened
                human self-awareness, fostered rationality, created a
                secularized culture, enhanced individuality, and established
                institutional forms of freedom. My repeated references to the
                agrarian world can easily be regarded as references to the
                natural world as well. My emphasis on civic participation can
                be taken as the social counterpart of biological mutualism;
                citizenship, as the social counterpart of biotic involvement in
                shaping the forms of natural ecocommunities; and civic
                history, as the social counterpart of natural history. In using the
                word counterpart here, however, I do not mean that civic
                participation, citizenship, and civic history are reducible to
                natural mutualism, ecocommunities, and biological evolution;

                they differ in far too many ways to be congruent. But this is a
                philosophical question I have dealt with in a broad discussion of
                first and second nature in my The Philosophy of Social Ecology
                (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1990). Suffice it to say here that
                my goal in this book has been to redefine the city and the
                citizen in the language of social ecology. It is my hope that
                thoughtful people today will attempt to understand what the
                city and citizenship used to be in order to better understand
                what they could be in a free, rational, and ecological society.
                The usual kinds of answers given to the question of what
                constitutes a city are often spatial and demographic in
                character, viewing the the city as an area occupied by a closely
                interlocked, densely populated human community. This
                definition, cast in largely quantitative terms, has been
                advanced for a long time. In fact, it is the popular criterion for
                the prestige enjoyed by some cities over other ones, and of
                cities generally over towns and villages. Tradition has it that
                the larger a city is, the better it is culturally and economically,
                by comparison with smaller communities. It is worth noting
                that years ago, American census-takers regarded communities
                of five thousand people or more as urban and those with
                smaller populations as rural. More recent criteria of what
                constitutes a city have changed only quantitatively. The word
                city, in fact, has turned into something of a social euphemism,
                the product of a time long past. Today, statisticians and many
                urbanologists favor the use of such categories as the Standard
                Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA)-sprawling, densely
                occupied regions that ordinarily embrace milllions of people. In
                reality, cities are being supplanted by areas so immense in size
8 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                that they are losing their contours, specificity, and uniqueness.
                Many urban agglomerations today have larger populations
                than many countries had a century ago and are in many
                respects hardly different from small nation-states.
                My own definition of a city cannot be reduced to a single
                proposition. Like rationality, science, and technology, which I
                regard as defined by their own histories, I view the city as the
                history of the city. That is to say, I view the city as the
                cumulative development—or dialectic—of certain important
                social potentialities and of their phases of development,
                traditions, culture, and community features. Least of all do I
                see citification—a processual noun for the city in history—as a
                mere “system of space,” to use Henri Lefebvre’s phrase, in
                which the geometrical term space becomes a quasi-mystical
                category for social, economic, and cultural relationships-
                relation- ships that I feel should be explored quite directly,
                without the convoluted “decoding” that enters into the work of
                certain postmodernists and neo-Marxists today. Neither from
                simple propositional definitions nor from somewhat mystical
                postmodernist gymnastics would I have any way of knowing
                how cities and their village, temple, and town progenitors
                came into being, how they developed, or what they ought to
                be if their potentialities were to be fulfilled in a free and rational
                society.
                Defining the early city, I maintain, begins with the recognition
                of the city as a creative breach with humanity’s essentially
                biological heritage, indeed the “metamorphosis” of that
                heritage into a new social form of evolution. The city was
                initially the arena par excellence for the transformation of
9 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                human relationships from associations based on biological
                facts, such as kinship, to distinctly social facts, such as
                residential propinquity; for the emergence of increasingly
                secular forms of institutionalization; for often rapidly innovative
                cultural relations; and for universalizing economic activities
                that had been previously associated with age, gender, and
                ethnic divisions. In short, the city was the historic arena in
                which—and as a result of which—biological affinities were
                transformed into social affinities. It constituted the single most
                important factor that changed an ethnic folk into a body of
                secular citizens, and a parochial tribe into a universal civitatis,
                where, in time, the “stranger” or “outsider” could become a
                member of the community without having to satisfy any
                requirement of real or mythic blood ties to a common ancestor.
                Not only did political relationships replace kinship relationships;
                the notion of a shared humanitas replaced the exclusivity of
                the clan and tribe, whose biosocial claims to be “the People”
                had often excluded the “outsider” as an inorganic, exogenous,
                or even threatening “other.”
                Hence the city was historically the arena for the emergence of
                such universalistic concepts as “humanity”—and is potentially
                the arena for the reemergence of concepts of politi- cal self-
                regulation and citizenship, for the elaboration of social
                relations, and for the rise of a new civic culture. The steps from
                a consanguineous clan, tribe, and village to a polis, or political
                city; from blood brothers and sisters who were born into their
                social responsibilities to citizens who in the best of
                circumstances could freely decide on their civic responsibilities
                and determine their own affinities based on reason and secular

                interests—these steps constitute a meaningful definition of the
                city. Cities, to be sure, can rise and fall. They can enjoy good
                fortune for a time or, owing to conflicts, totally disappear. But
                once the city established firm roots in the history of social
                development, it acquired a conceptual reality that still persists,
                and it can still undergo many metamorphoses despite the
                disappearance or stagnation of individual cities. The city, in
                effect, has become a historic tradition—often a highly moral
                one—that tends to expand uniquely human traits and notions
                of freedom, and an idea of civic commonality that corrodes the
                parochial bonds of blood ties, gender distinctions, age status-
                groups, and ethnic exclusivity.
                We can thus legitimately speak of the history of the city
                without focusing on the rise, development, and decline of any
                one city in particular. And we can speak of this history as
                cumulative. The late medieval city, for example, united civic
                and ideological traditions that had originated in Athens,
                Jerusalem, and Rome, and that persisted long after those cities
                had declined as innovative civic entities. Later, the cities of the
                Renaissance, the Baroque era, and the Enlightenment arose as
                reworked arenas of ancient and medieval cities, borrowing
                from them their architecture, literature, art, religions, and
                philosophies, yet transforming them to meet the needs of a
                new time.
                The ways in which actual cities provide US with processual
                definitions of the city form much of the content of this book.
                Insofar as I am guided by the Greek notion that a city or polis is
                an ethical union of citizens, I am committed to an overarching
                vision of what the city ought to be, not merely what it is at any
11 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                given time. The term ought is the stuff out of which ethics is
                usually made—with the difference that in my view the “ought”
                is not a formal or arbitrary regulative credo but the product of
                reasoning, of an unfolding rational process elicited or derived
                eductively from the potentialities of humanity to develop,
                however falteringly, mature, self-conscious, free, and
                ecological communities. I call this integration of the best in first
                or “biological” nature and second or “social” nature an
                emergently new “third” or free nature—that is, an ethical,
                humanly scaled community that establishes a creative
                interaction with its natural environment. From a processual
                standpoint, I refuse to bifurcate that continuum we call
                “Nature” into a biological world and a social world that stand in
                flat opposition to each other. Both are in a very real sense
                natural, and their naturalness finds its evolutionary realization
                in those remarkable primates called human beings who,
                consciously responding to a sense of obligation to the
                ecological integrity of the planet, bring their rational,
                communicative, richly social, imaginative, and aesthetic
                capacities to the service of the nonhuman world as well as the
                human.
                This ethics of complementarity, as I called it years ago, would
                not only be a culminating point of aeons of natural evolution,
                once it guided human behavior in the cities of an ecological
                society; it would eminently be a culminating point of reason
                itself—a condition in which rational goals could be established
                for citizenship not only in new, ecologically oriented networks
                of cities but in truly rational beings called citizens. For
                citizenship, too, is a process—as the Greeks so brilliantly saw—
12 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                a process involving the social and self-formation of people into
                active participants in the management of their communities.
                As this book stresses, citizens today no longer even
                approximate the high and eminently human standard of
                citizenship that was established in the Hellenic world—a
                meaning that must be recovered, as well as the personal and
                social training, or paideia, for producing citizens.
                To this high civic and ethical calling, so to speak, we are
                summoned by reason: to networks of new, humanly scaled
                cities, to citizenship, to directly democratic political institutions,
                and to a vastly expanded ideal of freedom. The cities I have
                discussed in this book approximate the fulfillment of this calling
                —some more than others, a few more highly conscious of free
                civic ideals than the rest—in civic cultures that held to such
                intituitive, often naive notions of citizenship that they were
                highly vulnerable to destructive forces; and in thinkers who
                projected (often in revolutionary situations,) in thought what
                they believed should have been achieved in actuality but, alas,
                was not.
                When I use the word networks in this book, I am alluding not to
                ad hoc interactions, tentative agreements, contracts, or
                transient associations among cities-although these were
                common enough, if usually very short-lived, in the past.
                Rather, I am referring to what has long been a theoretical ideal
                and at times an impressive municipal reality: namely,
                confederations. I cannot stress how integrally the confederal
                association of cities and towns is part of the development of a
                free, ecologically oriented society. Localism, in the narrow
                sense of a virtually autarchical locality that aspires to “self-

                sufficiency”—in the sense so popular in the ecology movement
                today—could easily produce a parochialism notable for such
                evils as racism, cultural insularity, and a stagnant
                traditionalism. Conceived localistically, municipalities would be
                as regressive as authoritarian nation-states.
                Confederalism is explicitly not “localist” but is rather
                integrative, as I explain in the appendix to this book. It rests on
                the mutual obligations of confederated municipalities to
                systematically adjudicate conflicting claims, coordinate
                common efforts, and see to the administration of municipal
                policies without infringing on the right of the majority of its
                participants. That consensual forms of agreement where
                possible would be the most desirable decision-making
                procedure does not mean that majority decision-making
                should not be adopted if a confederation risks the prospect of
                being tyrannized by the few at the expense of the many.
                Moreover, confederation, if it is to be successful, must not only
                function in accordance with majoritarian forms of decision-
                making; it must diminish the authority of confederal councils,
                the higher they are, in coordinating the policies formulated at
                the basic level of decision-making—the citizen assembly of a
                municipality.
                A clear distinction must be drawn between administration and
                policy-making: the former would fall within the province of the
                confederal councils, while the latter would fall within the
                province of the municipal assemblies. The traditional
                hierarchial pyramid of authority would thus be literally inverted
                in confederal municipalism; the “apex” of all authority would
                lie with the municipal assemblies, guided by majority rule both
14 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                in the assembly and among the assemblies of a confederal
                region; the “base” would lie with the broadest confederal
                councils whose work is simply administrative and adjudicatory,
                and whose deputies, drawn from smaller confederal bodies,
                would be easily recallable and subject to careful popular
                oversight.
                Is this a chimerical scheme? History has shown that the very
                contrary is true. Although confederations in the past often fell
                apart, each for very specific reasons that would require a full
                volume to explore, they were often shattered or confined to
                limited areas by imperial states and, more recently, the nation-
                state. Confederations, in fact, have a long and impressive
                history. They were the principal political weapons for resisting
                —and, for a time, diminishing—state power. The struggles of
                confederated Rhenish cities in the late Middle Ages against the
                Holy Roman Empire and of the confederated Spanish cities
                against Charles V during the Reformation era can be cited as
                partially successful attempts to abort or restrict imperial and
                national power. In Spain, confederal movements had an impact
                on public life that was felt well into the 1930s.
                In many respects, this contest between confederalism and the
                nation-state is reemerging today, although very little
                consciousness guides intuitive opponents of the nation-state, a
                shortcoming that has more to do with the atrophied
                consciousness of so-called “Left”-wing movements than with
                any other single factor. Indeed, if the closing decade of this
                century is permitted to pass without the emergence of a
                strong, self-conscious, and well-organized movement that is
                committed to municipal confederation, radical theory and

                practice will deserve the ignominious oblivion into which
                Marxist and individualistic “anarchist” tendencies have been
                drifting for some time now. Today’s dogmatic or subcultural
                radical movements may one day be viewed with contempt if
                they reject the last—and in my view their only—prospect of
                functioning as popular movements, and if they fail to cross the
                line from academic or personalistic subcultures into the public
                sphere where they could still reach millions of eager but
                confused people. Popular albeit inchoate impulses toward
                these same ideas—local control, confederation, and a new
                politics—may well be used, in altered form, and manipulated
                by reactionary forces in the service of racist, parochial, and
                ultimately authoritarian ends.
                Urbanization Without Cities thus advances an appeal—perhaps
                the last that can be made in this period—not only for a new
                theoretical framework in which to develop a new politics (in
                this term’s Hellenic meaning rather than in the parliamentary
                meaning imparted to it by the nation-state). It also advances
                an appeal for a self-conscious practice in which confederal
                municipalists engage in local electoral activity to alter city and
                town charters, restructure civic institutions to provide the
                public sphere for direct democracy, and bring the means of
                production under citizen control—not under the particu1aristic
                forms of “workers’ control” that tend to degenerate into a form
                of collectivistic capitalism, or under forms of nationalized
                production, which enhance the state’s authority with greater
                economic power.
                This practice is not a mere “strategy,” to use the language of
                the traditional Left—indeed, the language of all statist

                movements. It is not a “means” to an end, least of all a very
                unclear and muddled end. Rather, it is the unfolding of an end:
                the famous “Commune of communes,” to which socialists and
                anarchists alike long aspired, especially after the legendary
                Paris Commune of 1871, which explicitly used this term. In this
                process or dialectic of unfolding, the achievement of a
                Commune of communes—or in less colorful terms, a
                confederation of municipalities—requires a completely
                uncompromising politics. It rests on the notion of a
                fundamental duality of power in which increasingly
                independent and confederated municipalities emerge in flat
                opposition to the centralized nation-state. Indeed, whatever
                power confederated municipalities gain can be acquired only
                at the expense of the nation-state, and whatever power the
                nation-state gains can be acquired only at the expense of
                municipal independence.
                In the force-field that exists between the two, either the
                municipalities and their confederations will increase their
                power by diminishing the the power of the ration-state, or the
                nation-state will increase its power by diminishing the authority
                of the municipalities and their confederations. Thus, for a
                municipalist movement to run candidates for state, provincial,
                or national office would be an absurd, in fact, oxymoronic
                subversion of its very claim to seek a “grassroots” or
                “participatory democracy,” if only because any office beyond
                the municipal level is, almost by definition, a form of
                representation rather than participation. Even more
                significantly, it would ignore the crucial fact that as they run
                candidates for local offices, confederal municipalists are also
17 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                running them against state, provincial, and national offices and
                institutions. The demand for municipal confederations is
                simultaneously a demand for opposition to the nation-state in
                all its forms, and to the illusion that the control of state,
                provincial, or national legislative bodies on the “top” is a
                precondition for the attainment of local power at the “bottom.”
                Not only would campaigns for state, provincial, and national
                office relax the tension between the “top,” which is the realm
                of statecraft, and the “bottom,” which is the realm of an
                authentic politics; they would diminish the educational function
                of politics at the “bottom,” which alone can become the realm
                of a new politics. Far from reaching greater numbers of people
                by running candidates for the summits of state power, such
                campaigns would confuse the distinction between politics and
                statecraft, between the participatory and the representative,
                between the confederal and the national. Not only would the
                tension between these two utterly opposing spheres of activity
                be relaxed and its dialectic aborted; and not only would the
                truly democratic nature of political education, which is based
                on face-to-face discourse between neighbors and citizens, be
                replaced by the media; but the very moral and educational
                thrust of a libertarian or confederal municipalist approach
                would be lost as a heavy mist beclouded the distinction
                between politics and statecraft. A “Commune of communes” is
                not a “Republic of communes” or a “Commonwealth of
                communes”; indeed, as a confederation of municipalities, it
                stands uncompromisingly opposed to any specious attempts
                to reduce a confederation or commune to a republic or a
                commonwealth.

                Radicals, social-democrats, and liberals—not to speak of that
                hybridized phenomenon known as “the Greens”—have never
                learned how to deal with the problem of state power. If history
                from earliest recorded times to the present has demonstrated
                anything, it is the implacable fact that state power is
                corruptive. None of the most idealistic and principled
                revolutionary leaders of the past lived comfortably with the
                corruptive effects of state power. Either they succumbed to it,
                or they consciously tried to diffuse it. The retention of state
                power destroyed the moral integrity not only of the most
                radical Puritans of the seventeenth century, who were eager to
                gain it, but that of the most dedicated socialists, communists,
                and anarchists who actually held it for a time. The English,
                French, Russian, and Spanish revolutions provide compelling
                evidence of the capacity of state power to corrupt—a capacity
                that can no longer be regarded as a moral truism but, given its
                unrelenting nature, must be seen as an existential fact. To
                pursue state power—or to “seize” it, to use the language of
                traditional radicalism—is to guarantee that it will persist as a
                form of elitist manipulation, expand, and be brutally exercised
                as an instrument against a popular democracy.
                A libertarian or confederal municipalist politics advances the
                best approach against “seizures” of state power and its
                retention by an elite, by slowly trying to accrete power for
                municipalities—initially, by acquiring moral power for
                municipal assemblies, as I have indicated in the closing
                chapter of this book. Libertarian or confederal municipalism
                seeks to expand the democratic institutions that still linger on
                in any modern republican system by opening them to the

                widest public participation possible at any given time. Hence
                the slogan that I have advanced: “Democratize the Republic!
                Radicalize the Democracy!” It is not that state power is to be
                “seized”—and then never relinquished—but that popular
                power is to be expanded until all power belongs to the
                institutions of a participatory democracy.
                From this standpoint, the distinction between politics and
                statecraft must be maintained in a clear and uncompromising
                manner, all the more to assure that no “pragmatic” exigencies
                or parliamentary” strategies”—even if they are used only to
                propagandize one’s views or challenge the “top” from the
                “top”—are invoked for seemingly confederal-municipalist
                ends. Indeed, the most effective impact of municipalist
                propaganda comes precisely from the fact that it is
                municipalist—that is to say, that it can be conducted only by
                person-to-person contact and its scope hopefully extended by
                a movement that tries to reach every municipality in a region
                or nation. It is this kind of propaganda that makes for trust,
                personal interaction, and face-to-face education and that
                fosters the development of a face-to-face democracy. Its
                authentic starting point is the small study group, the local
                lecture hall, the neighborhood press, and personal discourse-
                not the electronic media of statecraft that hypnotized the
                countercultural “media freaks” of the 1960s.
                Most of the ideas that appear in this introduction are
                elaborated in the body of this book. They are developed
                against the larger background of a historic moment in the
                evolution—and I should add, the decline—of city life, namely
                the emergence of a major threat to city and countryside alike:
20 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                urbanization. The existence of this threat—not merely as
                geographic sprawl but as a devastating dehumanization of city
                life, a destructuring of community and a denaturing of agrarian
                life—informs the views that follow. My argument runs counter
                to the conventional wisdom that city and countryside, like
                society and nature, are necessarily in conflict with each other,
                a theme that pervades so much of the writing on urbanity in
                Western society. Quite to the contrary: whatever may be the
                ways in which city life marks a departure from the more
                “natural” forms of human association such as tribal and kinship
                groups, the city has been more of a gift to social life and the
                ecological landscape than it has been harmful. To recover a
                feeling for the participatory civic institutions that once marked
                city life and citizenship is to recover those ideals of civic life and
                civic sensibility that could countervail the massive destruction
                that urbanization and the nation-state inflict on city and
                countryside alike.
                My writing of this book stemmed from my conviction as a social
                ecologist and eco-anarchist that there is a pressing need to
                view the city—more generally, the municipality, if we are to
                include towns as well—as an ecological enterprise, not merely
                as a logistical or structural one. The word ecological means a
                good deal more here than it does in the conventional
                environmentalism of the single-issue movements that are
                concerned with pollution, the retention of relatively untouched
                forests, the perpetuation of wildlife, and the like. Ecology, in my
                view, is more a societal project than a biological one. It should
                be conceived in terms that explore how notions of domination
                and the historical development of hierarchy have led to the

                social as well as natural problems we face today. For a clearer
                understanding of my ecological perspective—social ecology—
                the reader is advised to consult my many books on the subject,
                particularly The Ecology of Freedom and Remaking Society.
                The present book is concerned with what are loosely called
                “urban problems,” or if you like, “urban ecology.” Its goal is
                practical as well as theoretical. Hence, the largest chapter in
                the book (“The New Municipal Agenda”) advances a
                programmatic agenda for recovering not only an ecological
                concept of the city and an active citizenry but the creation of a
                new politics that combines the high ideal of a participatory
                citizenship with a recognition of what the city or town can be in
                a rational, free, and ecological society.
                In any case, the city, however much more distorted it may
                become in the future, will remain a problem. At its best, it has
                been a crucial part of human history and a force in the making
                of the human mind for some seven thousand years. Can we
                afford to ignore it? Must we accept it as it is—as an entity that
                sprawling urbanization threatens to obliterate, as it threatens
                to devour the countryside as well? Or can we give the city a
                new meaning, a new politics, a new sense of direction-as well
                as provide new ideals of citizenship, many of which were in fact
                once attained in previous times? We ignore the city and
                citizenship at the peril of becoming isolated from the great
                mass of humanity, which is threatened by the anonymity and
                powerlessness created by urbanization. This is an issue that all
                socially and enviromentally concerned people must face. My
                goal here is to pose the question of the future of cities and
                citizenship as clearly as I can and to advance solutions based

                on the principles of social ecology.
                Murray Bookchin
                Institute for Social Ecology
                Plainfield, Vermont
                January, 1992
                Chapter One: Urbanization Against Cities
                The title of this chapter has been deliberately worded to create
                a paradox in the reader’s mind. How, it may be fair to ask, can,
                we speak of urbanization against cities? The two words,
                “urbanity” and “city,” are usually taken to be synonyms.
                Indeed, as conventional wisdom would have it, a city is by
                definition an urban entity, and an urban entity, in turn, is
                certainly regarded as a city.
                Yet I shall take great pains to show that they are in sharp
                contrast to each other—in fact, that they are bitter antagonists.
                My reasons for making such an unorthodox distinction
                between urbanization and citification are not intended to be
                semantic word juggling. The contradiction forms the very
                rationale for writing this book. “Urbanization against cities” is
                meant to focus as sharply as possible on a human and
                ecological crisis so deep-sfeated we are hardly aware of its
                existence, much less its grave impact on social freedom and
                personal autonomy. I refer to the historic decline of the city as
                an authentic arena of political life (that once lived in some
                balance with the natural world) and, perhaps no less
                significantly, the decline of the very notion of citizenship.
                So sweeping a statement obviously requires some clarification

                at the outset of our discussion. According to most social
                theorists, the traditional “contradiction” created by the rise of
                urbanism has been the city’s ages-old “conflict” with the
                countryside. History, we are commonly told, is filled with
                innumerable examples of the city’s efforts to free itself from
                the trammels of agrarian parochialism. The city, it is
                emphasized, has always tried to assert its cosmopolitan
                culture and secular civic institutions over the narrow
                provincialism and constrictive kinship ties of the rural town and
                village. We take it for granted that from ancient to modern
                times the city and countryside have been at “war” with each
                other. Historically, this “war” is supposed to be embodied in
                the conflicting interests between the feudal lord and the urban
                merchant, the peasant food-cultivator and town-dwelling
                craftsperson, the landbased aristocrat and the citified
                capitalist, the farmer and the industrial worker.
                That such conflicts have existed over the course of history and
                echo in modern society is true enough. We still retain ingrained
                visions of a cleansing and virtuous pastoral life that stands in
                moral contrast with the tainted and sinful world of the city. The
                contrast has been the subject of Biblical invectives, the theme
                of some of our most outstanding novels, and a centerpiece in
                the writings of many distinguished sociologists.
                Taken as a whole, however, this Manichean drama can be a
                gross simplification of reality. It is certainly true that city and
                countryside have commonly viewed each other
                antagonistically in the past. And there have been long
                stretches of history when each tried to assert economic and
                political dominance over the other. But there have also been
24 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                times when they existed in an almost exquisitely sensitive,
                creative, and ecological balance with each other. Some of the
                most admirable human adventures m culture, technics, and
                social freedom have occurred precisely in those periods when a
                complementary relationship between city and country, indeed
                between society and nature, successfully replaced the mutual
                rivalry for supremacy.
                Today, it would seem that the city has finally achieved
                complete dominance over the countryside. Indeed, with the
                extension of suburbs into nearby open land on an
                unprecedented scale, the city seems to be literally engulfing
                the agrarian and natural worlds,
                absorbing adjacent towns and villages into sprawling
                metropolitan entities—a form of social cannibalism that could
                easily serve for our very definition of urbanization. All talk of
                metropolitan Babylon and Rome to the contrary, we have no
                comparable parallels in the past to urbanization on our
                present-day scale. Worse, the city seems to be replacing rural
                culture and all its rich traditional forms with the mass media
                and technocratic values we tend to associate with “city life.” If
                all of this is true—as I frankly believe it is—I plan to introduce in
                this book a very discordant qualification. Contrary to most
                views on the subject, I plan to show that if we use words such
                as “city” and “country” meaningfully to describe this process
                of physical, cultural, and ecological urban cannibalism, the
                image of an all-devouring “city” that is engulfing a supine and
                helpless “country” is a sheer myth.
                The truth is that the city and the country are under siege today
                —a siege that threatens humanity’s very place in the natural
25 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                environment. Both are being subverted by urbanization, a
                process that threatens to destroy their identities and their vast
                wealth of tradition and variety. Urbanization is engulfing not
                only the countryside; it is also engulfing the city. It is devouring
                not only town and village life based on the values, culture, and
                institutions nourished by agrarian relationships. It is devouring
                city life based on the values, culture, and institutions nourished
                by civic relationships. City space with its human propinquity,
                distinctive neighborhoods, and humanly scaled politics—like
                rural space, with its closeness to nature, its high sense of
                mutual aid, and its strong family relationships—is being
                absorbed by urbanization, with its smothering traits of
                anonymity, homogenization, and institutional gigantism.
                Whether or not the urbanization of both the city and the
                country is desirable is an issue that I shall earnestly explore,
                But I cannot emphasize too strongly that even if we think in the
                old terms of city versus country and the unique political
                contrasts such a time-honored imagery has nurtured, the
                conflict between city and country has largely become obsolete,
                Urbanization threatens to replace both contestants in this
                seemingly historic antagonism. It threatens to absorb them
                into a faceless urban world in which the words “city” and
                “country” will essentially become social, cultural, and political
                archaisms.
                Perhaps our greatest difficulty in understanding urbanization
                and its grave impact on social and personal life today stems
                from our tendency to link it with our very naive idea, of the city.
                We are often satisfied to call any urban entity a city if it is
                demographically congested, structurally sizable, and, most
26 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                significantly, populated by individuals whose work no longer
                deals directly with food cultivation. Urbanization, like
                citification, seems to meet these criteria so completely that we
                commonly identify the two, and distinguish them more as a
                matter of degree than of kind. Thus, we tend to regard a
                sprawling metropolitan area merely as an oversized city, or it
                may be an agglomeration of closely packed “cities” that
                Americans call “urban belts” and the British call
                “conurbations.”
                Granted that we are finding it increasingly difficult, on careful
                reflection, to regard urban belts and conurbations merely as
                cities. We uneasily sense that they are something more—if not
                something newer—than what previous generations called
                cities. What confuses us about such perplexing issues is that
                the people who live in such new urban entities are plainly
                engaged in city-type occupations and seem to follow citified
                lifeways. Increasingly removed from the natural world,
                metropolitan dwellers rarely, if ever, earn their livelihood as
                farmers, however fashionable urban and suburban gardening
                has become in recent years. They are employed in urban jobs,
                be they professional, managerial, service-oriented, craft-
                oriented, or the like. They five highly paced and culturally
                urbane lifeways-that lock into mechanically fixed time slots—
                notably, the “nine-to-five” pattern—rather than follow agrarian
                cycles guided by seasonal change and dawn-to-dusk personal
                rhythms. Urban environments are highly synthetic rather than
                natural. Food is normally bought rather than grown. Dwellings
                tend to be concentrated rather than dispersed. Personal life is
                not open to the considerable public scrutiny we find in small
27 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                towns or rooted in the strong kinship systems we find in the
                country. Urban culture is produced, packaged, and marketed
                as a segment of the city dweller’s leisure time, not infused into
                the totality of daily life and hallowed by tradition as it is in the
                agrarian world. That country life is growing more and more like
                city life and losing its simplest natural attributes is a point that
                will become highly salient for the purposes of our discussion.
                For the present, what counts is,that the aforementioned
                distinction still exists’ in the image of what we call urbanization
                (conceived as citification) as distinguished from ruralization.
                Superficial as these continuities and contrasts may be, they
                begin to dissolve completely when we start to explore history
                for richer, fuller standards of what we mean by the word cities.
                I use the plural, cities, advisedly: Despite certain similarities,
                the differences between cities of the past also have
                considerable importance. History presents us with a wide
                range of unique and distinctive cities—the earliest in Sumer
                centering around temples; later ones, such as Babylon, around
                palaces; the more dynamic Greek democracies around civic
                squares that fostered citizen interaction; medieval and more
                recent ones, around a variety of different marketplaces.
                However diversified cities may have been in the past, our
                language gives them considerable prestige. The term
                civilization has its origin in civitas—a Latin word occasionally
                used for city—and denotes the cultural sophistication the
                western world has traditionally imparted to some kind of
                urbanism. Most of our utopian visions, whether heavenly or
                earthly, take the form of a pity, a “New Jerusalem’’ to. speak in
                sacred terms, or an idealized version of the Hellenic “city-

                state” to use Secular language.
                But here we abruptly encounter the limits of the term
                urbanization as a synonym for citification. Urbanization does
                not comfortably fit into an imagery of the city drawn from
                theocratic, monarchic, democratic, and economic communities
                peopled by craftsfolk and small merchants who were engaged
                in a natural economy. Our urban belts and conurbations are
                vast engines for operating huge corporate enterprises,
                industrial networks, distribution systems, and administrative
                mechanisms. Their facilities, like their towering buildings,
                stretch almost endlessly over the landscape until they begin to
                lack all definition and centrality. It is difficult to root them in a
                temple, palace, public square, or the small, intimate
                marketplace of craftsfolk and merchants. To say that they have
                any specific center that gives them civic identity is often so ill-
                fitting as to be absurd, even if one allows for centers that linger
                on from past eras when cities were still clearly delineable areas
                for human association.
                What, then, do our premodern cities with their rich diversity of
                forms and functions have in common? We arrive at a basic
                characteristic of city life that is the result not only of human
                propinquity, structural size, occupations, and an urbane
                culture. What major cities of the past share—whatever their
                differences are largely moral, often spiritual, attributes with
                deep roots in a natural environment that sharply distinguish
                them from the physical attributes we associate with
                urbanization. Cities of the past from their very beginnings were
                ultimately what I would call communities of the heart”—moral
                associations that were nourished by a shared sense of

                ideological commitment and public concern. Civic ideology and
                concern centered around a strong belief in the good life for
                which the city provided the arena and catalytic agent. The
                good life by no means meant the affluent life, the life of
                personal pleasures and material security. More often than not,
                it meant a life of goodness, of virtue and probity. This sense of
                civic calling could assume a highly spiritual form such as we
                find in the Jews’ reverence for Jerusalem or a highly ethical
                form as in the Greeks’ admiration for Athens. Between these
                emotive and intellectual extremes, city dwellers of the past
                tended to form social compacts” that were guided not only by
                material and defensive considerations but by loyalties to their
                cities that were shaped by richly textured ideological
                commitments.
                Love of one’s city, a deep and abiding sense of loyalty to its
                welfare, and an attempt to place these sentiments within a rich
                moral and ecological context, whether God-given or
                intellectual, clearly distinguishes the majority of cities of past
                eras from those of present ones. We have virtually no
                equivalent in the modern city of the Near Eastern sense of civic
                spirituality, the Greek feeling of political affiliation, the
                medieval endearment to communal fraternity, and the
                Renaissance love of urban pageantry that infused the
                otherwise disparate citizenry of the past. Such loyalties, with
                their moral underpinnings, may linger on in the residents of
                modern cities, but more as a fevered appetite for the material,
                cultural, and nervous stimulation of what we today designate
                as the good life than as a product of the ethical sturdiness,
                spiritual commitment, and sense of civic virtue that marked

                the citizenry of earlier eras. It also meant a love of the land, of
                place and natural setting that gave rise to a rich ecological
                sensibility and respect for the countryside.
                To speak truthfully, our present-day relationship to the city
                usually takes the form of very pragmatic material
                requirements. A modern city, suburb, town, or, for that matter,
                a village is often evaluated in terms of the “municipal services”
                it offers to its residents. The traditional religious, cultural,
                ethical, and ecological features that once endeared citizens to
                their city, and its natural surroundings have dissolved into
                quantitative, often ethically neutral, criteria. The city is the first
                fund into which we make a series of social investments for the
                express purpose of receiving a number of distinctly material
                returns. We expect our persons and property to be protected,
                our shelters to be safeguarded, our garbage to be removed,
                our roads to be repaired, our environment to be physically and
                socially tidy—which is to say, spared from the invasion of
                “undesirable elements.”
                Doubtless we want our cities to be culturally stimulating,
                economically viable, and attractive in reputation. But such
                attainments are not necessarily a function of the city as such.
                They often depend upon the results of personal enterprise, the
                presence of individual types who reside in it by virtue of birth or
                choice. For a city to claim a famous son—and, more recently, a
                famous daughter—does not necessarily reflect well upon the
                city’s reputation for producing gifted or renowned people but
                rather on the individual gifts of one or more of its residents. It
                does not provide us with evidence of the city’s cultural milieu
                but of a specific person’s gifts and biography that often involve
31 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                a valiant effort to transcend a community’s oppressive
                environment. Such was the case, for example, with James
                Joyce’s relationship with Dublin, Oscar Wilde’s relationship with
                London, or Cezanne’s relationship with Paris.
                Hence, urban “civilization” as we know it today is the erratic
                byproduct of a particular city, not its main and distinguishing
                consequence. Such a “civilization” emerges from the wayward
                activities of fairly privatized individuals or corporations rather
                than the innate traits of the municipality itself. A civic culture
                does not stem from the collective efforts of a unique and
                cohesive public, however unusual the city may be in terms of
                its regional location and its historic traditions. It stems from the
                personal activities of certain individuals wKo happen to occupy
                a residence within the city’s confines, staff its shops and
                offices, work its industries, and, of course, produce its artistic
                artifacts. Urban “civilization,” today, is not a characteristic civic
                phenomenon that emerges from a distinctive public and body
                politic; it is simply the exudate of free enterprise with its patina
                of “public service” and cultural charity. That mayors, corporate
                leaders, and philanthropists may vie with each other in
                celebrating the projects they initiate—projects that may range
                from concert halls and museums to airports and industrial
                parks—is simply evidence of the shallowness of what today is
                called “civic-mindedness.” Rarely do these projects, which in
                any case are seldom free of vulgarity, nourish the city as a
                collectivity and arena for public activity. Like iridescent bubbles
                that rise, glisten, and burst, they form the surface of the city’s
                often stagnant cultural life and social malaise.
                In fact, like any marketplace, the modern city is the hectic
32 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                center of a largely privatized interaction between anonymous
                buyers and sellers who are more involved in exchanging their
                wares than in forming socially and ethically meaningful
                associations. Cities today are typically measured more by their
                success as business enterprises than cultural foci. The ability of
                an urban entity to “balance its budget,” to operate
                “efficiently,” to “maximize” its service with minimal cost, all of
                these are regarded as the hallmark of municipal success.
                Corporate models form the ideal examples of urban models,
                and civic leaders take greater pride in their managerial skills
                than in their intellectual abilities.
                This dominant entrepreneurial concept of the city has its
                precise counterpart in the dominant contemporary notion of
                citizenship. If we tend to view the city as our most immediate
                social “investment,” we expect the city to give us adequate
                material “returns.” We pay our taxes with a distinct
                expectation of the services they will buy. The greater the
                services for the money we pay, the more profitable it is to
                reside in a given city. Civic amenities are clearly measurable in
                terms of the number of schools, class sizes, parks, firehouses,
                transportation facilities, police, crime rates, parking spaces—
                indeed, in terms too numerous to inventory. When we “buy”
                into a residential area, we reconnoiter it primarily for these
                material and logistical amenities and secondarily, if at all, for
                the cultural stimulation and sense of community it provides.
                Not surprisingly, the resident of most cities today tends to
                develop a very distinctive self-image. It is not the image of a
                citizen—a historically remarkable term that I have yet to
                describe—but that of a taxpayer. He or she does not have a
33 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                sense of self appropriate to what we might call a public figure
                but rather that of a free-wheeling investor. Doubtless,
                taxpayers and investors often form many associations, but
                they ally with each other to advance or protect very specific
                interests. Like all sensible entrepreneurs who are involved in
                the business of residing in a city, they want a favorable return
                for what they pay, and, as the saying goes, “in numbers there
                is strength.” Accordingly, all common adages to the contrary,
                they can fight City Hall—presumably, the place where the
                corporate board meets—and, depending as much upon their
                wealth as upon their numbers, they may succeed.
                But beyorid this economically secure interplay of conflicting
                interests and demands, the citizen qua taxpayer is not
                expected to get deeply involved in municipal affairs. Nor does
                the contemporary urban environment encourage him or her to
                do so. A “good citizen” is one who obeys the laws, pays taxes,
                votes ritualistically for preselected candidates, and “minds his
                or her own business.” This notion of appropriate civic behavior
                is no t merely a mutually shared, quietistic vision of modern-
                day citizenship; it is a political desideratum that, if violated,
                exposes—more active taxpayers to charges of “meddling” at
                best and “vigilantism” at worst. Both taxpayers and municipal
                officials prudently acknowledge that the people of a city should
                be properly represented by efficient, specialized, and
                professional surrogates of “the public.” Day-to-day power,
                however, resides’ precisely in the hands of these managerial
                surrogates, not in their “constituencies” who increasingly
                acquire the anonymity and’ facelessness that the word
                “constituency” denotes. Like the traditional liberal concept that
34 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                government is best when it governs least, so the contemporary
                liberal Concept of citizenship seems to be that a “constituent”
                is best when he or she acts the least.
                Such a concept of citizenship is fraught with grave
                psychological as well as political consequences. Individuals
                whose public lives barely transcend the social level of mere
                taxpayers tend to form very passive images of their
                personalities and of the natural environment around them. An
                increasingly disempowered citizen may well become a
                quietistic and highly retiring self. A major loss of social power
                tends to render a person less than human and thereby yields a
                loss of individuation itself. Such constituents live in a painfully
                contradictory world. On the one hand, society becomes an
                intensely problematic presence in their lives. The social realm
                is a potential source of war, of economic instability, of
                contending factions and ideologies that may reach directly into
                the most guarded niches of private life. These problems
                become particularly intimate when issues such as abortion,
                military conscription, sexual freedom, and earning capacity
                invade the individual’s domestic realm.
                On the other hand, while such issues rage around the
                “constituent,” he or she is steadily divested of the power to act
                upon them. Indeed, the “constituent’s” intellectual equipment
                to form an assured opinion is eroded by an ever-deepening
                sense of personal incompetence and public detachment. A
                preoccupation with trivia—the problems of shopping, fashion,
                personal appearance, career advancement, and
                entertainment in a thoroughly boring milieu—replaces the
                more heroic stance of a socially and environmentally involved
35 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                body politic. We thus encounter a twofold development: a
                world in which growing social power preempts concerns that
                were once largely within the purview of the individual and the
                community, and the steady erosion of personal power and the
                individual’s capacity for action. Within this paralyzing
                forcefield, the individual’s self-identity begins to suffer a crucial
                decline. Self-recognition dissolves steadily into a grim lack of
                selfhood. Inaction becomes the only form of action with the
                result that the “constituent” retreats into an inwardness that
                lacks the substance to render one individually functional.
                A world in which personality itself resembles the tabula rasa of
                an aimless society and a meaningless way of personal fife
                would seem to raise more universal issues than the fate of the
                city and the citizen. But in many respects this universality
                expresses itself as a need for a larger perspective toward civic
                issues. The city is not only the individual’s first social
                “investment”; it is his or her most intimate social environment.
                Owing to its vital immediacy,
                the city remains (as it has throughout history) the most direct
                arena in which the individual can act as a truly social being and
                from which he or she can attain the most immediate social
                solutions to the broader problems that beleaguer the
                privatized self. Insofar as the individual’s self-definition as an
                empowered person and citizen is even possible today, the civic
                terrain on all its levels must be regained by its constituents and
                reconstituted in new ways to render people socially
                operational. Civic reempowerment of the citizen thus becomes
                a personal issue as well as a social one. It Is equivalent to
                regaining one’s private selfhood as well as one’s public
36 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                selfhood, one’s personality as well as one’s citizenship.
                To attain such reempowerment and self-reconstitution has its
                presuppositions. So much of civic participation and civic-
                mindedness has been lost in this century, particularly its latter
                half, that we will have to probe deeply into the buried history of
                the city and of Citizenship for reference points by which to
                understand where we Stand in the swirl of urbanization that
                surrounds us.
                We will want to know what the concepts of “city” and
                “citizenship” really mean—not simply as ideal definitions but
                as fecund ecological processes that reveal the growth of
                communities and the individuals who people them—indeed,
                that turn them into a genuine public sphere and a vital body
                politic. It is painfully characteristic of our present-day myopia
                that these very words, public Nphere and body politic, have
                simply dropped out of our social vocabulary. When we use
                them at all, we rarely seem to understand what they mean or
                at least meant to earlier civilizations in which we claim to have
                our civic and social roots. They have been supplanted by such
                terms as “electorate” and, of course, “taxpayers” and
                “constituents”—administrative terms that denature the
                concepts of politics and community by definition.
                It also behooves us to examine the kind of institutions cities
                have created to foster citizenship and public empowerment. A
                romarkable number of conflicting institutional issues clustered
                around the city as it meandered its way through different
                historical forms: decentralization versus centralization, direct
                democracy versus representative republicanism, assemblies of
37 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the people versus councils of deputies, recall and rotation of
                public officials versus lengthy tenure in office and professional
                fixidity. popular management of social affairs versus
                bureaucratic control and manipulation. These issues have
                exploded repeatedly, from ancient times to the present, into
                bitter civic conflicts. They persist in our very midst under the
                rubric of “reform” movement to alter city charters and most
                recently as neighborhood movements to establish “grass-
                roots” democracy.
                We will want to know how the high ideals of a free citizenry with
                a sense of place in a cherished natural environment were
                variously realized and lost, often to be regained for limited
                periods of time in the same area or in other parts of the world.
                We will have to ask how “communal liberty” (to use Benjamin
                Barber s phrase) has fared with the fortunes of the citizenry
                and how each interacted with the other, for neither the city’s
                forms of freedom nor the citizen can be isolated from each
                other without doing violence to the meaning of both. That
                urbanization eventually separated from citification to take on a
                life of its own and ravage the city and countryside, ecological
                as well as agricultural alike will be an abiding theme in all we
                shall have to explore. This separation begins with the massive
                institutional, technological, and social changes that eventually
                dispossessed the citizen of his or her place in the city’s
                decision-making processes. Urbanization, in effect, both
                presupposes and later promotes the reduction of the. citizen to
                a “taxpayer,” “constituent,” or part of an “electorate.” We shall
                see that urbanization yields not only a drastic colonization of
                the countryside but also of the city’s and the citizen s very self-

                identity. Like the modern market, which has invaded every
                sphere of personal life, we shall find that urbanization has
                swept before it all the civic as well as agrarian institutions that
                provided even a modicum of autonomy to the individual. Born
                of the city, urbanization has been its parent’s most effective
                assailant, not to speak of the agrarian world that it has almost
                completely undone.
                It will be important to see the extent to which presumably
                nonurban institutions, often remotely tribal in origin and rooted
                in a more naturalistic society, became integral features of the
                democratic city in the form of popular assemblies,
                neighborhood councils, and the town meetings so redolent of
                an active municipalism and citizenship in our own day.
                Ironically, the same can be said for feudal, theocratic, and
                monarchical institutions, with the castle, temple, and palace as
                their centers. Indeed, we need go no further, if we choose, than
                the American and French revolutions to find that popular
                assemblies under different names have been the principal
                means by which ordinary people fought out the issues of
                justice and freedom with nobles, monarchs, and centralized
                nation-states. Each opposing camp has fought with the other
                for civic and ultimately social sovereignty. The current legalistic
                image of the city as a “creature” of the state is not an
                expression of contempt. It is an expression of fear, of careful
                deliberation in a purposive effort to subdue popular,
                democracy. That the term has been codified into laws, even in
                self-professed “democracies,” expresses a dread of a
                menacing civic or municipal incubus in every centralized social
                system, one that has always threatened to dismember

                centralized power as such and restore the control of society to
                a public that has been cruelly dispossessed of its very identity..
                History is an all-important vehicle in our enterprise, the
                counterpart of evolution in an ecological approach. The
                “powers-that-be” live in a compulsive fear of remembrance, a
                fear of humanity’s social memory of past institutions, cultures,
                and the search for origins. An essential theme of George
                Orwell’s 1984 is the effort by a highly totalitarian state to
                eliminate the sense of contrast earlier lifeways imposed as a
                challenge to existing ones. Thinking itself had to be
                restructured to exclude this challenge by using words—
                Orwell’s famous “Newspeak”—that attenuated their previous
                wealth of meaning and the disquieting alternatives that the
                past posed to a fixed, eternalized, and ahistorical “now” or
                commitment to “nowness.” Previously, authority had rested on
                tradition, often in a highly distorted form; today, it rests oil
                conditioning, with no regard to a troubling past.
                The purpose of Orwell’s “Newspeak” Was to change thinking
                by “the invention of new words and by stripping such words as
                remained of unorthodox meanings, and insofar as possible of
                all meanings whatever,” Words such, as “free,” Orwell tells us,
                still existed in “Newspeak” but not “in its old sense of‘politically
                free’ or ‘intellectually free,’ since political and intellectual
                freedom no longer existed even as concepts and were
                therefore of necessity nameless.”{1} One could only use the
                word “free” in a strictly functional, amoral, and technical sense,
                such as in the statement “This dog is free from lice” or “This
                field is free from weeds.” “Newspeak was designed not to
                extend but diminish the range of thought” by a process of
40 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                abbreviation—by rendering concepts more functional than
                moral in nature and by dememorizing thought (if I may coin a
                phrase) that was designed to uproot the mind from a sense of
                continuity and contrast with a challenging past.
                The Rise of Urbanization and Decline of Citizenship makes no
                compromises with an emphasis on “nowness” and the
                cybernetic language of electronic circuitry that is so
                fashionable today. The pages that follow are thoroughly
                infused with history and its moral meaning, and with language
                that is rich in secondary meanings. The reader will find no
                words like “feedback,” “input,” “output,” and “bottom lines,”
                which are currently used as substitutes for processual and
                thought-laden terms such as dialogue, origins, “explanations,”
                “judgements,” and “conclusions.” I have been at pains to
                emphasize my use of history and traditional language for a
                very distinct reason. This book deals with cities and citizenship
                —traditionally, the shared fate that confronts “town and
                country” in the modern era—and the impact of urbanization
                upon personality, freedom, and humanity’s sensitivity to
                nature. But it is also a book about morality and ethics. My
                concern with the way people commune—that is, actively
                associate with each other, not merely form communities—is an
                ethical concern of the highest priority in this work. I am
                concerned with the “social compacts” people form as ethical
                beings and the institutions they create to embody their ethical
                goals.
                To a great extent, this is the Greek, more precisely, the
                Athenian, ideal of civicism, citizenship, and politics, an ideal,
                that has surfaced repeatedly throughout history. I believe this
41 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                ideal forms a crucial challenge—despite its many limitations for
                the modern era. I propose to explore not only the ills of
                urbanization insofar as they have subverted town and country
                (including the natural environment), alike, but to explore the
                social and cultural conditions that gave rise to communities,
                citizens, and a politics whose high regard for personal activism
                has always made community the richest and most fulfilling
                expression of our humanity.
                Chapter Two: From Tribe to City
                Conventional accounts of the city’s origins tend today to be
                stridently technological: they anchor the emergence of the city
                in the discovery of food cultivation, particularly its highly
                productive form of animal-powered agriculture. The city, it is
                assumed, appeared because of the large food surpluses
                farming folk could provide with the Neolithic technological
                innovations that marked the cultivation of the land. With this
                new material plentitude at their disposal, we are told, people
                began to detach themselves from agricultural pursuits and
                develop their skills as potters, weavers, metallurgists,
                carpenters, jewelers, and masons, not to speak of
                administrators, priests, soldiers, and artists. As agrarian
                villages increased in size and density, they are said to have
                reached a “critical mass”—often of undefinable size—that
                apparently qualified them to be called “cities.” Generally, we
                tend to regard the city itself as a sharp economic breach with
                the countryside, marked by a typically urban development of
                crafts, administration, and, to use a grossly denatured word,
                “politics.” This new, largely nonagrarian ensemble of activities
42 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                produced what we like to call “civilization”: a literate world,
                culturally “enlightened,” presumably more rational
                institutionally and technologically than the agrarian, society on
                which, it relied—in short, what the distinguished Marxian
                archaeologist, V. Gordon Childe, called the “urban revolution/’
                This conventional image of the city’s origins projects a highly
                modern view, largely ecbnomistic and progressivistic, onto the
                past. It assumes that because we are primarily, economic
                beings whose civic activities are deeply rboted in industrial,
                commercial, and service occupations, our urban “forebearers”
                gathered in towns and cities to follow similar pursuits. They,
                too, we tend to believe, conceived of the city as an economic
                enterprise, massively committed to nonagrarian tasks. We are
                prepared to concede that in a more “barbarous” era early city
                dwellers were also preoccupied with their safety or defense
                from rival cities or pastoral nomads. Hence, they congregated
                in great numbers behind defensive palisades and fortified
                walls. While defensive concerns might account in part for early
                urban density, they too were a function of economic concerns
                in modern eyes, just as we, today, assign economic
                motivations to what we also call defense by nation-states and
                imperialistic blocs. Thus we assume that our urban
                “forebearers” were very much like us. They were economic
                beings who were busily engaged in the pursuit of their material
                interests within the fixed confines of a structural and territorial
                entity called the “city.”
                With equal alacrity we assume that just as they shared our
                economic lifeways (albeit in a more rudimentary fashion), they
                also shared our civic attitudes. Although we are likely to
43 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                concede that their sense of communal loyalties was stronger
                than ours, we often believe that they judged their cities with a
                shared viewpoint like ours. However exotic many of their civic
                institutions seem in the light of our own, we tend to believe
                that their notion of citizenship was essentially as self-serving
                and self-interested as our own. They participated in civic affairs
                to the degree that their material interests were involved, and
                essentially their interests were no less economic than our own.
                Unwittingly, we subject their civic-mindedness as well as their
                “civilization to the very economistic class analyses we profess
                to reject in the name of our “higher ideals” and “morals,”
                however much these are honored in the breach.
                This view is greatly reinforced by the historical literature at our
                disposal. Athens, we are reminded, had its demos; Home, its
                plebs; the medieval commune, its popolo, just as we have our
                proletariat and lower middle classes who live in gnawing envy
                or hatred of their aristocratic and bourgeois elites. We are
                reminded that such Lorms as “ancient,” “medieval,” and
                “modern” should not impel 118 to greatly distinguish the
                unalterable content of human nature, that human beings will
                seek to satisfy their egoistic impulses despite all their
                ideological avowals to the contrary. This excursion Into an
                unvarying psyche that lies at the core of human behavior
                defines the city dweller—particularly the citizen—with the
                same modern attributes that define our contemporary
                metropolitan dwellers. Hence, we comfortably sit back before
                the vast tableau of urban historical development with a sense
                of self-assurance that Our contemporary ills are as ancestral
                and incorrigibly “human” as our biological attributes and
44 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                pathologies. They belong to us as assuredly as the human
                brain, human fingers, and ingrained human psychological
                traits that our species shares with its ancestors and with its
                heirs.
                If the city provides any evidence of human association and the
                immutability of human behavior, a serious account of its rise
                and development in no way supports this simplistic and
                conventional Imagery. It would be difficult to find one all-
                embracing reason that oxplains the emergence of a settled
                human collectivity such as a village, much less a population of
                thousands that we would expect to find in a city. The earliest
                cities archaeologists have unearthed do not seem to have
                been based on advanced forms of food cultivation, notably
                animal r powered plow agriculture, a point that Jane Jacobs has
                so ably highlighted in her book The Economy of Cities.
                Although it is doubtful that an “urban revolution” gave rise to
                an “agricultural revolution,” as Jacobs seems to contend,
                strong evidence exists that such very early cities as Çatal
                Hüyük in Anatolia and Jericho of Biblical fame may have
                consisted of sizable communities that acquired much, perhaps
                most, of their food from the hunting of game and the
                harvesting of undomesticated plants. Much plants as were
                domesticated seem to have been recent achievements of
                people who were harvesters of wild wheat varieties rather than
                experienced food cultivators. Bones of aurochs—the extinct
                ancestors of modern cattle—as well as those of wild deer,
                boars, asses, geese, and the skeletal remains of such predators
                as wolves, foxes, and leopards, suggest a “citified population of
                hunters and gatherers whose arts of gardening were of recent

                origin. By conventional standards, this economic tableau does
                not comfortably explain why a city such as Çatal, with an
                estimated population of at least 6,000 people occupying some
                30 acres, should have been able to flourish on two nearby sites
                9,000 years ago, many millennia before Mesopotamia became
                the region for Childe’s celebrated “urban revolution.”
                If Çatal Hüyük is to be accorded a major place m the origins o
                the city, the reason for its existence—indeed, for its
                persistence for centuries—seems primarily to have been
                religious. Although the city was close to a rich source of
                obsidian that was almost certain y bartered for a wide variety
                of nonindigenous foods it is most conspicuous for its large
                number of religious shrines. James Melaart, who has provided
                us with detailed and richly interpretive studies of the city,
                found no less than 40 shrines among the 139 buildings he
                examined. These shrines were generally larger than the
                surrounding houses and decorated with elaborate religious
                artwork, paintings on opposing walls that symbolized death in
                one case and life in another...
                Mellaart found no pottery in Çatal Hüyük—one of the principal
                hallmarks of Neolithic culture that, together with plow
                agriculture and domesticated animals, would normally be
                associated with a compact city of thousands. The thick walls of
                Çatal, its pueblolike houses, its small plazas, and its ornate
                artwork so visible to the public suggest an intensely vivid
                religious fife that is equally suggestive of an intensely active
                civic life. Its tool kit and higly naturalistic artistry suggest an
                ecologically oriented community of late Paleolithic hunters and
                gatherers rather than an early neolithic community of food

                cultivators. The culture is marked by a very sophisticated stone
                and bone technics, by markedly collective dwellings adorned
                with images of animals and shamanlike figures amidst
                paintings of reindeer, leopards, and bow-carrying hunters. If we
                are to judge by the considerable amount of comment Çatal has
                elicited—owing partly to Mellaart’s own interpretations—the
                occupants of the city were strikingly matricentric in their
                orientation. Women figure highly in the symbolism of the city’s
                cults. The Mother Goddess is the most conspicuous figurine
                that we find among the city’s statuettes, and careful attention
                seems to have been given to the internment of women and
                infants in joint graves, presumably mothers and their children,
                a feature that is absent in male burials. Nor do hierarchy and
                warfare seem to be features of the city’s social life. Judging
                from the size of Çatal’s dwellings and the implements found in
                burial remains, the city was fairly egalitarian despite minor
                differences that are observable. There are no “obvious signs of
                violence or deliberate signs of destruction,” Mellaart observes
                for the original city and its nearby successor, both of which
                were simply abandoned for no apparent reason after centuries
                of occupancy.{2} Cases of violent death among the hundreds
                of skeletons examined on the sites are notable for their
                absence.
                If the emergence of a city as large as Çatal Hüyük cannot be
                explained by a high degree of technical development or by
                warfare, it is interesting to note that an unknown people,
                already familiar with the arts of planting, harvesting, and
                milling grains, did not form any kind of permanent settlements
                on fertile soil as early as 18,000 years ago, when ice sheets still

                covered vast portions of the European continent. Evidence of
                food cultivators has been found quite recently adjacent to the
                Nile River at Wadi Kubbaniya in upper Egypt. They were
                planting wheat, barley, lentils, and chickpeas at a time when
                Magdelenian hunters were still wandering over the European
                tundra of Spain and France, leaving behind their celebrated
                wall paintings of animals in remote cave sites. The Wadi
                Kubbaniya people were not Neolithic farmers, although by
                every precept of technological or economic determinism they
                should have been. Their “diversified agriculture did not lead
                directly to the beginnings of village life,” observed Fred
                Wendrof, Romauld Schild, and Angela E. Chase, who unearthed
                the remains of these early food cultivators. “Probably people
                continued their wandering ways as hunters and gatherers for
                thousands of years more. Farming was just one more resource
                in a broad-based way of life. These conclusions raise anew the
                question of why civilization emerged.”{3}
                In fact, it is fair to say that both the Çatal Hüyük and Wadi
                Kubbaniya peoples, who may not have been particularly
                exceptional, raise the question, Why did “civilization” (more
                precisely, the drastic change from hunting and gathering to
                food cultivation and civic social relationships) emerge at all?
                This question seems shrouded in mystery because the
                changeover from one cultural form to another seems to be
                more drastic than it actually was. What Çatal Hüyük and the
                earliest food cultivators tell us is that the transition from tribe
                to village and city was not the predictable result, as
                archaeological orthodoxy would have it, of technological
                change or, as more recent theories would claim, of population
48 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                pressure, war, or other drastic environmental pressures that
                might have produced hunger on a large scale. In short, the
                transition from tribe to city was not the necessary result of
                economists relationships that our Euro-American minds foist
                upon prehistory and history; nor was the transition, when it
                occurred, as deliciously complete and sharply delineated with
                polarities of a war between town and country as theoretical
                orthodoxy would have us believe.
                Conversely, hunting and food-gathering peoples, who by all
                conventional standards of archaeology seem to have lacked
                the “economic base” for an urban society, actually formed
                sizable cities and initially used a technics more akin to late
                Paleolithic lifeways than Neolithic. As the anthropologists who
                studied the Wadi Kubbaniya sites conclude, “There does not, in
                fact, seem to be any single ‘cause’ for the beginnings of
                agriculture [and we may reasonably add, the city]. It may well
                have begun as a natural interaction between early peoples and
                the plant species they came to exploit regularly. It probably
                happened many times in the past, whenever Paleolithic
                peoples made extensive and sustained use of plant resources.
                It is important in this instance because the plants used [by the
                Wadi Kubbaniya people] were cereals, and these cereals
                provided the economic base for the development of our
                civilization. The rise of agriculture, however, did not lead
                rapidly or inevitably to identifiable social or economic change.
                It simply provided another resource in a broadly based hunting,
                fishing, and gathering economy.”{4} I find this conclusion, with
                its wayward suggestions and its shades of heterodoxy, all the
                more tantalizing because its authors do, in fact, use the
49 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                conceptual framework and terminology of traditional
                archaeology with its recourse to such words as economic base,
                resource, and exploit.
                Which is not to say that cities congeal out of mere mist. Clearly
                a city requires a tangible food supply, one that is sufficiently
                plentiful to support such nonagrarian strata as artisans,
                administrators, and shamanlike priests to perform their
                specialties. If the remains of Çatal Hüyük and the Wadi
                Kubbaniya cereal farmers suggest anything, however, it is that
                early cities formed to meet cultural rather than strictly
                economic or defensive needs. The shrines so evident at Çatal
                suggest that the population of the city was committed to the
                performance of religious rituals, that cultic and priestly
                functions do more to explain why this city arose in Anatolia
                many millennia ago than do economic or military functions.
                Paleolithic lifeways; richly elaborated by time and
                environmental changes, may have been more tenacious than
                we have supposed them to be. They may have been more
                attractive to tribal peoples, even many self-anointed “civilized”
                ones, or, at least, more deeply rooted in the long evolution of
                human culture.
                If this conclusion is sound, the urban and agricultural
                “revolutions” so closely associated in the archaeological
                literature with the rise of urban culture do not form an elegant
                fit by modern standards. The rise of cities may have had more
                to do with shrines, cultic practices, and temples rich in
                naturalistic symbols than with the “discovery” of cereal
                cultivation, plows, and domesticated animals. Not that the city
                gave rise to these agrarian basics, as Jane Jacobs seems to
50 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                suggest. Apparently, agriculture in a simple form was known to
                hunters and food gatherers long before villages began to dot
                the landscape that phased from the Paleolithic into the
                Neolithic. But the shrine, later enclosed by a temple, may have
                been more authentically a harbinger of the city than the plow,
                and a quasireligious figure such as the shaman or priest may
                have been an earlier civic leader than the politically astute
                chief. By the same tokeri, the earliest “citizen” may have
                assumed his or her civic functions as a member of a
                congregation rather than, as a “resident” of an urban district.
                The earliest civic center, in effect, may have been a ceremonial
                area rather than a marketplace, a center for the worship of
                natural deities and forces.
                If this background accurately portrays the factors that gave
                rise to the city and the functions of its residents, it highlights
                many features of early city life that contradict modern
                economistic biases about urbanism, notably contemporary
                ones that visualize the city as a business enterprise and its
                concerns as primarily fiscal or commercial. Despite the highly
                sophisticated crafts that appear in cities as differently situated
                in time from our own cities as Çatal Hüyük, there is no evidence
                of the existence of an internal market within the community
                itself, and certainly very little beyond local barter. A
                considerable amount of trade may have developed between
                cities or between a city and an essentially tribal community.
                But trade inside the city itself was minimal or, at least,
                marginal. To summarily repeat Karl Polanyi’s rich probing into
                what he was to call “the anonymity of the economy in early
                society” and his compelling demolition of the view that the
51 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                market was necessarily the decisive element in the founding of
                the city would exhibit a lack of appreciation for the
                thoroughness and elegance of his analysis.{5} Indeed,
                according to Polanyi, no domestic marketplace appears in early
                cities until Hellenic times, when the Athenian agora became a
                modest center for exchanges of goods as well as intense civic
                activity. Even so, Aristotle was to regard moneymaking as an
                “unnatural” urge that required public control and self-restraint.
                What early city dwellers actually exchanged with each other
                were services. More precisely, men and women cojointly
                contributed their share to the common fund of material goods.
                It was this shared pool of the means of life that constituted the
                economic life” of tribal communities and early cities. People
                contributed, in effect, their skills in growing food, in working
                wool and flax, in crafting metals and stone, and, by no means
                of least importance, their artistic and decorative talents in
                bejeweling and designing artifacts for deities, priests, and
                members of their own community.
                “Postulates” of “self-sufficiency” and the distinction between
                “natural and unnatural trade” are not strictly archaic. We find
                them most self-consciously and philosophically stated in
                Greece. But prior to the full flowering of the Hellenic polis,
                material life in cities was deeply embedded in the blood ties,
                religious obligations, mutual loyalties, magical techniques, and
                the intensely naturalistic sensibilities of the tribal world. Guided
                more by custom than rationally vdiced strictures, these form
                the psychological setting and institutional carryovers for the
                more rationalistic civilization we later find in the Greek
                archipelago. This unconscious tribal and mutualistic substrate
52 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                of obligation and association was, in fact, more forceful as a
                guide for human behavior than its formulation into a
                sophisticated civic and political philosophy or social theory.
                In the so-called “primitive” or archaic worlds, more than food
                entered the “common pool,” Possibly, all things short of one’s
                closest possessions, including aspects of one’s very identity,
                had a highly collective aura that destined them to be shared or
                to be used communally. Initially, if the city had a pronounced
                function at all, it was a religious one. The strong emphasis that
                many anthropologists now place on political and centralized
                governmental forms as institutions for efficiently redistributing
                produce from ecologically different areas may be overstated.
                That great imperial systems, such as those of the Incas, Aztecs,
                Babylonians, Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese, were centers
                for collecting and redistributing a great variety of goods from
                highly diverse and distant ecological regions can hardly be
                faulted as a reality. Indeed, by imperial times many ancient
                cities were as conspicuous for their warehouses as they were
                for their temples and palaces.
                But such an emphasis on material function, like the highly
                deterministic strategies to explain the existence of every
                community within our purview, betrays a very modern bias. It
                reveals a proclivity, almost an unthinking compulsion, to assign
                a “material role” to every phenomenon, particularly every
                institution and form of association, that exists in the past as
                well as the present. Worse, it crudely downgrades the richly
                associative role played by material things such as gifts, which
                serve to foster a much deeper human attribute: the need to be
                grounded in community, to enjoy shared sensibilities that are
53 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                spiritually supportive and without which authentic individuality
                is chimerical. Human personality, which is nurtured by parental
                care, kinship ties, friendship, and the assurance or security
                provided by personal support systems, becomes a material
                thing—a manipulatable object among many other objects and
                commodities—precisely when its immaterial support systems
                are subverted and its traits reified. Quite an opposite case can
                be made for the belief, so widely promoted by contemporary
                “cultural materialists,” that chiefdoms, monarchies,
                bureaucracies, armies, clerical hierarchies, and the unlimited
                investment they required were distributive agencies and
                processes that served humanity’s “needs,” mythic or real. It
                could be more validly shown that they reflected a mania for
                domination that created mythic “needs” and systems of
                control on a scale so harmful to the communities they were
                pledged to service that they and their legacy of waste,
                destruction, and cruelty now threaten the very : existence of
                society and its natural fundament, Indeed the domination of
                nature was to have its roots in the domination of human by
                human such that a credo of domination was to embrace the
                planet.
                But an important caveat must be voiced here when we speak
                of a mania for domination that can so facilely be used to color
                our image of the early, essentially temple, cities at the dawn of
                civic life. By no means is it clear that the sacerdotal hierarchies
                that emerged in these cities from Erech in Mesopotamia to
                Teobhuacan in Mexico immediately led to a hierarchical
                restructuring of the fairly egalitarian tribal or village peoples on
                whom they depended—peoples who built their monuments,
54 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                often massive in size; who created their plazas, dwellings, and
                altars; who filled their temple storehouses, erected their walls,
                and shaped the sculptures that dazzle the modern eye. That
                such vast efforts with their enormous mobilizations of labor
                could have been made for purposes that seem so “profitless”
                and “useless” by present-day urban standards without
                coercion of the most authoritarian kind seems unthinkable at
                first glance—so much, in fact, that all early temples and
                mortuaries are normally regarded as the work of savagely
                coercive rulers and brutal tyrants.
                But if this imagery is certainly true well into history, we have no
                reason to believe that it reflects the social relationships that
                gave us our earliest cities and their cultic structures at the
                dawn of history. I have described elsewhere, in great detail,
                how an egalitarian society may have slowly phased into an
                increasingly hierarchical one-initially theocratic, ultimately
                feudal, and finally monarchical.[1] Here, I would like to
                emphasize that the earliest cities were largely ideological
                creations of highly complex, strongly affiliated, and intensely
                mutualstic communities of kin groups, ecological in outlook
                and essentially egalitarian and nondomineering in character.
                We do not know if a sizable city like Çatal Hüyük, which dates
                back 9,000 years, or a hugely monumental city like
                Teotihuacan, which was slowly erected around 300 B.c. and
                ceased to be occupied around 800 A.D., were originally
                constructed by forcibly “mobilizing” large numbers of
                “oppressed” villagers in surrounding communities or,
                surprising as it may seem, whether they were voluntary
                enterprises undertaken by devout “parishioners” who viewed
55 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                their civic responsibilities as a sort of “calling.” We assume that
                a coercive strategy was followed by oppressive elites at the
                inception of city life because we read our literary accounts of
                Mesopotamian and Egyptian forced labor back into city
                lifeways in a misty preliterate era. It is easy to. overlook the
                fact that any literary tradition of urban, life, even the very early
                Gilgamesh epic that dates back to the beginnings of
                Mesopotamian city life, is already evidence of a technically
                advanced, often coercive, society. Çatal Hüyük, Jericho, Erech,
                Teotihuacan, Monte Alban, and Tikal, to cite cities far-removed
                from modern urban development in the cultured areas of the
                Near East and the Americas, are mysteries to us that we try to
                dispel with our own motivations and social interests. Yet their
                archaeological remains are rich with the evidence of
                ideological aspirations and human relationships that were
                fundamentally different from our own secular ones—cultic and
                communal sensibilities that viewed “the city” (if such a word
                can be used indiscriminately to encompass all sizable human
                settlements) as a monument to lifeways and sentiments that
                were basically different from our own. Possibly, the ordinary
                people who reared the monuments in the earliest of these
                cities were closer in their outlook to the medieval artisans who
                often willingly gave of their time and skills to slowly erect over
                generations the great cathedrals of Europe. In either case, they
                speak to a dedication that stands in marked contrast to the
                mentality of the engineers and construction crews who are
                seeding the modern world with high-rise residential and office
                structures in urban areas of every continent.
                We are confronted, too, with the differences between early and

                modern conceptions of “citizenship.” How did ancestral
                “citizens” of the first cities view themselves? In what sense
                were they different from us—or similar to us? By asking these
                questions, we encounter a problem that lacks the degree of
                completeness and fixity that we find in a physical structure
                such as the remains of a temple or palace. Citizenship, as we
                shall see, is a process, not a reality that is reducible to a
                concise, single-line definition. It does not leap into being from a
                vacuum, surrounded by streets for personal display, buildings
                into which the sovereign individual can retreat, and dense
                populations that foster personal intercourse. Çatal Hüyük, in
                fact, had no streets at all, to cite an intriguing feature of the
                city. A pueblolike city, it had small squares but no open byways.
                It lacked the streets that such modernists as Marshall Berman
                and Richard Sennett regard as the structural essence of
                urbanism, particularly in the form of wide boulevards in which
                the monadic ego of our time can display itself in dandylike
                fashion and assert its “individuality.” One moved from one part
                of Çatal to another over rooftops, ascending or descending
                ladders, entering into the recesses of dwellings and crossing
                small squares.
                This is a significant personal fact, not merely a structural
                eccentricity. Çatal Hüyük must have been a highly collective
                community. It was intensely peopled—more like a tribe than
                what we, today, would call a city. Yet even by modern
                standards of urbanism such as size and density, it was a town,
                not a village. From a historical perspective, given time and
                place, it was even an immense city if archaeological
                calculations of its populations are remotely correct. What does

                this tableau mean? In what sense were its men and women
                “urban”? We can surmise that they were not mere “residents”
                of the city or the ancestral members of modern-day
                “constituencies.” They were not burdened by the anonymity
                and awesome sense of personal isolation that is the most
                characteristic trait of the modern urban dweller. In some sense,
                they were “protocitizens” of a highly articulated and richly
                textured community in which a high sense of collectivity,
                nourished by such organic facts as kinship ties and a sexual
                division of labor, was integrated with the civic facts of
                politically defined rights and duties. They were communities in
                transition between the biological realities of the tribal world,
                rooted in blood ties, gender, and age groups, and the political
                realities of the urban world, rooted in residential propinquity,
                vocational mobility, and legal prerogatives. Early cities
                probably did not contain citizens in the sense of self-
                empowered individuals ethically united by ideals of civic virtue,
                rational in their social policies, and completely free to
                participate through discourse and practice in the management
                of their cities—in short, those attributes that Greek social
                thinkers were to call phronesis, the practical reason involved in
                creating and managing a community. All the evidence we have
                of these protocitizens suggests that their power for social
                action was largely controlled by obligations to kin groups and
                theocrats, their ideals guided more by faith than reason, their
                sense of virtue more pragmatic than ethical, and their social
                institutions more biologically derivative than cultural in
                character.
                Yet these seemingly uncivic features provided a crucially
58 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                important matrix for what was to grow into the highly
                sophisticated classical notion of the “citizen.” If social
                empowerment seemed to derive more from such group
                attributes as the family or the clan than from personal
                attributes, the individual living in these cities enjoyed a real
                sense of power as such, not a body of conferred rights that
                were more formal and juridical than substantive. Tribal
                societies are known that exhibit a high degree of respect for
                individual uniqueness and free will, however much custom and
                public opinion seem to place limits on personal behavior. One
                cannot simultaneously deny the existence of primitive
                individuality while acknowledging the existence of a fairly
                spontaneous ego and considerable self-assertion among, say,
                certain hunting and gathering communities such as the
                pygmies of the Ituri Forest who include outrageously boastful
                men and extremely shrewd women. By their marked presence,
                such personal traits as boastfulness and shrewdness, indeed
                humor, gaeity, and reflectiveness, frankly contradict the
                conventional image of preliterate peoples as divested of ego
                and personality, the modern claim to individuality. The
                contemporary neurotic notion of personality may not have
                been as common among so-called primitives as it is today in
                the metropolitan areas of Europe and America, although by no
                means is it absent. But individuality certainly exists among
                remaining preliterate communities, albeit in a different form
                and faced by more overt constraints than our own, notably
                where the rules of the game are fairly explicit and mutualistic
                in contrast to our modern, highly engineered society, which
                bombastically celebrates its formal “freedoms” and tries to
                ignore its lack of social concern.

                Surprisingly, citizenship and the political forms that foster it
                would be difficult to explain without looking precisely at those
                primal organic institutions—particularly clanlike relationships,
                popular assemblies or the various councils that spin off from
                them, and the egalitarian outlook, in sum, the tribalism—that
                the city, in the conventional wisdom of the recent past, was
                supposedly designed to overcome. Rousseau was to pithily
                observe that “houses make a town but citizens make a
                city.”{6} Yet he would have been no less surprised than all the
                major social theorists of his day to learn that the most
                important attributes, of citizenship derive more directly from
                the tribal world than the village world, from rude shelters
                rather than houses. Houses may make towns, even huge
                urban belts that subvert the conditions for an active,
                participatory body politic, but simple huts and tents—the
                “primitive” dwellings of hunting, gathering, and pastoral
                peoples^—provided the homes for institutions and social
                types that often embodied the civic ideals we associate with
                citizenship.
                Notions of human scale—of communities that are modest in
                size and comprehensible politically and logistically to their
                residents are distinctly tribalistic in character and origin. They
                are formed from the idiom of a civic mentality that is rooted in
                familial loyalties and’extended kinship relationships. Not
                surprisingly, many early cities, insofar as they leave any
                written account that is open to us, are. “founded” entities.
                Their “ancestry” originates in a shared deity or a delineative
                progenitor with some kind of personal embodiment. The Sons
                of Aeneas, the Trojan hero who “founded” Rome in the city’s
60 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                urban mythology, are no different in principle than the Children
                of Israel and the Biblical Jacob who was the patriarchal
                ancestor of the Hebrew tribes. The word “citizen,” in fact,
                appears sporadically, or late in the history of cities. Quite
                commonly, the “citizens” of a community denoted themselves
                as “brothers,” a term in widespread use throughout the Middle
                Ages and early Renaissance. Men and women in the towns and
                cities of the past visualized their relationships in terms of
                familial connections. As “strangers” began to form the majority
                of urban dwellers in late classical and medieval cities, this
                familial imagery with its emphasis on smallness of scale,
                accessibility of person, and close-knit support systems of the
                kind we associate
                With “humanly scaled” communities became the outlook and
                prerogative of urban elites, notably the municipal aristocrats
                and! nobles who staked out a real or legendary claim to the
                city’s “founder.” Ultimately, the newer, dwellers of the city, too,
                formed their own “brotherhoods” in which ties, rights, arid
                duties were solemnized by blood oaths and kinshiplike rituals.
                In time, the word “brother” became an ecumenical form of
                civic address and affiliation, spanning class ties and interests.
                The civic institutions that we most commonly associate with a
                “participatory democracy” often reach back in almost
                unbroken continuity to tribal assembles. It is fairly certain that
                face-to-face assemblies of the people in ancient cities were
                often the keystone of the civic institutional arch and extensions
                of tribal assemblages with their remote origins in primitive
                egalitarian relationships. So, 100, the notions of consensus
                where it existed, prolonged discourse with its goal of arriving at
61 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                a commonality of views, and a sense of agreement were
                pronounced features of such a radical political (lomocracy. By
                contrast, councils, the representative organs of assemblies,
                patently originate in the smaller assemblies of elders, chiefs,
                and warriors. As contractions of the popular assembly—the
                “voice of the people” as distinguished from the people
                themselves—they are ubiquitous features of a tribalistic view
                of the reduced assembly projected into republican concepts of
                self-governance.
                Yet here, too, I must add a caveat that initially seems to break
                the continuity of the development from tribe to city. The city
                may continue the traditions of the tribe institutionally into a
                rich skein of participatory, indeed ecological relationships, but
                it also constitutes its antithesis biologically. The city is the
                perpetuator of the kin group insofar as the latter is a parochial
                expression of blood ties I hut exclude the stranger—the
                outsider—who cannot claim a common ancestry with the
                brothers and sisters. Tribalism is equatable with familial
                exclusivity, not only familial solidarity. The distinction between
                exclusivity and solidarity is crucial here. Whether He live or
                real, tribalism has its universal solvent in blood, the medium
                that accords equality or isonomia (to use the Hellenic term) to
                its members. Theoretically, one does not join a tribe; one is
                born into it or, at most, adopted by it because of the services it
                requires. Adoption involves elaborate rituals that transform the
                outsider into an insider—an “inorganic” being, to use Marx’s
                formulation, into an “organic” part of the community.
                The city breaks this biological spell, with its ecological aura,
                however fictive it may be in reality. It exorcises the blood oath
62 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                from the family with its parochial myths and its chauvinistic
                exclusivity, while retaining or reworking its concept of
                socialization. Paternity is given a high place in the civic
                firmament of values, but the fathers are slowly divested of
                their absolute powers over the sons—sons who are needed by
                the city to perform administrative and military services. The
                stranger is denied formal legal status in the city’s system of
                governance but is admitted into the magic circle of civic
                protection and solicitude, especially if bearing skills, wealth,
                and material resources.
                But the ecological aura remains as legend by hypostasizing the
                city’s founders, the ethnic continuity of its citizens, the status
                of its rulers, although reality enhances the hidden powers of
                the newer residents who can claim no tie to the civic
                progenitors. Hence, the city creates a special kind of social
                space. A projection of familial and tribal forms, the city
                subverts the authentic substance of the parochialism that
                flavors kinship ties with a mysterious inwardness and rescues
                tribal institutions as ecumenical forms of civic administration.
                The Greek democrat, Kleisthenes, is almost a symbol of these
                shrewed maneuvers, maneuvers by no means unique to the
                Athenian polis. To break the hold of family ties that obstructed
                the power of civic institutions, the citizenry was organized into
                territorial “wards,” but each “ward’ was felicitously called a
                “tribe.” The municipal space of Athens, in effect, was
                expanded to create a largely civic citizenry, unencumbered by
                the mindless tribal obligations and blood oaths that impeded
                the rights of the stranger but in a form that wore the symbols
                and enjoyed the prestige of tribal tradition. Indeed, one of the
63 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                great tasks of ecological thinking will be to develop an
                ecological civicism that restores the organic bonds of
                community without reverting to the archaic blood-tie at one
                extreme or the totalitarian “folk philosophy” of fascism at the
                other.
                Chapter Three: The Creation of Politics
                Politics has acquired a fairly odious reputation among the great
                majority of people today. The word seems to denote
                techniques for the unsavory end of exercising power over
                human beings. We “play politics” not only on an international
                national, and local scale; we do so in domestic relations, in
                schools and places of learning, in ordinary jobs or extraordinary
                careers. Politics, in effect, is seen to have invaded the most
                private recesses of our lives. At worst, it is viewed as
                oppressive, manipulative, cunningly seductive, and basically
                degrading. Few words more readily evoke a contemptuous
                sneer than the term “politician.” Conceived instrumentally as a
                means to control people, politics is regarded as inherently
                corruptive of both its user, the politician, and the public on
                whom it is used. The ideal of a political life earns few acolytes
                among people with any degree of moral probity. Traditional
                conservatives and anarchists alike identify it with the state and
                preach a message of the attenuation or outright abolition of
                “political power.” Liberals and socialists rarely celebrate
                politics as a desideratum, but they wed it so closely to the state
                —a necessity in modern liberal and socialist theory—that its
                practice is seen as unavoidable in a highly imperfect world.
                Modern social ideologies tend to blend politics with the state
64 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                almost unthinkingly—and often throw society into the brew for
                good measure. The confusion on this score is massive. Just as
                there are many people who, by virtue of the all-pervasive role
                the state plays in their private lives, draw no distinction
                between “government” and “society,” so an incalculable
                number are incapable of distinguishing between the state and
                “politics. These attitudes and they are often, little more—are
                justified today by ordinary experience, as we shall see. That
                the social, political, and “statified” are not synonymous,
                indeed, that they are broadly demarcatable arenas with
                histories and identities of their own, is so far removed from the
                public’s mind that to distinguish them seems paradoxical.[2]
                The equatability of political with state activities is taken as a
                given. The penetration of the two, normally conceived as one
                common phenomenon, into private affairs still encounters
                considerable resistance, although in the form of a
                psychological tension that finds expression in existential
                resistance such as petty violations of the law rather than
                ideological clarity.
                In recent years, however, serious attempts have been made to
                probe the distinction between “society” and politics, which has
                traditional roots in theoretical distinctions between, society
                and the state. The anarchists have been saying for years what
                everyone either knows or feels: the state is not the same kind
                of phenomenon as the family, workplace, fraternal and sororal
                groups, religious congregations, unions and professional
                societies, in short, the “private” world that individuals create or
                inherit to meet their personal and spiritual needs. This personal
                world can be designated as “social,” however much
65 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                “government” penetrates, regulates, or, in totalitarian states,
                absorbs its forms. It is a world that has deep roots in what Marx
                and later Hannah Arendt were to designate as the “realm of
                necessity,” a world where the individual satisfies the conditions
                for his or her personal survival. Here, biology provides the soil
                for a system of self-maintenance such that people have a
                culturally conditioned but systematic way of reproducing their
                kind, feeding and clothing themselves, satisfying their needs
                for shelter and the support systems for resisting an inclement,
                presumably “cruel, mute, and blind natural world.”
                To have sharpened the distinction between the social and the
                state is one of the major contributions of traditional anarchist
                theory. That there could be a political arena independent of the
                state and the social, however, was to elude most radical social
                thinkers, even so intense a political ‘thinker as Marx who
                allowed for “democratic” states that could “evolve” toward
                socialism and “Bonapartist” states that stood above and
                balanced off conflicting class interests. The reformist wing of
                Marxian socialism was by no means alone when it envisioned a
                pliable state that could be used for socialist interests. Its own
                “founding fathers’:’ were no less riddled with uncertainties
                about the nature of the state than the reformists are today.
                The emergence of the political realm as unique has a complex
                background in the history of ideas,. Politics as a phenomenon
                distinguishable from the state and from social life initially
                appears in the extant writings of Aristotle, perhaps the most
                Hellenic of the Greek social theorists and philosophers. With
                Aristotle we are still dealing in terms of human association on
                the level of the city, or to be more precise, the polis, which is

                commonly mistranslated as the “city-state!”. [3]
                By the middle of the fifth century B.C., when the Athenian
                democracy was approaching its high point of development, the
                concept of a state—of a professionalized bureaucratic
                apparatus for social control—was notable for its absence; Attic
                Greek contains no word for state. The term is Latin in origin,
                and its etymological roots are highly ambiguous. It more
                properly denotes a person’s condition in life—his or her status
                or way of life and “standing”—than a commonwealth or a state
                in the modern sense of the term. Not until the early sixteenth
                century, when we witness the rise of authentic nation-states
                and highly centralized monarchies, does the word come to
                mean a professional civil authority with the power to govern a
                “body politic.”
                There is a very real sense in which the evolution of the word
                broadly reflects the evolution of the state itself. Not that state
                powers were rarities in the ancient and medieval worlds. Eric
                Vogelin’s “cosmological” empires—Mesopotamian, Egyptian,
                Persian—and the more “ecumenical” Roman empire were
                certainly states in the sense that they controlled vast
                resources, dominated millions of people, and were structured
                along highly professional, rationalized, and bureaucratic lines.
                State institutions emerged very early in human history,
                although in varying degrees of development and stability,
                often in “bits and pieces,” as it were, with highly tribalistic
                features. The Pharaonic state in the Nile valley already reached
                back thousands of years, perhaps beyond the unification of
                northern and southern Egypt, long before the Roman empire
                had begun its long decline.

                Athens had a “state” in a very limited and piecemeal sense.
                Despite its governmental system for dealing with a sizable
                slave population, the “state” as we know it in modern times
                could hardly be said to exist among the Greeks, unless we are
                so reductionist as to view any system of authority and rule as
                statist. Such a view would grossly simplify the actual conditions
                under which humanity lived in the “civilized world.[4] Until
                recent times, professional systems of governance and violence
                coexisted with richly articulated community forms at the base
                of society—city neighborhoods in the world’s few large urban
                areas, self-contained towns and villages, a network of
                extended kinship ties, a great variety of vocational, mutual-aid,
                and fraternal groups—which were largely beyond the reach of
                centralized state authorities. In fact, these distinctly social
                formations were necessary to the maintenance of the state.
                They were sources of its revenues, its military personnel, and,
                in many cases, the source of many labor services for a great
                variety of public and religious tasks.
                The Athenian democracy, if anything, was the opposite of a
                professionalized system of governance organized strictly for
                social control. If we choose to translate the word for the
                Athenian polis as “state,” which is done with appalling
                promiscuity, we would have to assume that the notion of a
                state is consistent with a body politic of some forty thousand
                male citizens, admittedly an elite when placed against a still
                larger population of adult males possibly three times that
                number who were slaves and disenfranchised resident aliens.
                Yet the citizens of Athens could hardly be called a “class” in any
                meaningful sense of the term. Indeed, within this body politic,
68 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                we encounter economic distinctions that run the entire gamut
                of material resources from the wealthy to the impoverished.
                We would also have to assume that the notion of a state is
                consistent with a consciously amateur system of governance,
                based on almost weekly popular assemblies, a judicial system
                structured around huge juries that represent the assemblies on
                an attenuated scale, the selection and rotation of civic officials
                by sortition, that is, the use of the lot, and the absence of any
                political professionalism or bureaucratism, including military
                forces that are authentic militias of armed citizens rather than
                professional soldiers.
                These few remarks do not do full justice to the Athenian
                system of democracy, notably its high level of consciousness,
                civicism, commitment, and esthetics. They must suffice for the
                present to understand how politics was created on the rare
                occasions when it appeared in history with a reasonable
                degree of authenticity, and how it was conceived by its most
                renowed theorist, Aristotle. It is to Aristotle that we must turn
                for the earliest known distinctions between the social and
                political realms, the household and the public arena. The state
                was not alien to Aristotle; it existed as monarchy and tyranny,
                as everyone could see among the states that surrounded the
                Athens of Pericles’s day. And they were as easily confused with
                the polis by Aristotle and his students, just as we, today,
                confuse politikos, the administration of the polis’s affairs, with
                the state. What was central to Aristotle’s thought, however,
                was the polis, not that ambiguous phenomenon, the state.
                What is central to modern thought, by contrast, is the state not
                politics or, strictly speaking, the affairs of administering an
69 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                entity that could pass for a polis. Hence, although politics and
                the state intermesh in both cases, they do so in very different
                ways and from remarkably different perspectives.
                This distinction should not be reduced to a simple difference of
                vantage points toward a shared phenomenon. Aristotle and
                the modern social theorists are, in fact, looking at two very
                dissimilar worlds. The difference becomes very evident in Book
                Seven of Aristotle’s Politics where the proper size of the “ideal”
                polis is discussed. Both Aristotle and most modern social
                theorists would agree that a community that is very small risks
                the possibility, if it relies primarily on its own resources, of
                inadequately furnishing its inhabitants with the means of
                existence, much less providing for the “good life,” however one
                chooses to interpret this highly problematical phrase. Almost
                presciently, Aristotle derides, the view that a community’s
                greatness is to be judged by its demographic and territorial
                size. Important as numbers and resources may be, a polis with
                too large a population and area cannot have a “good legal
                government.... Law [nomos] is a form of order, and good law
                must necessarily mean good order; but an excessively large
                number cannot participate in order: to give it order would
                surely be a task for divine power, which holds the universe
                together. Hence the polis also must necessarily be the most
                beautiful with whose magnitude it combines the above-
                mentioned limiting principle; for certainly beauty is usually
                found in number and magnitude, but there is a due magnitude
                for a polis as there is for all things—animals, plants, tools,”
                otherwise it will lose “its true nature’’ as well as workability.
                Summing up this remarkable body of notions, Aristotle
70 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                concludes “that the best limiting principle for a polis is the
                largest expansion of the population with a view to self-
                sufficiency that can be taken in at one view.”{7}
                Probably no modern social theorist would reason out this case
                for “beauty” qua “magnitude” and “limit” qua “true nature” as
                the essence of a community. The ease for human scale has
                been argued by heterodox urbanologists on logistical,
                democratic, and esthetic grounds; but rarely, if ever, has it
                been argued on ethical, indeed metaphysical, grounds. A
                community “that can be taken in at one view”—that is,
                decentralized, comprehensible, and attractive—which Aristotle
                and his modern counterparts regard as a desideratum, is
                rooted in many, similar but also many different premises.
                Aristotle speaks to us from an age that found In magnitude and
                harmony the essence and, in the “true nature” of a human
                community, the limit to a polis. An ethical pragmatism
                pervades Aristotle’s remarks that qualitatively differs from the
                instrumental pragmatism of the modern urbanologist, however
                much the two share a common practical view of human
                consociation.
                Politics, in turn, is also inseparable in Aristotle’s mind from its
                ethical context. Men are “animals,” a fact that greets us early
                on In the Politics, but they are animals of a very special kind. It
                is man’s destiny or telos, if he is to fulfill his “true nature,” to
                live in the polis. A polis, however, is more than a community or
                koinonia. It is a koinonia that has reached the ideal form of a
                shared commonality of purpose among men whose self-
                realization is the “good life.”
                The “good life,” in turn, includes a degree of material self-
71 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                sufficiency that goes beyond mere survival. But it does not
                consist in on appetite for goods, with all its attendant excesses,
                that clouds man’s ethical and intellectual clarity. Man
                transcends his animality insofar as he has reason and speech,
                or logos, which combines both lit tributes in the ability to
                symbolize verbally and generalize logically. But these abilities
                do not guarantee that man has reached or oven approximates
                the fulfillment of his potentialities. Institutions must exist that
                constitute the means for achieving human self-fulfillment; a
                body of ethics must exist that gives the required Institutions
                substance as well as form; a wealth of social activities must be
                cultivated in the civic center or agora of the polis, the
                gymnasium, and in the theater as well as the popular assembly
                and courts to nourish, interactions and discourse; a mode of
                character development and education, both of which are
                combined in the (Ireek word paideia, must be at work to enrich
                the interactions among men and thereby foster the growth of
                ethical and intellectual insight.
                Underlying these various “means” is Aristotle’s emphasis on
                human solidarity or philia, which includes friendship (the
                common English translation for the Greek term) but which is a
                word more far-reaching in its connotation of civic commonality.
                The Intimacies of friendship may be reserved for a limited few,
                but philia implies an expansive degree of sociality that is a civic
                attribute of the polis and the political life involved in its
                administration. Man is “by his nature” a political animal or zoon
                politiken, which is to say that he is destined not only to live in a
                community but also to communize. In criticizing Lylcophron the
                Sophist, who contends that the polis is a “mere alliance”
72 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                among men to prevent them from inflicting harm on each
                other (Hobbes’s later view of the “social contract”) and
                promote the exchange of goods to satisfy their individual
                needs, Aristotle argues that the polis is an end in itself, the
                realization of man’s need for consociation apart from its
                material benefits. “If men formed the community and came
                together for the sake of wealth,” he declared, “their share in
                the polis [would be] proportionate to their share in the
                property, so that the argument of the champions of oligarchy
                would appear to be valid... ; but if on the other hand the polis
                was formed not for the sake of fife only but rather for the good
                life... and if its object is not military alliance for defence against
                injury by anybody, [and] it does not exist for the sake of trade
                and of business relations,” the polis would be more than a
                community and its citizens would “take civic virtue and vice
                into their purview.” Indeed, lacking a concern for “civic virtue
                and vice,” men would form communities no different from
                those of animals or slaves, who are simply concerned with
                survival. Communities united by mere economic and military
                alliances—and, here, Aristotle has the Etruscans and
                Carthaginians in mind—would be no different from the
                associations other people establish who, for all “agreements
                about imports and covenants [to abstain] from dishonesty and
                treaties... for mutual defence,” have no “officials in common”
                and take no “concern as to the moral character of the
                other.”{8}
                By contrast, the household is the sphere of mere survival, the
                place to which our zoon politiken repairs to satisfy his biological
                need for food, clothing, shelter—in sum, the “realm of
73 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                necessity” to cite Marx’s commonly used phrase. It is the
                domain of the man’s wife, children, kin, and slaves where an
                apolitical “kingship” (patriarchy) prevails. Here, the man’s
                relationship between his own person and the members of his
                domestic group is determined not by logos but by need, and
                the social tie is strictly one of “ruler” and “ruled.” “The family,”
                we are bluntly told by Aristotle, “is the association established
                by nature for the supply of men’s everyday wants...”{9}
                But men aspire for more and accordingly group their families
                together to form villages. To the extent that villages are
                transformed by man’s potential for the good life into ethical
                and cultural communities, the polis begins to appear. The
                family still exists to satisfy man’s animal wants. Hence the two
                worlds of the social and political emerge, the latter from the
                former. Aristotle’s approach to the rise of the polis is
                emphatically developmental and, in this way, resembles
                Plato’s account of the rise of the “ideal polis” in The Republic.
                [5] The polis is the culmination of a political whole from the
                growth of a social and biological part, a realm of the latent and
                the possible. Family and village do not disappear in Aristotle’s
                treatment of the subject, but they are encompassed by the
                fuller and more complete domain of the polis.
                The distinction between the social and political in Aristotle’s
                thinking is strikingly processual: the difference is explained by
                the growth and development of the social into the political, not
                by their polarization and mere succession. The state has not
                yet emerged in a form that gives it a uniqueness apart from the
                other two domains. “Buie” properly belongs to the family.
                Where it does appear in the koinonia, it is simply a brute

                extension of the patriarchal family to the civic world
                (monarchia) or it takes the form of a despotism ruled by a
                tyrant (tyrannos). And Aristotle views monarchies and
                tyrannies as warped or unfinished forms of civic administration
                that are unbecoming to a polis, although rule by a monarch
                with its traditional constraints on the ruler is to be preferred to
                rule by a tyrant, which is the arbitrary supremacy of one man.
                Nor does he prefer the rule of the few over the many—an
                aristocracy at best and an oligarchy at worst. By the same
                token, democracy that Aristotle understands to be the rule of
                the many over the few—specifically, a condition where the
                “poor” rule over the “wealthy”—is by no means desirable,
                although he does not seem to find it as abhorrent as arbitrary
                one-man rule.
                The best-ordered polis is structured around a system of
                governance where the most ethically and materially
                meritorious stratum of the population manages the polis’s
                affairs in the interests of all. This “polity” or “meritocracy,” as it
                has been called, is an ethical union that simultaneously yields
                the “good life” in a moral and material sense. Politics consists
                of the practical reason (phronesis) and action (praxis) that
                enters into such a felicitous koinonia.
                Athenian politics was nothing if it was not vital, indeed voluble,
                and popular in every sense of the term. Within a span of some
                three centuries, the Athenian people and their renegade
                aristocratic surrogates such as Solon, Kleisthenes, and Perikles
                were to dismember the traditional feudal system of Homeric
                times, wage a steady war against privilege within the citizen

                body, and turn the popular assembly from a lifeless, rarely
                convened mass meeting into a vital on-going forum for making
                major decisions, thereby opening public life to every Athenian
                adult male. Power ceased to be the prerogative of a small, well-
                born stratum of the population. It became a citizen activity.
                Athens’s historic calendar is marked by seething upsurges of
                the people, startling fluctuations between aristocratic rule,
                tyranny, limited popular government, until, by the latter half of
                the fifth century B.C., Athenian political life stabilized around a
                face-to-face democracy of the most radical kind. We may
                assume that similar developments occurred: in many Hellenic
                poleis that were to ally themselves with Athens for internal
                political reasons as well as mutual defense.
                In any case, in recorded history we have no structure
                comparable to the Athenian democracy. Popular assemblies
                such as the New England town meeting and the Parisian
                revolutionary sections of 1793–94 were to appear elsewhere
                over time. The Swiss Confederation is one of the few among
                many aborted or incomplete examples where popular control
                formed the underpinnings of an on-going political system.
                Athens, however, is unique historically in that the polis fostered
                a degree of citizen participation not only in the decision-
                making activities of the assembly but in the everyday politics
                of the agora that impelled its admirers over the ages to regard
                it with uncritical adulation as evidence of a “pure” democracy
                —and its opponents as evidence of a horrendous “mobocracy.”
                If politics is taken to be a form of popular activity in
                administering public life that, strictly speaking, is neither a,
                state, conceived as a highly professionalized system of

                governance, nor a “society,” conceived as forms of personal
                association for promoting survival and well-being, the
                Athenians’ could be said to have literally created politics. It was
                a parochial politics by modern “global” definitions of the term:
                civic rather than regional in,scale, limited to a minority of the
                population, Hellenic in its purview of the “civilized” world,
                contemptuous of slaves, women, the “barbarians” beyond the
                confines of the Greek ethnos, and resident aliens who
                performed much of skilled work and engaged in most of its
                trading activities.
                Qualitatively, however, Athens made up in depth what it lost In
                scope. It may well be, as the Jewish Zealots were to believe,
                that a special insight of a spiritual or moral nature is the
                privilege not Of great empires but of small communities on the
                margins of the great classical ecumenes. Both peoples, the
                Hellenes and the Israelites, provide visible evidence of the
                truth that may be hidden In this seemingly self-serving
                conviction. Yet a “creation” had Certainly emerged that opened
                a new dispensation in human affairs. A new realm of life had
                appeared, the political realm, winch was to acquire many
                different meanings but whose origins in classical Greece still
                keep faith with the pristine values and practices that impart
                meaning to those ill-used words, the “public sphere.”
                The Roman Republic, which looms high in its impact on the
                Euro-American political tradition, stands in marked, contrast to
                the Athenian notion of a public sphere., Polybius, the Greek
                chronicler of Rome’s rise to world hegemony, offers us the
                classical theory of republican, government, a theory that was
                to deeply affect the thinking of American and French

                constitutionalists in the eighteenth century.
                According to Polybius, the virtues of monarchy were embodied
                III the consuls, the two chief magistrates of the Republic. The
                Sonate provided the Republic with the advantages of
                aristocracy, with its gradations in descending order of consular,
                praetorian, aedilitian, tribunitial, and quaestorial ranks. The
                image of the Roman Senate freely debating public issues is
                essentially a myth: no senator could voice his views on an
                issue unless the presiding consul solicited his opinion, and
                these requests were directed in a strict hierarchical sequence
                that often left little time for oratory by the body’s lower orders.
                Finally, democracy was represented by several assemblies of
                the people. These assemblies (some four have been identified)
                reflected, in their variety and ascendancy, the fortunes of the
                plebeians and other lowly orders in their conflicts with the
                ruling patriciate. Whatever their origins, Roman popular
                assemblies elected all the magistrates of Rome, some of
                whom, such as the tribunes and praetors, had enormous
                control over other branches of the government during their
                heyday.
                Assemblies could be used by ambitious politicians to bypass
                the Senate and enact laws that the ruling oligarchies opposed.
                Hence, two political strategies existed during the more fervent
                periods of the republican era: an oligarchical one and a popular
                one. The comitia centuriata formed the principal popular law-
                making body of republican times. A complex mix of weighted
                voting groups sorted out according to military status and, later,
                according to classes based on property and age, the assembly
                was highly structured along hierarchical lines. It elected
78 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Rome’s consuls, praetors, and censors—each successively
                forming the most important or prestigious magistrates of the
                republic. The elective functions of the comitia centuriata were
                to be slowly supplanted by the Roman tribal assembly, the
                comitia tributa, largely based on territorial divisions in which 35
                tribes were classified into 31 rural tribes and 4 urban ones.
                Coexisting with both of these ranked assemblies, the plebs had
                their own exclusive concilium plebis from which all patricians
                were excluded. The concilium chose its own tribunes and
                aediles, the latter constituting officials who administered public
                works and police and took charge of the grain supply and
                games that gave the city such ill-famed distinction.
                We owe the word “plebiscite” (plebiscitia) to the right of the
                plebeian tribunes to submit laws for the approval of the
                concilium. Either the Campus Martius along the westward bend
                of the Tiber or the Forum constituted the principal meeting
                places for these assemblies, and discussion, if it occurred at all,
                was minimal. Laws, edicts, declarations of war were presented
                to the people by officials such as consuls, praetors, and
                tribunes; elections and confirmations were voted upon
                methodically. We cannot say with certainty that Roman popular
                assemblies were simply mute. Before the assemblies divided
                into their specific units, the highly structured comitia was
                preceded by a loosely organized contio where discussion may
                have been possible. “The contio may be a survival of an early
                form of assembly,” opined the late Lilly Ross Taylor, “like that of
                the Homeric warriors or the Spartans of later times, in which
                men expressed their opinion by shouting.”{10} If so, the
                contio does not bring the Roman assembly form any closer to

                the highly talkative Athenian assembly. Indeed, Greek
                observers of Roman procedures found the difference between
                the contio and comitia confusing. “With no such distinction in
                Greek lands between meetings for speaking and those for
                voting,” Ross notes, “Greek writers on Roman institutions have
                difficulty with the word contio.”{11} Polybius and Dio Cassius
                were to call the assemblies by one word, demos, or, simply, the
                people. Appian, an Alexandrian Greek, and Plutarch, who was
                born in Boeotia, seem to have been removed sufficiently from
                the traditional polis to designate the Roman assembly form as
                an ekklesia, the Greek word for the popular assembly that, as
                Ross emphasizes, “combined speaking and voting.”{12} If the
                contio was anything like the Homeric and Spartan assemblies,
                it did more listening than speaking, voicing its approval by
                acclamation and shouts rather than by oratory.
                Polybius’s association of the Roman assemblies with
                democracy Is specious. The republic had no democratic
                component in the Hellenic sense of the term, and speech,
                while relatively free, was more an affair of delivering elitist
                rhetoric to manipulable audiences in the Forum than the verbal
                interchange of political equals. A face-to-face relationship,
                between active citizens for the purpose of arriving at a
                consensus is alien to republican systems of government. A
                democracy is participatory; a republic, representative. The first
                involves the exercise of power directly by the people; the
                Second, its delegation to selected surrogates, who then
                reconstitute the political realm that initially existed at the base
                of the koinonia into a distinctly separate and usually
                professional power at its summit. Republics are beyond the

                immediate reach of popular control; democracies are not even
                confronted by the issue of the displacement of power.
                Rousseau, with barely concealed irony for the French
                philosophes who were so endeared to English
                constitutionalism, was to draw these distinctions sharply.
                “Sovereignty, for the same reason as it makes it inalienable,
                cannot be represented. It lies essentially in the general will,
                and will does not admit of representation: it is either the same,
                or other; there is no intermediate possibility. The deputies of
                the people, therefore, are not and cannot be its
                representatives: they are merely its stewards, and can carry
                through no definitive acts. Every law the people has not ratified
                in person is null and void—is, in fact, not a law. The people of
                England regards itself as free: but it is grossly mistaken: it is
                free only during the election of members of parliament. As
                soon as they are elected, slavery overtakes it, and it is
                nothing.”{13}
                The Roman cult of libertas is structured around personal
                freedom/not political. An individual can exercise a wide range
                of choices in vocations, responsibilities, and the satisfaction of
                tastes. Roman license during the Empire, with its almost
                psychotic appetite for ‘extremes, merely expanded this cult
                into a way of life. Credo was warped into extravagant practice
                with the result that the state soon found it ceased to enjoy the
                support of its citizenry. Its citizens fled from military service,
                public obligations, tax levies, and the most minimal communal
                responsibilities. Accordingly, every aspect of government had
                to be professionalized, Under the Empire, Rome’s troops were
                mercenaries, increasingly of alien birth and culture; its
81 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                bureaucracy became an elaborate apparatus, staffed by
                numerous ex-slaves who had acquired the skills for political
                affairs that their former masters lost and that Roman citizens
                generally neglected.
                This extraordinary erosion of personal competence blemishes
                every aspect of the imperial era. But even the republic
                prepared the way for Rome’s decline, In the political sphere,
                Roman libertas never became freedom, the Greek vision of
                eleutheria based on equality. One searches Latin for a term
                other than libertas or licentia that expresses the centricity of
                individual political judgements, in short, a term that does not
                sort the individual into the collective and weighted units of the
                comitia and councilium. The search is a vain one. The Roman
                concept of political life is corporatist, even statist, to the core,
                and there is no reciprocal interaction between the personal and
                the political.
                To find an individual who has room for a political fife, we turn to
                the Roman noble or well-born for examples. Here, political life
                is obligatory—indeed, apart from war, the authentic calling of
                an aristocrat. Hence it is to be conceived as a profession and
                suffers from the very professionalization of politics that Greek
                democrats tried so assiduously to avoid. Young men of
                patrician lineage were trained from birth in diction and rhetoric,
                physical fitness and military skills, amiability and the. arts of
                influence. Overly mannered and self-conscious, they were
                taught to gain favor with the powerful and befriend the
                potentially influential. By degrees, they were initiated into legal
                skills and affairs together with martial arts and the> postures
                of command. Polybius advises us that ten years of military
82 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                service are necessary before a man can aspire to a political
                career—a prerequisite that was mercifully abbreviated in the
                later years of the Republic. One then went into the service of a
                provincial governor and moved onward, at home, to a minor
                magistrate or a military tribune.
                To become a praetor was the “next obligatory office,” as Taylor
                puts it, followed by the consulship, if at all possible. Between
                times, one held important offices in the provinces where the
                opportunities for enrichment and plunder were immense.
                These broad outlines of the nobleman’s training and career
                could be painted with details that more appropriately describe
                politicking, rather than politics. The right friends, devoted
                clients, and suitable personal connections were critically
                important in achieving public office and political renown.
                Even more significant than the Roman cult of libertas was the
                Roman cult of amicitia, the Latin word for “friendship.” Career
                success depended not only upon lineage and wealth but also
                on the elaborate system of friends and shared obligations a
                rising patrician developed. I use the word “system” advisedly
                to single out the complex machinery of personal ties and
                interactions on which the whole structure of rule was based.
                Roman “politics” must be seen as a network of clients and
                associates rather than dubs and parties. The fierce differences
                between factions in the Republic, that finally brought it to ruin
                were more personal in nature than political. Cicero’s allusions
                to the partes of the populores and the optimates (the “parties”
                of the “people” and “aristocrats,” to use these terms in a
                modern sense) are evidence of differences in methods of
                manipulation rather than programs. None of the nobles, with
83 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the exception of the brothers Gracchi, over tried to really shift
                political power from the patrician elite to the populace. Indeed,
                Roman politicians were rarely burdened by Nontimentality for
                the oppressed or the plight of the commoners.
                To use the people for personal ends and career ambitions,
                however, was a widespread technique, not only during
                republican times but also during the imperial era. Nor were the
                Roman people the worse For the use of such demagogic
                tactics. Nobles gave immense quantities of their wealth to gain
                popular support against their rivals. A steady flow of
                emoluments, gifts, festivals, and games came to be expected
                by the Roman people as a characteristic feature of politics.
                Roman client and gift politics, in turn, accelerated the
                degradation of the citizenry, fostering an appetite for
                sensationalism and brutality that emerged in marked contrast
                with its traditional republican spirit and virtues. “Public things”
                or res publica became a highly merchandisable commodity—a
                “thing” to be sold, bought, and pilfered. In this respect, the
                Empire changed very little in Roman “politics.” It merely made
                the process of demoralization, vulgarization, and pilfering more
                systematic and orderly.
                Early Rome did not produce a breed of kindly men—nor, for
                that matter, did Athens and other Greek poleis, Kindness and
                sentimentality are not classical traits. Obligation and duty are
                the preferred personal attributes of the ancient world. But
                these attributes did create an ideal of a highly committed,
                morally certain, and fiercely independent yeomanry. The
                landholdings of these yeomen provided the material
                competence for a solid independence of mind and a sense of

                community rootedness. Behind the more distinguished names
                of early republican Rome, such as Cincinnatus, who left his
                farmstead for vigorous public service, were the stern traditions
                of family cults, civic deities, and an unblemished ancestry—a
                lineage to be cherished because it exhibited soldierly simplicity
                and agrarian virtues. Dignatas and honorare were to be prized
                over wealth, social status, and public esteem, although
                invariably such rewards came with family probity.
                These stern and dutiful farmers were to fill the legions
                commanded by Scipio in the brutal wars with Carthage. They
                were the fodder of costly, long-term, and debilitating conflicts
                that brought ruin to their farms and the destruction of their
                social moorings. Thereafter, an unyielding patriciate, too
                urbane to value the innocent simplicity of its own rural
                ancestors, effaced what the Punic Wars had largely undone—
                the ideals of republican virtue and the agrarian material
                conditions in which this sense of virtue and duty was rooted.
                Cincinnatus belonged to a social world rather than a political
                one. Governance in his day was seen as a domestic
                responsibility in which a public servant tended to the needs of
                the people more as a father than an administrator. Such men
                became short-lived dictatori without ever establishing
                dictatorships; they promptly went back to their farms after
                answering the call to public service. They did not thirst for
                power, much less professionalize it.
                But Rome could not strike the balance between aristocratic
                values and public rights achieved by Athens. More precisely,
                Rome failed to turn the governance of the civitas into a
                genuinely political community. Men like Cincinnatus were to

                lose not only the landholdings that gave them independence of
                mind and spirit; they were to lose the social base for public
                commitment without developing a politics that could control
                and contain the new civic dispensation that was forming
                around them. Like Athens, Rome was to grow—and, like
                Athens, it was to be brought into a broad regional theater of
                power relationships and responsibilities. But where Athens
                drastically reworked its yeoman society into a vital public realm
                that fostered active citizenship among all its social elements,
                Rome permitted its yeomanry to dissolve into rootless
                constituencies and its public fife to languish. A republic rather
                than a democracy came into existence with a degree of
                administrative ingenuity unprecedented in the history of
                jurisprudence, efficiency, and military prowess. But for this
                achievement it paid a penalty that ultimately spelled its death.
                The late Roman Republic was not a world that could nourish a
                Cincinnatus or even a Marcus Portius Cato, whose writings are
                filled with denunciations of Rome’s moral debasement,
                lasciviousness, and extravagance. Politics was claimed almost
                exclusively by the patriciate and jealously guarded from any
                serious invasion by the people. In this sonse, republican Rome
                was true to itself: like all elitist regimes, it would have been
                exceptional if it failed to turn from an increasingly oligarchical
                republic into a completely despotic empire.
                Athens and Rome ultimately became legendary models for two
                types of “popular” government: a democracy and a republic.
                And later social theorists and political practitioners who had
                lost any monarchic proclivities were to clearly favor a
                republican system of governance over a democratic one.

                But democratic notions of a body politic did not disappear.
                They were to surface from the depths of a popular
                “underground” of deviant Christian sects throughout ‘the
                Middle Ages, such as the Brethren of the Free Spirit, Anabaptist
                movements, and blatantly anarchic conventicles during the
                Reformation Era. Like Athens, they were not without their
                flaws: elites are to be found within elites, saints within larger
                communities of believers, and the like. Nevertheless, village
                democracies kept alive strong traditions of popular assemblies
                that may have been inherited from distant Neolithic and similar
                institutions’and that also emerged in many medieval towns.
                The notion of the “people” or demos did not disappear. The
                ideals of “popular rule” were to linger on from classical
                antiquity well into modern times.
                More commonly, however, republican theories of governance
                were hybridized with democratic notions, and they were to
                produce rising demands of self-governance with institutions
                that were redolent of democratic Athens. Machiavelli’s Prince
                and Discourses glitter with a fascinating mixture of republican
                and democratic ideas, largely translated into the virtues of his
                beloved Roman Republic, His aversion for the idle nobility is
                pronounced. Politics, in Machiavelli’s eyes, is not the fare for
                the slothful, ignorant, and crested boors who are the fatuous
                heirs of titles and aristocratic pedigrees. It is a highly skilled
                craft that must be exercised as gently by the prince in his
                relationship with the people as it must be exercised ruthlessly
                by him in his relationship with his rivals. Machiavelli’s demand
                for a total commitment by his chosen sovereign to politics
                reflects the emergence of a new kind of man, the Renaissance
87 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                prince: secular, keenly intelligent, skillful, and cunning. He is a
                man of reason rather than faith, of judgement rather than
                belief, and self-reliance rather than dependency, A new
                political dispensation is in the air, a modern one, that draws its
                precedents from the senatorial party of the early Roman
                Republic rather than the sacerdotal party of the medieval
                church. Machiavelli’s references are to Scipio, not to Augustine;
                to Livy, not Aquinas.
                But within this republican idea of a meritocracy, Machiavelli
                advances for sixteenth-century Italian concepts that could be
                found in Perikles and the Athenian commitment to
                amateurism. Comparable only to his, hatred of the nobility is
                his hatred of mercenaries who were plaguing and plundering
                Italy in his day—professional soldiers. The most commanding
                need of a well-ordered state, he tells us, is a citizen-army.
                Mercenaries are as unreliable as they are unscrupulous. They
                are born plunderers who have no allegiances other than those
                that money can buy. “Mercenary captains are either very
                capable men or not,” he declares; “if they are, you cannot rely
                on them, for they will always aspire to their own greatness,
                either by oppressing you, their master, or by oppressing others
                against your intentions; but if the captain is not an able man,
                he will generally ruin you. And if it is replied to this, that
                whoever has armed forces will do the same, whether these are
                mercenaries or not, I would reply that as armies are to be used
                either by a prince or by a republic, the prince must go in person
                to take the position of captain, and the republic must send its
                own citizens. If the man sent turns out to be incompetent, it
                must change him; and if capable, keep him by law from going

                beyond the proper limits. And it is seen by experience that only
                princes and armed republics make very great progress,
                whereas mercenary forces do nothing but harm, and also an
                armed republic submits less easily to the rule of one of its
                citizens than a republic armed by foreign forces.”{14}
                Machiavelli’s argument clearly tips toward a republic and an
                armed citizenry rather than a prince and a professional army.
                Clearly, if princely government was central to his concerns, the
                prince’s competence would normally be beyond any legal
                assessment. There would be nothing that could prevent him
                from “going beyond the proper limits,” indeed, to tolerate any
                limits at all. Nor could Machiavelli, whose mind was steeped in
                the Greek and Roman classics, have been unmindful that the
                Athenian military forces, in contrast to the Roman imperial
                ones, were structured around clearly accountable captains
                who were strictly regulated by law, indeed by the ekklesia or
                popular citizen-assembly. Amateurism takes high priority over
                professionalism and political Institutions, visibly peopled by a
                free, and an armed, citizenry, over a state power with its
                mercenary bureaucrats and soldiers.
                Machiavelli undoubtedly had his eyes sharply focused on Italy
                and the cause of national independence, but his feet were
                firmly planted in his beloved Florence and the cause of
                freedom. The sap flowed, as it were, from the roots upward—
                from city to nation—with the result that a republican, even
                princely, state was nourished by and mixed with civic
                democratic notions.
                Ideologically, the hybridization of two very distinct and
89 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                potentially conflicting classical ideas of public governance
                arises from a serious confusion over what we mean by politics
                and statecraft.
                The rise of the nation-state from the sixteenth century onward
                greatly altered the entire framework of political discourse. The
                basic unit of public governance was the city, not larger entities
                such as the province, nation, or empire. A citizen’s allegiances
                to gover nin g institutions could be comfortably enumerated as
                a very distinct hierarchy of loyalties. He was first and foremost
                a townsman. The town was the authentic and most meaningful
                locus of his personal and public life. Only secondarily did he
                identify himself with a province or a region. The idea of
                “nationality” was at best vague, that is when it existed at all.
                Romans in the most far-flung reaches of the empire
                consistently visualized themselves as citizens of the imperial
                city. Among the Greeks, civic loyalty was virtually all-
                consuming: Athenians, for example, sharply and disdainfully
                distinguished themselves from Spartans or Corinthians, a
                sentiment that was freely reciprocated by all citizens of other
                poleis with respect to other Greek cities. The Stoic philosophers
                who were to pave the way for Christianity insisted well into
                Roman times that civic loyalty defiled the novel notion that all
                men were brothers. But the Stoic notion and its very novelty
                has the ring of an ideological protest against the more popular
                view that citizenship implies a primary loyalty to one’s town,
                not to a vagary called “humanity.”
                The rise of the nation-state altered this hierarchy of loyalties—
                and, with this change, the way in which politics was conceived.
                Not that ancient and medieval civic parochialism was an

                unblemished desideratum. Parochialism had a very harmful,
                often dehumanizing, effect on urban life generally. The
                tendency to set one city against another fostered local
                chauvinism with such pathologies as ethnic antagonisms,
                wars, and cultural introversion. In a world where the city
                produced a deep sense of ethnic and cultural identity that
                compares with the modern world’s most strident forms of
                nationalism, the conquest of one city by another often
                terminated in the sheer annihilation of a people as a distinct
                community. Rome’s total destruction of Carthage in the last of
                the Punic wars was not merely the dismantling of a major
                ancient city; it was the enslavement and total effacement of a
                people—of their identity, culture, traditions, uniqueness,
                indeed their very claim to exist. Jericho, Troy, and Jerusalem
                were to suffer similar fates, to cite only the most well-known
                examples of what urban destruction often meant in the early
                and classical worlds—an act of devastation comparable only to
                genocide in the modern world.
                With the rise of nationalism and the nation-state, the state
                began to assume ideological preeminence over the city, and
                even radical social thinkers began to formulate their political
                ideologies in broad territorial or national terms. Puritan
                revolutionaries thought of their “rights” not as citizens of
                London, which formed the real center of parliamentary unrest
                against the court, but as “Englishmen.” Puritan theory, based
                on a doctrine of natural rights, formulated these “rights” not in
                the characteristically civic forms of popular assemblies and
                politics based on personal intimacy; a nation, “England,” was
                conceived as the legendary victim of invading “barbarous”

                Normans who had crossed the channel from France some five
                hundred years earlier and imposed a royal tyranny on a
                representative system of Saxon self-governance. The
                Combatants in the revolution expressed their loyalties in terms
                of their adherence to “parliament” or the “court.” Larger-than-
                life Institutions, far beyond the reach of the ordinary citizen,
                began to Supplant the civic institutions within which some kind
                of face-to-face democracy was feasible. Republicanism, in
                effect, was a radical ideology of nations rather than cities and
                statecraft became the “politics” of highly centralistic state
                structures.
                It is hard to overstate the amount of intellectual mischief the
                extension of the word politics, basically rooted in the civic life of
                the polis, produced when it was permitted to encompass
                statecraft. Classical politics always implied the existence of a
                body politic—in its own way, a kind of ecological community in
                the social sense even in Rome, when the words populus
                Romanus came to mean little more than an aristocratic
                oligarchy. The classical notion of a body politic was not a
                euphemism for an “electorate” or a “constituency,” as it is
                today; it was a real, physical, and clearly observable entity. It
                could be seen daily in public squares where heated discussions
                over political issues intermingled with the chitchat of personal
                and business problems; it assembled with almost weekly
                regularity on a hillside of Athens, the Pnyx, where meetings of
                the ekklesia were convened, or it gathered in open spaces of
                the Roman Forum where the comitia tributa often held its
                sessions. It could be heard quite audibly, whether by
                acclamation in Sparta, arguments in Athens, or even in the

                most despotic of Rome’s imperial periods when the hoots and
                shouts of commoners at the Coliseum reminded the emperors
                that they were not beyond the reach of public criticism. In more
                militant times, this body politic rioted in Rome’s St. Peter’s
                Square during the Middle Ages and stormed into Florentine
                churches to hear the sermons of Savonarola during the
                Renaissance. In short, the body politic existed in the literal
                sense that it was a tangible, protoplasmic entity that expressed
                its concerns in the eye-to-eye contact of personal confrontation
                and fervent discourse.
                This eye-to-eye contact of active citizens was an organic
                politics in its most meaningful, protoplasmic, and self-fulfilling
                sense. Political assemblies were not mere audiences on which
                public officials practiced their arts of statecraft; they were
                legislative communities united by a reasonable commonality
                of shared, public interests and ethical precepts. That political
                life had worked its way out of social life to acquire a distinct
                identity of its own and presupposed social forms as its
                underpinnings is evident enough from any account of the polis
                or its near-equivalent in the medieval city-state or “commune.”
                But even so conservative a thinker as Aristotle never confused
                a family or a workshop with the agora, where public affairs
                were normally discussed, and the ekklesia. Where the body
                politic physically assembled to make public decisions. Hence,
                the Greek polis was never a state in any modern sense of the
                term with professional surrogates for an assembled body
                politic, nor was it a social entity such as a “family” that united
                the people into an authentic kin group. Aristotle’s notion of
                philia or solidarity as a crucial precondition for a political life

                expressed the unique identity politics possessed as a form of
                governance, one That transcended mere kinship obligations. If
                kinsmen were obligated to each other by virtue of blood ties
                and tribal custom, citizens were obligated to each other by
                virtue of civic ties and ethical precepts.
                If politics can be said to have emerged from society in the strict
                sense that I use the latter word to denote familial, vocational,
                and sociable relationships, so statecraft can be said to have
                emerged from politics conceived as the activities of a directly
                involved body politic. Aristocracies, monarchies, and republics
                ultimately dissolve the body politic as a participatory entity, an
                essentially ecological phenomenou into an amorphous mass of
                privatized “social” beings we so aptly call an electorate or a
                constituency. The “deputies of the people” replace the people,
                to use Rousseau’s pithy formulation, and bureaucratic
                institutions replace popular assemblies. The identity of politics
                as a unique phenomenon to be distinguished from other,
                presumably “social” activities, is not a concept that was
                confined to classical thinkers such as Aristotle. It is a recurring
                and often perplexing problem that appears in the writings of
                Rousseau, in constitutional documents of the past that
                distinguish between “active” (propertied) citizens and
                “passive” (propertyless) citizens, and today, most strikingly, in
                the writings of a highly gifted political philosopher, Hannah
                Arendt.
                What is so curious about this literature and its attempt to single
                Out politics as a clearly identifiable area of public activity is the
                extent to which it is burdened by the institutional weight of the
                nation-state. Arendt’s distinction between a “political realm”
94 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                and one that is “social” allows for very little difference between
                political activity and statecraft. The state has so thoroughly
                merged with the political—institutionally and functionally—that
                the two almost seem identical. What is remarkable is that
                modern social theory does not find this congruence of very
                different arenas of public governance problematical. Clear as
                the old Aristotelian distinction between the social and political
                may be, the equally crucial distinction between the political
                and the statist tends to be lost in the modern literature on
                politics. Political activity and statecraft have become so
                thoroughly intermixed in theory and l’Oality that the present-
                day usage of the word “politics” is taken to be the “art” of the
                politician, who, for all practical purposes, replaces the body
                politic. That the state historically depoliticized tills body politic
                and essentially disbanded it institutionally seems like a
                meaningless ideological curiosity in a world where political
                activity” takes the form of an on-going battle of political
                gladiators in a strangely muted, almost empty arena.
                Perhaps the main reason why the confusion between politics
                and statecraft persists so strongly today is that we have lost
                sight of the historic source and principal arena of any authentic
                politics—the city. We not only confuse urbanization with
                citification, but we have literally dropped the city out of the
                history of ideas—both in terms of the way it explains the
                present human condition and the systems of public
                governance it creates. Not that we lack any valuable histories
                of the city or attempts to evaluate it sociologically. But our
                urban literature generally neglects the relationship between
                the city and the remarkable phenomenon of citizenship it
95 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                produces. Urban historians tend to fixate on largely narrative
                accounts of the city’s development from village to megalopolis
                —accounts that are riddled by nostalgia for the past or a brute
                acceptance of existing urban conditions and the future they
                portend. The notion that the city is the source of immensely
                provocative political, ethical, and economic theories—indeed,
                that its institutions and structures embody them—is generally
                alien to the modern social theorist.
                An ethical interpretation of historical urban standards must
                highlight one central issue: the need to recover civic forms and
                values that foster an active citizenry. This amounts to saying
                that we must recover politics again—not only the social forms
                of personal intercourse that underpin every kind of human
                activity. The city, conceived as a new kind of ethical union, a
                humanly scaled form of personal empowerment, a
                participatory, even ecological system of decision making, and
                a distinctive source of civic culture—this civic notion of
                community must be brought back again into the history of
                human ideas and practical wisdom. It must be critically
                reexamined as a realm of thought and activity that gives rise—
                as it did in various periods of history—to political consociation,
                a politics that places family, work, friendship, art, and values
                within the larger context of a rounded civic world. Politics, in
                effect, must be recreated again if we are to reclaim any degree
                of personal and collective sovereignty over our destiny. The
                nuclear unit of this politics is not the impersonal bureaucrat,
                the professional politician, the party functionary, or even the
                urban resident in all the splendor of his or her civic anonymity.
                It is the citizen—a term that embodies the classical ideals of
96 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                philia, autonomy, rationality, and, above all, civic commitment,
                The elusive citizen who surfaced historically in the assemblies
                of Greece, in the communes of medieval Europe, in the town
                meetings of New England, and in the revolutionary sections of
                Paris must be brought to the foreground of political theory. For
                without his or her presence and without a clear understanding
                of his or her genesis, development, and potentialities, any
                discussion of the city is likely to become anemically
                institutional and formal. A city would almost certainly become
                a shapeless blob, a mere chaos of structures, streets, and
                squares if it lacked the institutions and forms appropriate to the
                development of an active citizenry. But without the citizens to
                occupy these institutions and fill these forms, we may create
                an endless variety of civic entities—but like the great urban
                belts that threaten to devour them, they would be completely
                socially lifeless and ecologically denatured.
                Chapter Four: The Ideal of Citizenship
                If the city makes it possible for us to single out politics as a
                unique sphere of self-governance that is neither social nor
                statist, the citizen as the viable substance of this unique sphere
                makes it possible’to undo the confusion that blends these very
                distinct spheres into a collage of overlapping terms and blurred
                meanings, For it is in the citizen—in his or her activity as a self-
                governing being—that! the political sphere becomes a living
                reality with the flesh and blood of a palpable body politic.
                The Greeks may have been the first people to give us a clear
                image of the citizen in any politically intelligible sense of the
                term. Tribal peoples form social groups—families, clans,
97 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                personal and community alliances, sororal and fraternal clubs,
                vocational and totemic societies, and the like; They may
                assemble regularly to examine and decide communal affairs—
                certainly a nascent form of politics—but the issues that
                confront them rarely deal with ways and means of governing
                themselves. Custom plays a paramount role in establishing
                their norms for community management; discourse, beyond,
                direct argumentation, occupies a place secondary to the
                enormous authority of precedence and long-established
                administrative procedures. Nor is this approach to be disdained
                as trivial or “primitive/’ Group safety and stability require that
                the community preserve the old, well-tested ways of life, of
                expeditiously applying and modifying time-honored and secure
                structures of group management. The kin relationship forms
                the social tissue of this governing body, whether the blood tie
                be real or fictitious. Religious belief, too, may play a very
                important role, as Fustel de Coulanges has argued.
                But politics as a creative and rational arena of discourse with
                its vastly innovative possibilities for shaping and bonding
                widely disparate individuals is only latent in tribal assemblies. It
                still has a domestic character with powerful familial biases that
                exclude the stranger. Tribal assemblies of preliterate peoples
                invoke the past political assemblies of free citizens create a
                future. The former tends to be highly conservative; the latter,
                highly innovative. If the two were juxtaposed with each other,
                we would be obliged to contrast custom to reason, precedent
                to a sense of futurity, kinship ties to civic ties, mythopoeia to
                ethics. In waxing enthusiastically over the popular assemblies
                that existed very early in Mesopotamian cities, Henri Frankfort
98 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                declared that the assembly form “is a man-made institution
                overriding the natural and primordial division of society into
                families and clans. It asserts that habitat, not kinship,
                determines one’s affinities. The city, moreover, does not
                recognize outside authority. It may be subjected by a
                neighbour or a ruler, but its loyalty cannot be won by force, for
                its sovereignty rests with the assembly of its citizens.”{15}
                Which is not to say that these contrasts are so absolute that
                they polarize the tribal assembly against its civic counterpart.
                Athenian citizenship, based on a civic myth that all citizens
                shared a common ancestry, became highly parochial by
                Perikles’s time. For a well-established resident alien or
                metoikos (metics) to become a citizen of the polis was virtually
                impossible. Doubtless, Athenians knew that Solon, a century
                earlier, offered the lure of Athenian citizenship to all skilled
                craftsmen who were willing to migrate from various parts of
                the Mediterranean to Athens. And Kleisthenes, a generation
                removed from Perikles, permitted many metics to become
                citizens in his day. Athenian citizenship, conceived as a form of
                status based on blood ties, was a shaky affair at best. But
                under Perikles, the body politic behaved like an oversized
                medieval guild. For patently self-serving reasons, it simply
                closed its doors to outsiders who might stake a reasonable
                claim to the privileges afforded by the corporate community. In
                principle, the impediments Athenians raised to citizenship in
                the middle of the fifth century B.C. were not different from
                those that modern nation states place in the way of
                immigrants and alien residents.
                The Greek citizen ideal, however, differed very profoundly from
99 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the modern. It was not simply some specious myth of shared
                heredity that united citizens of the polis with each other but a
                profoundly cultural conception of personal development—the
                Greek notion of paideia. Paideia is normally translated into
                English as education, a term that is notable for its sparseness
                and limitations. To the Greeks, particularly the Athenians, the
                word meant considerably more. The education of a young man
                involved a deeply formative and life-long process whose end
                result made him an asset to the polis, to his friends and family,
                and induced him to five up to the community’s highest ethical
                ideals. The German word, bildung, with its combined meanings
                of character development, growth, enculturation, and an well-
                rounded education in knowledge and skills, more appropriately
                denotes what the Greeks meant by paideia than any word we
                have in English. It expresses a creative integration of the
                individual into his environment, a balance that demands a
                critical mind with a wide-ranging sense of duty. The Greek
                word, areté, which in Homeric times denoted the warrior
                attributes of prowess and valor, was extended by the classical
                era to mean goodness, virtue, and excellence in all aspects of
                life. Paideia and areté are indissolubly linked—not as means
                and ends but as a unified process of civic- and self-
                development. Excellence in public life was as crucial to an
                Athenian’s character development as excellence in his
                personal life. The polis was not only a treasured end in itself; it
                was the “school” in which the citizen’s highest virtues were
                formed and found expression. Politics, in turn, was not only
                concerned with administering the affairs of the polis but also
                with educating the citizen as a public boing who developed the
                competence to act in the public interest. paideia, in effect, was
100 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                a form of civic schooling as well as personal training. It rooted
                civic commitment in independence of mind, philia, and a deep
                sense of individual responsibility.
                The modern notion of “politics” as a form of managerial
                “efficiency” or of education as the mere acquisition of
                knowledge and skills would have seemed pitiful to an Athenian
                citizen of classical times. Athenians assembled as an ekklesia
                not only to formulate policies and make judgments; they came
                together to mutually educate each other in the ability to act
                justly and expand their civic ideals of right and wrong. The
                “political process,” to use a modern cliche, was not strictly
                institutional and administrative; it was intensely processual in
                the sense that politics was an inexhaustible, everyday
                “curriculum” for intellectual, ethical, and personal, growth—
                paideia that fostered thjs ability of citizens to creatively
                participate in public affairs, to bring their best abilities to the
                service of the polis and its needs, to intelligently manage their
                private affairs in Accordance with the highest ethical standards
                of the community.
                This “calling” to civic and personal excellence was more than a
                family responsibility’or an institutionalized form of personal
                training. By classical times, Athenians who could afford them
                had tutors aplenty—rhetoricians to teach them the arts of
                persuasion; philosophers and logicians to instruct them in
                wisdom and consistency of thought; elders to provide them
                with the inherited lore of their families, civic traditions, and
                models of behavior; gymnasia in which to train and control
                their bodies or learn martial arts; courts to shape their faculties
                for judgment; and, in time, the ekklesia in which to formulate

                crucial policies through discourse and debate. But every polis,
                be it a garrison-state such as Sparta or a democracy such as
                Athens, provided a variety of public spaces in which citizens
                could gather on more intimate terms, often daily, to discuss
                public and practical affairs. Perhaps the most important of
                these spaces, the agora, which M. I. Finley calls the “town
                square,” was an informal meeting ground in the people could
                be assembled when needed.{16} By Perikles’ time, the
                Athenians were to shift the formal assembly of the people—the
                ekklesia—to a hillside (the Pnyx), but, as Finley notes, the
                agora originally meant a “gathering place,” long before it was
                invaded by shops, stalls, and temples.
                The agora provided the indispensible physical space for
                turn¬ing citizens hip from a periodic institutional ritual into a
                living, everyday practice. Home was the place in which one
                ate, slept, and tended to the details of private life. But the
                Greeks generally held this private world in small esteem. Life
                was authentically lived in the open public space of the agora,
                where the citizens discussed business affairs, gossiped, met
                friends—new and old—occasionally philosophized, and almost
                certainly engaged in vigorous political discussion. Perikles
                could be waylaid there by badgering critics as surely as
                Sokrates could be drawn into lengthy discussions by the
                intellectually earnest young nobles of the polis. Jugglers,
                acrobats, poets, and play-actors mixed with tradesmen,
                yeomen, philosophers, and public officials, a crowd spiced by
                strangely costumed visiting foreigners who gawked at the
                looming acropolis above and the superbly adorned public
                buildings nearby.

                During inclement weather, this colorful and eminently vocal
                crowd could take refuge in the colonnaded arcades or stoa that
                lined part of the twenty-six-acre square. There, they
                encountered artisans working at their trade and merchants
                who displayed their wares, often women who sold much of the
                farm produce that fed the community. In its emphasis on-
                direct, almost protoplasmic contact, full participatory
                involvement and its delight in variety and diversity, there is a
                sense in which the agora formed the space for a genuine
                ecological community within the polis itself. Thus politics,
                which found its most ordered and institutionalized expression
                in the ekklesia, originated in the daily ferment of ordinary life In
                the agora. Its informal genesis reveals the organic way in which
                Important policies slowly developed into popular ideas before
                they were formulated as verdicts and laws in the courts and
                official assemblages of the polis. The democratic institutions of
                Athens, for all the ritualistic panoply that surrounded them,
                were merely the structural forms in which everyday debate
                and gossip were hardened into the legislated expression of an
                easy-going, unstructured, and popular politics—one that was
                embodied by an earnest, Spontaneous, and an extraordinarily
                active citizenry. The “tyranny of structurelessness” that so
                many contemporary liberals and socialists fling so reprovingly
                at their libertarian critics as an “ultrademocratic” vice would
                have been incomprehensible to the Athenian citizen. The
                teeming “anarchy” of the agora was, in fact, an indispensible
                and fecund grounding for “libertarian” structures (to use
                Jaeger’s term) that, given time and neglect, would have
                Otherwise turned into oligarchic institutions with a democratic
                veneer.

                Citizenship, in effect, involved an on-going process of
                educational, ethical, and political gestation for which such
                words as “constituent” and “voter” are modern parodies of a
                politics that was more existential than formal. This gestative
                process occurred in the agora days before it found expression
                in the ekklesia. It is a cliche to say that Americans are a
                “practical people,” Italians an “emotional people,” Germans a
                “methodical people.” In any case, there can be no doubt that
                the Athenians were a “political people” and citizenship was
                their destiny, not merely the avocation it has become in the
                modern world. Behind their ideal of citizenship, nonperishable
                as long as there is a meaningful literature on democracy, is the
                way that citizenship was formed. It was a citizenship formed by
                the moral fortitude of a mountain people—in Athens’s case,
                tempered by the wide cultural contacts afforded by a major
                seaport—and a delicate balancing of social conflicts that pitted
                opposing classes against each other without obliterating the
                virtues each possessed in its own right. Greece was to inherit
                not only the aristocratic epics of Homer and their high standard
                of courage but the mundane litanies of Hesiod with their
                workaday sense of practicality. Her long journey from a tribal to
                a political world, from a society of peasants to one of citizens, is
                a fascinating narrative in its own right. But it is also an
                exemplary biography of the citizen as such, at least insofar as
                this remarkable individual was to approximate an ideal that
                Athens more closely attained than any community that
                followed her—and one that the modern world may well lose at
                the peril of its freedom.
                The first phase of this journey into a political world begins with
104 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the way the Athenians managed to shed the narrow features of
                the kinship bond based on blood ties, religion, and familial
                loyalties, while simultaneously developing an almost ecological
                sensibility based on a Active kinship, territorial commonality,
                rationality, and a healthy secular humanism.
                Greek society was not immune to a general historical trend
                that raised humanity out of a dismal archaic era, one which
                reworked an egalitarian tribal world into a hierarchical feudal
                one. By Homeric times, commanding patriarchal clans had
                already imposed their will on loosely structured and highly
                vulnerable peasant communities. Ironically, the very tribal
                features of kin and blood that once had produced egalitarian
                norms of mutual aid and material reciprocity were used to
                achieve their very opposite: a hierarchical system of rule
                focused on domination and acquisition. This new reordering of
                traditional clans or phratries from tribal into aristocratic
                families fostered exclusivity and privilege rather than sharing
                and communal responsibility. The “bribe-devouring judges”
                whom Hesiod, the Boeotian peasant, had denounced in the
                eighth century B.c. had become land-devouring nobles by the
                seventh. Gross inequalities in the ownership of land that mark
                the Greek world in that period of transition seem like
                forerunners of the Roman agrarian crisis that followed the
                Punic Wars. That Greece, especially Athens, did not become a
                mere historical preface to Rome, indeed that the polis
                developed a political life so markedly different from any
                republican system of governance, can be explained only in
                terms of a remarkable constellation of factors from which the
                modern world can learn much.

                What aristocratic Greece and democratic Greece were to share
                as a common legacy is a vigorous ideal of independence—an
                ideal oven stronger than its widely touted ideal of justice. To
                the Greek mind, clientage in any form verged on slavery,
                indeed a denial of the individual’s humanness and personality.
                This notion, which many Greek scholars were to regard as an
                aristocratic disdain for Work as such, actually expressed a
                concern for the citizen’s capacity to form independent
                judgements insulated from external or personal interests. “To
                build one’s own house, one’s own ship, or to spin and weave
                the material which is used to clothe the members of one’s own
                household is in no way shameful,” observes Claude Mosse in
                her insightful study on work in the ancient world. “But to work
                for another man, in return for a wage of any kind, is degrading.
                It is this which distinguishes the ancient mentality from a
                modern which would have no hesitation in placing the
                independent artisan above the wage-earner. But, for the
                ancients, there is really no difference between the artisan who
                sells his own products and the workman who hires out his
                services. Both work to satisfy the needs of others, not their
                own. They depend on Others for their livelihood. For that
                reason they are no longer free. This perhaps above all is what
                distinguishes the artisan from the poasant. The peasant is so
                much closer to the ideal of self-sufficiency (autarkeia) which
                was the essential basis for man’s freedom in the ancient world.
                Needless to say,fin the classical age, in both Greece and Rome,
                this ideal of self-sufficiency had long since given way to a
                system of organized trade. However, the archaic mentality
                endured, and this explains not only the scorn felt for the
                artisan, labouring in his smithy, or beneath the scorching sun
106 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                on building sites, but also the scarcely veiled disdain felt for
                merchants or for rich entrepreneurs who live off the labor of
                their slaves.”{17}
                As befitted free men, farmers enjoyed the economic
                independence and material security that were needed to form
                decisions untainted by self or class interests. In fact many
                Greeks would have seen even wealthy tradesmen as clients of
                their buyers and highly skilled craftsmen, artists, and poets as
                dependents of a fickle market for their products. To be free in
                Athens meant very little if one’s basic needs were not satisfied
                within a mutualistic group of self-sufficient producers. The word
                autarkeia, strictly translated, has the double meaning of the
                rarely used definition of “selfirule,” as weil as. the. more
                familiar notion of “self-sufficiency.” In its latter meaning,
                autarkeia has long been replaced by autonomos, literally the
                conditipn of living by one’s own laws. This concept of
                independence is more juridical than political. The English
                translation of these words, notably the use of “autarchy” to
                mean economic self-sufficiency and autonomy to denote
                personal freedom or self-government, creates a disjunction
                between the material and political that would have been alien
                to the Greek ideal of independence. We would be hard put to
                understand Artistotie’s belief that all tradesmen, artisans,
                merchants, and servants should be denied the franchise if we
                failed to recognize that it is not simply labor and trade he
                despised but, more importantly, material clientage in any form
                that could affect the citizen s independence of judgement.
                Independence without the substance of material self-
                sufficiency and personal autonomy would have been formal at
107 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                best and hollow at worst to the Greek mind. No client, however
                well-off, could render a judgement or reason freely without
                deferring to exogenous authorities and interests on whom his
                welfare depended.
                It is worth noting that these Hellenic precepts have entered
                into modern ecological thinking with little knowledge of their
                remote origins and political orientation. But such a demanding
                notion of independence could not have emerged solely from
                ideological considerations. Here, the mountainous terrain of
                the Greek archipelago comes verymuch to our aid. “Nature
                gave to Greece, as to her neighbors, the tendency to equality
                together with abundant opportunities for the growth of public
                opinion, and then intensified these forces by strictly limiting
                the areas in which they could operate,” observes Alfred
                Zimmern. “Each little plain, rigidly sealed within its mountain-
                barriers and with its population concentrated upon its small
                portion of good soil, seems formed to be a complete world of its
                own. Make your way up the pasture-land, over the pass and
                down on to the fields and orchards on the other side, and you
                will find new traditions and customs, new laws and new gods,
                and most probably a new dialect.... The Greeks were not
                painfully taught to value local independence. They grew up
                unable to conceive of any other state of government. It was a
                legacy slowly deposited through the long period of isolation
                which intervened between the first settlement of the Hellenic
                invaders and their emergence centuries later as a civilized
                race. They never themselves realized, even their greatest
                writers did not realize, how unique and remarkable their
                political institutions were.”{18}
108 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Colorful and truthful as these lines may be, Zimmern
                understates the extent to which Greek thinkers were conscious
                of their heritage and political uniqueness. Indeed, as we shall
                see, it was the extraordinary acuity of this consciousness that
                imbued Athens with a high sense of mission and clear sense of
                direction. No political sphere was more carefully, thoughtfully,
                and artistically crafted than the Athenian. Equality or isonomia
                followed from an even more basic; influence than Greece’s
                mountainous terrain exercised on its pocket-sized communities
                of free villagers. To five in such isolation and forced
                independence required that every family and family-sized
                community had to fend for itself. The Greek farmer had to be a
                well-rounded man in a more tangible sense than we use this
                cliche today. He was obliged to know how to fight for his
                land,as well as cultivate it, build his shelters as well as repair
                them, methodically tend to his wounds as well as cunningly
                avoid needless conflicts, plan his long-range needs as well as
                satisfy his immediate ones, function as a caring father, loyal
                spouse, dutiful son, supportive brother, a wary buyer of things
                that his co mm unity could not produce—in short, he needed to
                combine a working knowledge of all the techniques needed for
                his survival with soldiering and “politicking.” Together with his
                spouse, who presided over all the domestic affairs of the
                family, the Greek farmer gained in practical competence and
                personal fortitude what isolation denied him in acculturation. In
                the Latin sense of competere—to be fit, proper, or qualified—
                he had no equal in the ancient world. Hence, he could be
                “unequalled” by self-anointed superiors who tried to
                subordinate him and assert their authority over his destiny. A
                magnificent amateur, he embodied the nascent citizenship in
109 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                which all his peers acknowledged the need for a self-possessed
                individual who could be entrusted as much with the affairs of
                his community as with the satisfaction of his private needs.
                The flow of ideas from the independence of a mountain-
                dwelling villager to the egalitarianism of a polis-dwelling citizen
                must be seen as an unbroken continuum. The Greek language
                itself is magnificently processual and organic. A crucially
                important word such as arche, from which an entire political
                vocabulary has been constructed, denotes the originating
                principle as well as the ordering principle of any kosmos, the
                Greek word for “order” in the broadest sense of the term. To
                think of an “order” without deriving it from its origin and,
                hence, the latent possibilities that it could fulfill is linguistically
                built into the Greek mind—and also provides us with an
                important clue to the language’s ethical thrust. Origin, history,
                f ulfillm ent, and possibility—all form a unified whole in Greek,
                so that whether we choose to speak of the universe,
                humankind, the polis, or the citizen, these concepts, charged
                with ethical meaning, denote the unity of civic, natural, and
                social life or what we call “connectedness” today. Accordingly,
                autarchies or self-sufficient communities lead us organically—
                deductively, if you will—to independence, competence, and
                isonomia. The Greek polis has its arche in this germinal
                phasing of a highly competent farmer who, by an immanent
                process of sociopolitical development, found his fulfillment as a
                highly competent citizen.
                The old Greek aristocracy was no mere anachronism in this
                process. The Athenian democracy did not shed it; rather, it
                tried, with qualified success, to absorb it. Its epic culture,
110 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                gospel of valor, high sense of philia, and code of honor, marked
                by a disdain for material thin gs, were incorporated into the
                puritanical virtues of
                the democracy, which abjured luxury, ornateness of dress,
                culinary delights, and self-indulgence. The democratic hero
                was not only valorous but sternly self-willed and emotionally
                controlled. Warrior manliness did not die; it was reworked into
                civic loyalty, personal dignity, and a high regard for virtuous
                behavior. The comradeship of the military camp became the
                isonomia of the ekklesia in which human worth was seen as
                virtually interchangeable. Citizens were expected not only to
                be competent but to be competent equals. Hence, all could
                participate in the governance of the polis on the same footing,
                a practice which, as we shall see, was translated into the
                widespread use of sortition and attempts to arrive at decisions
                by consensus as well as by voting.
                It is worth emphasizing that nearly all the men who turned
                Athens from an aristocratic oligarchy into a democratic polity
                were of noble lineage, Solon, Kleisthenes, and Perikles, to cite
                the most well-known figures in forming the democracy, were
                members of the most elite clans, the genos, of Attica, the
                territorial domain of Athens. In contrast to their Roman
                counterparts, however, they did not become the leaders of an
                unruly partes populares, nor did they try to rise in an
                oppressive hierarchy by throwing away their fortunes in gifts to
                a debased urban mob. They were commonly men of
                exceptional distinction who could be as heroically selfless in
                political causes as their ancestors were heroically valorous in
                military ones. As Werner Jaeger was to point out, Athens did

                not destroy its aristocracy but rather tried to turn its entire
                citizen body into one.
                This pithy formulation has several levels of meaning. Politically,
                it sums up the slow but sweeping way in which Attica’s “bribe-
                devouring” nobles were shorn of their power. By the seventh
                century B.C., Athens and its environs were on the brink of
                revolution. Plutarch tells us that the “common people were
                weighed down with debts they owed to a few rich men. They
                either cultivated their lands for them and paid them a sixth of
                the produce and were hence called Hectemorioi and Thetes, or
                else they pledged their own persons to raise money and could
                be seized by their creditors, some of them being enslaved at
                home, and others being sold to foreigners abroad. Many
                parents were even forced to sell their own children (for there
                was no law to prevent this) or to go into exile because of the
                harshness of their creditors. However, the majority, which
                included the men of most spirit, began to make common cause
                together and encourage one another not to resign themselves
                to these injustices, but to choose a man they co,uld trust to
                lead them. Having done this, they proposed to set all enslaved
                debtors free, redistribute the land and make a complete reform
                of the constitution.”{19}
                At this point, Athens might have easily gone the way of Rome.
                Five centuries later; the Gracchi brothers, who faced a nearly
                identical crisis between bitterly polarized classes of landless
                peasants and bloated patricians, raised such sweeping
                demands for political change and agrarian reform that they
                opened irreparable wounds in the Roman body politic. It
                remains to the credit of the Athenians that the crisis was
112 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                handled very gingerly. The moderation that Hellenic society
                turned into a deeply personal as well as civic ethos was to find
                its embodiment in Solon, a noble of considerable prestige who
                had earned the respect of the Athenians as a whole. No one
                could have contained the crisis that faced his people with
                greater prudence.
                Elected archon of the polis—its chief magistrate—and invested
                with sweeping powers to resolve the, conflict, Solon followed
                the middle course that eluded the Gracchi and the more
                sincere populates in the closing years of the Republic. For the
                poorest of the demos—the Hectemorioi and Thetes—he
                removed their most pressing economic burden by cancelling
                all outstanding debts and making debt slavery illegal. To
                strengthen their political status, he revived and expanded the
                functions of the ekklesia, which had virtually ceased to exist
                since tribal days. The assembly was authorized not only to
                enact the community’s laws and elect its magistrates; it
                convened as a court of justice to deal with all cases other than
                homicide, a crucial advance in empowering the demos, The
                upper crust of the nobility—the Eupatridai—were obliged to
                relinquish their hereditary claim to, furnish Athens with its
                archons, a powerful, annually elected magistracy whose
                number Solon increased to nine. The office, to be sure, could
                only be filled by landowners, but the door to executive power,
                which later generations were to open, was now unlocked for
                the demos.
                Solon never pretended that he desired the political and
                economic supremacy of demos, nor did he try to divest the
                nobility of power. As his verses indicated, he shrewdly steered
113 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                a middle course through a crisis that would have exploded in
                social chaos had any of the contending orders gained absolute
                supremacy over the others:
                To the mass of people I gave the power they needed,
                Neither degrading them, nor giving them too much rein;
                For those who already possessed great power and wealth
                I saw to it that their interests were not harmed.
                I stood guard with a broad shield before both parties
                And prevented either from triumphing unjustly.{20}
                The land magnates were not deprived of their holdings, nor
                were the Hectemorioi permitted to reclaim the sixth of their
                produce that was taken by their landlords. Usury still plagued
                the Attic peasantry, although the lender and borrower were
                more evenly squared off by the controls that the ekklesia
                exercised over legal disputes. Solon also created a Council of
                Four Hundred—the famous Athenian boule—to which only
                propertied men could be elected annually. However, the boule
                served to check not only the popular ekklesia by rigorously
                determining its agenda and supervising its deliberations; it also
                checked the behavior of the aristocratic Council of the
                Areopagus (formerly the powerful Council of the Eupatridai),
                whose functions over the years were to, become more
                ceremonial than political. A number of reforms, unique for their
                time, were made to expand individual rights and alter popular
                etiquette. An heiress, burdened by an impotent husband, was
                free to marry his next of kin, and relatively poor women were
                spared the need to collect dowries. Individuals could will their
                property as they ‘chose, not according to familial dictates—a
                law that struck an important blow at the collective solidity of
114 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the aristocratic genos and its concentration of sizable wealth. A
                number of lesser laws restricted displays of excessive luxury
                and riches. But perhaps the most strikingly Hellenic law
                imputed to Solon was one that disenfranchised any citizen
                who, to use Plutarch’s words, “in the event of revolution, does
                not take one side or the other.” It was Solon’s intention,
                Plutarch emphasized, not to reward citizens who seek the
                safety of neutrality, apathy, or indifference at the expense of
                the public interest. Athenians were expected to be politically
                involved, irrespective of the causes to which they adhered, or
                else they were not worthy of citizenship. It was an affront to the
                Hellenic concept of citizenship for a man to prudently and
                selfishly “sit back in safety waiting to see which side would
                win.”
                Characteristically, Solon refused to linger on as a tyrant by no
                means a pejorative term or a despised status in those days
                despite pleas that he become one, and went into voluntary
                exile for ten years. His work did not resolve all the political and
                economic problems that brought him to the archonship, nor did
                it prevent a tyrant from ultimately replacing him. But it
                provided Athens with the opportunity to absorb his reforms and
                the time needed for its citizenry to mature politically—to use
                and accustom itself to the ekklesia, to learn the arts of
                compromise, and to develop a political etiquette that fostered
                a sense of civic commonality rather than social conflict. The
                rather mild tyranny of Peisistratus and his son Hippias, which
                followed Solon s departure, greatly reduced the power of the
                Attic nobility and initiated the economic and political changes
                that were to lead to the democracy. Recalcitrant nobles were
115 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                forced into exile and their estates divided among the poor. The
                needy were given livestock and seed, exports were promoted,
                and a vigorous foreign policy opened new markets to Athenian
                commerce. Peisistratus, despite the personal control he
                exercised over Attica’s affairs and his blatant nepotism,
                adhered to the Solonic constitution so meticulously that even
                Solon was induced to support him after his return to Athens.
                The political level of the Athenian citizen was raised
                enormously by the tyranny, and the commoners—farmers,
                shepherds, artisans, and merchants—benefited so
                considerably from the archonships of Peisistratus and Hippias
                that the tyranny became self-vitiating. Three generations had
                passed since Solon had been given the archonship, and Athens
                was now ready for a democracy. In terms of the mere flow of
                events, the efforts to initiate authentic popular rule seemed to
                come almost as a reaction to attempts by the aristocracy to
                restore their old clannish oligarchy, and many of the
                democracy’s features must be seen as institutionalized efforts
                to prevent the emergence of entrenched power by elites of any
                kind. But the Athenian people, too, seem to have become more
                certain of themselves and their capacity to govern their own
                affairs. The aristocracy, in turn, appears to have suffered a
                genuine lack of nerve. After a feeble attempt to eliminate the
                reforms of Solon and the Peisistradae, the nobles broke ranks.
                One of their own kind, Kleisthenes, the head of the aristocratic
                Alcmaenodae, became archon in 506 B.C., and the
                democraticization of Athens was launched in earnest.
                Kleisthenes struck decisively at the societal basis of aristocratic
                power—the traditional kinship network that gave the Attic
116 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                nobility its very sense of identity. The ancient Greek phratries
                and clans were simply divested of any political power and
                gradually declined in importance for want of any significant
                functions. The old Ionian system of four ancestral tribes was
                converted into ten Strictly territorial “tribes” based exclusively
                on residence. The villages and towns of Attica, in turn, became
                outlying sections of Athens and were designated as “demes”
                instead of genoi. Politics now became inseparable from
                territorialism: the demes, with their own popular assemblies,
                were grouped together in varying numbers into thirds or
                trittyes, and three trittyes, in turn, constituted a tribe, hence
                Attica was composed of thirty trittyes. Ten of the thirty demoi
                were composed of residents in or around Athens; another ten,
                from the maritime districts; and the remainder from the
                interior.
                Kleisthenes shrewdly placed one urban trittys in each of the
                ten tribes, so that the Attic agrarians from whom the nobles
                garnered whatever popular support they had were politically
                buffered by City citizens—the men who were to form the
                backbone of the democracy. This switch in the governance
                system of the polis was Strategic: it fostered the power of a
                citizenry that was distinctly urbane, cosmopolitan, and forward
                looking, vitiating the strongly hierarchical structure of a once-
                entrenched, highly parochial, feudal class system. At the same
                time, tradition was kept alive by using the language of the
                tribal world (even the word gene had a special clannish origin),
                retaining a number of local religious associations, chieftainlike
                figures such as demarchs (the deme’s version of the Athenian
                archons), and by making membership in a dome hereditary

                even though a citizen might choose to reside at some later
                time in another part of Attica. Kleisthenes, in effect,
                “revolutionized” Athenian political life in the literal sense of the
                term: he replaced a once-egalitarian tribal system that had
                been perverted into a harsh feudal hierarchy by a tribalistic
                structure that actually restored the old freedoms of the people
                on an entirely new political and societal level. Athens had
                revolved in a full circle—more precisely, a spiral—to the
                isonomia of its tribal past, but without the innocence that made
                the early Greeks vulnerable to hierarchy and domination.
                The boule was increased from a council of four hundred to five
                hundred and restructured so that fifty men from each of the
                ten tribes rotated every tenth of the year as an administrative
                “executive committee” between sessions of the ekklesia. Each
                tribe selected its fifty bouleutes by lot, a practice that became
                so widespread that even archons were so chosen from
                members of the boule, as were members of Athenian juries
                (dikastoi) and lesser functionaries. Apart from the polis’s
                magistrates, no property qualifications debarred Athenian
                citizens from participating in the governance system, and
                under Perikles the last restrictions that lingered on from
                Kleisthenes’s reforms disappeared completely. In time,
                members of the boule, the ekklesia, and the heliaea or courts
                were compensated for participating in these institutions,
                generally on a per diem basis and in the case of the boule,
                annually. No public office could be held for more than a year,
                and with certain exceptions (jurymen and generals) none could
                be held more than twice in a lifetime.
                This extraordinary opening of public life to the Athenian
118 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                citizenry was completed during the sixty years that saw
                Kleisthenes assume the archonship in: 492 B.C. and the
                outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431. An analytic account
                of the democracy, its possibilities and its limitations, properly
                belongs to the discussion of civic freedom that follows in the
                next chapter. For the present, what counts is the way the
                democracy formed the citizenry and, in turn, was formed by it.
                Democratic leaders such as Kleisthenes and Perikles did not
                foist a remarkably open system of participatory governance on
                a passive people; the institutional structure and the body
                politic interacted closely with each other against a haunting
                background of quasitribal social forms and relationships. This is
                politics at its best—in a lived sense, not a formal one. The
                Athenian notion of areté, the daily practice of paideia, and the
                institutional structure of the polis were synthesized into an
                ideal of citizenship that the individual tried to realize as a form
                of self-expression, not an obligatory burden of self-denial.
                Citizenship became an ethos, a creative art, indeed, a civic cult
                rather than a demanding body of duties and a palliative body
                of rights. At his best, the Athenian citizen tried not only to
                participate as fully as possible in a far-reaching network of
                institutions that elicited his presence as an active being; the
                democracy turned his participation into a drama that found
                visible and emotional expression in rituals, games, artwork, a
                civic religion—in short, a collective sense of feeling and
                solidarity that underpinned a collective sense of responsibility
                and. duty. This drama extended beyond life itself. The Athenian
                citizen had little hope of any certain immortality other than the
                memory he left behind in the polis. Afterlife became a form of
                political life and eternahty existed only insofar as noble political
119 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                actions were memorable enough to become part of the polis’s
                history and destiny.
                The polis shrewdly availed itself of aristocratic attributes to
                bring the individual Athenian into the full light of citizenship,
                with its high standards of civic responsibility. We have seen
                how the agora prepared the way for the ekklesia. By the same
                token, the gymnasium, presided over by a paidotribes,
                extended the all-consuming fascination of the Greeks for
                athletics into martial arts, thereby preparing the young for
                military training. Troubling as this may be in modern eyes, war
                was a fact of life in antiquity. Apart from certain cults and
                religions, pacifism found no following among the ancients. One
                either fought unquestioningly for one’s city or faced clientage
                and slavery in the event of defeat. The citizen-soldier was
                much more than: a pillar of Athenian military strategy. He was
                a guardian not only of the polis but also of the democracy, as
                we shall see later, just as the citizen-farmer became the
                embodiment of its ideal of autarkeia.
                But the polis, particularly the democracy, gave the family’s
                aristocratic attributes a uniquely public character. And it is in
                this non-elitist sense that the democracy elevated its citizens
                into an “aristocracy”—not only as a result of the participatory
                nature of Its courts, assemblies, and councils, but also the
                familial mood of koinonia that its civic festivals engendered.
                Without losing their essentially religious character, rituals and
                festivals became a form of politics. The ekklesia opened with
                prayers, and its agenda was composed of sacred as well as
                secular topics. Problems of constructing temples or planning
                festivals occupied the assembly as earnestly as matters such

                as ostracism or the ratification of treaties. In famous funeral
                oration, which so vividly captures the spirit of the democracy,
                Perikles cites among its attributes “the contests and sacrifices
                throughout the year, which provide us with more relaxation
                from work than exists in any other city.”{21} Webster’s
                observation that the Athenians tended to turn their holy days
                into holidays suffers from a certain degree of
                misunderstanding.{22} Athenian life struck a remarkable
                balance between religiosity and secularity: the camaraderie of
                participating in a spectacle or sharing fully in the excitement of
                the games imparted a quasireligious sense of communion to
                civic life. This sense of communion more accurately conveys
                the intense meaning of koinonia than do such commonplace
                words as “community.” At the risk of repitition, we could say
                that such shared experiences unravel the Athenian notion of
                “community” as an on-going activity of communizing, not
                simply an institutionalized form of participation. Like the agora,
                the “contests and games” of Athens often created a shared
                sense of preternatural civic enchantment.
                The democrats knew this very well and these “contests and
                games” occurred with considerable frequency. To discuss them
                in detail would require a volume in itself. Let it suffice to say
                that every year, many days were devoted to the Lesser
                Mysteries in February and the Greater Mysteries in September,
                rituals that centered around Persephone’s descent into Hades
                and Demeter’s mourning, the mythical explanation for the
                occurrence of winter and its lean months. Every July, Athenians
                participated in the Lesser Panathenaia, which culminated
                quadrennially in the Greater Panathenaia, an extraordinary

                parade of Athenians and Athenian life in full array, if we are to
                judge from the bas relief that girdles the Parthenon. Almost
                every month, Athenians witnessed or participated in a variety
                of rituals, contests (athletic, musical, poetic, and choral), or
                celebrations to honor deities, historic events, great
                personages, victors in Panhellenic festivals such as the
                Olympics or the fallen of past and recent battles. Religion and
                civic loyalty blended the great variety of personal and social
                interests within the body politic into an underlying
                commonality of outlook that, if it did not remove serious
                conflicts, rarely reached such desperate levels that they could
                efface the democracy from within. Ultimately, it was to be
                Macedonian rule that brought the democracy to its definitive
                end, not the Athenians. For all its shortcomings, the democracy
                in various forms persisted through nearly two of the most
                stormy centuries of the ancient world and, at its height,
                exhibited a degree of cultural and intellectual creativity that
                has no peer in western history.
                Perhaps the most important of the Athenian festivals was a
                comparatively new one: the City Dionysia. Even more than the
                Greater Panathenaia, when all of Athens went on display with a
                large tapestry (the pelops) that depicted the triumph of
                Olympian “reason” over the chthonic rule of “force,” the City
                Dionysia was strongly democratic in its focus. It was then, for
                three out of a span of six days that overlapped March and April,
                that Athenians could witness the great dramatic tragedies that
                gave the democracy its ideological meaning. By the
                thousands, Athenians flocked to the Theater of Dionysos on the
                southeast slope of the Acropolis to see the plays of Aeskylos,
122 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Sophokles, Euripides, and others who literally created serious
                drama in western culture. Under the clear skies of a high
                Mediterranean spring, they watched with absorption the
                Aeskylean drama of their own polis and its human antecedents
                unfold with a majesty that may have verged on reverence—
                certainly a thrilling sense of exaltation that compels a modern
                historian of the democracy, W. G. Forrest, to cite Aeskylos “as
                the greatest of the three Athenian tragedians,” and for many,
                including myself, the greatest of the world’s dramatists.{23}
                Aeskylos’s trilogy, the Oresteia, advanced a powerful validation
                of the democracy that, in its emotional and declaratory power,
                may even exceed the funeral oration of Perikles—a trilogy that
                was constantly replayed and kept winning prizes at the City
                Dionysos long after the author’s death.
                Its story has been told and interpreted repeatedly, and to
                explore it at length would be a tiresome redundancy. Let it
                suffice to say that the murder of Agamemnon, the returning
                chief of the besiegers of Troy, by his wife, Klytemnestra,
                followed by her own death at the hands of her vengeful son,
                Orestes, opens the whole drama of Athens’s transformation
                from a quasitribal society, rooted in kinship rules, custom, and
                chthonic deities, into a political community—a polis—based on
                residence, reason, and the anthropomorphic Olympians. It is
                Athene who, in a challenging statement against the Erinyes
                (the three female guardians of “matriarchal” blood ties and
                tribal retribution for the murder of one’s kin), solemnly
                declares:
                It is my task to render final judgement here.
                This is a ballot for Orestes I shall cast.
123 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                There is no mother anywhere who gave me birth,
                and, but for marriage, I am always for the male
                with all my heart, and strongly on my father’s side.
                So; in a case where the wife has killed her husband, lord of the
                house, her death shall not mean most to me. And if the other
                votes
                are even, then Orestes wins.{24}
                After being pursued by the Erinyes for committing a blood
                crime more damning than a marital one—and particularly
                against his mother from whom early tribal descent may have
                been traced—Orestes is absolved and the Erinyes reconciled
                by acquiring a civic status as Eumenides, the kindly ones who
                look after the well-being of the Athenian polis.
                The trilogy has many levels of meaning, probably all of which
                had a gripping effect on the audience that knew Aeskylos
                personally or, in later years, by reputation. The Eumenides, the
                last drama of the trilogy, celebrates the victory of civic law and
                rationality over tribal custom and unthinking mimesis. Athene,
                born of Zeus’s head, embodies logos and justice. In a strongly
                patriarchal society that saw male rationality as the sole
                bulwark to dark chaos and an uncertain, untamed world, it was
                not difficult to identify “fickle” woman with nature and the polis
                as the sole realm of freedom and law. Orestes’ trial, which
                marks the culmination of the trilogy, is presented as a new
                dispensation in the affairs of men. The Erinyes unrelentingly
                pursue any homicidal perpetrator of the blood tie. All that
                counts with them is the act of murder of one’s kin, not the
                circumstances or motive that produced it. To the Athenians,
                this behavior was evidence of unreasoning tribalism, of an
124 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                irrationality that precluded any civic union based on discourse,
                logic, and orderly compromise. Recourse to trial rather than
                ordeal, to the weighing of circumstantial evidence, motive, and
                logical judgement rather than mere action and contests of
                fortitude, marked the first step toward a political koinonia—the
                city as a polis.
                To the Athenian audience, which believed Athens was the first
                city to establish a system of laws, the trial of Orestes was a
                founding act. Athens’s decision to try homicide by a judicial
                process literally created the polis as an ethical union based on
                justice. “If it please you, men of Attica,” intoned Athene, the
                patroness of the polis, “hear my decree now, on this first case
                of bloodletting I have judged. For Aegeus’ population, this
                forevermore shall be the ground [the Hill of Ares] where
                justices deliberate-No anarchy, no rule of a single master.... I
                establish this tribunal. It shall be untouched by moneymaking,
                grave but quick to wrath, watchful to protect those who sleep,
                a sentry on the land.”{25} Henceforth, justice, not tradition;
                reason, not custom; fact, not ordeal; motive, not myth are to
                guide the men of Attica, for without this new dispensation, the
                polis has no ethical meaning, nor does the democracy have an
                ethical rationale.
                It is easy to see in Aeskylos not only the clearest voice of the
                polis, of a body politic free of arbitary rule, but also of the
                democracy—whether as a “radical,” as Forrest declares, or as a
                “revolutionary poet,” as George Thomson seems to believe.
                {26} To the Athenians, who apparently revered Aeskylos, the
                Oresteia unfolds the emergence of justice from a hazy “dark”
                world of tribal antiquity and its fortunes in the arbitrary domain
125 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                of warriors, nobles, and the genoi, into the clear light of the
                polis and its orderly citizenry. The identification of the audience
                with the drama must have been intensely personal; it was the
                authentic protagonist of the play. Of Aeskylos’s remaining
                dramas, Prometheus Bound arrests us to this very day with its
                message of heroic defiance against unfeeling authority and its
                expansive belief in humanity’s sense of promise, indeed its
                capacity to advance toward an ever-wider horizen of intellect
                and wisdom.
                It would be easy enough to end our discussion of the Athenian
                drama with Aeskylos, but Sophokles beckons us with other
                facets of meaning that must have deeply affected the Athenian
                spirit. His Antigone raises the ambiguities of justice in the form
                of conflicting Individuals, indeed personalities. Antigone herself
                becomes the ombodiment of tribal kinship rules in her frenzied
                zeal to bury the body of her brother, Polyneikes, whom Kreon,
                the King of Thebes, wishes to leave to vultures and dogs as an
                example for future rebels. Kreon thus appears as the
                embodiment of secular authority, the civil counterpart to
                Antigone. The drama emerges as a fugue, in which deeply
                emotive ethical themes are played against each other and
                intermesh. If Aeskylos’s characters tend to appear as forces
                rather than individuals, despite Klytemnestra’s awesome
                personality and Athene’s majesty, Antigone wins us as a
                persecuted heroine who seeks the burial of her brother s body
                and Kreon as the willful embodiment of civil rule, prior even to
                the rise of the polis. For we are still in the time of the royal oikos
                or household. In writing the drama, Sophokles may have tried
                to show that after the decline of this prepolitical world of blood
126 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                clans and regal palaces the Athenian citizen no longer had to
                confront the pangs of tragedy in Hegel’s sense of the term—a
                drama in which both sides are right. The polis spares us the
                need to pit divine law in the form of tribal commandment
                against human law in the form of civil retribution for rebellion.
                We can read our romantic sympathies for Antigone into the
                drama, but a Greek audience might have viewed her
                differently. It would have been obliged to place Kreon’s civil
                obligation on a par with Antigone s tribal obligation, and its
                sympathies would have been allotted according to political as
                well as personal sensibilities. Relief emerges from the sense of
                delivery that a concealed theme in the drama affords: the free
                air of the polis in which the citizen can breathe without the
                presence of such exotic conflicts.
                Such is also the case in one of Sophokles’s most celebrated—
                and possibly one of his most misunderstood—plays, Oedipus
                the King and Oedipus at Colonus. Here man, potentially the
                citizen, rises to a clear and level gaze at his fate and his ability
                to learn from suffering. If there is anything that impresses us
                about the play, it is the fact that Oedipus emerges with greater
                nobility toward the end of his life, all his misfortunes
                notwithstanding, than in its portentous beginnings. No broken
                King Lear confronts us but rather a hero whose passion for
                truth ultimately transcends the disastrous impact of patricide
                and incest. The cathartic core of the drama is unmistakable: it
                is the nobility of the individual, purged of archaic curses and
                trammels, of man’s high promise and destiny to achieve
                insight and wisdom when he acquires the status of a free
                citizen.

                Yet, the Greek ideal of the citizen, in contrast to ours, is not
                monadic. However individuated the Greek drama became with
                Sophokles and even more decidedly so with Euripides, the
                Athenian citizen would have mocked the entrenched bourgeois
                myth that the free man is an atomized buyer and seller whose
                choices are constrained by his own psychological and physical
                infirmities. He would have seen beyond the arrogance of this
                self-deception into the pathos of the bourgeois citizen’s
                clientage to the powerful, his aimless pursuit of wealth, his
                reduction of life to the acquisition of things—in short, a moira
                or destiny governed more by ananke or necessity than by the
                understanding that even such a nascent personality as
                Oedipus brings to his own insight into reality. Such a despised
                bourgeois being, he would have concluded, is no less archaic
                than the Erinyes, who must be freed from their primality as
                mere forces and reconstructed by reason and justice into the
                “kindly ones.” Only then, in synchronicity and ethical union
                with the polis, is citizenship more than a formality and its
                practice more than a ritual.
                By the same token, the Athenian citizen was not a corporate
                being in our usual meaning of the term. Most present-day
                discussions of the Athenian’s lack of individuality and the
                polis’s tendency to subserve his personality to an overbearing
                collectivity are weighed down by Eurocentrically neurotic
                images of the individual as such. The modern identification of
                individuality with egotism and personality with neurosis has
                been overindulged under the rubric of “modernity” with an
                arrogance that bears comparison only with the conceited
                claims of psychoanalysis and psychohistory to explain the
128 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                human drama in all its aspects. That human beings can be
                individuated in different ways—some as highly social and
                political beings, others as private and self-indulgent beings, still
                others as combinations and permutations of both—is as alien
                to the imperialistic claims of “modernity” as it is to the
                admirers of gemeinschaft, the stagnant folk community based
                on kinship and organismic relationships. To the Hellenic citizen
                of a polis, leaving all its mythic origins aside, the monad would
                have seemed as prehuman as the folk community seemed
                prepolitical. Individuality meant citizenship. And, ideally,
                citizenship meant the personal wholeness that came from
                deep roots in tradition, a complexity of social bonds, richly
                articulated civic relationships, shared festivals, philia, freedom
                from clientage and freedom for collective self-determination
                through institutions that fostered the full participation and
                everyday practice of a creative body politic. To he such a
                citizen, one had to live in a polis—a city that possessed an
                agora, a space to convene general assemblies of the people, a
                theater to dramatize the reality and ideology of freedom, and
                the ceremonial squares, avenues, and temples that gave it
                reverential meaning. To remove any of these elements that
                made up this whole was to instantly destroy it. Without every
                one of them, cultivated on a daily basis by the paideia of
                citizenship and guided by an unerring concept of areté, the
                Athenian ideal of citizenship fell apart and its institutions
                became hollow forms.
                But such notions, valuable as they may be, lack a processual
                content that sees this whole from the standpoint of an ever-
                fuller development. We can see this by looking closely at the

                quixotic nature of the Greek dramatic tragedy itself—the
                staged experience of the polis and citizen. For it was through
                the tragedy that the Athenian underwent self-examination,
                much as though he could withdraw from his own skin and
                observe himself thoughtfully for what he really was. It is
                notable that all the tragedies we have at our disposal are made
                up of mythic and epic material. As civic experiences, they
                seem to function dissonantly with stuff that is drawn from a
                prepolitical world, from eras that precede the polis in its most
                advanced stage of development. Their heroes and heroines
                are Bronze Age characters who still live under the
                commandments of a tribal or warrior society, by canons of
                right and wrong that are archaic at best and chthonic at worst.
                In the transformations that the dramas recount from one world
                to another, we rarely seem to rise from new foundations
                embedded in still older ones to the edifice that the audience
                knew at hand—the polis of the, fifth century B.C. and its
                democracy.
                Yet the antiquity of the characters, material, and themes with
                which all the great tragedians seem to have worked is belied
                by a startling sense of innovation, by tensions from which new
                ideals, institutions, and credos are born. The, Oresteia seems
                to not only justify radically new communal dispensations,
                indeed most of which already existed when the trilogy was
                presented; its radicalism consists in the fact that Athene’s
                decrees are fraught with the promise of change, with motives
                that are likely to yield ever-wider ethical and political horizons.
                One senses that a community guided by justice has just begun
                to emerge, that the civic ideal of freedom is still nascent, that

                citizenship and the polis are still experiencing birth pangs and
                their future still lies before them. Few Athenians, I suspect,
                could have left such dramas without feeling an intense sense
                of futurity and a serene commitment to growth. Prometheus
                Bound is even more challenging in its thirst for heroic
                innovation and its passion for a fuller arid richer experiential
                life, as are the Oedipus dramas for truth at all costs.
                Hence, seemingly conservative material is played, replayed,
                and ultimately transmuted into searingly progressive hopes
                and possibilities. When we bear witness to these dramas by
                viewing them in all their starkness as idealized “archetypes” of
                an immutable human nature, we do violence to the tensions
                they probably produced in the Athenian audiences of their day.
                These plays were no mere spectacles or cathartic outlets for
                pent-up civic anxieties. Quite to the contrary: they were
                sources of motivation and tension, designed to move their
                audiences forward to noble deeds and great enterprises, to
                contrast past with present so that meaning, continuity, and
                tendency could be imparted to the future. They voiced a hope
                in the human spirit that belies the conventional interpretation
                of the Athenian drama as fatalistic in its view of life and
                resigned in its image of destiny. Indeed, it is with Euripides, that
                most “modern,” “realistic,” and “individualistic” of the Greek
                tragedians, that hopelessness, alienation, and the insufferable
                burden of circumstances seem to devour the characters of the
                drama and exhaust the hopes of the audience. Here, the deus
                ex machina snaps up the immanent dialectic of the older
                drama with its promise of futurity and hope.
                The polis was no less a theater for the practice of virtue than

                the orchestra at the foot of the Acropolis was a home for the
                performance of the plays it watched. And the citizen was no
                less an actor in a great civic drama than the men who
                performed for him with masks in the City Dionysos. In both
                cases, the plot we call the history of Athens incorporated the
                layered traditions that formed its cultural biography and
                ideology. So central was the citizen to this plot with his
                “freedom for” as well as his “freedom from,” that the histories
                of the time, when they refer to Attica, speak more commonly of
                “the Athenians” than they do of “Athens.” Unerringly, they
                reveal that Athens was no mere collection of structures, no
                simple geographic locale, that any aggregate of people could
                occupy without the polis losing its authenticity. Admittedly, the
                city outlived the polis, and the democracy in a formal sense
                outlived the citizens. Democratic institutions persisted in a
                truncated form long after Athens s final defeat by the
                Macedonians at Krannon in 322 B.C. No city was a polis, in
                Aristotle’s view, unless it had an agora; but, needless, to say,
                no agora could have produced a democracy unless it had the
                kind of citizen the historians of that day called “the Athenians.”
                There is a myth that the classical Athenian polis was the
                spontaneous product of custom and tradition. Hence, its
                integrity rested largely on hidden presuppositions of which it
                was largely unconscious, indeed, to which it was sublimely
                oblivious. This notion of an unreflective Athenian morality,
                imputed to Hegel and held by many romantics in the last
                century, is belied by almost everything we know about the
                democracy. The Aeskylean tragedies and Perikles’s funeral
                oration, to cite two highly important and widely separated
132 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                examples, completely refute the image of the democracy as a
                phenomenon based on mere habit and convention. One must
                totally ignore Kleisthenes’s reforms and the subtle melding of
                religious tradition with clearly formulated political goals not to
                recognize that the democracy was a consciously crafted
                structure, the product of purposeful, insightful, and thoughtful
                efforts to achieve clearly perceived goals—and, let me add,
                guided by a philosophy and practice of its own. The
                introduction of the lot, the rotation and limitation of tenure in
                public office, the development of the assembly and the boule—
                all reveal a degree of intentionality and clarity of purpose that
                has few equals in any later constitutional developments. That
                Sokrates was executed for questioning this order on charges
                that were archaic even by conservative standards of fifth-
                century Athens has more to do with the politics of the trial,
                particularly Sokrates’ arrogance and his desire for martyrdom,
                than the challenge his philosophy posed to the polis’s “ethical
                order.” No political community was more aware of its
                uniqueness and wondrous of its achievement than the
                Athenian democracy. And no one was more consciously
                committed to this humanly wrought body of institutions than
                the Athenian citizen.
                By contrast, later ideals of citizenship, even insofar as they
                were modeled on the Athenian, seem more unfinished and
                immature than the original—hence, the very considerable
                discussion I have given to the Athenian citizen and his context.
                As we shall see shortly, there were impressive attempts to
                create patterns of civic freedom that approximated the
                democratic polis in medieval city-states and in the American
133 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                and French revolutions. These attempts were usually intuitive.
                The Americans who attended town meetings in New England
                after 1760 and the French sans-culottes who filled the radical
                sections of Paris in 1793–94 were hardly aware of the political
                drama that unfolded in Athens some two millennia earlier,
                although their more knowledgeable spokesmen fingered
                Plutarch throughout their lives and occasionally adopted heroic
                names during fervent moments of the two revolutions. What
                was lacking in their attempts to achieve a living approximation
                of civic democracy was not merely ideology. Greece,
                commonly Athens (although Sparta’s garrison-state was a
                close runner-up for some utopian writers and for Rousseau),
                was held up as a fascinating experiment in popular self-
                governance and, as usual, compromised with the republican
                ideals generated by the emerging nation-state,
                For this reason, the Athenian ideal of citizenship, like its parallel
                creation, politics, demands careful exploration today even
                more than at any time in the past. If moderns find democratic
                politics and citizenship a desideratum, they will never achieve
                them without a supreme act of consciousness. They must not
                only want it but know it. Athenian civic goals, for all their
                shortcomings (notably Athens’s treatment of women, alien
                residents, and its widespread use of slave labor), must be
                rooted in an everyday notion of what we mean by politics. Is it
                statecraft? Or does it center around social entities such as
                cooperative, vocational societies or tribes in the
                countercultural sense of this much-abused term? Or some
                broad concept of grass-roots organization that passes under
                words such as “localism,” “decentralism,” and
134 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                “bioregionalism”? Is it an educational activity—a civic paideia
                —that fosters the citizen’s empowerment, both spiritually as
                well as institutionally? Or is it primarily a form of
                “management” whose goal is administrative efficiency and
                fiscal shrewdness?
                No modern body of ideas, to my knowledge, has wrestled with
                the answers to these questions adequately enough to draw
                clear distinctions among the social, the political, and the statist
                so that a meaningful outlook can be formulated—one that will
                seek the delicate balance of ingredients (traditional, familial,
                ethical, and institutional) and the paideia that articulates an
                authentically democratic politics with a concept of citizenship
                that gives this outlook reality. Nor do we have a clear idea of
                the extent to which the city, properly conceived as a humanly
                scaled ethical community, differs from urbanization and the
                inhuman scale produced by the nation-state. We rarely
                understand’how integrally an ethical politics is wedded to a
                comprehensible civic scale, to the city itself, conceived as a
                thoroughly manageable and participatory union of citizens,
                richly articulated by tradition and by social, cultural, and
                political forms. We live so contemporaneously within the given
                state of affairs, the overbearing “now” that eternalizes the
                status quo, that no society is more prey to the workings of
                mindless forces than bur own. Bereft of a serious regard for
                history, indeed for the experiences of our own century, we find
                ourselves in the airless vacuum of an immutable “present/ a
                time warp that precludes any sense of futurity and ability to
                reason innovatively.
                Accordingly, where thinking of a crude kind does exist, lines of
135 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                thought fecklessly crisscross each other like the scrawlings of
                an infant that can barely grasp a pencil. Oligarchies are
                accepted as democracies; virtual monarchies as republics;
                state institutions as social forms; social forms as political ones.
                One, can hardly speak, here, of a kind of shallow eclecticism
                that afflicts every age; rather one encounters a potpourri of
                unfinished notions, barely worthy of being called “ideas,” that
                are mingled together in the viscera rather than the head. To
                think out ideas to their logical conclusion, to be consistent and
                complete in thought, is viewed as a form of intellectual
                aggression that stimulates reticence or withdrawal rather than
                dialogue or response. The modern “ego” is now so fragile that
                the mere presence of passion, particularly in the form of
                argumentation, is a stimulus to flight or, worse, cause for a
                yielding quietism. The emphasis that the Athenians placed on
                speaking, which was identified with democracy, spells out the
                extent to which a qualitative breach separates our pitiful image
                of public activity from the classical one of two millennia ago.
                What should be stressed, for the present, is that the Athenian
                ideal of citizenship did not die in the formal sense, even after
                Macedonia had eviscerated the democracy. The ekklesia and
                boule functioned for generations after Athens lost her
                independence; the institutions were kept alive as a political sop
                to the Mediterranean-wide belief in Athens’s uniqueness, all
                the more to cloak a growing despotism that finally caused the
                last institutional vestiges of the democracy to wither
                completely. And here lies a lesson that later institutionally
                oriented democrats were to learn at great cost. An agora does
                not in itself produce a polis, nor does an ekklesia in itself
136 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                produce citizens. All of them must exist, to be sure, if a
                democracy is to be established; but they remain mere
                formalities if they fail to interact in the proper way to form a
                unified whole. It was this largely formal sense of democracy
                and citizenship that served, in part at least, to abort the only
                attempt to rescue the Roman republic in the guise of the
                Athenian polis. It would be difficult to tell from Plutarch’s
                biographies of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus that the brothers
                were no mere agrarian reformers; indeed that their laws to
                supplant the Senate’s powers by the authority of the comitia
                tributa came as close to a fundamental political revolution as
                Rome ever experienced. The brothers, in M. I. Rostovtzeff’s
                view, were clearly out to “set up at Rome a democracy of the
                Greek type,” a “dream or farce,” as he calls It, that was
                designed “to transfer from the Senate to the popular assembly
                the decision of all important business, or, in other words, to set
                up at Rome a democracy after the Athenian model.”{27} Nor
                Was this goal entirely impractical, at least institutionally. “To
                secure this point no special law was required: according to the
                constitution all important business was, in theory, settled by
                the popular assembly; the innovation was this, that business
                which by custom had hitherto been decided by the Senate was
                now laid by [Gaius] Gracchus, as tribune, before the popular
                assembly, for their consideration and decision.”{28}
                The effort ultimately foundered not for want of institutional
                mechanisms but for lack of a genuine citizenry. Despite
                Rostovtzeff’s aristocratic biases, he is on solid ground when he
                emphasizes that “to allow land even to every member of the
                proletariat could never bring back a time when the state rested
137 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                NOCurely upon a strong peasant population.”{29} The culture
                that produced men such as Cincinnatus or the elder Cato was
                waning and had to be recovered or a new one developed in its
                place if mere institutional changes were to be viable and
                lasting. The Gracchi would have had to deal with still another
                change that would ultimately undermine the entire republican
                edifice. Rome was no longer a city in any Hellenic sense of the
                term. It was the center of an emerging empire, an urbs, to use
                the conventional Latin word for “city,” that had ceased to be a
                civitas, the word Romans commonly used to denote a “union of
                citizens.” The terminological distinction is apt: the Roman urbs
                was growing uncontrollably by the second century B.C., at the
                expense of the Roman civitas; it was sprawling outwardly in
                size as well as worldwide in scope, especially after the spoils of
                the Punic Wars began to fill its coffers. Conceivably, the
                yeoman-citizens who founded the republic could have turned it
                into a democracy. But once they “came down from the Seven
                Hills” on which Rome was founded, they became “small,” to
                use Heine’s words. The “idea of Rome” as a spiritual heritage
                diminished in direct proportion to the growth of the city. “The
                greater Rome grew,” Heine wrote, “the more this idea dilated;
                the individual lost himself in it: the great men who remain
                eminent are borne up by this idea, and it makes the littleness
                of the little men even more pronounced.”{30}
                The decline of the ancient world did not efface the ideals that
                Athens and Rome inspired. Later eras were to blur them so that
                we now speak of two kinds of “democracy,” “direct” and

                heritage. During inspired moments, medieval and modern

                cities were to fluctuate between the two and, at times, come
                closer to a Hellenic democracy and citizenry than the Gracchi
                could have achieved in Rome. What these cities achieved in
                fact, however, they rarely achieved in ideology; hence their
                patterns of civic freedom were basically intuitive creations.
                They did not last long. But in an era of chilling discontinuities,
                when our knowledge of western culture is in grave peril of
                disappearing, we can no more ignore the legacy of their
                example than we can ignore the sprawling urbanization that
                threatens our civic identity and political freedom.
                Chapter Five: Patterns of Civic Freedom
                Although the city was the cultural center of the ancient world,
                its material base was extremely fragile. Hence the remarkable
                rise and fall of cities throughout antiquity. City life depended to
                a remarkable degree on the viability and the economy of
                agrarian communities and labor so that cities appear more as
                islands in a vast rural ocean than self-sustaining economic
                entities. Indeed, prudent estimates of the number of rural
                workers needed to sustain a single city dweller have been
                placed at a ratio of ten to one. Hence any serious agricultural
                catastrophe like a drought, floods, or pest infestation, not to
                speak of wars that devastated agriculture, could lead to the
                breakdown, indeed the complete disappearance, of a major
                city as so many civic ruins from antiquity attest to this very day.
                The fragile dependence of the city on the countryside’s
                economy placed a high.premium on the stability of urban
                institutions. The Hellenic emphasis on the polis as a realm of
                reason that had to vigilantly guard itself against a surrounding

                world of chaotic uncertainty and mindless barbarism—a
                sensibility so important to understanding its attitude toward
                women, slaves, and aliens—is not without its roots in the
                compelling realities of ancient urban life. A nature tamed by
                man, specifically by well-established and reliable farmers,
                forms the matrix of Hellenic philosophy and the great cultural
                monuments of the Athenian polis. Civic democracy was largely
                an agrarian democracy, and its ideal of the farmer-citizen,
                however dubious it became in the later history of the polis, was
                the product of a very viable agrarian heritage. Rome, too,
                developed these ideals and did ndt require Greek culture to
                produce them.
                Correspondingly, the ancient city was not only a center for
                country life whose standards were formed by farmers, later by
                nobles and “country gentlemen,” but it was “seafaring” in a
                very loose sense of the term. Owing to the insecurity that the
                city felt as an “atoll... on an ocean of rural primitivism,” it direly
                needed access to the sea to cope with any dislocations
                between town and country. The all-important factor that could
                correct any imbalances caused by drought, flood, plague, arid
                other such disasters was imports or, put more bluntly, the
                tribute that a city-state could exact from a league of captive
                “allies” or the victims of outright conquest. The Delian League,i
                which Athens established to assert its supremacy over the
                eastern Mediterranean, quickly turned into a relatively modest
                looting enterprise to feed and provide the “good fife” for its
                citizens. The Roman Empire is a lasting historical example of
                parasitism run riot to the point of moral, cultural, and societal
                suicide.

                Hence, ancient cities were located within a hundred miles or so
                of the Mediterranean Sea or close to navigable rivers that led
                to major bodies-of water. Ancient Lugdunum (modern Lyons)
                provides us, with an example of a city that Rome founded in 43
                B.C., deeply inland in Gaul, that was. felicitously located at the
                confluence of the Rhone and Saone rivers. Beyond the coasts
                and rivers, cities dwindled to towns and, not much farther, to
                villages and hamlets that then phased into a little known
                wilderness where military forts kept a guarded eye on restless
                barbarian tribes. Ancient cities were never autonomous urban
                centers. Fragile in the extreme, they depended upon local
                agricultural communities for the most important essentials of
                fife, a very simple technology, and a considerable amount of
                human muscle power to work it, If they expanded beyond the
                capacity of their agricultural base, they direly needed tribute
                from other city-states to sustain themselves unless they
                enjoyed natural blessings such as the Nile, whose annual
                overflow in September provided Egypt with endless quantities
                of fertile soil from the highlands of Ethiopia.
                Modern urban dwellers tend to feel uneasy about so tentative
                and qualified an image of the city., We like to think of cities as
                “eternal” and urban cultural fife as free of rural social
                influences. We are willing to grant that cities do change with
                architectural innovations, technology, and societal advances
                but that basically they are immune to the ravages of time and
                the vicissitudes of history. The tombs of buried cities in
                Anatolia, Mesopotamia, North Africa, and the ruins of Central
                America and Mexico are grim reminders that cities can die
                forever without successors to overlay them, indeed that
141 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                historically they have been terribly Vulnerable to social and
                ecological changes. Nor do we like to think that, cities have any
                significant roots in agrarian societies, Indeed that they did not
                always “dominate” the countryside in the (ill-encompassing
                sense that they do today. The enormous power modern cities
                exercise over rural fife—not only economically and
                technologically but culturally—seems to be a historic destiny in
                Our eyes that is structured into citification or “civilization” from
                its very origins, a telos that predestines urban fife to achieve
                lasting supremacy over all other fife ways. The great urban
                belts that sprawl across the land, ugly as they may be, appear
                to us as the culmination, perhaps the fulfillment, of a drama in
                which early temple cities or Greek poleis were merely
                archetypal characters ill a larger and more sweeping civic story
                that reaches its climax In what we call “modernity” and all its
                citified amenities. That contemporary urbanization does not
                represent the culmination or fulfillment of citification, that the
                history of the city cannot be properly understood with the
                hindsight and Eurocentricity of a New Yorker, Parisian, Berliner,
                or Londoner reveals a modern conceit that under critical
                examination tells us how skewed and misleading are popular
                ideas of how cities actually developed and the special
                identities they acquired.
                This conceit, to be sure, is not entirely modern. Ancient
                empires such as the Babylonian and Persian built cities to last
                and earnestly believed in their immortality. The Greek image of
                the polis as immortal was woven into the heroic image of the
                democratic citizen and the ideal that noble actions would yield
                a lasting fame that would survive his own mortality. The words
142 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                “eternal Rome” are proverbial. Even before the rise of
                Christianity, they entered deeply into the consciousness of the
                city’s citizens. As it turned out, the closing years of the empire,
                a span of two centuries before it finally fell apart, were riddled
                by deep civic pessimism. The Romans of that time were filled
                with a fatalistic despair about the future of their city and
                eventually transferred their allegiance from the “eternal city”
                to the “City of God.”
                What distinguished their civic optimism from our civic
                arrogance, however, is our preening belief in the autonomy of
                the city, our conviction that city life and its traditions have
                always enjoyed a supremacy over rural lifeways and cultures,
                indeed that the former stands in innovative and exciting
                contrast to the latter. This conceit is very different from the
                ancient commitment to the city and has its origins in the highly
                introverted civic development of Europe during the late Middle
                Ages. Judging from the comedies of antiquity, Greeks and
                Romans had their “country bumpkins” who were the naive foils
                for “city slickers. But the ancients never doubted that these
                “bumpkins” were their “country cousins” in a very real cultural
                and material sense. The ancestral farm, if an urban citizen
                owned one, or the family village where the bones of his
                ancestors lay, was a place to which he repaired from the
                demands and stresses of city living. It was there that he found
                his “roots” and from there that he carried his household deities
                into the very confines of the city. It was from the country, too,
                that he acquired his bread, cheese, figs, and precious olives so
                characteristic of Mediterranean fare, for no doubt existed in his
                mind that, all its cultural amenities aside, the city was
143 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                materially dependent upon the immediate countryside and the
                farmers who trundled its produce into his squares.
                His political fife, such as it was after the decline of the polis, had
                a distinct rural imprint: it centered around assemblies even in
                Rome and other cities outside Latium, on such councils of
                “elders” as the Senate, and, in republican times, on a citizen-
                militia, all of which were institutions formed by early village
                and town democracies. It is in this sense, by no means a strictly
                exploitative one, that we can agree with Chester G. Starr’s
                observation that nearly all ancient cities “controlled a wide
                expanse of countryside, which extended in more recently
                urbanized areas as far as fifty miles or more from the city walls;
                they thus resembled an American or English county more than
                our purely urban units of government. Commerce and industry
                might have some significance within this complex but did not
                need to do so, for its unity rested primarily on administrative,
                agricultural, and psychological bonds.”{31} A brisk walk of an
                hour or so could bring a Roman within clear sight of farmland
                and within two or three additional hours to villages that
                seemed largely untouched by urban culture.
                That the ancient city also carried enormous political weight in
                Mediterranean life and was a source of considerable ferment,
                indeed, potentially, of serious rebellions against its imperial
                sovereigns, is a fact that never left the minds of the Roman
                emperors. Not that the peasantry was totally passive and free
                of strong resentments—not only toward the imperial city but
                also its own urban centers. Attica’s “party of the Plain,” as
                historians call it, enviously regarded the Athenian town-dweller
                as a parasite and periodically aligned itself against him, hence

                Kleisthenes’ shrewd admixture of urban with rural trittyes to
                neutralize these conflicts. In Roman times a rural police was
                created by the city, particularly In the Near East, to maintain
                “order” among the agricultural poor.
                But the emperors kept an especially tight rein on the cities
                under their control, for it was here that internecine conflicts
                against urban oligarchies and civic chauvinism could reach
                acute proportions. “The ancient city was an institution which
                swallowed up much of its citizens’ hearts,” Starr tells us, and
                Roman emperors “were undoubtedly right in feeling that the
                Roman world could not endure outright war among its
                constituent units but the necessary alternative was deplorable:
                the race for titles was miserable stuff to fire civic loyalty and to
                promote urban thinking.”{32} Ultimately, through imperial
                paternalism, legal constraints, and the use of oligarchies to
                control or deflect the anger of lower orders in their own cities,
                “the vigor of local politics waned; the cities were not granted,
                as a substitute, a really significant, inspiriting influence on the
                imperial government. In all this the Empire was wiping out not
                merely freedom of thought in the political Sphere but the very
                possibility of serious political action for the bulk of its subjects.
                So it was destroying a very important focus for the forces which
                had led to the expansion and remarkable vitality of
                Mediterranean civilization up to this point. The upper classes
                and the Caesars both delivered devastating blows at the sense
                of local attachment, the solidarity of the city, from which the
                thinkers of the past had drawn their strength.” Whatever
                Roman civilization seemed to produce in the way of order and
                uniformity of laws, it more than destroyed in the way of

                creativity and political commitment. By the latter part of the
                fifth century A.D., the Mediterranean basin had ceased to be
                either orderly or innovative. In balance, the cost of imperial and
                bureaucratic control from above with its loss of local control
                and participation outweighed, by far, the dubious benefits it
                professed to confer and the entire basin suffered a collapse
                that was to haunt civilization throughout future centuries.[6]
                By contrast to the Mediterranean basin, Europe through the
                Middle Ages and well into modern times followed a very
                different development. Although European patterns of civic
                freedom never equalled the institutional and political creativity
                of the polis, many medieval communes were as vital and
                energetic as the Greek cities, and it is from this world that
                modern images of urban supremacy really derive. From the
                thirteenth century onward, particularly in Italy and the
                lowlands of modern Belgium and Holland, city-states began to
                emerge that were structured around uniquely urban tasks—
                artisan oriented, financial, commercial, and industrial—that
                slowly loosened urban fife from its traditional agrarian matrix
                and provided the town with an authentic civic fife and
                momentum of its own.
                Which is not to say that medieval towns and cities ceased to be
                dependent upon their rural environs for food and raw
                materials. But as time passed, in different parts of western
                Europe, it was to be the city that gradually remade the
                countryside in its own image and entangled the landed nobility
                in its own economic and political concerns. And ultimately it
                was to be the city that imposed its technics, economic
                relationships, culture, and values on agrarian communities.

                Traditional agrarian attitudes did not place a high premium on
                artisans, merchants, and financiers; these were not orders that
                were respected in ancient society. A Greek or Roman
                “bourgeois” who made a profitable income from trade and
                workshops tried to accumulate enough wealth in order to retire
                on landed property of his own and five in rural gentility with the
                airs of a noble. Capital migrated from town to country, not the
                reverse. The medieval world radically altered this movement.
                For the first time on a large scale, urban entrepreneurs began,
                to view their vocations as honorable and invest their earnings
                from generation to generation in their own enterprises.
                As family fortunes increased, they remained in the city and
                were not invested into estates. Quite to the contrary, it was the
                Italian and Flemish noble who often moved to town and began
                to enchance his own fortunes by involving himself in industry,
                trade, and foreign promise. The “merchant prince” of the
                Middle Ages was not simply a euphemism for men of ignoble
                lineages who managed to, acquire “princely” fortunes from
                trade. The words often included noblemen of highly prestigious
                families who regarded the city as a center of a very lucrative
                commerce and began to participate in it with the avidity of the
                most pedestrian burgher.
                How this reversal of traditional trends occurred can only be
                noted summarily here, The breakup of the top-heavy, highly
                parasitic, and costly Roman Empire led to a general retreat of
                the Latin cities and their European affines in Iberia, Gaul, and
                Britain to their authentic ecological chora: the land base that
                could properly support a modest urban population. As sources
                of tribute began to break away from the empire and its
147 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                provinces were assailed by repeated invasions of semitribal
                German, Slav, and Magyar peoples, the fragile ancient city
                dwindled to little more than a village scale, at least in western
                Europe where urban fife had a, very limited land base and
                abutted the vast forest that still covered most of the continent.
                Rome’s population alone declined from its highpoint of a
                million to less than 50,000 in the “Dark Ages” that followed and
                never fully recovered demographically through the medieval
                period, despite its enormous importance as the center of
                western Christianity. Already, as early as the third century, the
                European provinces such as Iberia, Gaul, and Britain began to
                detach themselves from the empire in everything but name
                and move toward a localist economy that produced only for
                their own particular needs. As John Mundy and Peter
                Reisenberg point out, the foundations for a decentralized
                medieval society were not created by German invaders, the
                “barbarians at the gates” who sounded the death knell of a
                terminally ill empire; they were established by Rome itself
                when the late Caesars, faced with a completely unwieldly
                imperial structure, set each order in Roman society adrift with
                the necessary “duties, privileges and special jurisdictions [it
                needed] to implement its work.” Each group, in effect, was
                obliged to make “its own law” in order to survive. “Moreover,
                the old classical conception of liberty was replaced by
                something less grand but more socially exact. Gildsmen, or
                collegiati, were privileged, for example, even to the equestrian
                grade. But privilege depended upon obligatory service. This
                perception of an inmixture of liberty and servitude pervaded
                late Roman and much of medieval social thought.”{33}

                The veering of the former Roman provinces toward a highly
                localist society, one in which each component was internally
                held together by an elaborate hierarchy of clearly defined
                rights and duties, laid the foundations for European feudalism.
                Autarchy, now based on hierarchy, surfaced with a vengeance
                in the form of minutely segmented and self-sufficient
                communities, all supported by agriculture and a rude form of
                manorial artisanship. Cities that were once the islands in a
                rural world largely disappeared while the rural society seemed
                to solidify into minute congeries of simple manors, each
                surrounded by small dependent villages. The serfs who
                peopled these villages were not attached permanently to the
                land. Both manor and village, in turn, seemed to be haunted by
                the nearby debris of ruined cities, some partly occupied, which
                were testimony to an exotic world clouded by legends of past
                greatness and the misty traditions of imperial power. Within
                this setting, we do not have to go too far to understand the
                origins of the Arthurian legends of Britain and the dreams of
                grandeur that clustered around the name of Charlemagne.
                These ruins came to fife very slowly, often as the building
                materials of churches, modest villas, and town halls. The
                medieval towns and the few cities that we find in the eleventh
                century after the great tides of “barbarian” invaders and the
                fractured empires of Charlemagne receded into history were
                very unusual phenomena. Although they were never
                independent materially, there is a very real sense in which they
                were to become quite autonomous economically, to an extent,
                in fact, that was quite rare in the ancient city. To begin with,
                they were not simply religious or administrative centers as
149 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                were so many of their classical predecessors, although such
                centers were fairly common in medieval Europe. What is
                significant about them is that they were largely structured
                around the tasks that most markedly distinguish the city from
                the agrarian village: crafts, trade, a nascent form of
                mechanized industry, and a culture—moral, artistic,
                architectural, and even religious—that is peculiar to such a
                citified constellation of activities. No longer was nonagricultural
                work demeaning, nor for that matter was work generally, as
                ultimately became the case during the imperial period of Rome
                and the old Mediterranean slavocracy. Quite to the contrary,
                nonagricultural work was to be celebrated over all other forms
                as authentic evidence of “civilization,” so that, etymologically
                speaking, the word now came into its own. The artisan and
                tradesman, normally metics whom the ancient city dweller
                viewed with condescension as the urban counterparts of the
                rural “primitives” (the view that the imperial age created
                toward its once idealized yeomanry), now found themselves
                the center of a new concept of urbanity, indeed, the city’s most
                prized and productive member. Trade itself, which aristocrats
                at all times slyly exploited to their own advantage, was openly
                acknowledged as an honorable enterprise, and wealthy
                merchants began to give lavishly of their fortunes to adorn this
                new civic temple to their interests. However much the Church
                viewed profit making as intrinsically evil, it soon learned to
                accommodate itself to this new civic reality despite its pious
                denunciations of gain from the pulpit.
                This new kind of city appeared not only because of the
                extraordinary energy Europe brought to a world drained by
150 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                imperial tribute; it also emerged because of the inherent
                weakness that marked a highly decentralized and parochial
                system of agriculture. Whatever may be the image Roman
                nobles developed of their servile farming orders, the
                aristocrats of the ancient world still prized their status and
                traditions as landed gentry. To own a large estate, worked by
                gangs of slaves and tenants, was as much a calling as it was a
                lucrative enterprise. The nobles, moreover, had used the
                Empire to wrest all political power from the artisan and
                merchant orders, and thus gave their imprimature to the
                ancient city: its odium of parasitism, display, indolence, luxury,
                and class arrogance. The cities they now controlled became
                monuments to their power as lords of a basically agrarian
                economy and culture. Under the Caesars, this economy and
                culture did not disappear; quite to the contrary, it was greatly
                strengthened by a huge bureaucracy and enriched by an
                immense flow of tribute. The ancient city never transcended
                these economic and cultural limits. The polis, to be sure, gave
                it a creativity that made civic life seem like a work of art. Rome,
                particularly under the Empire, gave it a highly elaborate state
                apparatus that made it a self-destructive engine for exploiting
                Mediterranean society.
                The medieval city was more fortunate and found itself
                surprisingly free of these limits. Agrarian society in the Middle
                Ages was much too fragmented to establish lasting obstacles
                to urban development:, and its culture was much too
                introverted to challenge the new “civilization” nurtured by the
                towns. The famous medieval maxim, “Urban air makes for
                freedom/’ could be, said to include freedom of thought and an
151 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                openness to innovation as well as personal and political liberty.
                Like a calculating observer who can patiently stand by while his
                opponents exhaust themselves in mutual combat, the
                medieval towns played for time and waited for the temporal
                lords to drain their strength in the ceaseless rivalries that
                marked the era. When the local nobles were weak enough or
                drained of their wealth, the cities stepped in to assert their own
                autonomy, either by buying their freedom or by force of arms,
                and ultimately were to assert their supremacy over the
                countryside.
                This drama, to be sure, did not unfold with the elegant
                consistency we often expect from a good story. Many cities and
                towns failed to gain their freedom for generations, despite
                bitter struggles with their territorial lords. And when they did
                so, their liberties were often fragile and highly vulnerable to
                internal as well as external challenges. In retrospect, however,
                we can see a fairly distinct pattern of civic freedom emerge,
                not only from territorial lords but also structurally, within the
                medieval civitas itself. The Italian city-states, in particular,
                provide the dramatis personae and almost exemplary “plot
                lines” for an overall story of European civic development. Not
                that other cities—Flemish, German, French, and Swiss—are not
                good examples in their own right, or, in some cases, more
                lasting patterns of civic freedom. But what Lauro Martines calls
                the “power and, imagination” of the Italian city-states is so
                vibrant, so artistically creative and institutionally stimulating,
                that one senses a degree of organicity and roundedness rarely
                matched for that period by other European regions.{34} And if
                we rise above the national chauvinism that afflicted
152 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                medievalists of the recent past, it would be hard to disagree
                with Mundy that the “distinction between the northern
                European and Italian town” drawn by Belgium’s great historian,
                Henri Pirenne, a distinction that so greatly biased a whole
                generation of medieval scholars toward the northern city-
                states, “seems to have no basis in fact, at least through the
                ages of urban renewal up to the twelfth century,” a time when
                urban freedom reached its peak internally.{35}
                We also know that the movement for civic freedom really
                began in Italy and only later did it move up to Flanders,
                northern France, and southern, Germany. Thereafter it became
                a contagion in the cities of western and central Europe. To
                discuss so mixed and uneven a development in civic freedom’
                we would be obliged to leap almost dervishly from one region
                to another to uncover the underlying sequence of events that
                makes medieval urban development reasonably intelligible. If
                most of this account focuses on the Italian experience, it is
                because the peninsula’s city-states encapsulate in a clearly
                definable area the basic cycle that marked the rise and decline
                of civic democracy in Europe as a whole. Indeed, it was in Italy
                that the city-state of the High Middle Ages was to come into its
                own, and it is from the rich accounts of that civic world—its
                extraordinary art and architecture, its changing political
                relationships, and its cycle of birth, maturation, and decay—
                that the European municipality was to play out its most
                authentic internal development and lead, almost unerringly, to
                the urban drama that is unfolding before our eyes today.
                The origins of these city-states need not concern us. After at
                least a millennium of urban development, from the legendary
153 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                founding of Rome in 753 B.C. to the last of the emperors in 476
                A.D., probably no area in ancient Europe was more citified than
                Italy and few municipalities exhibited more staying power than
                those that the German invaders engulfed as they rolled over
                the peninsula. Thus, Italian cities never really disappeared.
                However much they declined demographically, they recovered
                fairly early and by the tenth century began to grow with
                exceptional verve and energy.
                Nor need we trouble ourselves too much about the factors that
                led to this recovery. So far as the northern Mediterranean was
                concerned, the Saracen floodtide that swept over the basin
                began to recede by the eleventh century: even Sicily was
                reclaimed for Christianity by 1091, after two centuries of
                Muslim occupation. By this time, a lively trade existed between
                Italian and Arab merchants until the Mediterranean between
                the twelfth and fourteenth centuries was largely controlled by
                the Italian city-states lake from 1150 to 1350. These city-states
                were soon the major entrepot agents that brought Christian
                and Muslim into commercial contact with each other, and the
                economic foundations for a flourishing municipal fife were
                securely established.
                The locale of the Italian city-state, or communa to use its
                medieval Latin name, covered most of the northern and
                central areas of the peninsula and embraced the great
                Renaissance cities of Florence, Venice, Verona, Pisa, Sienna,
                and Cremona, to cite only a few, and those great political nodal
                points of Italy’s history, Milan, Genoa, and Bologna. It is not the
                Renaissance that will concern us here, except insofar as the
                Dominican Fra Savonarola represented a popular reaction to
154 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the aristocratic and simoniacal world that fostered it, and it is
                not the communa as a “city republic,” words so easily
                interchangeable with “city-state” that will be our main focus of
                interest. What is insufficiently known about the Italian
                commune is the extent to which it became a stage for a
                working democracy and its actors a new expression for an
                active citizenry. Dazzling as its cultural treasures and
                adventurous as its stories may be, we must put aside the pure
                glamour of the commune and examine those brief periods
                when it seemed more like a polis than a republic.
                Democracy clearly emerged in the early Italian cities, not only
                representative forms of governance and oligarchies of various
                kinds, only to submerge and then reappear again for a short
                time in richly articulated forms. Its principal institution took
                the.form of a popular assembly and we hear of it almost from
                the inception of the commune itself. The Italian commune, it
                should be clear, was not simply a community or even a town in
                the customary civic sense of the term, although it was this as
                well. It was above all an association of burghers who were
                solemnly united by an oath or conjuratio, The conjuratio, in
                contrast to the formation of a community by mere force of
                circumstances and events, turned what we might simply
                designate as a town into a vibrant fraternity. Although
                motivated by shared practical concerns, the burghers who took
                this oath were presumably foreswearing their personal self-
                interest on behalf of a common one, a conscious act of mutual
                fealty not to a local noble, cleric, military chieftain, or distant
                monarch. Despite its strongly religious terms, it was an act of
                citizenship, unique in an age of religious congregations, that
155 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                pledged members of the commune to respect each others’
                civic rights and extend them untampered to newcomers and
                future generations.
                The conjuratio, in fact, did considerably more: it committed the
                citizens of the commune to orderly and broadly consensual
                ways of governing themselves with a decent respect for
                individual liberty and a pledge to their mutual defense. The
                stormy conflicts between the monarchs of the Holy Roman
                Empire and their Italian vassals, and more disruptively
                between local bishops, nobles, and military captains over
                landed domains and control over the cities, were resolved by a
                delineable and, at times, a logical course of urban
                development to which the conjuratio forms a point of ethical
                entry. Once the cities replaced arbitrary rule with some kind of
                elective rule, coordinates emerged for gauging its political
                evolution. Men then swore to aid and defend each other, to
                pledge their prestige and bring their personal jurisdictions to
                the service of a shared community, and to respectfully invest
                the chosen heads of this civic association with executive and
                judicial powers. A consulate, composed of all the consuls in
                formal assembly, constituted the highest executive and judicial
                magistracy of this remarkable association. We know that its
                members were chosen at a general assembly of the commune
                itself, a popular assembly that “was quite likely convened with
                some regularity, and in times of trouble even more often,”
                Lauro Martines tells us. “Here the views of leading men were
                heard and important decisions taken, usually by acclamation.”
                We know, too, that this general assembly of “all the members
                of the commune” was the “oldest communal institution” of
156 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                these Italian cities, and further, that the, consuls usually
                “sounded out the general assembly” before they made any
                major decisions about such issues as war and peace, taxes,
                and laws.{36} What is so vexing is that we know so little about
                this revival of a highly democratic, face-to-face form of political
                control and of the citizens who created it. Whether age
                endowed it with the legitimacy of an unbroken tradition back to
                ancient times, we do not know—only that it was the oldest of
                the commune’s structures. This much is clear: whatever
                authority the assembly enjoyed prior to the consulate—that is,
                if it existed at all before the conjuratio—is clouded by the
                furious infighting between clerics, nobles, opportunists of all
                kinds who managed to grasp and lose control of the cities for
                nearly two centuries before these civic entities freed
                themselves of arbitrary rule and disruptive rivalries.
                Considering the volatility of the Italian city-states, the
                assembly soon lost ground to the consulate and the consuls,
                who began to elect their own successors. The Italian city was
                never to be restrained by such Hellenic mores as “nothing in
                excess” or the Pythagorean ideal of harmonia. One could
                almost say that seldom did anything but excess and explosive
                political theatrics, mark these fervent and creative urban
                entities. In any case, civic leadership fell into the hands of
                large, wealthy families who were to establish the parameters
                of civic ‘politics for centuries to come, even after they were
                temporarily removed from power or replaced by newcomers
                from within or outside the city. The assembly, in turn, never
                totally disappeared. It lingered on in a highly atrophied form
                and haunted the oligarchs and despots who usurped its

                powers. We know that in Bergamo, for example, as elsewhere,
                outgoing consuls were obliged to hold elections for new ones in
                popular assemblies, although the nomination of candidates
                was the privilege of only a few. Such practices persisted well
                into the twelfth century when cities such as Genoa and Pistoia
                tried to eliminate prearranged nominations of consuls between
                electors that favored one of the parties at the expense of
                another.
                In time, this early popular democracy gave way to republican
                forms of governance, and the powers of the city were invested
                in a large legislature dominated by influential urban families. In
                some places, the assembly continued on as a vestige to be
                manipulated by oligarchs. Elsewhere, it was replaced by
                “assemblies” that were simply republican legislatures.
                “Emulating all princely courts and the general assemblies in
                Italian towns, some of these [representative] assemblies
                hoped to meet four times a year,” observes John H. Mundy.
                “This was impracticable for general assemblies, but smaller
                select councils often did meet three or four times
                yearly....”{37} Although Mundy is referring here specifically to
                England, the drift from popular assemblies to oligarchical
                councils was as true of Italy as it was for Europe generally. The
                “conciliarism,” as this parliamentary trend was called,
                essentially replaced civic democracies, such as they were, with
                authentic city republics, and the great towns of Italy looked
                more, institutionally speaking, like preimperial Rome than
                classical Athens.
                We must not suppose, however, that Italy became a
                centralized State at this time, even on a municipal base.

                Whether as a democracy or a republic, the Italian city rested to
                an astonishing extent on little neighborhood “communes” that
                existed within the larger urban commune. We have no parallel
                for this development in ancient Athens or Rome. Irrespective of
                the kind of consulate it had, the city’s neighborhoods acquired
                an autonomy of their own that is truly spectacular by any
                standards of civic governance. Fortified towers rose
                everywhere—in Milan, Florence, Pisa, Verona, Pavia, Parma,
                and the like—held by noble families in consortia or sworn
                family groupings that were pledged to maintain their
                neighborhood turf against other corporate intruders and the
                commune as a whole. Oaths were sworn everywhere in the
                tradition of the conjuratio but so localist in their commitments
                that we can only describe a commune as a loose confederation
                of neighborhood communes, indeed, a confederation of
                neighborhoods within the commune. “When a union of this sort
                brought peace to a neighborhood,” observes Martines, “that
                part of the city became nearly impregnable, because the
                linking of towers and the easy blocking of the narrow streets
                made for an effective domination of the adjoining area.”{38}
                Let there be no mistake about the fact that these consortia
                were anything but neighborhood democracies. The towers
                were built by leading wealthy families who were much too
                powerful in Home respects, and much too weak in others, to
                seize complete control of the commune. They were highly
                localist oligarchies that kept Italian cities in continual turmoil
                until they were supplanted by despotic signori, family
                dynasties ruled by one man who replaced a multitude of
                oligarchies, often to be unseated again and his sons restored in

                reckless shifts of aristocratic and military power. Italian civic
                history is not notable for any even or linear development from
                democracy through republican systems to oligarchy,
                monarchy, and despotism. All five of these institutional forms
                bubbled up in an unpredictable assortment of patterns,
                predominantly as one at certain times or in combination with
                each other on many other occasions. Ultimately, the
                Renaissance cities settled down as oligarchies and princely
                courts where an electrifying but aristocratic humanism gave us
                the priceless artistic treasures of that era.
                But the consortia created “bad” and lasting habits that
                fostered a highly democratic atmosphere at the base of city
                fife. It produced neighborhood loyalty and citizen
                empowerment with a vengeance. “Propertied urban
                inhabitants were attached tenaciously not merely to a city but
                to a street, a parish, an ambience—to a radius of perhaps 150
                meters,” declares Martines. “And though a citizen might
                frequent an estate in the country, he lived in the city and there,
                if fortunate, he died. More likely than not, he married someone
                from that vicinage, and all his main blood ties, as well as his
                closest friendships, were there. The character of the
                neighborhood could be so distinctive, could’ leave so deep an
                imprint on its inhabitants, as to make for different linguistic
                expressions and even for different intonations or accents.
                Dante detected neighborhood differences in speech at
                Bologna.”[7]{39}
                These loyalties gave the commune a political vitality it never
                fully lost until recent times. Conciliar governance did not
                abolish major democratic features of the city such as the
160 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                selection of consuls by sortition at Lucca, for example, where
                the neighborhoods or contrada convened in their own
                assemblies and “lots were drawn,” notes Daniel Waley,
                whereupon “each of the 550 men who drew slips inscribed
                elector consiliari then had the duty of naming one man from his
                own contrada as a councillor.”{40} When the podesta system
                of government or podesteria was established in Italian
                communes that vested all executive power in a single man, he
                too was often chosen this way. In Vicenza during the mid-
                thirteenth century, twenty city electors “were chosen by lot,
                and of these twelve were eliminated by voting; the eight
                remaining electors then proposed three names, from which the
                final choice was made by a further vote of the council.”{41}
                The councils, in turn, often required a quorum of two-thirds to
                arrive at a decision, and in some cities councillors were fined
                for failing to attend. Nor is it unusual to learn that a majority of
                two-thirds was needed to make major decisions, at which time
                even larger quorums and majorities as high as 10/11 or 16/17
                were required—proportions that could almost be regarded as
                consensual.
                The podesteria, for all its majesty and seeming absolutism,
                was by no means the authoritarian ogre it initially appears to
                be. A podesta was not selected from any members of the
                community. He had to be an outsider who could distance
                himself from the internecine familial and factional conflicts that
                often brought the city to the brink of chaos, hence too the
                elaborate electoral system that was meant to buffer the
                influence of particularly powerful groups. Nor could he come
                from a neighboring commune, which obviously was privy to
161 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the city’s infighting. He was selected for his impartiality, for his
                legal training, and ordinarily held his office for no more than a
                year, often as little as six months. The consulate, like the
                assembly, did not disappear; indeed, in Treviso as late as 1283,
                general assemblies of virtually all resident citizens who
                enjoyed rights to public office were convened to deal with
                emergencies, even if only to bestow almost despotic powers of
                control on a military captain.
                A detailed account of the podesteria, signori, the later courts of
                the Sforza and Medici, and the republican oligarchies that
                overturned these various forms of one-man control, would
                require a volume in itself. Here we must focus on the conflict
                between the “People” and the “nobility,” the popolo and
                nobilta as they were called respectively. Equivalently, we could
                have called the “people” the “foot soldiers” or pedites and the
                “nobility” the “knights” or milites, the military
                characterizations so redolent of the rise of Greece’s hoplites
                and the supremacy they achieved over the aristocratic cavalry.
                The parallel, limited as it may be, is quite instructive. What the
                Italian citizens of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries
                called the popolo was in no sense the urban poor, the Thetes of
                ancient Athens. The poor in the commune were a socially
                inchoate stratum of journeymen, relatively unskilled craftsmen
                who verged on being proletarians, laborers, servants, itinerant
                tradesmen, runaway serfs, and that vast déclassé of beggars
                and thieves who plagued the medieval cities almost from their
                inception. Many of these elements could be expected to follow
                any standard that filled their empty pockets. In a feudal world
                where a feeling of social place was crucial to one’s sense of
162 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                self-regard, they were outside the pale of the commune’s life
                and its broader political concerns.
                ^yhat the commune meant by the popolo were men with a
                certain amount of material substance, such as master
                craftsmen, professionals, notaries, well-off tradesmen, even
                financiers and an emerging commercial bourgeoisie that
                owned sizable fortunes from foreign trade. Although there was
                a close interlinking of the nobilta and the very well-to-do
                popolo that makes it difficult to draw precise class lines in the
                conflicts that brought the two into opposition with each other,
                many of the popolo were’ virtually excluded from the city’s
                political life and were treated like resident aliens, the metics of
                ancient Athens. They paid its taxes, served in its militia, and
                were subject to all its laws without any right to hold public
                office or enter into its civic councils. In cities of 40,000 or more,
                active citizenship was restricted by property qualifications,
                social status, and length of residence to a thousand or less.
                Although the Milanese popolo provided the city with the
                greatest part of its revenues, for example, they held only one-
                fifth of the consulate’s offices. Later, on the intervention of the
                Holy Roman Emperor, Otto IV, they were given half of the
                conciliar seats. This reform and others like it were enough to
                whet appetites without providing enough sustenance to keep
                them satisfied. In the first half of the thirteenth century, the
                popolo began to take over the reins of power in one commune
                after another—Bologna by 1231, Pistoiain 1237, Florence in
                1250—and to acquire a growing voice in the governance of
                Piacenza, Lodi, Bergamo, Siena, Parma, and Qenoa. “The
                popolo’s breakthrough into politics was the result of
163 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                revolutionary organization,” declares Martines with a
                decisiveness that is not easy to encounter among many
                historians of the era.{42} In a very real sense, perhaps more
                sweeping than we realize, he is correct.
                In retrospect, what makes the popolo’s ways of organizing so
                revolutionary was its highly localist and organic fashion of
                acting politically, a form of organizing that is utterly antithetical
                to modern concepts of party politics. The popolo had turned
                themselves into a neighborhood movement, not unlike the
                contrada in structure and the consorterie in their ‘confederal
                way of interlinking with each other. The noble families of two
                centuries earlier had taught its more servile orders well in the
                arts of political organization and power, The tradition of
                organizing a movement on a block-to-block, square-to-square
                basis had not died out in Italian cities after the podestarie
                subdued the interfamilial squabbles within the nobility. It was
                still very much alive, and the popolo used it well. However
                varied the specific structures this organization produced,
                certain forms clearly emerged from this neighborhood base.
                The rise of vocational gilds provided one very important
                pattern for linking men of the same occupation from different
                neighborhoods into a common organization. Gilds were
                established not only for merchants, physicians, apothecaries,
                jurists, and notaries, but also for smiths, cloth finishers,
                butchers, bakers, furriers, tanners, leather makers and the like,
                generally reflecting the popolo’s social composition as a whole.
                These vocational groups, composed almost exclusively of well-
                to-do tradesmen and master craftsmen in their fields, were the
                earliest popular organizations of which we have any record,
164 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                and they tried not only to control the operations of their crafts
                and its produce but also constituted themselves into armed
                societies with the very distinct goal of controlling the
                commune. Before long, open clashes exploded between the
                popolo and the nobilta at Brescia in 1192, Piacenza in 1198,
                Milan in 1201, and in year-by-year sequence, Cremona, Assisi,
                Lucca, and onward to Pistoia in 1234.
                Neighborhoods were now convulsed by strife between poorly
                trained and the more highly skilled fighters of the noble
                consorterie, Rarely had the armed citizen moved so much to
                the forefront of civic political life. By now, armed popular
                societies based on neighborhood ties began to supplant the
                gilds in order to deal with the endemic warfare that erupted in
                the city’s streets. These societies were better trained than the
                vocational organizations. More closely cemented by their ties
                as neighbors, they had a better knowledge of the quarters in
                which they functioned and they could muster their forces more
                rapidly and on shorter notice as emergencies arose. If Bologna
                can be taken as an example of the enhanced ways of dealing
                with the nobilta, it demonstrated the need for the armed
                neighborhood societies to extend beyond the gild framework
                into a more cohesive, area-oriented, well-synchronized, and
                highly cooperative form of military organization. By the middle
                of the twelfth century, the city could boast of twentyfour armed
                neighborhood companies in comparison to Florence’s twenty
                and still smaller numbers elsewhere. Moreover, the Bolognese
                societies were consolidated across adjacent urban parishes
                into what looked very much like a citywide militia. The popolo,
                to be sure, had not created the idea of a neighborhood militia
165 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                out of thin air; such companies of men living in the same parts
                of the city had been the backbone of the communal military
                system for years. What the popolo did, however, was to
                change the militia’s function from a mere civic guard, designed
                exclusively to defend the commune from external enemies,
                into a politically insurrectionary force designed to change the
                commune’s internal structure and power relationships.
                Florence’s armed societies can be taken as a general example
                of the structure that the popolo established in the popular
                communes of Italy after their victory over the nobilta, The
                twenty neighborhood companies it had created earlier now
                became the commune’s exclusive fighting force, absorbing the
                remains of the old one where it could. In districts where the
                popolo was weak, a larger number of militia units were
                assigned to guard its interests. The rest were equally
                distributed throughout the city. Each company adopted its own
                banner and insignia—a “dragon, a whip, a serpent, a bull, a
                bounding horse, a Hon,” even a ladder, “were emblazoned on
                individual shields and helmets,” Martines notes. “Rigorous
                requirements required guildsmen to keep their arms near at
                hand, above all in troubled times. The call to arms for the
                twenty companies was the ringing of a special bell, posted
                near the main public square. A standard-bearer, flanked by
                four lieutenants, was in command of each company. These
                men were elected by a council of twenty-four members of the
                company and served one year. The Captain of the People was
                the commander of the twenty companies. Being an outsider,
                he was expected to stand above the temptations of local
                partisanship. His oath of office obliged him to call the

                companies to action whenever there was a threat to the
                popolo.... The popolo had no trouble finding only the most
                committed and reliable men for its armed companies. The
                success of this was seen in moments of crisis, when the ardor
                of the companies won many victories for the popolo,” a fact
                that was not lost on Machiavelli some two centuries later when
                he voiced his compelling argument for a citizen-militia as
                opposed to the use of mercenaries in The Prince.{43}
                Once it came to power, the popolo did not completely
                eliminate the podestal constitution. A large Council of the
                People was formed to counterbalance the power of the old
                communal legislature and a powerful council of “elders”
                functioned as the commune’s executive. The Captain of the
                People was elevated to a status that, for all practical purposes,
                matched that of the podesta, and he was fully regaled with a
                court system that paralleled that of the podestal one. The
                popolo, in effect, had structured a dual power into the older
                constitution, matching the communal council with a popular
                one, the podesta with the militia chieftain, and courts of both
                men as counterweights to each other. Overarching this entire
                structure was the popular militia itself, which could easily
                intervene in the popolo’s interests if its interests were in
                anyway threatened.
                If this was a democracy, it was one of merchants, notaries,
                professionals, and master craftsmen, not of journeymen,
                weavers, dyers, and laborers who formed the only “proletariat”
                the thirteenth-century world knew. By the same token,
                however, it was not a democracy of blooded idlers and
                aristocratic bullies. The popular democracy was composed of
167 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                men who worked with their hands at crafts or devoted long
                hours of the day to the chores of administration, business, and
                legal affairs. Whether they were wealthy entrepreneurs or men
                of modest means, they saw themselves as self-made
                individuals, not the heirs of family wealth and unearned status;
                they believed; with good reason, that, they lived highly
                productive, sober,‘and socially useful lives and were far more
                capable than the nobles of bearing serious responsibilities on,
                their shoulders. They were no one’s clients and no one’s
                masters, except where they trained their own successors in the
                skills of their crafts. Although the new manufacturers who
                operated with hired labor could hardly make this last claim for
                themselves, they were far from constituting a majority of the
                typical ltalian popolo. Italy in the thirteenth century was not an
                industrial society with modern capitalists and workers. It was a
                largely artisan and highly paternalistic world, and the men who
                fathered its workshops as well as its families were not,
                disposed to grant the least modicum of: power to anyone who
                was a subordinate. These men knew only too well that, without
                them, the commune would quickly atrophy and disappear, but
                without the nobles and, to a considerable extent, their own
                subordinates, it could survive and ultimately flourish.
                For limits of space, it is impossible to explore the vast cultural
                impact the popular commune had on its age, be it the painting
                of Giotto, the sensual realism of Boccaccio, the shift of
                literature from Latin to the vernacular, the laicization. of
                education, the huge increase in popular literacy, or a political
                tradition that trounced any attempt at institutionalized
                despotism. For all his aristocratic inclinations, Dante was a

                popolani, no less than the chronicler Giovanni Villani whose
                history of Florence is one of the best to be written of his era.
                The popular commune created new men who breathed a
                fresher urban air than any of their medieval contemporaries:
                one relatively free of superstition, turgid scholasticism, and
                social status; Above all, it produced a new kind of citizen who,
                with his Weapons by his side and craft tools in his hands, felt
                boldly empowered arid politically confident. Alert to any threat
                to his liberties; he was prepared to fight for his rights with the
                same energy with which he fashioned his produce. This
                alertness extended beyond a defensive stance against an
                aggressive nobility into a mili tant interest in public affairs and
                a readiness to occupy public responsibility. Not since Hellenic
                times did men of relatively modest means feel so close an
                identification between their own interests and those of the city
                in which they lived. Deeply individuated, indeed animated by a
                vivacious love of public debate and political discussion, such as
                Italians are to this very day, this new citizen seemed all the
                more motivated to shape his city’s destiny as well as his own.
                The ancient civitas as an association of active citizens had
                been reborn, and its spirit was to live in its citizen body long
                after its institutions were to atrophy and pass into history.
                That the popular commune did not last as long as the Athenian
                polis is no mere quirk of ill fortune. Like the Roman Republic, its
                problems could not be resolved by replacing a small oligarchy
                with a bigger one. The popular commune, was not a “leveler”
                of social orders and economic classes. Quite to the contrary, it
                gave a new impetus to trade, the accumulation of wealth, and
                increasing economic and political differentiation, setting the
169 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                popolo grosso or “fat people” against the popolo magro or
                “thin people.” In time, the commune developed a siege
                mentality, fearful of the popolo magro within its walls and the
                nobiltas who were slowly gathering their forces outside them.
                To live with one’s weapons by one’s side with an ear open to
                the requests of a buyer and another to the peals of an alarm
                bell is not conducive to trade and is exhausting to the spirit of a
                nascent bourgeois. After a few generations—and the time span
                varied from city to city—signorial rule began to overtake
                republican virtue. The process was as insidious then as it is
                today: popular assemblies began to vote increased emergency
                powers to their podesta and captain; the same men were
                repeatedly confirmed in executive office, and their tenure was
                extended from one year to five, from five to ten, and ultimately
                to lifetime office. Soon the leader’s son supplanted his father
                after death and dynasties began to turn elective offices into
                mere charades. However much they lingered on
                ceremoniously in form, the republics began to die in fact, and
                the Italian cities, unevenly and with trepidation, entered the
                age of the signori. That the republican era never ceased to
                haunt the Italian mind is attested to by sporadic attempts to
                revive it. The most notable, to be sure, were Cola di Rienzi’s
                assumption of power as the tribune of a new Roman republic in
                the mid-fourteenth century and Fra Savonarola’s theocratic
                republic in Florence toward the end of the fifteenth. Rienzi,
                however, had his eyes focused more on a unified Italy than an
                emancipated Rome, a project that was woefully advanced for
                its time, and Savonarola turned Florence into a hysterical
                battleground for an apocalyptic battle between Christ and
                Satan. If Rienzi was too early for the fourteenth century,
170 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Savonarola was too late for the fifteenth. Both men challenged
                entrenched attitudes that stood as insuperable obstacles to
                their projects: Rienzi, a predominantly feudal sensibility;
                Savonarola, a vivacious Renaissance sensibility that
                increasingly made his monkish mentality an anachronism. And
                both men went down in tragic defeat: Rienzi as a hero of Italian
                nationalism, Savonarola as a fanatic of Italian medievalism.
                There can be no doubt that all of Europe watched the career of
                the Italian city-state with keen interest and borrowed heavily
                from its pioneering civicism. If Europe had any capital during
                the High Middle Ages, it was papal Rome, also an Italian city-
                state. Pilgrims and invaders, kings and beggars, knights and
                merchant-adventurers, all crisscrossed the peninsula for
                reasons of their own, and Italian merchants were to be seen
                everywhere: at fairs in France, city gates in Germany, on
                London’s docks, and in Flemish city squares. Hence, if civic
                freedom needed a stimulus it could not generate on its own,
                the Italian city-state was a ubiquitous presence that could
                provide one. In any case, and in almost every way, the cities of
                western Europe went through all the phases that the Italian
                cities had pioneered and added certain adornments of their
                own.
                Generally, European towns north of the Alps lagged behind the
                Italians by a half-century or so, and at some point in time they
                branched off from this shared development into institutional
                stagnation. Various kinds of republican structures can be found
                at one time or another in almost every town of Europe, often
                preceded by consulates and followed by oligarchies with a
                wide variety of names. Elective systems of governance, which
171 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Roman traditions inspired in Italy, were reinforced north of the
                Alps by German tribal traditions. Not until well into the High
                Middle Ages did hereditary kingships come into fashion; until
                then, monarchs were elected to the throne and by no means
                did they occupy it with complete regal confidence. Moreover,
                they were surrounded by councils that spawned the
                parliamentary structures of later times, essentially oligarchic in
                character but in some measure reflective of the aristocratic,
                clerical, and commoner estates that made up the sovereign’s
                realm. As in Italy, the word “people” was defined in a highly
                restricted manner. “Note that there is a difference between the
                people (populus) and plebs which is the same as that between
                an animal and a man or between a genus and a species,”
                declared a thirteenth-century canonist in the Aristotelian
                language of the day. “For nobles and non-nobles collected
                together constitute the populus, The plebs is where there are
                no senators or men of consular dignity.”{44} The inferences
                we can draw from these remarks are that the “people” include
                everyone of all orders and degree; the plebs consist of that
                segment of the “people” who are not equipped to govern. The
                governing councils of European towns generally reflected this
                distinction: an urban patriciate monopolized most of the civic
                offices. Rich merchants took over Bruges in the mid-thirteenth
                century; Rouen in the late twelfth; Freiburg, which established
                a lifetime consulate, in 1218; and many large cities of Germany
                such as Cologne. The conciliar system and the early
                assemblies were reworked into oligarchies. Needless to say,
                there were also exceptions. At Nimes, the constitution provided
                for the election of five consuls from the “whole people of the
                city or its larger part,” typically indirectly, such as existed in the
172 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Italian city-states. Arles locked its carefully controlled general
                assemblies into an oligarchy by placing virtually all changes of
                law and imposition of taxes in the hands of its consuls and their
                council.
                “Democratization” of the European cities occurred slowly and
                generally followed on the heels of the popular communes in
                Italy, often in exacting detail. Basel established a captain of the
                people in 1280; Freiburg turned its oligarchy into an annually
                elected board of twenty-four consuls following a “popular”
                revolt very similar to Bologna’s; Liege created what can best
                be called a gild-type city republic, headed by sixty governors of
                its craft gilds and two burgomasters. The city went even
                further than most when, from 1313 onward, it made the
                issuance of new laws contingent upon the approval of a
                popular assembly composed of all the city’s citizens,
                irrespective of their status. Even broader extensions of civic
                liberties were to mark the stormy popular movement of
                Flanders when civic government was shaped by the despised
                weavers and fullers of cloth-manufacturing towns such as
                Ghent and Ypres where the “fat” and “thin” people were to
                clash in brutal conflicts. This chronic struggle is too complex to
                narrate here; it involved not only battles between well-to-do
                oligarchies and virtual proletarians who manufactured wool
                products as mere hired help but also the intervention of the
                Count of Flanders, Guy de Dampierre, and the French monarch,
                Philip the Fair. Patriotism intermingled with class conflicts to a
                point where democratic demands were repeatedly diluted by
                the hatred of the Flemish people toward France. As a result,
                lowly artisans and their lordly masters fought side-by-side
173 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                when they were not fighting face-to-face. Ultimately, the “thin”
                people, organized into “lesser gilds” triumphed over their
                patriciates, and established a civic structure that gave
                adequate representation to the weavers, fullers, and gildsmen
                of “low degree” in a tripartate magistracy that excluded all or
                most of the patricians.
                What the European communes could not resist was the steady
                rise of the nation-state, indeed one that the rich merchants
                favored to restrain their unruly local barons who interfered with
                the free movement of trade and their unruly laboring classes
                who posed a continual threat to civic oligarchies. Perhaps the
                earliest harbinger of this new drift toward territorial centralism
                occurred when the Flemish communes, led by Philip van
                Artavelde, the son of the great champion of Flemish liberty,
                Jacques van Artavelde, were thoroughly routed by Count Louis
                in the Battle of Roosebeeke in 1382. “Henceforth, Flanders was
                to give up the dream of government by a league of
                independent towns and submit to the ever more and more
                centralized rule of powerful territorial lords, whose model was
                naturally the aggressive monarchy of France,” concludes
                Ephraim Emerton in his wistful account of this tragic history. “At
                the death of Count Louis in 1383 the county passed by
                inheritance to his son-in-law, Philip the Bold of Burgundy, the
                first in the fine of princes through whom the Low Countries
                were drawn into the politics of France, the Empire, and Spain.
                The cities, still great and powerful, enjoying very wide
                privileges, were to be only incidents in the larger relations of
                the country.”{45}
                Emerton’s closing remarks on the struggle of Flemish towns for

                civic freedom and autonomy might well seem like a touching
                epitaph for the commune as the nation-state began to emerge.
                Not only did it survive as little more than a haunting dream in
                Flanders, but also in Italy, where the triumph of the signori by
                the fifteenth century was virtually completed. Savonarola’s
                brief restoration of a Florentine republic in the closing years of
                that century reads more like a parody of the city’s glorious
                republican: past than an authentic revival. It would seem that
                Daniel Waley’s verdict on the nature of Italian civic
                republicanism could be applied to European communes as a
                whole. “The existence of republican forms of government in
                the Italian city-states was intensely precarious,” Waley writes
                in an assessment that can only be regarded as an
                understatement. “These institutions were so constantly under
                pressure or even in full crisis that there is little reason to be
                puzzled at their failure to survive in most of the cities.”{46}
                Internal factionalism, which often reached insurrectionary
                proportions, “suffices on its own to explain why, in most cities,
                the regime of a single individual was able to secure acceptance
                before the end of the fourteenth century. Clearly the occasional
                survival of republicanism as an exception needs more
                explaining than do the triumphs of the signori. Republicanism
                in decline is seen as a puzzling historical problem only if the
                republic is regarded as the body politic in health, the ‘tyranny’
                (signoria) as a pathological form.”{47}
                Perhaps, as Waley seems to suggest, we should reverse the
                judgement modern liberal historians have of what constitutes
                the health arid pathology of a body politic. But it is fair to ask,
                as I have throughout this book, whether any kind of politics,
175 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                much less one that can be “embodied” in an active citizenry, is
                possible under a tyranny or, for that matter, a “representative
                democracy” (republic). Waley seems to surrender the need for
                an ethical judgement of the commune, of the conjuratio’s
                radical implications and its sense of promise, if he asks us to
                surrender to the “facts” of the historical record rather than
                cherish the possibilities civic freedom holds for a humanity that
                has yet to fulfill its unfinished potentialities for a rational way of
                life. We can never let this commitment to an ethical judgement
                give way to the evidence of a grossly irrational reality merely
                because the record of the human enterprise speaks faultingly
                against it. Truth rarely lies in the center of experienced facts. If
                it did so, we would still believe the earth is flat and justice is
                merely the authority of the strong. These are the irrefragable
                facts as they are experienced in everyday life. Historians, in
                turn, would merely be turgid chroniclers of anecdotes,
                storytellers of things past whose accounts can never be free of
                their own hidden biases and proclivities. Until very recent
                times, philosophy for more than two millennia has warned us
                that “brute facts” do not really exist and are never free of
                interpretation, even as we deny humanity any sense of
                possibility, the hope of going beyond the “facts” and achieving
                its most worthy ideals. “Brute facts” will become real only
                when we become brutish and deal with the existing reality on
                its own terms, no different in principle from the adaptive ways
                we impute to other living beings.
                Actually, the history of civic freedom does not end with the
                fourteenth century or the rise of the nation-state. The ideal of
                popular assemblies as a form of self-governance, and the city

                as the nuclear arena for politics and an active citizenry, seems
                to have enjoyed a remarkable degree of persistence, especially
                if we bear in mind that there were so many factors—statist,
                economic, logistical, and demographic—to work against. That
                it exists even today in the form of the New England town
                meeting, however vestigial it appears by comparison with its
                past, is testimony to the need people have felt in fairly
                politicized regions to retain forms of face-to-face decision
                making and direct democracy. In fact, the town meeting is
                much too close to our discussion of the city’s future to be
                examined in any detail here. It may be regarded as a legacy,
                but it is still a living legacy that should not be consigned to the
                past. Suffice it to say, for the present, that from 1760 to the
                closing years of the American Revolution, it spread out of New
                England and reached as far south as Charleston. During this
                period, it fueled the revolution as surely as the more well-
                known Committees of Correspondence and such popular
                societies as the Sons of Liberty. Considerable effort was
                needed to eliminate the town-meeting form in many
                communities of the new United States and to nibble away at its
                powers in New England itself. We shall see that as recently as
                the 1960s, Vermont townships and their popular meetings
                essentially controlled the state government because the
                House of Representatives was elected by towns, not along
                geographic and demographic lines.
                Nor can we deal with the challenging problems raised by the
                Swiss Confederation, a piece of contemporary history that
                seems to have been shunted away from “mainstream”
                accounts of civic freedom. To assign a few paragraphs to a

                living illustration of confederalism, participatory democracy,
                and active citizenship, despite the philistine smugness of Swiss
                life and the conservatism of Swiss politics, would be doing
                violence to the extraordinary example of freedom that is also
                with us. It will require a section of a later chapter on civic
                confederal forms to even remotely approximate the insights
                Benjamin Barber brings to this issue in his discussion of direct
                democracy in the Swiss cantons. What Barber asks us to
                recognize is that democratic forms in themselves, however
                radical they may seem to be, “are inherently neither
                conservative nor progressive; they can be employed to bring
                about rapid and even radical change under conditions of
                consensus and unity of governing and people. They can
                obstruct reform and paralyze effective government altogether
                where the people are no longer one with their governors or
                synonymous with their government.... Democracy in
                Switzerland appears reactionary because the conditions that
                justify it have eroded; democracy in the villages of
                Graubünden is failing because the village communities are
                themselves moribund. Neither the institutions themselves nor
                a putative peasant mentality is to blame.”{48} Democracy, in
                sum, has its own prerequisites, and it will be no small part of
                the coming chapters to examine them in the light of modern
                societal problems—American, European, Graubünden, no less
                than those that exist for a New England town-meeting
                democracy.
                The most dazzling, almost meteoric example of civic liberty
                and direct democracy in modern times is the rise and brief
                ascendancy of the sectional assemblies in the Great French
178 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Revolution, a movement that addresses the typical question of
                whether or not a face-to-face democracy is possible in a large
                city, indeed by the standards of two centuries ago a world city.
                It should be kept in mind that eighteenth-century Paris, where
                the sectional assemblies flourished, was the capital of
                continental Europe’s most absolute monarchies, a city that,
                more so than any other aside from London, seemed to have
                been a creature of the nation-state.
                Under the Bourbons, Paris had very little self-government of its
                own. Ruled more or less directly by the monarchy, it groaned
                under the imposition of an inept regal administration and a
                corrupt nobility that reduced its lower orders to sheer
                destitution. Yet within a span of only four years, Paris acquired
                not only complete control over its own civic afFairs but created
                a system of control that was built around face-to-face
                neighborhood assemblies, coordinated by a commune that, at
                its revolutionary highpoint, called for the complete
                restructuring of France into a confederation of free communes.
                This demand was to survive for nearly a century after the
                revolution, when it became the insurrectionary program of the
                more famous Paris Commune of 1791.
                Ironically, the sectional assemblies have their origin in the sixty
                district assemblies Louis XVI convened in Paris to elect the
                city’s middle-class deputies to the Estates General. These
                assemblies were directed to select the 147 electors who, in
                turn, were to choose Paris’s twenty deputies to the Third
                Estate. The French Revolution, although spurred into action by
                the power plays between the Third Estate and the monarchy,
                really began from below and, most typically, as a result of
179 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Parisian militancy. Despite the highly discriminatory franchise
                that the Xing imposed on his own capital—nearly a quarter of
                the city’s population was disenfranchised in contrast to a sixth
                in the rest of France—the district assemblies were highly
                spirited and acted in flat defiance of the throne. They rejected
                the presiding officers with whom they were saddled by the
                municipality and chose presiding officers of their own; the 147
                electors to whom they were entitled were unabashedly raised
                to four hundred; and what is perhaps most damning, they
                refused to go home as the monarchy directed them to do. They
                defiantly established themselves as permanent fixtures of
                Paris’s municipal government. The four hundred electors, in
                turn, began to meet almost daily at the museum and shortly
                afterward at the Town Hall, where they simply edged out the
                royal appointees to the municipal government. The electors, in
                effect, became a provisional Paris, “Commune”’ until an
                authentic Commune was constitutionally elected. By
                September 1790, the Paris Commune numbered three
                hundred and coexisted uneasily with the sixty district
                assemblies from which it drew its representatives.
                The tension between the Commune and its district assemblies
                and within the assemblies themselves mounted as the
                revolutionary fever of the’ city rose. The distinction between
                propertied “active citizens” who had franchise rights and
                propertyless “passive” ones who were expected tp be little
                more than political bystanders ultimately made any exclusion
                of the disenfranchised people, the sans culottes, increasingly
                awkward. By this time, the “districts” had been renamed
                “sections” and their number reduced from sixty to forty-eight
180 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                by the National Assembly in order to diminish their power.
                Despite such attempts to suppress the “districts” and later the
                “sections” as deliberative bodies, the assemblies largely
                ignored the National Assembly’s decrees. In May 1790, the
                Assembly tried to limit the concerns of the sectional
                assemblies to purely municipal issues, a ploy typipal to this day
                of conservative elements in New England town meetings, but
                the restriction ultimately proved to be ineffectual. With the
                outbreak of war, the revolution moved markedly leftward. In
                July 1792, the Theatre-Français sectipn decreed the elimination
                of all distinctions between “active” anil “passive” citizens, a
                decree that was quickly adopted by all the forty-eight sections
                of Paris. The sectional assemblies were now thrown open to all
                the underprivileged orders of Paris: the laboring classes,
                relatively unskilled artisans, carpenters, construction workers,
                nascent proletarians of the textile and luxury goods
                workshops, and the like. A year later, on Danton’s request, the
                newly elected revolutionary Convention that replaced the
                National Assembly dbcreed that poor citizens could receive a
                stipend of forty sous for, attending sectional assemblies, which
                were reduced to two a week, presumably so that the sans
                culottes could attend them with reasonable regularity. The
                attempt by the liberal Girondins to close all sectional
                assemblies by nine in the evening so that working sans
                culottes would be unable to attend the assemblies after they
                returned home contributed greatly to the popular insurrection
                that removed them from the Convention and brought the
                Jacobins to power.
                Although the details of how these local assemblies functioned
181 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                leaves much to be desired, partly because the minutes of the
                sections were lost in the flames of the Paris Commune of 1871,
                partly, too, because their history has yet to be written by
                historians sympathetic to their decentralistic outlook, we know
                enough to describe them in broad terms. Sectional assemblies
                met at least twice weekly in the summer and autumn of 1793,
                the high tide of the sans culotte movement and often went into
                “permanent session” during hectic periods of the revolution.
                Attendance fluctuated widely from a hundred or less when the
                agenda was routine to overflowing halls (usually in state-
                commandeered churches and chapels) when serious issues
                confronted the revolutionary people. Structurally, each section
                had a president with a committee to assist him, a recording
                secretary, tellers for counting votes, and ushers to maintain
                order. Although it is not very clear how fixed these positions
                were, the President’s committee was renewed monthly by an
                assembly vote, and very few presidents seem to have held
                office for more than a year. Each section, it must be stressed,
                made its own rules and probably varied in form and the
                frequency of its meetings.
                A multitude of revolutionary commissars and committees
                surfaced from these assemblies and dealt with a large number
                of important economic, political, and military problems. We
                have only to enumerate the names of the sectional
                committees to gain some idea of the functions this
                neighborhood democracy undertook. Aside from its assemblee
                generale of the local citizen body, each section’s “most
                important function, that of police, was entrusted to a
                commissaire de police, aided by sixteen commissaires de
182 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                section. To meet the needs of local administration the sections
                formed almost as many committees as a modern American
                town or city. There were comites civile and comites
                revolutionaires (Vigilance Committees); there were comites de
                bienfaisance (Relief Committees), comites militaires, comites
                d’agriculture, and commissions de salpetres (for providing
                gunpowder). Each section had its own revolutionary court
                system and justices of the peace as well as special committees
                to organize work for the unemployed (ateliers de charite), or
                tenth-day festivities (fetes decadaires), or open-air suppers for
                the poor (banquets populaires).[8]
                The forty-eight sectional assemblies, in turn, were coordinated
                by the Paris Commune to which each section elected three
                deputies at an assemblee primaire. Also at this special
                assembly, usually quite heavily attended, the sections elected
                the Bureau of the Commune: the city’s mayor, its procureur,
                and his two deputies, who essentially constituted a communal
                executive committee to which sixteen administrateurs were
                chosen from the Commune’s normal complement of 144
                sectional representatives. To buffer this rather manipulative
                executive from popular pressure, an additional thirty-two
                members were added to the Bureau to form a Corps Municipal.
                When this majestic group of forty-eight sectional notables
                convened with the remaining ninety-two deputies that formed
                the Commune, it bore the solemn title of the Conseil General
                de la Commune or, as it came to be known in the historical
                literature, the Commune’s General Council.
                The more radical sections of Paris were not unmindful that
                these concentric rings of authority surrounding the commune’s
183 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Bureau were meant to camouflage an inner circle of executives
                who were as disquieted by the irascibility of the sections as the
                Convention was of the Commune, a body that it really saw as a
                dangerous challenge to the nation-state. Although the
                Commune eventually became more radical under sectional
                pressure as time went by, the sections were always more
                radical than the Commune and began to act very much on
                their own. When necessary, as was frequently the case, sans
                culotte sections did not hesitate to bypass the Commune
                completely and form their own interlocking committees and
                networks. Delegations from one section often visited the
                assemblies of another, where they were usually greeted with
                fervent embraces, hortatory speeches of welcome, and
                characteristic “kisses of fraternity,” which often culminated
                with banquets topped by endless toasts to liberty and the
                brotherhood of man. As F. Furet et al. tell us: “From the angle of
                political solidarity, the participants in activities of the sections
                saw themselves as forming a whole, a ‘family’ of ‘brothers and
                friends,’ where the use of the familiar form tu broke down all
                the barriers of social and cultural origin. Outside the section
                this fraternal solidarity was further expressed by
                ‘fraternization,’ a sort of pact for mutual aid between the
                popular sections to resist the pressure of the aristocrats and
                the moderates, and then to eliminate them from the
                committees which they controlled. Thus on May 14, 1793, the
                Social Contract section, under the direction of its president,
                went in a body to the Lombard section to chase out the
                ‘aristocracy.’ In this way the sections were regenerated in the
                bourgeois quarters dominated by the moderates before the fall
                of the Girondins, and by the ‘new moderates’ after the month

                of September 1793.”{49}
                It is difficult to fully convey the enormous powers the sections
                accrued by 1793 before they were subverted by the
                Convention. The titles of their various comites and
                commissions do not’ tell us how intensely active the sections
                had become in the administration of their neighborhoods and
                finally in running the entire city of Paris. They were sources of
                information on local counterrevolutionaries and grain
                speculators, both of whom existed by the nestful in the city.
                They became the dispensers of a rough-and-ready popular
                justice, the guardians of the “maximum” that regulated the
                price of staples, the dispensers of food for the poor and
                sustenance for the widowed and orphaned, the caretakers of
                refugees from the provinces and the homeless who all but lived
                on the streets. They were the authentic organizers of the great
                journées, the insurrectionary “days” that pushed the revolution
                in an increasingly egalitarian direction much to the dismay of
                the Jacobins, whom they mistakenly worshipped with almost
                unthinking reverence before they were betrayed by the
                Robespierres, Dantons, and Saint-Justs. They forged the “holy
                pike” that armed the revolutionary populace and made it
                possible for it to intervene directly in the Convention’s
                proceedings and alter the course of its decrees and laws. Going
                even further, the sections began to intervene significantly in
                the economy of the city. Their comites d’agriculture scoured
                the countryside to feed the city, their committees to establish
                ateliers de charite freely appropriated workshops abandoned
                by wealthy emigres and used them to provide jobs for the
                unemployed who made uniforms, weapons, and gunpowder

                fpr the embattled revolutionary armies at the front. Not unlike
                the Athenian festivals of an earlier age that did so much to
                cement the polis together, the sections not only called periodic
                fetes decadaires and neighborhood banquets populaires but
                helped to stage the fervent citywide celebrations that occurred
                throughout the revolution, fostering a sense of civic fraternity
                that Paris was to rarely see again after 1793, when the “year of
                the sans culottes” passed into history. And it was these
                canaille, or “rabble” as they were also called, who were to be
                pushed from tho stage of history and shot down by the
                thousands in the reaction that followed the tenth of Thermidor
                (July 28,1794), when Robespierre and his followers were
                guillotined.
                Finally, “From the principle of popular sovereignty,” observe
                Furet and his colleagues, “the sans culottes went as far as the
                notion of direct government. With the same verve which made
                them rise against the Girondins, in the summer of 1793 certain
                sections demanded to keep their own civil records, to levy their
                own taxes, and to render justice without appeal. No limitations
                should be imposed upon the assembly of citizens, which
                decided everything. A decision by the Convention (September
                9, 1793) having limited section meetings to two days a week,
                the sans culottes got around the decree by holding a daily
                meeting of the ‘Society of the section.’ This assembly claimed
                to supervise the civil servants and magistrates, who in their
                eyes were merely their subordinates. Members of the comites
                civiles, revolutionary commissions, police commissioners, or
                commissioners for supplies were subjected to constant
                surveillance by the sections, at least as long as the latter
186 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                maintained their independence from the revolutionary
                government. Censure, ‘purifying’ votes, and revocability of
                elected persons were the principal means by which this
                popular sovereignty was exercised, according to the
                Rousseauean principle of a sovereign and indivisible popular
                opinion.”{50}
                The well-to-do classes of France had everything to fear from
                these sectional assemblies and a radical Commune of Paris.
                Although it was highly unlikely that the largely bourgeois
                districts of 1789 ever envisioned a France governed by a
                completely popular direct democracy, the rise and growing
                influence of the sectional assemblies clearly evoked images of
                a confederal France structured around sections similar to the
                Parisian in all the cities and towns of the country—a nationwide
                commune of communes. The extent to which this vision of an
                entire European country began to take hold of the popular
                imagination as early as November, 1792, is suggested by a
                statement that the Section de la Cité circulated for the
                approval of other sectional assemblies. “The citizens of Paris
                declare ... that they recognize no sovereignty except a majority
                of the communes of the republic ..the statement provocatively
                declares, “that they only recognize deputies In the Convention
                as composers of a draft constitution and provisional
                administration of the republic.” By the spring of 1793, such
                views ceased to be isolated. On April 29 of the following year,
                the Conseil General of the Commune, which is to say the
                broadest of the concentric groups within that body, took
                practical steps toward implementing the idea of a federation of
                communes by establishing a corresponding committee to
187 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                communicate with the 44,000 municipalities of France. In a
                printed circular to the municipalities, the committee’s
                secretary boldly declared: “That is the only kind of federalism
                the people of Paris want.... All the communes in France should
                be sisters.”{51}
                For all his biases and preconceptions, Daniel Guerin is on solid
                ground when he resolutely concludes, “The bourgeois
                philosophers who had pronounced direct democracy
                unworkable in large countries [no less Rousseau than other
                social theorists of his day], on the grounds that it would be
                materially impossible to bring all the citizens together in one
                meeting, were thus proved wrong. The Commune had
                spontaneously discovered a new form of representation more
                direct and more flexible than the parliamentary system and
                which while not perfect, for all forms of representation have
                their faults, reduced the disadvantages to a minimum.”
                Indeed, it is doubtful if the Commune and the sectional
                assemblies could be regarded as a system of “representation.”
                The sans culottes had gone much further than any assembly
                form of which we know in establishing a direct democracy, this
                in the very heart of a nation-state that the Jacobins had
                centralized to a degree that would have been the envy of
                France’s most absolutist monarchs.
                Chapter Six: From Politics to Statecraft
                It remains one of history’s great ironies that the city, which
                reworked stagnant archaic systems of corporate life based on
                status and kinship into the innovative, free realm of politics and
                citizenship, was to produce the very factors that led to its own
188 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                undoing. European cities, I have pointed out, were different
                from their ancient counterparts because of their inherent
                autonomy as civic entities. The increasing separation of the
                medieval town from the city’s traditional agrarian matrix
                produced not only a new kind of city with an identity of its own;
                it also produced a new type of economy, culture, and political
                structure that profoundly altered the countryside and slowly
                remade it into the city’s image. Today, we have no difficulty in
                recognizing this profound change—the “urbanization” of the
                land—as a logical step in a mythic ascent of societal life from
                what Marx lamely called “rural idiocy” to what we like to call
                “civilization.” Modern agribusiness is the patent “conquest” of
                agriculture by industry, a city-born enterprise and technics; so,
                too, is mass culture, which has urbanized as well as
                homogenized agrarian lifeways. What we do not fully sense is
                the extent to which early city dwellers would have regarded
                such a sweeping urbanization of the countryside as peculiar,
                nor could they have anticipated the extent to which it would
                have undermined civic life and citizenship. We have simply lost
                contact with the problem of urbanization as antithetical to
                citification—and to the extent that we are oblivious to the very
                existence of the issue itself, we have become its mute and
                unknowing victims.
                How, then, did this remarkable change from civic autonomy to
                civic supremacy come about? And in what sense, institutionally
                and economically, did it begin to challenge the city s integrity,
                ultimately to raise the very real problem of its subversion as a
                realm of genuine politics and meaningful citizenship? Gur
                answers to these questions, so crucial to an understanding of
189 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                modern urbanization arid the threat it poses to the city, oblige
                us to examine the new kind of economy and values that
                became preponderant in the communes of the late Middle
                Ages and the role they played in replacing civic life with the
                nation-state or, more precisely, politics with statecraft.
                We must first look at the new economic relationships that
                began to link European cities and regions together—and I say
                “first” not because they are the sole, the “definitive,” cause
                that produced this new economic and political dispensation.
                Whether the European continent “necessarily” would have
                been changed from a loose association of towns, cities,
                baronies, duchies, and the allpresiding, if ineffectual, Holy
                Roman Empire into a clearly articulated group of nation-states
                is a problem in divination, not in social analysis. How Europe
                could have developed—whether toward confederal
                communities or toward highly centralized nation-states—is an
                open question. One can single out many reasonable
                alternatives European towns and cities might have followed
                that were, no less possible than the one that became prevalent
                in fairly recent times. No single course of development was
                “inevitable” or “predetermined” by the economic, social, and
                political forces at work. Indeed, that Italy did not become a
                nation-state until the nineteenth century must remain an utter
                mystery if a constellation of cultural, social, and political
                factors, particularly the role of its cities, is not invoked against
                strictly economic explanations. Seemingly, no area of Europe
                was more “modern,” “capitalistic,” or entangled in a market
                economy some 500 years ago than the Italian peninsula, and
                yet Italy was to lag behind western Europe’s trend toward
190 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                nation-state building for centuries. Nor can we understand why
                it was only in England that a market economy virtually
                absorbed all other economic forms of life such that the British
                Isles became the “model” for a capitalistic society in the
                nineteenth century while Spain, which entered so early on in
                the development of nation-states, lagged behind Europe as a
                whole and remained a predominantly agrarian society until
                well into the 1930s.
                This much is clear: from the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries
                onward, Europe—and, most notably, Italy—was the scene for
                an entirely new economic and social dispensation. The Italian
                city-states began to break with-traditional economic
                relationships that had been ingrained in ancient and early
                medieval civic life ways. From Italian ports and inland
                commercial cities—and in northern Europe from Flemish
                industrial centers—foreign trade began to bring a growing
                number of parochial communes into a new kind of commercial
                network, one that resembled what we would now regard as
                capitalistic. Trade, accumulation, and the reinvestment of
                profits into expanding and competitive business enterprises
                now became ends in themselves, not simply means to achieve
                personal wealth, land holdings, and aristocratic status. Not that
                this development was totally universal, as we shall see very
                shortly. But it occurred on a sufficiently wide scale to make it
                unique and to subvert the traditional agrarian lifeways that
                marked European society, merchant as well as noble, in past
                historical eras.
                Yet new as this development was, I do not wish to overstate it.
                Our own society, a society that celebrates the ascendancy of
191 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                “free trade” and a competitive capitalist economy, is
                ideologically imperialistic: it tends to cast the past too much in
                its own image. All the roads of European history do not lead to
                the triumph of the twentieth-century market economy. The fact
                is that feudal values, rooted in an elaborate system of rank and
                a strong orientation toward the ownership of land, were no less
                a part of received wisdom of the new, rising urban
                “bourgeoisie” than of the old agrarian nobility. Trade did not
                alter this received wisdom of feudal society for centuries to
                come. Indeed, like the merchants of antiquity, whose goal
                consisted of amassing enough wealth from the “sordid”
                operations of commerce in order to retire to a manorial life in
                the countryside, many Italian and Flemish merchants had very
                similar ambitions. Prestige gained by titles through
                intermarriage and by the ownership of landed property was
                still a desideratum among these early “bourgeois”—and such
                goals were to remain widespread in Europe well into the
                eighteenth century. On this score, the merchants of antiquity
                and their descendants in the Middle Ages were very much alike
                in outlook, particularly the most wealthy ones. In their
                psychology and sense of cultural self-definition, the city rich
                were similar to all the upper rural strata of the time. And we
                shall also see that these ambitions and this mentality exercised
                less of a hold among the more middling sort of city dwellers,
                such as artisans, ordinary merchants, and aspiring members of
                the plebeian orders. Differences in attitudes and wealth were
                to profoundly divide the medieval towns and cities internally,
                greatly complicating their relationships with the emerging
                monarchies.

                For the present, it is important to emphasize that the wealthy
                merchants of the late Middle Ages differed from their ancient
                counterparts in the way in which they were committed to
                commercial operations. Although their outlook closely
                resembled a feudal one, their practice was very akin to a
                modern one. The tension between the old and new, between
                precept and practice, introduced ways of functioning that
                deeply altered European life. Ancient trade, generally
                speaking, was surprisingly simple in comparison to later
                medieval business transactions despite its Mediterranean-wide
                scope. Ordinarily it was local and more like barter than modern
                forms of exchange; the ancient economy was not as highly
                monetized as it is today. Money was conspicuous more by its
                absence than by its presence, and the extent to which ancient
                trade was a regulated affair would have chilled modern
                acolytes of laissez-faire doctrines.
                Like the cities, which were usually religious and administrative
                centers, often as parasitic in their need for tribute from the
                surrounding countryside as in the exactations they placed on
                distant subject peoples, Mediterranean commerce found itself
                physically and culturally hemmed in by a distinctly agrarian
                world and a largely subsistence economy. Beyond the ancient
                cities that clustered along the shores of the Mediterranean or
                were planted strategically at intersections of inland waterways,
                the early trader faced a semifeudal world of crude manors and
                impoverished peasant villages, a world that dissolved into a
                forested, semitribal communal world. Both of these worlds, the
                manorial and the tribal, in antiquity constituted a very
                precarious, indeed hazardous, terrain for the merchant, for his
193 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                caravans on the land and his ships in remote waterways.
                The ancient merchant responded to these barriers accordingly.
                Trade was distinguished by its highly personalized and
                somewhat tentative character. The merchant and his sea
                captain or caravan leader were united by a specific enterprise
                rather than a highly organized business, although there were
                always many notable exceptions to this rule. Ships often went
                to sea and caravans with pack animals went inland to make a
                “killing” just as a wayfaring stock-market speculator today
                seeks his “lucky break.” In this sense, merchants were literally
                “merchant-adventurers,” and their “companies” had
                quasimilitary characteristics. They commonly went abroad as
                armed expeditions. Loans were often no less personal than the
                expeditionary techniques that brought a fleet of ships or a
                caravan of pack animals together. Although credit was fairly
                well developed by Roman times when the empire was already
                quite secure, in foreign trade to fairly remote parts, at least,
                credit was often seen more as a gamble than a safe
                investment. Such profits were high, and went into hoards or
                were invested in land rather than the expansion of on-going
                businesses. I speak here of foreign trade, not local trade; of the
                ancient world’s “merchant-adventurers,” not its home-based
                business enterprises, artisans, and commercial farmers.
                What the Italian merchants introduced in the Middle Ages was
                as close to a “revolution” as anything that goes by that name.
                A broad network of business houses, credit institutions, trading
                depots, warehouses, and affiliates began to interlink Italian
                city-states with numerous medieval European towns, and the
                movement of goods was gradually secured by treaties, tribute,

                and hired mercenaries from the predations of robber barons
                and bandits. The Venetian navy virtually swept the city’s
                Mediterranean trade routes of pirates, attaining a sea
                supremacy that rivalled the naval power of the more
                formidable empires around the basin. Business became
                systematic, safe, a predictable enterprise. Money was invested
                not only in the expansion and acquisition of landed property; it
                was also invested in larger commercial operations whose
                profits not only attracted ordinary people but also the local,
                nobility. The lure of this fairly safe source of wealth, still
                disdained culturally but crassly attractive to an increasingly
                practical and secularized world, was enormous. It opened new
                doors everywhere in late medieval society. Indeed, the social
                mobility of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries sharply
                contrasts with the social stagnation of the classical world. Well-
                to-do commoners were closely interlinked with nobles by
                marriage as well as by trade. Aristocrats offered titles and
                pedigree in exchange for the wealth and material security
                offered by merchants. Alliances were forged not only with
                families of the same social order but between families of
                different social orders. This melding of “classes,” largely feudal
                and “bourgeois,” has only recently received the attention it
                deserves and was to have a profound effect on the so-called
                “bourgeois revolutions” that marked the eighteenth century.
                Finally, where elite orders were not interlinked by marriage,
                merchants and even professionals acquired aristocratic status
                by buying it outright, especially from the fifteenth century
                onward. A considerable portion of the revenue acquired by the
                French Bourbon kings, for example, came from the sale of
195 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                titles, a sale that united the higher orders of society by a
                shared sense of titular nobility—even as it divided them by a
                sense of shared disdain between the purchased “nobility of the
                robe" and the hereditary “nobility of the sword.” In time,
                alliances and differences were to become as tentative and
                precarious as distinctions formed by wealth, when the rich of
                one day could easily suffer the pangs of penury after the
                misfortunes of another day.
                What did last and expand, however, were the trade networks
                established between communities, particularly the larger
                towns of medieval Europe. But the enormous growth,
                continuity, and increased stability of this foreign trade—the
                nearest thing to a capitalistic enterprise the continent
                developed—should not cause us to overlook the rich
                elaboration of the local market that occurred within the
                medieval communes and their immediate environs. The
                decline of the Roman Empire and the eclipse of the
                administrative cities that held it together brought the European
                continent face-to-face with itself and threw it back on its own
                mainsprings.
                No longer could the continent be sustained’and civilized, much
                less managed and exploited, by the Mediterranean basin with
                its rich granaries and sources of tribbte. Beyond the highly
                cultivated Roman-controlled territories of Europe lay great
                forests and bogs, a huge continent within the continent itself
                that was fairly pristine and open to new forms of social
                development. Communes began to appear in this virginal
                terrain that were now structured not only around religious and
                governmental institutions but, significantly, around the
196 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                markets qf craftsmen and artisans. These artisan towns, to be
                sure, were crude and unpolished; they were more villagelike
                than urban. The work and the markets that emerged from this
                highly decentralized, localistic society were still mainly
                organized around religious and feudal values. Often collecting
                around churches and cathedrals—indeed, commonly under
                the sovereignty of a bishop—they nevertheless became
                productive towns with small markets arid family-operated
                workshops, living off the agricultural produce in their environs
                and providing rural folk with the more skillfully crafted
                commodities they could not make in the countryside.
                Here we encounter something remarkably new: communes
                marked by a rich social fife, and with it a popular politics rooted
                in gilds, systems of mutual aid, a civic riiilitia, and a strong
                sense of community loyalty. The gild, the most important
                institutional center of a new kind of artisan society, should not
                be confused with the ancient collegia that it resembled
                structurally or with such strictly economic associations as
                modern trade unions, which it seems to resemble functionally.
                The Roman Empire exhibited a very low tolerance for
                nonstatist bodies that could challenge the authority of the
                monarchy and its bureaucracy. Hence ancient collegial
                associations of craftspeople were rarely permitted to extend
                their activities beyond those of burial societies and festive
                fraternities. They were allowed to have no economically
                regulative or protective functions. Essentially, they were
                cultural and quasireligious institutions. Modern labor unions, in
                turn, are primarily economic organizations and’ assume few
                cultural, much less religious; undertakings.

                The medieval gild, by contrast, assumed the responsibilities of
                the ancient collegium, the modern labor union, and a great
                deal more. Possibly religious in origin, it became highly secular
                in many of its activities, fostering material as well as moral
                commitments. It was a sworn, covenanted brotherhood that
                punished its members for lowering the quality of goods or
                seeking higher than prescribed prices. It regulated personal,
                moral, and religious behavior as well as the output of goods.
                Not only did it care for widows and orphans, the ill and infirm of
                its own members, but it gave alms to the poor, performed
                charitable works of all kinds, celebrated feast days, punished
                its members for usury, blasphemy, gambling, and other
                presumably “immoral” infractions of good behavior.
                What made medieval gilds particularly significant in ways that
                mark a sharp departure from towns of the past is that they
                attained a degree of legislative and governing authority that
                made them the principal municipal institution of many
                communes. However parochial they seem to us today,
                European towns by the thousands achieved a degree of
                autonomy that few municipal entities had acquired in times
                past or were to acquire later. This autonomy was pieced
                together corporately from a localized world of small artisans,
                craftsmen, and merchants—a feudal world, in fact, not a
                capitalistic one, however much it was centered around the
                marketplace—before European communes were to be
                networked together by foreign trade. The commune’s growth
                and elaboration took place organically, not artificially, within a
                highly decentralized agrarian society. In contrast to the Roman-
                controlled town, the European town was a unique
198 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                phenomenon insofar as local autonomy became the rule rather
                than the exception. Control from below thrived at the expense
                of an institutionally weak feudal society that was beleaguered
                by overlapping and conflicting jurisdictions between landed
                nobles, urban bishoprics, papal legates, and insecure
                monarchs. The unending series of conflicts that these
                jurisdictions generated was exacerbated by an undeveloped
                system of communications and by a crude armamentorium,
                one that made civic militias a powerful military force in social
                life.
                Foreign trade—more precisely the capitalistic carrying trade
                that emanated from the Italian city-states and the Flemish
                communes—definitely worked against this communal
                autonomy as surely as it played a role in interlocking Europe’s
                towns and cities. And in so doing, it posed a historic problem:
                would the commercial network created by intercity trade yield
                the formation of nation-states, centralized by monarchical and
                later republican systems of power, or would it give rise to
                confederal institutions, united in a shared continental system
                based on local community control? That the nation-state was
                to gain ascendancy over confederal systems of self-
                governance does not mean that its victory was predetermined
                by Europe’s history—nor does it mean that its victory cannot
                be undone. How that nation-state’s ascendancy was achieved
                is a story worth telling because it also brings to fight an
                achievement that was often very tenuous, owing to the
                resistance of the towns to centralism, a struggle that has not
                been definitively foreclosed by urban issues that are emerging
                today.

                For the present, we shall confine our account of the nation-
                state to the way it was achieved, with the clear reservation that
                other alternatives continually existed, indeed dramatic
                alternatives that we will explore later. Initially, the intercity
                carrying trade that began to unite Europe economically from
                the twelfth century onward not only tore into a complex web of
                mutual personal and communal dependencies in which trade
                as well as behavior was carefully regulated; it also became the
                infrastructure for a new body of societal institutions—initially
                regional rather than local, later overwhelmingly national—that
                cut across the grain of a time-hallowed and intensely
                communal and decentralized mode of social fife. It eventually
                introduced nationalism, a distinctly European phenomenon
                that was to spread beyond the continent itself and acquire
                global dimensions.
                The ancients, like the early Europeans, had very little
                experience with the notion of nationhood. Largely tribalistic or
                locafistic in outlook, they tended to look inward toward their
                traditional fifeways, to elaborate them rather than innovate
                new institutions and values. Even the Greeks and Romans, who
                were comparatively “forward looking” in their attitudes, were
                heavily guided by tradition. Cultural as well as economic “limits
                to growth” were deeply molecular: people owed their strongest
                allegiances to their kin group; next, to their community or
                perhaps region; rarely to a “nation.” The idea of a “nation” was
                alien to the ancient mind, a tribalistic form of mind that
                opposed the locality to the ecumene.
                Although pan-Hellenism was very much in the air among the
                Greek polei shortly before Alexander brought the western
200 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                world and the Near Eastern together institutionally, it quickly
                drifted into a cosmopolitan Hellenistic ecumene that adopted
                Greek for its lingua franca and Greek culture for its spiritual
                adornment. Hence a Greek “nation” never developed among
                the Greek polei.
                Israel seems to have acquired a strong sense of nationhood
                after the Maccabean Revolt, but it was smothered by foreign
                invaders. Religion ultimately placed a stronger claim on the
                Jews than a sense of territorial nationhood, hence a budding
                form of nationalism was soon supplanted by a powerful belief
                in a spiritual community whose strength still defies the
                economistic explanations advanced by crude variants of
                Marx’s “historical materialism.” The great empires of the
                ancient world were nOt “nations” in any sense of the term.
                Indeed, it is difficult to associate them with the modern, class-
                based nation-state. In the Near East, these empires assumed a
                highly patronymic form: a “property,” as it were, of a deified,
                patriarchal monarch for whom the vast lands under his control
                were regarded as part of his oikos or household. Lands
                annexed to the monarch’s original inheritance became the
                tributaries of a centralized household rather than the territory
                of an institutionalized body politic. The Roman Empire,
                particularly in its imperial rather than republican form,
                inherited this Near Eastern tradition-bound state form,
                however much it was secularized and regulated by laws.
                Indeed it should be kept in mind always that the Roman state
                was managed primarily by patricians, a group of “fathers,” by
                definition, rather than by citizens. The emperors, in turn, were
                the “fathers” of their people, not simply their sovereigns,
201 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                European nations, by contrast, were pieced together by sterner
                stuff. However muph monarchical nation building, so redolent
                of ancient statecraft, went hand in hand with the market’s
                expansion, the infrastructure created by commerce laid a
                stronger foundation for nationalism than anything we
                encounter in the ancient i world. This new, continentwide
                commercial nexus, formed out of the interlinking of towns,
                produced material dependencies for goods that cut across the
                moral relationships fostered by traditional society. Even before
                the monarchs of Spain, France, and England asserted their
                authority over their respective nations, they shrewdly
                exploited the divided loyalties and value systems created by a
                growing commercial dependence on far-flung markets on the
                one hand and a powerful psychological dependence produced
                by a richly elaborated localist community on the other.
                Between the material wealth offered by the former and the
                spiritual security offered by the latter, many towns were to
                divide internally as sharply as they divided against the
                countryside. Hence the European commune was pulled in two
                opposing directions: between the desirability of the nation-
                state and an ideal of communal confederation. France ;was to
                provide an existential example of the first, the Swiss
                Confederation, in its early days, of the second.
                Such alternatives did not really exist in the ancient world apart
                from Greece. The administrative cities of antiquity easily
                dissolved in the West into virtual villages with the decline of the
                empire, villages that formed the real community base of that
                society. Indeed, once sources, of tribute disappeared, the
                resources for maintaining the Roman imperial state
202 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                disappeared as well and the West devolved into decentralized
                feudal society. Europe fell back on its own resources and its
                own authentic forms of social and economic organization.
                The long history of Europe’s medieval development, a
                development that brings us to the opening of the modern era,
                totally changed the setting for urban evolution. European-wide
                trade, centered entirely around a new kind of self-sustaining
                municipality, opened sharply contrasting opportunities for
                development. The wealthy elites of the towns were riddled by
                the divided loyalties and interests to which I have already
                alluded. Among the rich merchants and their noble urban
                allies, a growing trend surfaced for unfettered trade, free of
                gild, restrictions and traditional moral constraints. On the other
                hand, the great majority of artisans, journeymen, small
                retailers, and professionals were to demand the perpetuation
                of traditional controls, their time-honored source of security
                and stability. What complicates this fairly conventional account
                of the “class struggle” within the medieval city is the very
                disconcerting fact that the medieval patricians and plebeians
                often united as readily as they fought with each other, notably
                against assaults from outside the city itself. Although by no
                means consistently, both “classes” commonly joined together
                to support their municipal privileges against landed nobles
                and, more strikingly, even against monarchs who were bent on
                achieving a highly centralized state. While the ordinary
                plebeian strata tended to be more consistent in their
                commitment to their civic rights, the more conflicted patrician
                stratum—feudal in outlook but decidedly bourgeois in its
                commercial practices—oscillated in its loyalties between the

                more popular elements in the city and the elite elements,
                noble and kingly, to which it felt a groveling loyalty that marks
                all parvenu elements in society. As we shall see, such alliances
                within the commune tended to be tentative and inconclusive,
                at times giving rise to serious urban revolts against the newly
                emerging absolute monarchs, at other times dividing the
                towns so seriously that they easily fell prey to monarchs who
                were to fashion the modern nation-state.
                The reader who looks for an elegant and compact
                development toward a modern urban society will not find one
                here. Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, when
                nation-states began to form, the continent’s towns and cities
                found themselves deeply entangled in a skein of shifting
                alliances and conflicts. Modern notions of “free trade,” largely
                confined to merchants engaged in the carrying trade of the
                Mediterranean basin and the continent, were nevertheless
                permeated by feudal values rooted in land ownership and
                status to an extent that would have seemed curious to the
                modern mind. “Capital,” in effect, was at war with itself and
                had very little identity of its own. Newly emerging capitalists of
                the high and late Middle Ages were often pulled in sublimely
                contrary directions by a fading past and a barely emerging
                future.
                For their part, the plebeian elements of the towns were deeply
                committed to their ancient traditions, that is, to the corporative
                values of the medieval world. No affinity to “free trade” or
                notions of unregulated business practices were to be found
                among these less privileged groups. Despite their quasifeudal
                notions, however, they resolutely opposed territorial lords who

                sought to challenge the liberties of their towns, ironically in
                contrast to the wealthy merchant strata in their own
                communities who feared both camps in this conflict and
                variously allied themselves with one against the other. Finally,
                the newly emerging princes and monarchs who were to
                eventually piece together the nations of Europe were
                themselves deeply divided by this skein of tentative alliances
                and conflicts. They were more than willing to use the European
                communes against nobles who challenged monarchical
                authority. But they were equally willing to subdue the
                communes when they raised the cry for their ancient municipal
                liberties and autonomy.
                It is within this highly unstable yet very traditional world—
                unprecedented in the ancient Mediterranean—that a new form
                of societal organization was to permeate very old ones: a
                centralized state apparatus structured around a distinct
                national entity. The ancient world had seen the centralized
                state in all its grandeur and power. And it had even seen in a
                bare, rudimentary form the outlines of the nation. But never
                before had the two—state and nation—been cojoined to
                produce a form of statism based on nationalism with its far-
                reaching sequelae for the modern world and the emergence of
                a highly corrosive global market economy.
                Within this rich, highly variegated, and fluid period of history,
                when societal development could have followed very different
                directions from the one toward which it moved, we must
                reexamine the conventional wisdom about the rise of the
                modern state and the formation of the nation.

                That the state preceded the nation historically hardly requires
                emphasis here. The previous pages of this work have operated
                with this fact throughout. The professional institutionalization
                of power and the monopolization of violence by distinct
                administrative, judicial, military, and police agencies occurred
                fairly early in history. The state, so conceived, emerges as a
                highly compact entity whose persistence from ancient times to
                the present seems almost unchanged functionally, however
                much it has varied in form.
                But so functionally similar an institution, seen only in terms of
                its “class character” and its coercive role, can be very tricky
                when it is treated without respect for the many nuances of its
                development. Among many social theorists, this simplistic
                notion of the state has given rise to images of various state
                forms as mere epiphenomenal expressions of a basic,
                deceptively unchanged structure—indeed, to use Marxian
                language, as the mere “superstructure” of an unaltered
                “base,” hence an institution that scarcely deserves searching
                analysis. In modern politics, this simplistic approach produced
                considerable mischief. The careless use of words similar to
                “fascist,” applied to established republican states as well as
                totalitarian ones, can generate very slovenly and crude
                political attitudes. States have been called fascist or, for that
                matter, democratic that are very far from being either one or
                the other; and their opponents have often disregarded hard-
                won civil liberties that deserve the most; earnest support by
                any ideological standards or values.
                What is no less disturbing, there has been a gross disregard of
                democratic rights generally among self-styled “progressives”
206 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                whose concerns for material justice have supplanted their
                concerns for social justice. The primacy given to economics, an
                emphasis uniquely characteristic of a market-economy
                mentality—and most evident, ironically, in socialist and
                syndicalist ideologies—has led to a troubling disregard for
                libertarian political institutions whose preservation and
                expansion is of immeasurable importance to the development
                of a new, municipally oriented politics. These institutions have
                often been contemptuously dismissed as “bourgeois” by many
                socialists and anarchists alike, although we shall have occasion
                to see that the “bourgeoisie” was never libertarian in outlook
                and rarely republican in its commitment to state institutions.
                Even liberal and conservative ideologies have used such words
                as “freedom” so ecumenically that both the content and form
                of the term have been absorbed into a meaningless “black
                hole” of sociological rhetoric.
                The interchangeable use of the words “state” and “nation,” in
                turn, has been even more troubling. Trite avowals of “my
                country right or wrong!” imply no commitment to a republican
                state, even when the cry is justified by a country’s seemingly
                democratic or libertarian institutions. Patriotism today is
                nationalism, not democratism, although during the French
                revolution the two words could have easily passed as
                synonyms. “Love of country” may characterize the sentiments
                of a fascist, socialist, liberal, or conservative, and this love does
                not in itself commit any one of them to a particular state form,
                much less to a free community. Hence the development of the
                state and the emergence of the nation are not matters of
                academic interest. Their history is deeply entangled with the
207 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                prevalent societal values of our time and profoundly affects our
                visions of society’s future, especially in a discussion of the
                municipality.
                A close study of the state shows that there are and have been
                varying degrees of statehood, not simply the emergence of a
                finished phenomenon called “the state.” Indeed, the universal
                use of such words as “state” can impede a clear understanding
                of the ; extent to which “the state” exists at various levels of
                societal development—not only historically, but also today in
                modern society. Conceived in a processual way with due
                regard to the degrees of statism that have existed historically
                and functionally, I should emphasize very decidedly that “the
                state” can be less pronounced as a constellation of institutions
                at the municipal level, more pronounced at the provincial or
                regional leyel, and most pronounced at the national level.
                These are not trifling distinctions. We cannot ignore them
                without grossly simplifying politics. Differences in degrees of
                statification can have major practical consequences for
                politically concerned individuals and communities.
                History, moreover, provides us with compelling evidence of
                germinal states, quasistates, partially formed, often very
                unstable states, and finally fully formed and all-embracing
                states. The Athenian polis and even the Roman Republic were
                not fully formed states—this in contrast, for example, to the
                fairly well-formed Roman imperial state and even more fully
                formed Egyptian state of Ptolemaic times. When applied to
                classical Athens, the use of the word “state” has a very limited
                meaning, despite the presence of slavery. Even in the modern
                nation-states we know best, municipalities are often less
208 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                “statified” than nations, with the exception, to be sure, of the
                patently totalitarian states that have emerged in our own time.
                In practical terms, a modern municipal politics can be very
                different from a national parliamentary “politics,” as we shall
                see in the closing chapter of this book, and localist politics can
                rest on ideological traditions and premises very different from
                those we associate with the formation of the nation-state.
                The fact is that we have been much too concerned with the
                origins of the state, conceived primarily as an instrument of
                class domination, to give due recognition to the history of the
                state: its evolution, its various unfinished forms, its varying
                kinds of structure, and its capacity to penetrate the social and
                political life of the community as well as the nation.
                Living, as we do in “founded” republican states of one kind or
                another—states that are clothed in a panoply of “declarations,”
                “constitutions,” “charters,” and even highly personified
                “fathers” and “founders”—our images of “the state” tend to
                acquire a highly contractual, legalistic, and contrived form.
                “The state,” with its clearly dated documents, seems more like
                a social contract than a historically conditioned phenomenon.
                Behind the “contractual” state lies an anthropology and history
                that, carefully considered, desanctifies its rationalistic claims to
                authority and its mandate as the source of an orderly society.
                The state, in fact, had to fight its way into existence against
                claims that were no less rationalistic and morally valid than
                those that it advanced on behalf of its own legitimation. It had
                to emerge organically, that is to say, within the framework of
                social relationships and, later, political norms that were by no
                means consistent with and were, at times, highly antithetical to
209 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the formation of a state apparatus. Hence, it is fair to say that
                just as the constituted or constitutional state preceded the
                formation of the nation, so an organic state, uncertain of its
                pedigree and of dubious legitimacy, preceded the
                establishment of a constituted or “constitutional” state. The
                organic origins of the state, in turn, bring into question the
                extent to which the state can be validated wholesale on strictly
                rationalistic terms and, above all, its capacity to absorb the
                very aspects of social and community life in which it was
                gestated. To demystify the authority of the state as a
                rationalistic contrivance is to take the first step toward
                recovering the Hellenic notion of politics as a public activity,
                the domain of authentic citizenship—not as statecraft, the
                domain of the professional legislatures, military, and
                bureaucrats.
                Contrary to rationalistic and contractual images of the state,
                state institutions emerged slowly, uncertainly, and
                precariously out of a social milieu that was distinctly nonstatist
                in character. In fact, the social and organic sources of the state
                had to be meticulously reworked before they could give rise to
                state institutions. The ancient temple corporation, actually a
                religious legitimation of tribal collectivity and public control of
                land, seems to have been the most likely source of the Near
                Eastern state. This was a time when priests commonly became
                kings or, at least, when the kingship often took on a priestly
                character. In either case, the temple and palace
                monumentalized as well as deified the tribal community.
                Despite the increasing secularization of the state, notably m
                Greece and Borne, the state never completely lost its religious

                trappings and its function as the custodian of the collectivistic
                community. This attribute, whether as an ensemble of feudal
                nobles or a monarchy and ultimately as an absolutist empire,
                remained with it well into recent times. The traditional “head of
                state,” be he a lord or king, always remained the “father of his
                people,” whether by divine right or as a divinity in his own
                right. Hence, prior to the rise of republican systems of
                governance, the state always appeared not as a constituted
                phenomenon but as a reworking of a very traditional, organic,
                patriarchal, indeed tribalistic body of relationships in which
                power was not simply conferred by the community as in the
                case of elected kingships but inherited along lineage and blood
                lines in a manner redolent of the ancient tribalist blood tie. The
                present always entailed a reworking of the past, a
                transmutation rather than a dissolution of traditional forms to
                meet new needs and imperatives.
                It is notable that the rise of the centralized nation-state in
                Europe also followed this archaic and highly organic process of
                transmutation of old into new. Indeed, until “The Age of the
                Democratic Revolutions,” to use the title of R. R. Palmer’s
                distinguished book, it was not through the constitution of new
                states but the recovery of ancient rights that king and
                community were thrown into civil war with each other, a
                conflict that often took the shape of monarchy against
                municipality.{52} Neither one party nor the other sought to
                innovate new forms of governance but rather to restore old
                ones from the past. Characteristically, the earliest form of the
                European nation-state appears not as the emergence of a
                national economy, significant as this development proved to

                be, but as the increasing sovereignty of the kingly household
                itself—the monarchical oikos—and the image of the “nation” as
                a kingly patrimony.
                The evolution of the kingly household into an authentic state is
                strikingly revealed by the evolution of the English monarchy.
                The reputation of England as a uniquely centralized state from
                the days of the Norman Conquest in 1066 tends to be
                overstated. Admittedly, William the Conquerer took firm
                possession of Anglo-Saxon England shortly after the defeat of
                Harold in the Battle of Hastings, but the area under Norman
                control was relatively small, almost provincial in size. Wales
                and Ireland had yet to be conquered and Scotland to be
                absorbed. William’s absolutism was not only restricted
                territorially; it was short-lived historically. The English state—
                and certainly its highly fragmented sense of nationhood—is
                notable not for its continuity but its discontinuity. Growing
                baronial strength clearly began to abridge monarchical rule in
                little more than a century after the conquest: the Magna Carta,
                to which John unwillingly set his seal at Runnymede in June
                1215 is testimony not to the rise of English democracy, all
                legends about the charter’s intent aside, but to the power that
                the English barons acquired at the expense of the monarchy.
                Although John’s father, Henry II, had left his sons a state
                buttressed by a system of royal law remarkable for its time—
                extending the “King’s peace” to include civil and criminal
                cases, a rationalized system of trials, punishments, and juries,
                and a professional royal judiciary to translate this system into
                practice—many of these jurisdictions were to be reclaimed by
                the barons. Nominally centralized, England remained

                remarkably decentralized under the weaker monarchs who
                filled the long span between Henry II and Henry VII, a period of
                some three centuries. A centralized infrastructure had
                emerged from the conquest, but history had yet to flesh it out
                with effective royal institutions.
                What makes the English state interesting is the challenge it
                raises to simplistic theories of state formation and rule. I refer
                to its organic roots and its evolution out of household offices.
                The English state was born not out of an administrative body of
                autonomous departments but rather it was formed out of the
                personal responsibilities of the king’s servants—his immediate
                household coterie—often in opposition to the doubtful loyalties
                of the king’s own feudal barons. Perhaps the foremost of these
                royal servants was the king’s personal secretary, his
                chancellor, who carried the royal seal and coordinated the
                emerging departments that comprised the administrative
                portion of the royal court. In time, the chancellor became the
                pole around which an increasing number of clerks, experts,
                and specialists in various governmental areas, and overseers
                of what was to become a fairly complex executive authority
                collected to form the all-important English chancery. Almost
                every aspect of monarchical rule fell within its purview,
                principally the king’s exchequer who saw to the collection of
                taxes and Henry II’s professional judiciary.
                In fact, the English state was formed largely from the king’s
                bedroom, dining table, men-in-waiting, and household clergy,
                not from constituted principles of government that spoke in the
                interests of a specific “ruling class.” Class theories of the
                “origins of the state” to the contrary notwithstanding, the

                English state of the Middle Ages began as the elaboration of a
                patrimony rather than the institutionalization of one “class’s”
                authority over that of another. The English barons, who were to
                view the formation of this state with suspicion and later with
                overt hostility, found it difficult to claim it as their own. A
                continual tension; existed—occasionally expressing itself in a
                violent form—between the baronial infrastructure of English
                medieval society and the monarchy, which formed the
                originating impulse of an authentic, fairly complete state, In its
                patrimonial form, the English state is no exception to the
                “origins of the state” generally; this mode of state formation is
                very similar to the way in which the “barbarian” chiefdoms of,
                an earlier tribal society gradually extended their power from
                networks furnished by their personal retainers and clans. The
                journey from “valet” to “prime minister,” amusing as the
                juxtaposition may seem, is closer to the truth of state
                formation than the more “sociological” idea that the state
                emerged as an agency of class interest—whatever it was to
                become later in history.
                I have dwelt in some detail bn the origins of the English state—
                in time to be regarded as the prototype of the nation-state par
                excellence—not because of its uniqueness but rather because
                of its continuity with the ancient past. The organic growth of
                the English monarchy parallels to a remarkable degree the rise
                of oikos forms of statehood. Historically, these forms go back to
                early Egypt, Persia, Babylonia, and even Rome before the
                empire became heavily bureaucratized.
                Why did the English state become such a useful framework for
                the modern nation and for modern capitalism? An answer to
214 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                this question lies precisely in the limits as well as the
                rationalistic and centralistic forms it assumed, both territorially
                and institutionally. Despite its exhausting adventures in France,
                the English state by Tudor times remained focused more
                fixedly on its own island territories than did its archaic
                antecedents. And institutionally, it never achieved a degree of
                absoluteness—or at least was never permitted to do so—such
                that it devoured its own bourgeois “golden goose.” It permitted
                a flexibility of market development that was rarely to be seen
                in the past, not only in the medieval world. Thus, while the
                absolute monarchs of England (principally Henry II and the
                Tudors) managed to hold a nation together, at least in the
                Anglo-Saxon core areas of the island, eventually integrating
                the Scots as well as the Welsh within a national framework, it
                provided ample space for its middle-class “commons” to
                flourish, prosper, and, in time, resist the exactations and
                arbitary demands Charles I imposed upon them. Throughout
                much of its history, England was burdened less by a
                bureaucracy than her rivals in western Europe. While the
                monarchy retained a well-knit bureaucratic structure,
                particularly in the administration of royal law and the collection
                of taxes, England was largely managed by its local squirearchy,
                a highly personalized system of management guided by the
                rationalized standards introduced by Henry II and the Tudor
                monarchs. The English Revolution of Cromwell’s time finalized
                this delicate balance between the king and his “commons” in a
                way that imparted a fictive quality to the English state as an
                ideal “bourgeois” political system. Indeed, it was England’s
                “constitutional monarchy” that was to have an almost hypnotic
                attraction for the progressive intelligentsia of the French and

                German enlightenments.
                Ironically, it was France rather than England that was to create
                the kind of all-pervasive bureaucratic nation-state that
                characterizes present-day bourgeois state forms. Given the
                waywardness of history that defies attempts by historians to
                systematize the development of events in the name of
                historical materialism and other “scientific” explanations of the
                nation-state s emergence, France’s preeminence as the
                prototypic nation-state is explained not by her “advanced”
                development as a “bourgeois” society but rather by the
                lateness of that development, indeed by delays that were to
                significantly initiate that development in the midnineteenth
                century, well after it occurred in England. To be sure, French
                absolutism did not emerge in a sudden burst of centralization
                but quite to the contrary. Louis IX (“Saint Louis”), more than a
                century after Henry II of England, still issued his decrees with a
                terminology that is redolent of the early Frankish system of
                collective rule in which the Germanic kings were considered
                merely first among equals. The expression “We and our barons
                recurs in Louis’s pronouncements, a phrase that in no way
                suggests a commanding authority over the feudal community.
                But even more so than England, France began to enter into a
                phase of state evolution that was to induce many historians to
                regard French absolutism as the predecessor of all Europe—an
                overstatement, to be sure, but a sufficiently suggestive one to
                impart to the French Revolution, which overthrew it, a
                particularly incendiary challenge to absolutism as such.
                By the end of the twelfth century, France had already begun to
                catch up with England by creating les officiers du roi (officials of
216 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the king) who shared power with the French barons in the
                traditional royal council. By degrees, the French began to
                outpace their English rivals. Functionaries, emerging from the
                royal household, acquired expanding administrative roles so
                that the kingly servants were soon to be royal bureaucrats
                rather than household administrators. In contrast to the
                English monarchy, the French carried this development much
                further: it encompassed time-honored local as well as royal
                jurisdictions. Already a huge hierarchy of petty officials had
                arisen, such that by the end of the thirteenth century, Philippe
                le Bel was obliged to place the host of lieutenants, sergents,
                and hedeaux who afHicted the French people on local and
                provincial levels under the scrutiny of controlleurs, a royal
                strategy that may have enhanced rather than diminished the
                bureaucratization of the nation. Royal commis· saires were to
                become permanent regional officials by the midsixteenth
                century and a far-reaching network of intendants, supervised
                by surintendants, acquired the odious status of a financial
                bureaucracy that particularly aroused popular hatred.
                In time, the immense French bureaucracy of the sixteenth and
                seventeenth centuries, in theory answerable only to the
                monarchy, acquired a life—indeed an outlook—of its own. The
                emergence of a bureaucratic sensibility, permeating all levels
                of French society, can hardly be emphasized too strongly. A
                new, almost ubiquitous “nobility of the robe,” ennobled more
                as functionaries of the monarchy than by virtue of birth, began
                to overshadow the hereditary “nobility of the sword.” In
                contrast to so much of feudal Europe, the sons of the French
                middle classes began to regard the royal bureaucracy rather
217 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                than the clerical hierarchy as the avenue toward upward
                mobility and power, a shift in perspective that linked the French
                “bourgeoisie,” whatever that word meant some two centuries
                ago, to the monarchy more tightly than historians of “class
                conflict would have us believe. The French Revolution,
                conceived as the “classic bourgeois revolution” of emerging
                capitalism, was to test this “class analysis” in the fiery crucible
                of insurrection, with more dismal results than later, nineteenth-
                century historians suspected.
                Herder’s conclusion to the contrary notwithstanding, France
                was by no means the “precursor of all Europe.” It is beguiling to
                think that an even more centralized and bureaucratized
                “nation-state” was established in Sicily in the early thirteenth
                century, when Norman conquerors dispossessed the Arab
                rulers of their control over the island and established what
                many historians have variously called the “earliest modern
                state” and “absolute monarchy” in Europe’s history. Emperor
                Frederick II did, in fact, create an “omnipotent royal power”
                that led to the, “complete destruction of the feudal state” to
                use Jacob Burckhardt’s words, a state marked by a completely
                centralized legal system, a professional army (which the
                French monarchy introduced very early in its evolution), and an
                all-encompassing bureaucracy of professionally trained
                officials, all indubitable traits of Norman Sicily.
                But these are traits of a kind that in no way made Sicily a
                “modern state,” much less a “nation-state.”{53} Such state
                forms, in fact, were to appear very early in human history. The
                Ptolemaic state that followed Alexander’s conquest of Egypt in
                ancient times did not differ in fundamentals from the structure
218 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                that Frederick imposed’on Sicily some fifteen centuries later.
                Characteristically, both Alexander’s general, Ptolemy, and the
                Norman monarch, Frederick, wedded the economy of the Nile
                and of the island to the state itself. In both cases, key
                commercial operations, particularly the grain trade, became
                state monopolies and economic activity was. bound to
                statecraft. The Norman state in Sicily was an “Oriental
                despotism,” to use the language of nineteenth- and early
                twentieth-century historiography, not a “modern state,” much
                less a “nation-state.” Administered t>y conquerors and their
                bureaucracies with highly regulated economies, the Norman
                state was no more “modern” than the Inca state in Peru or the
                Egyptian state in North Africa.
                We are faced with the paradox that one of the earliest
                approximations to a centralized “nation-state” emerged in
                Spain, even before the Tudors in England and the Bourbons in
                France fully consolidated their rule. Yet Spanish absolutism and
                nationalism did not promote the development of a
                “bourgeoisie” or a “bourgeois society”—developments that
                have been associated with the emergence of the nation-state.
                In fact, Charles V and his successors were to virtually devour a
                flourishing Spanish burgher stratum, milking it of its wealth,
                preempting its power, and essentially subverting town life in
                the Iberian peninsula. At the beginning of the sixteenth
                century, a swath of almost meaningless royal parasitism and
                domestic extortion cut across Spanish history, eventually
                undermining a flourishing city network that enjoyed extraordfi
                nary wealth and autonomy. The extortions initiated by the
                Spanish state led, as we shall see shortly, to one of the greatest
219 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                urban uprisings in western history, an uprising that decided the
                future of the new nation that had emerged from the Christian
                reconquest of the Iberian peninsula after centuries of Moorish
                rule. City life and commerce were to stagnate or decline for
                reasons that had much more to do with absolutism and its
                efforts to forge Spain into a nation-state than did the
                decentralization that marked the ensuing history of the
                country.
                What is most intriguing is that neither absolutism nor the rise
                of a nation-state provides us with an adequate explanation for
                the rise of a “national economy” as Hannah Arendt suggests.
                Although Spain was to remain a largely agrarian society up to
                the 1930s, indeed a very traditional one, its Hapsburg kings
                were no less “enlightened” than the Bourbon kings of France
                and, with the exception of the two Henrys and Elizabeth, the
                Tudor and Stuart kings of England. Nevertheless, Spain moved
                into a period of economic decline that still weighs on her
                shoulders today while England became the “factory of the
                world” and France its cultural “perfumery.” Although European
                nation-states from the sixteenth century onward created the
                arena for a national economy, they did not necessarily create
                the forces that shaped it. Absolutism, which, sculpted a sense
                of nationhood out of feudal parochialism, played a very crucial
                role: it not only supplanted localism with, nationalism; it also
                stifled a highly decentralistic, localistic, and spontaneous
                society, marked by a rich diversity of cultural, economic, and
                communal attributes, replacing it with increasingly
                homogenized lifeways, bureaucratized institutions, and
                centralized state forms. In some cases, this absolutist
220 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                alternative favored the later expansion of a market economy;
                in others, it led to state parasitism and outright regression. In
                all cases, however, it turned localist politics into nationalist
                statecraft, divesting citizenship of its classical attributes and
                turning vital, empowered, and strongly etched men and
                women into passive, disempowered, and obedient “subjects.”
                This shift from a living people to deadened subjects did not
                occur without furious resistance. A belief in autonomy, regional
                and local identity, and citizen empowerment ran very high
                between the late Middle Ages and fairly recent times. The
                battle to retain these distinctly political qualities and rights was
                to be fought not in national political parties or by professional
                statesmen; rather, it was conducted on the level of village,
                town, neighborhood, and city life, where the ideals of
                confederation were to be opposed to demands for a nation-
                state and the values of decentralization were to be opposed to
                those of centralization. What lay in the balance was not only
                the future of the town and countryside but the development of
                political institutions as opposed to state institutions—and an
                active citizenry as opposed to a passive “constituency.”
                It has become somewhat conventional in urban historiography
                to treat “city-states” as though their relationships with each
                other were normally marked by endless petty squabbles and
                their relationship to absolutism by an almost unqualified
                degree of support. “City-states,” we are commonly told, were
                almost innately quarrelsome, hence the wars that were
                endemic on the municipal level of politics. Ultimately, so the
                argument goes, they were to show a unique commonality of
                interests in the support they gave to the emerging absolute

                monarchies and nation-states of the late Middle Ages. Like the
                monarchy, they opposed feudal lords who placed imposts on
                their commercial transactions and blocked the development of
                their markets with a self-enclosed manorial economy.
                The partial truth this conventional view conveys is outweighed
                by the serious error it contains. It expresses a characteristically
                liberal and Marxist prejudice that prevailed a century ago
                against all decentralized societies, a prejudice that was to be
                placed in tho
                ideological service of European nationalism and its gospel of
                the centralized state. Only today do we seem willing to
                recognize how reactionary and false was this imagery of ever-
                embattled, quarrelsome, and promonarchical cities, whose
                economic power was presumably placed with few if any
                qualms in the service of absolutism.
                There is more than enough historical evidence to show that
                cities were as disposed to form,leagues and confederacies with
                each other as they were to fight with each other. Many of these
                leagues and confederacies, in fact, were not only networks of
                mutual aid; they were vigorously directed against absolutism
                and its threat to communal liberties. Finally, territorial lords
                were often quick to abandon their traditional feudal or manorial
                forms of rights and duties, to participate as vigorously in
                commerce as the most avaricious merchants. Indeed, English
                capitalism cut its first teeth in the countryside where many
                squires and nobles turned agricultural and common lands into
                sheep runs to meet Flemish demands for wool—perhaps the
                earliest example of agribusiness in modern times.

                Confederacies or leagues of cities go back as far as Greek
                times when poleis entered into various associations with each
                other for mutual protection, shared religious beliefs, economic
                interests, even for quasitribal honorific reasons. At least fifteen
                of these confederacies of one kind or another, known more
                generally as koinoi, can be identified—many of which are very
                obscure but marked by fascinating examples of cooperation.
                These confederacies can often be traced back to tribal groups
                that were established as early as the Bronze Age. Tribalism
                never completely disappeared as a framework for the later
                confederations, Thus the famous Delian League that Athens
                developed was initially Ionian, composed of poleis that
                generally claimed a shared ethnic ancestry. By the same token,
                the Peloponnesian League that opposed it was largely Dorian,
                and the Achaean League claimed a shared ancestry with the
                archipelago’s early Mycenean settlers although “Achaea” itself
                was really composed of a mixed population of Dorians and
                their precursors, the simpler Arcadians.
                A troubling feature of many confederations is that one polis
                tended to become the pole around which its confederates
                clustered, whether by inclination, necessity, or coercion. The
                Delian League formed by Athens eventually became so
                overarchingly Athenian in character that historians were to call
                its later phase an “Athenian empire,” This is an overstatement.
                That Athens battened itself on the revenues it extracted as
                “protection money” from the league and used coercion when
                persuasion failed to hold its confederates in line is doubtless
                true; but there is an inescapable irony in the fact that it foisted
                its own democratic institutions on poleis with limited freedoms
223 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                of their own, whether they wanted a democracy or not. The
                internal politics of the league’s members stands in very sharp
                contrast to the despotic institutions we encounter in virtually
                all ancient empires. In fact the original confederal council of the
                league, formed early in the fifth century to check Persia’s
                advances into Greece, was distinguished by its high sense of
                fraternity. All members of the council had an equal vote, and its
                treasury was kept in the Temple of Apollo on the politically
                neutral island of Delos. Only later, when the Persian threat
                ended, did Athens assert complete sovereignty over the
                league, preventing Naxos and Thasos from seceding and
                bringing the league’s treasury to the Athenian acropolis.
                We also know of confederacies, however, where poleis were
                permitted to function very much on their own. Pellene, for
                example, showed considerable independence in the Achaean
                Confederacy; conversely, Thebes was held in check by poleis
                that made up the Boeotian Confederacy, particularly after it
                was reformed toward the end of the fourth century B.C. The
                use of the word sympoliteia to designate many confederacies,
                particularly those that extended byeond traditional tribal
                areas, is significant. Taken literally, the word describes a union
                of poleis, presumably of equal status, in contrast to a patria or
                “fatherland” with its connotations of a capital city, or an
                ethnos, with its real or fictive tribal bonds based on blood ties.
                At the molecular level of the sympoliteia’s life, the human bond
                is based on citizenship, on the polites, not on some form of
                juridical national identity at one extreme or kinship ties at the
                other. Citizenship, in effect, is not dissolved into an impersonal
                national affiliation or a presumably biological or tribal one. And,
224 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                in fact, many polites or citizens of a confederacy enjoyed rights
                in other confederal poleis that they normally denied to resident
                aliens. They could buy land, enjoy the full protection of a
                confederated polis’s laws, and, in some cases perhaps,
                participate in its ekklesia, although normally their political
                rights were linked to the institutions of their own cities. In short,
                the confederacies of ancient Greece were to enlarge the whole
                concept of citizenship, well beyond the parochial framework of
                early poleis, while still maintaining their decentralized civic
                lifeways.
                How were the confederacies structured? Our knowledge of
                them is very limited and any extended discussion of their
                known institutions is precluded by lack of space as well as
                facts. But certain general outlines can be noted. Normally, a
                Greek polis consisted of magistrates, a board of generals, a
                council or boule, and a citizens’ assembly. This form of
                “government” existed in many Greek poleis from the fifth to
                the third century, when it was finally swept away by the
                Romans.
                This is not an overstatement. The fact is that Greek poleis had
                very little experience with “representative” forms of
                governance; indeed it was very hard for the Greeks to think in
                terms of “representation” generally. They could understand the
                rise of an oligarchy, which they often identified with a tyranny
                or repressive control of some kind, and a democracy, which, in
                its Perikleaii form, seemed radical or “excessive” to its
                opponents. And republican-type structures did surface among
                them from, time to time. But these republics rarely produced
                stable institutional forms. Human scale—a distinctly municipal
225 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                scale—continued to be the only congenial and comprehensible
                level of institutional form that seemed to satisfy Hellenic
                lifeways and modes of thinking. Any form larger than the polis
                or confederacies of poleis cut across the grain of the Gfeek
                mind and Greek social theory. The rise of the Macedonian
                empire, regaled with all the trappings of royalty, generally
                horrified the Greeks, and the Roman empire seems more to
                have fascinated them, as Polybius’s writings indicate, than
                attracted them until the very memory of political democracy
                had faded away, In any case, even when a republican regime
                did emerge among the Greeks, notably with the ascendancy of
                Rome, it was often called a demokratia and there was a
                tendency to trace its pedigree back to the polis of classical
                times. The Macedonian and Roman empires, in effect,
                constituted an annoying challenge to the Greek image of
                political consociation: its ethical as distinguished from
                administrative ways of visualizing or defining politics: its high
                regard for some degree of citizen participation in formulating
                policy or executing it. Just as a Roman in imperial times might
                look back nostalgically to the republica, so Greeks under
                foreign rule looked back endearingly to the demokratia and
                often used the word when it no longer applied to their
                institutions.
                Not surprisingly, the boule and ekklesia the council and the
                citizens’ assembly—were to appear in many Greek
                confederations, not only within Greek poleis themselves. There
                is evidence that an ekklesia formulated policies for the
                Thessalian Confederacy in the closing decades of the fifth
                century B.C., possibly as an aristocratic body. But in time cities

                began to encroach upon the power of the territorial nobles.
                Apparently, a democratic faction, strongly influenced by the
                Athenians, successfully extended popular rule within the
                Thessalian cities and the confederacy itself, after which the
                confederacy eventually became more centralized and
                exclusive. The Boeotian Confederacy was, as J. A. O. Larsen
                puts it, “a land of hoplites” because the area itself favored
                small-scale farming.{54} But it is surprising to find that the
                Confederacy more closely approximates a republican state
                than any we encounter so early in Greek history. This may have
                been the result more of Spartan influence than the internal
                development of the Thessalian poleis, an influence that did not
                go unchallenged by a pro-Athenian faction in the cities that
                made up the confederacy. Unfortunately, the details of its
                development are closed to us by the lack of adequate historical
                data.
                The Phocian Confederacy alternated between an oligarchy and
                a democracy: a strong executive made up of generals had to
                answer to a popular assembly that enjoyed the power to
                depose its military leaders. The Locrian Confederacy seems to
                have had a citizens’ assembly; indeed, from the scant
                evidence we have, democracy found a comfortable home
                here, often together with shared citizenship that made it
                possible for citizens of one polis to acquire property and to
                intermarry with citizens of another polis. In West Locris, the
                poleis were so indulgent that the Greeks generally singled
                them are out for their fairly humane and decent treatment of
                foreigners. The Aetolian Confederacy appears to have had an
                ekklesia in which all citizens not only had the right to vote but
227 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                followed the Athenian fashion of voting as individuals, not as
                citizens of their own poleis. This extraordinary degree of
                political individuation within a confederacy—a rarity even in
                decentralistic and confederal social theories—should not go
                unnoticed. What the Athenians did within Athens and its
                environs, the Locrians did within a confederation of separate
                cities. Meetings of their confederal assembly were held twice a
                year—once in the spring when the military campaigning
                season began and again in autumn when it came to an end.
                We shall have occasion to emphasize that democracy cannot
                be disassociated historically from military associations when
                they involve the mobilization of citizens for warfare, changes in
                arms and military technique, or simply a high valuation that is
                placed on the image of the armed citizen.
                The Achaean Confederacy, perhaps the best known of all
                Greek confederacies, became so democratic that it was in
                advance of Athens in some respects. Finally, in 417 B.C., Sparta
                was obliged to step in to impose oligarchic rule. This
                intervention stirred up a medley of reactions in which a pro-
                Athenian faction restored democracy that led to further
                Spartan intervention. Nevertheless, there seems to have been
                a persistent ekklesia on a local level that certainly was in
                existence in Hellenistic times, the era following Alexander’s
                conquests in the Near East and North Africa. Unfortunately, we
                know far too little about other Greek confederacies to provide
                even capsule descriptions about their structure and
                development.
                What does it mean in very concrete terms to say that a Greek
                confederacy had a citizens’ assembly? It is tempting to think
228 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                that in comparatively large confederal areas, such an
                assembly is simply a euphemism for a representative system
                of government, not a direct, face-to-face body of citizens.
                Actually, this is far from true. Judging from the Achaean
                Confederacy, citizens from various poleis were expected to
                attend it en masse. For those days, this would mean a journey
                over wide distances, hence assembly meetings would tend to
                attract only the well-to-do who had the means and leisure to
                attend them. But much the same could be said of the Athenian
                ekklesia. Attika was more than the environs of Athens, and for
                communities in the more distant parts of Athenian territory a
                journey to the city would have been a fairly difficult one. Like
                Athens, however, the poorer elements in the host city or
                ‘‘capital” of a Greek confederacy often outnumbered the well-
                to-do who could afford to make the journey and may have,
                provided it with a popular, indeed radical, ambience.
                Whatever may have been the possibilities and limits of ancient
                cities, municipal democracy withered and finally died under
                Roman rule. The Roman Empire, a purely parasitic
                phenomenon, was extremely wary of municipal autonomy. It
                provided cities with only enough freedom to police themselves
                and extract tribute from subject populations. In the centuries
                following Periklean democracy, city life as a political reality
                began to decline and, after the second century of the
                contemporary era, shrivelled disastrously, at least in Europe
                and the northern rim of the Mediterranean basin. Nor was
                urban life to revive in this area until the eleventh century. But
                with this revival came the emergence of new confederacies, an
                extremely important aspect of European history whose story
229 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                has been badly neglected. Peter Kropotkin’s work on the city
                confederacies and leagues of Europe, limited as it may be, may
                be cited as a truly pioneering effort.{55} The period of the
                French Revolution and the nineteenth century were to .witness
                a depressing shift in perspective from historical studies of
                localism and urban confederalism to the nation-state, a shift
                that reflects a distinctly centralistic bias in radical as Well as
                liberal historiography. The lacuna that exists in this field is by
                no means the result of oversight: it originates from a distinct
                political proclivity in Marxian historiography and liberal social
                theory to emphasize the role of the nation-state in fashioning
                the modern era, an emphasis for which we have paid dearly in
                evaluating the alternatives that face this era today with its
                increasing bureaucratization and centralization of social life.
                Despite its brevity and incompleteness, Kropotkin’s work still
                provides us with a robust framework for recovering some
                sense of the vitality this municipal world offered as an
                alternative to the nation-state. “Already in the years 1130–
                1150 powerful leagues came into existence,” Kropotkin tells
                us, “and a few years later, when [Emperor] Frederick
                Barbarossa [of the Holy Roman Empire] invaded Italy and,
                supported by the nobles and some retardory cities, marched
                against Milan, popular enthusiasm was roused in many towns
                by popular preachers. Crema, Piacenza, Brescia, Tortona, etc.,
                went to the rescue; the banners of the guilds of Verona, Padua,
                Vicenza, and Trevisa floated side by side in the cities’ camp
                against the banners of the Emperor and the nobles.”{56}
                The following year saw the emergence of the first of the
                Lombard Leagues (1167), which numbered, sixteen cities at its

                height, followed by a second in 1198 and finally a third (1226)
                that collectively included nearly all the major cities of northern
                Italy. Not only was Milan a member of all three leagues but also
                Bologna, Verona, Brescia, Ferrara, Faenza, Vercelli, and
                Alessandria. Even Venice, proud and independent, joined the
                first of the leagues. A league of Tuscan cities was formed
                shortly after Henry Vi’s death in 1195, and still another two
                centuries later, guided largely by Rome during the papacy’s
                quarrels with the empire. The number of leagues that formed
                in Italy during this time are too numerous to examine here.
                Some clustered around powerful cities such as Florence,
                Venice, Milan, and the papal seat in Rome, surfacing in the
                Romagna and in Umbria as well as in northern Italy. With the
                passing of time, these leagues either fell apart into rival cities
                or formed genuine city-states—in fact, small republics or
                duchies, depending upon the internal political structure of
                cities that led them. By the thirteenth century, this structure
                was usually oligarchical: the popolo, had given way to signori,
                and Italy was to become a battleground for major’ European
                powers that tried to dip into the still very considerable wealth
                of the peninsula. Although eminent urban historians such as
                Lewis Mumford are highly disdainful of this development,
                particularly the continual discord between the cities that are
                believed ultimately to have fed the parcelization of the area,
                Kropotkin is careful to note that it was precisely “when
                separate cities became little States [that] wars broke out
                between them,” generally as, a “struggle for supremacy or
                colonies.”{57} Whether Italy’s parcelization is quite the overall
                “evil” that characterizes most historical accounts of the Italian
                city-states or a desideratum that delayed the emergence of an

                overly centralized nation-state has yet to be assessed.
                The creation of city confederacies in central Europe followed a
                development that is very similar to what we encounter in Italy,
                but they were-also marked by characteristics that make them
                highly distinctive. That Italy led Europe in urban development
                is not surprising: the peninsula had been dotted by cities for
                centuries when much of the continent north of the Alps was
                still covered by forest. The German-speaking cities, however,
                were unique. Although they were to follow their Italian
                counterparts in time, they differed from them in social texture.
                They were burgher cities with sturdy domestic markets based
                on the ordinary staples of life to an extent we do not quite find
                in Italy (apart from Florence) or encounter in France. Cities
                involved in the Mediterranean trade made their fortunes
                largely from luxury goods such as silk, spices, gems, well-
                wrought armor, gold and silver ornaments, and the like, mainly
                transported from the Near East, North Africa, and Asia. By
                contrast, German’cities tended to deal in the making and sale
                of coarser cloths, tools, simple armor, food staples, and raw
                materials. These commodities gave rise to a stay-at-home
                artisan and merchant order that underpinned very stolid
                communities with a deep sense of rootedness and a strong
                appetite for security. Accordingly, a localist civicism and
                proclivity for autonomy persisted after the Italians had become
                relatively jaded in their municipal loyalties and yielded to
                despotic regimes. The German word Gemeinde has a special
                meaning in civic history for which other languages have poor
                equivalents. It denotes an organic community, a community
                that has a sense of identity and personality, indeed one in
232 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                which city hierarchies are notable for the contribution they
                make to the collective good at each level rather than the
                oppression they inflict on subordinates.
                Genoa and Venice acquired their wealth mainly from exotic
                goods and a Mediterranean-wide trade. Hamburg acquired its
                wealth from brewing and Liibeck from herring and the furs of
                east European forests. Merchant and artisan, trader and
                primary producer developed a symbiotic relationship that was
                relatively rare in the Latin cities of the south. The city
                confederacies projected their burgher traits onto their
                confederacies: cities and towns came together not only to
                protect their autonomy and liberties; they also joined to
                promote trade and share in a common prosperity, not simply
                as rivals whom circumstances forced into collusion with each
                other. The persistent conflict that marked so many Italian
                cities, especially when they developed into city-states that
                placed lesser communities under their control, was more
                subdued north of the Alps. Although bitter internal wars
                unravel this picture in the Flemish cities, where a nascent
                “proletariat” stood at loggerheads with a nascent “capitalist
                class” in the wool-processing industry of the time (a problem, I
                may add, that afflicted Florence no less than Bruges), the gild
                structures of central and northern Europe were more
                entrenched than elsewhere. They helped to create and
                empower a stratum of middling people, mainly artisans and
                small merchants, who enjoyed relatively comfortable lives and
                had a stabilizing effect on the community, cushioning the
                conflicts that were spawned by great disparities of wealth.
                Thus, one has the sense that German cities formed more
233 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                stable confederacies than did other urban entities in Europe.
                Indeed the Swiss Confederation, perhaps the most enduring
                and libertarian to emerge in Europe, rested heavily on the
                formation of the Graubunden or “Gray League,” the canton
                that was to be dubbed die kleine Schweiz or “little
                Switzerland,” partly because of its prototypic character as the
                home of Swiss democracy, partly too because of its ethnic
                diversity although its population is mainly German-speaking.
                Here, the Swiss recourse to referenda is reputed to have been
                born and “Nowhere through the whole range of history,”
                declared F. B. Baker exultantly, nearly a century ago, “is it
                possible to find a country where the democratic principle was
                more thoroughly applied ... or where the good and bad results
                of that principle have been more thoroughly
                demonstrated.”{58}
                Mumford’s churlish statements about the municipal
                confederacies of central Europe to the contrary
                notwithstanding, what the cities of Germanic Europe lacked in
                durability, they tended to make up in recuperability.{59} Some
                four centuries of German history are marked by a large number
                of municipal confederations that continually bubbled up to the
                surface of political life. The Hanseatic League, perhaps the
                most durable of the lot, existed from 1241, when Liibeck and
                Hamburg signed a treaty of mutual protection, to 1669, when
                its last diet was convened. Officially, the league was never
                terminated and cities such as Hamburg and Bremen are still
                designated as “Hanseatic cities.” Largely based on the Baltic
                trade, the league at its height embraced between 60 and 80
                cities (I have taken the most conservative figures at my
234 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                disposal), including the wool-processing center of Bruges in
                Flanders. Nearly all the major Baltic ports belonged to this
                confederacy at one time or another, and its ships ranged
                widely from Novogorod in the east to London in the west and
                along the Atlantic coastline.
                Still earlier, major confederacies appeared in parts of central
                Germany,; principally the short-lived First Rhenish League in
                1226, followed by the Second in 1254, which lasted until 1258.
                Some eighty cities, virtually all the leading Rhineland
                communities, belonged to the league until its members drifted
                away after supporting contending claimants to the throne of
                the Holy Roman Empire. Intermixed with the politics of the
                empire and endemically at war with nobles who preyed on
                their trade, their history weaves a story of enormous
                complexity and challenges. By 1384, a Swabian League had
                been formed that brought German cities to unprecedented
                influence. League members even advanced proposals to join
                the Swiss Confederation. Had the Swiss been responsive to
                these overtures, European history might have taken a very
                different turn than it did, possibly replacing nationalism with
                confederalism. But the union was not to be, and the cities, ever
                mindful of their autonomy and liberties, failed to prevail over
                the empire and the princes. Later leagues were to appear
                throughout Europe, even in England and, very significantly, in
                Spain. If we bear in mind the large number of municipal
                confederacies! that existed in Europe during the eleventh
                century and in the centuries that followed it, the certainty so
                prevalent in present-day historiography tliat the nation-state
                constitutes a “logical” development of Europe out of feudalism
235 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                can only be regarded as a bias, indeed a misuse of hindsight
                that verges on a mystical form of historical predetermination.
                Again, how, may we ask, were the Italian and northern
                European municipal confederacies structured? None of them
                created the popular intercity assemblies we encounter among
                the Greeks, Although citizen assemblies emerged within the
                cities, they did not appear between the cities. In Italy, the ad
                hoc nature of the confederacies did not create any serious
                problem of entrenched representatives who could defy the will
                of their constituencies: the confederacies were notable for
                their impermanence. They were little more than defensive
                alliances and disappeared as soon as they were not needed.
                The First Lombard League created a parliament of its own, but
                as Daniel Waley tells us, it simply assigned to its members
                areas of military responsibility and settled the price
                contributions of each to field armies (tallia milium) and
                garrisons.” This “parliament” never became a supracommunal
                authority.” Rather it functioned more like a temporary general
                staff. “To the communes,” Waley adds, “this societas or League
                was, like the Empire, an institution to be judged by its utility
                rather than by any theoretical implications: only an immediate
                imperialist threat could keep it in being.”{60} To the extent
                that we can speak of “capitalism” at this time, the highly
                aggressive entrepreneurial spirit of the Italian municipalities,
                fed by the enormous wealth of the Mediterranean-wide trade,
                fostered a degree of rivalry that inhibited cooperation between
                the cities and imparted a highly imperialistic spirit to the
                largest among them.
                This was not entirely the case north of the Alps. German city
236 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                confederations, for example, provide us with more enduring
                efforts to institutionalize intercommunal cooperation, efforts
                that reflect the prudent and deeply rooted burgher spirit of the
                communities that composed them as distinguished from the
                more reckless and venturesome features of the Italian
                merchants. The Second Rhenish League, shrewdly playing off
                the different candidates for the imperial throne, demanded and
                received formal recognition from William of Orange as a
                confederation—a civitates conjuratae—and avowed in its
                declaration that its citizens “have mutually bound
                [themselves] by oath to observe a general peace from St.
                Margaret’s Day (July 12, 1254).” This declaration was to go well
                beyond peacekeeping. Each member of the : league agreed to
                send four representatives to a city assembly or Städtetag—one
                at Worms for the upper Rhine, the other at Mainz for the lower
                —to remove excessive river tolls, provide for the common
                defense, add or expel new members, and foster the commerce
                and welfare of each of the league’s members to the benefit of
                all civic orders, including Jews and clergy, not only ordinary
                citizens. A board of arbitration was established to settle
                quarrels between confederate cities. Finally, an assembly
                meeting of the municipalities’ representatives was held on a
                quarterly basis, not on the usual annual one we encounter
                elsewhere.
                The Swabian League followed almost naturally out of its
                Rhenish predecessor and functioned as a countervailing force
                to the empire and the territorial lords. Its very formation
                without imperial sanction was an act of defiance against the
                efforts of Emperor Charles IV to assert centralized control over
237 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the German cities, hence its articles of agreement have a
                markedly defensive tone. But it functioned very much like the
                Rhenish League. By the 1380s, the confederacy forced the
                princes into temporary submission and, in combination with
                the League of the Rhine, which it structurally resembled,
                formed one of Europe’s greatest urban confederacies.
                The emergence of the celebrated Swiss Confederation or
                “Switzering anarchists” as Cromwell’s supporters were to call it
                centuries later, must be seen as an extension of the Rhenish
                and Swabian leagues, not an anomaly that stands at odds with
                the supposedly parochial traits imputed to European cities and
                their leagues. Switzerland was formed out of a milieu and
                modelled after examples that existed in central Europe as a
                whole.[9] The Swiss confederation, far from being an almost
                lonely “exception” to the confederal trends that existed in the
                thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, was actually a product of
                them. That the creation of nation-states was to be so greatly
                delayed in Germany and Italy is due in great measure to the
                obstacles that the cities, their confederacies, and later the
                powerful impact of their traditions of autonomy and freedom
                exercised on political life as a whole. It was not localist
                “pettiness” and “parochialism” that kept central and southern
                Europe from achieving nationhood until well into the
                nineteenth century. Rather, the “delay” was in great measure
                the product of a strong tradition of municipal autonomy and a
                dramatic history of resistance to centralization, however
                perverted this history became in later times. The Hanseatic
                League’s Diet, the Städtetag of the Rhenish League, and
                autonomous confederal’ bodies elsewhere in Europe haunt the
238 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                history of the continent like the unexorcised spirit of a more
                active public life and a vital civic politics. That the nation-state
                eventually did unite the laggard principalities of Germany,
                Italy, and, as we shall see, Spain into centralized states was not
                quite the happy dispensation it seemed to be at the turn of the
                present century, when nationhood was regarded as evidence
                of “modernity” and “progress.” Viewed with hindsight, the
                images of Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco rise up to remind us that
                the ideological celebration of the nation-state, which marked
                social theory during the Victorian era, was grossly misplaced.
                We of a later generation have good reason to lament the loss of
                the confederal alternative that appeared at an earlier epoch in
                Europe, one that might have averted the terrifying turn
                “national unity” took between 1914 and 1945.
                Confederalism was not merely an intuitive civic reaction to the
                feudal parochialism that marked so much of the medieval
                world at the time. There were theoretical not only practical
                considerations that were to surface almost simultaneously in
                two charismatic figures of western Europe. Heraldic rebels
                such as Cola di Rienzi in Rome and Etienne Marcel in Paris,
                contemporaries during the mid-fourteenth century, were to
                formulate the numerous moves toward confederal unity in very
                dramatic form. Rienzi’s efforts to restore a new Roman republic
                evoke images of the Gracchi and their efforts to restore Rome’s
                traditional republican virtues. His attacks on the venal nobility
                of papal Rome and his efforts to create a citizens’ militia were
                apparently part of a larger effort to unite Italy into civic leagues
                under Rome’s suzereinty. Present-day historians tend to depict
                Rienzi as a forerunner of Italian nationalism when they are not

                occupied with defaming him as a “demagogue” with strictly
                self-serving intentions. The greater likelihood is that he was a
                strident leader of Italian confederalism. As a self-styled
                “Tribune of the People,” a title redolent of the Gracchi rather
                than a Cincinnatus, Rienzi’s “parliament” was to be made up of
                delegates from Italian cities, not peninsular “provinces” that
                had yet to come into being. This effort was to be aborted when
                the papacy and nobility allied with each other, ultimately
                leading to his murder in 1354.
                Etienne Marcel emerges from this stormy era in a far more
                favorable light. A “provost of the merchants” and economically
                well-to-do in his own right, Marcel was clearly a popular leader
                of the “Third Estate” in Paris whose efforts to enlarge the
                powers of the Estates Generale at the expense of the
                monarchy and nobility and make royal taxes more equitable
                developed into a wider challenge to absolutism and aristocratic
                power. Marcel’s own goals, in fact, were probably more
                “bourgeois,” possibly even more “republican,” than his own
                order would have been prepared to accept. Like Rienzi, he was
                to enjoy immense support until a royalist faction within the
                middle class itself assassinated him in 1358. The tendency of
                nineteenth- and twentieth-century historians to read a “nation-
                state” mentality into men who lived in an era guided largely by
                feudal or confederal visions of political life is misleading.
                Underlying this bias is the: myth that Europe’s “bourgeoisie”
                was initially republican and basically nationalist in its
                convictions. Rierizi and Marcel rose to prominence because
                they spoke for artisans and the urban poor as well as merchant
                and professional strata, many of whom sided with the nobility

                against the ordinary people of Europe’s cities. Perez Zagorin
                seems to be much closer to the truth when be observes,
                “Grievances born of unfavorable conjoncture and wretched
                conditions underlay the popular upsurge, whereas Marcel
                himself was a revolutionary reformer who wanted to build an
                alliance of towns, strengthen the Estates General, and fasten
                political limitations on the monarchy. His movement also
                established some slight ties with the Jacquerie, the big peasant
                revolt that had broken out at the same time in the Ile-de-France
                and surrounding region.”{61} This judgement speaks to a
                confederal outlook, one that was more in tune with the period
                than a “nationalist” vision of a centralized France.
                Zagorin’s reference to the Jacquerie reminds us that the period
                faced a series of major peasant tumults—not only in France but
                throughout western Europe. The English Peasant Rebellion of
                1381, which followed the French Jacquerie by less than three
                decades, formed a high point in the restive village upsurges
                that finally led to the brief seizure of London by a peasant army.
                John Ball, an itinerant priest who’ was to color the rebellion with
                powerful declamations against social and economic inequality,
                gave the rising a larger-than-life image. Actually, the peasantry
                tended to rise in the aftermath of wartime ravages of the
                countryside or unpredictably in isolated pockets against feudal
                exactations, royal taxes, excessive “tithes,” upper-class
                highhandedness. To detail these uprisings would be
                impossible. Occasionally, they managed to cojoin with urban
                unrest into full-scale rebellions and to pose serious challenges
                to provincial and central authorities. Whether this connection
                was well-established—as was the case in the Hussite Wars of

                Bohemia during the fifteenth century—or assumed an
                emphemeral character, agrarian unrest became endemic
                throughout the centuries that followed and persists to this day
                in the Third World.
                Ordinarily, peasant revolts were short-lived and fragmented.
                The climax of these uprisings in western Europe was to emerge
                from the Lutheran Reformation of the 1520s, when the cities
                and countryside of Germany were thrown into years of
                persistent unrest. Between 1524 and 1526, German peasants
                rose on a mass scale; sweeping over large areas of the western
                and southern parts of the country and entering into historical
                annals as the famous “Peasants’ War.” Presumably, this was
                regarded as a “revolution” by chroniclers, who were eager to
                distinguish it from the many “rebellions” that exploded
                sporadically in the countryside from medieval times to the
                Enlightenment. The medley of ideologies, sentiments, and
                interests that are imputed to the German peasant uprising has
                endeared it to Marxists, liberals, romantics, theologians, and
                nationalists alike. It has been variously’ seen as a precursor of
                modern communistic movements, a striking example bf class
                war, an effort at moral regeneration, even as a forerunner of
                the German nation-state or a force that shaped’ its
                development. Most of these appraisals do not give sufficient
                emphasis to the deep-seated communitarian impulses that
                moved the peasants to action: their attempts to preserve the
                rural Gemeinde from fern dal, commercial, and clerical
                encroachment. If there is any unifying drama to the upheaval,
                it is the peasantry’s effort to preserve its organic communal
                ties, its traditional village universe that encompassed time-
242 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                honored values, institutions, and lifeways as well as
                landholdings that were challenged by princely and baronial
                encroachments. It is this universe, so much of a piece with the
                civic values of traditional society as such, that makes the
                Peasants’ War of 1524–26 so fascinating to theorists and
                historians of municipal development.
                The fortunes of this conflict, with all their varied
                interpretations, have been explored extensively enough to
                require no detailed treatment here. Thomas Munzer’s
                legendary “communist” tenets of the time probably articulated
                the peasantry’s commitment to its traditional networks of
                mutual aid, its timeless visions of a “golden age” based on
                equality, its precarious reality of collective management of
                land and goods that marked the Gemeinde—all village-based
                traditions rather than “anticipations” of socialist and
                communist theories that appropriately stem from a
                sophisticated industrial society rather than an old agrarian
                one. To the romantics who found in the peasantry the
                embodiment of a German ethnos, the conflict offers no
                inspiring myths of a united people motivated by a sense of
                blood and soil. The Peasants’ War was as fragmented as the
                society from which it stemmed. Only once do we hear of a
                really earnest effort to bring what were separate uprisings into
                a unified struggle. A “peasant parliament” was convened at
                Memmingen to form a “Christian Union of the Peasants” and
                coordinate the peasant armies of Upper Swabia. The union
                brought together the three Haufen or corps that were in revolt
                into common military operations, each led by a chief and four
                councillors, a structure that completely replicated the
243 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                administration of the peasant village. The village form, in
                effect, was projected onto the shared command structure of
                the mili tary forces, mirroring the traditional society that it was
                meant to preserve.
                The Memmingen “parliament” also formulated and adopted
                the famous “Twelve Articles” of the peasant revolt, a program
                worded in terms of scriptural authority. The articles “humbly”
                petition the secular authorities for the right of the villages to
                choose and depose their own pastors, to fix their own “tithes”
                according to the needs of the pastor and the poor of the
                community, to abolish serfdom, diminish corvee labor, reduce
                feudal dues and rents, and, finally, to restore all enclosed
                common land to the village and end further enclosures
                definitively. Allowing for many local variations, the Memmingen
                Articles became the basic program of the rebellious German
                peasantry and was soon the most widely circulated document
                of the war. Given its tone of humility, recourse to scriptural
                legitimacy, and humane demands, it completely expressed the
                spirit and values of the Gemeinde, It was the voice of a
                traditional village world by which the municipal life of the era
                was nourished and from which it drew its vitality. Herein lies the
                real continuity of the articles with German civic life: its strong
                solidarity as an ethical covenant.
                The German princes were to unite and crush the Peasants’ War
                in a terrible bloodbath. Although city support of the peasants
                was very widespread, it was often qualified and prone toward
                compromise. The Twelve Articles resonated with the urban
                poor and lower classes, and its moral tone and appeals to
                scripture won it considerable clerical support. The almost

                evangelical nature of the uprising gave it the qualities of a
                crusade for human rights and decency, traits that were not lost
                on many of the educated strata of the cities. Despite its radical
                rhetoric, Frederick Engels’s appraisal of the Peasants’ War is
                pervaded by all the prejudices of the last century. The war’s
                “chief result,” we are told, was the “strengthening of German
                decentralization which, in turn, was the “cause of [the war’s]
                failure.”{62} One is disposed to ask if victory by the peasants
                would have yielded a “centralization” of Germany that would
                have overcome the fragmentation created by the German
                princes. Accordingly, the Peasants’ War was either a
                “revolution,” as Engels claimed, or a crude anachronism as he
                should have claimed by his own standards of “historical
                materialism,” in which case it belonged not to the truly
                “revolutionary tradition” of Germany but to a “reactionary”
                one. His appraisal becomes all the more entangled when he
                rejects confederacy as a valid solution to Germany’s problems,
                a solution that the peasants intuitively seem to have desired.
                This problem is not an academic one. It raises the crucial
                question of whether or not seemingly “undeveloped” peoples
                today are to achieve what we so flippantly call
                “modernization”—by confederalism or nationalism,
                decentralism or centralism, libertarian institutions or
                authoritarian ones. We have not removed these questions from
                the future of our civilization nor can they be concealed from
                purview by the veil of history. If anything, hindsight has made
                them as searing today as they were in earlier times, when the
                terrifying future that now looms before us was very far
                removed from the eyes of men and women in the sixteenth
                century.

                This much must be emphasized: the attempts to create a
                nation-state in western Europe four centuries ago did not occur
                without considerable resistance from the free cities of the era,
                rebellious villages, and aroused artisans, not only recalcitrant
                nobles. The sixteenth century, which was decisive in the rise of
                European absolutism and ultimately nationalism, bears
                witness to a veritable deluge of village, provincial, and urban
                uprisings. Even England was not spared from dramatic
                agrarian unrest: Kett’s Rebellion of 1549, while more of a mass
                protest against land enclosures than a revolutionary challenge
                to royal authority, required the use of thousands of troops
                before it could be subdued. In France, the rebellion was
                followed by the rising of the Croquants between 1592 and
                1595, a struggle more redolent of German demands for village
                autonomy than the English one. Such revolts, generally
                localized and easily subdued, were to become endemic as
                France passed deeper into absolutism and ultimately
                revolution. Indeed, it was not until the Napoleonic Era that they
                came to a definitive end, and a once rebellious peasantry was
                turned into a conservative pillar of the Bonapartist monarchy.
                None of these rebellions produced confederations or
                developed into serious challenges to the emerging nation-
                states of the West. The civic roots of the English Revolution
                have rarely been appraised from a municipal viewpoint,
                although the revolution that began in England in the 1640s
                was to find a remarkably democratic fulfillment in the
                townships of New England. (This is a development we must
                reserve for a later and fuller discussion.) The Great French
                Revolution, in turn, was to evoke the ideal of communal
246 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                confederation without giving it permanent reality. Indeed, the
                Jacobin “dictatorship,” if such it can be called, was to turn
                France into one of the most centralized nation-states in Europe.
                But the ideal did not die. Later, it acquired a brief and glowing
                moment of reality in the subsequent Paris Commune of 1871, a
                commune or “city council” that called upon all the cities of
                France to join’it in a huge civic confederation—only to be
                crushed in bloody fighting with troops of the Third Republic
                after some two months of existence. With magnificant
                stubbornness, the Paris Commune of the nineteenth century
                had tried to bring to life what its predecessor of the eighteenth
                century had entertained in its conflict with the Jacobin-
                controlled Convention during the last years of the Great
                Revolution.
                Ironically, the most serious threat to absolutism and the
                nationstate by a confederation of municipalities was to emerge
                during the sixteenth century in a country where absolutism
                seemed virtually triumphant: Spain under the rule of Europe’s
                sternest and politically least yielding monarch, Charles V. The
                period directly preceding the final subjugation of the Moors in
                1492 was marked by a remarkable burgeoning of city life and
                the consolidation of Spanish absolutism under the Catholic
                monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella. Spain’s prosperity and its
                movement toward a nation-state seem like an almost textbook
                example of collaboration between a monarchy and an urban
                “bourgeoisie.” That monarchy and city could have eventually
                entered into conflict with each other would have seemed
                inconceivable at the time if it did not actually happen. Isabella,
                following an active policy of fostering city life and playing

                urban strata against landed magnates, promoted internal
                commerce, scrupulously respected municipal rights, and
                worked closely with the Spanish Cortes, the country’s
                “parliament.” This policy was intended to develop institutions
                and forces countervailing the rapacious Spanish territorial
                lords. The gilds, long the objects of royal hostility, were
                permitted to extend their ordinances and confirmed in their
                Tights to control production operations. The ‘‘crusade” against
                the Moors was shrewdly used to increase popular enthusiasm
                for the monarchy, indeed to give it a centrality in Spanish life
                and religion that, it had never enjoyed. The image of a morally
                regenerated Christian Spain evoked hopes of a stable, unified,
                and powerful nation whose restive nobility and centrifugal
                regionalism had to be brought under rigorous control.
                This image was translated into a certain measure of fact,
                especially in Castile, the Spanish heartland. Castile formed the
                bulwark of the newly emerging nation, the source of its
                prevailing dialect, its manners, and the “prototypic” Spanish
                character, which held such linguistically, ethnically, and
                culturally disparate “Spains” as the Basques, Catalans, and
                largely Moorish Andalusians together. Here, tod, the monarchy
                in later years was to choose its future capital, Madrid, and turn
                the city into the administrative center of the country as a
                whole. This state machinery was one of the most sophisticated
                in Europe. At the same time, the Catholic kings began to shore
                up their relationship with the cities, deflecting urban hostility
                from the monarchy to the nobility and drawing upon urban
                wealth to consolidate royal rule, Ferdinand and Isabella
                enlarged their bureaucratic control over the independent cities

                were given extended powers to bring the urban noble clans
                under control and protect the cities from landed magnates who
                exploited them.. Municipal land that the magnates had illegally
                seized were restored in some measure; tax farmers, whose
                actions verged on outright plunder, were replaced by the
                encabezamiento system in which the main tax, the alcabala,
                was collected by local officials; the Royal Council was staffed
                by university trained lawyers, the letrados, and a supervisory
                hierarchy of officials to oversee the burgeoning bureaucracy
                from secretaries to visitadores who provided for redress from
                abuses and grievances. A centralized and professional
                judiciary, together with various councils of brotherhoods, the
                Inquisition, and the Cortes itself balanced out a bureaucracy
                and provided for close royal supervision of nearly all aspects of
                Spanish life.
                This machinery, partly traditional and partly new, was destined
                to have a very limited life span. Although the French monarchy
                was to install a similar one that lasted for some two centuries,
                the Spanish state machinery began to weaken appreciably
                even during the reign of the Catholic monarchs. The final
                struggle against the Moors essentially brought the conflict
                between the monarchy and nobility to an end. Despite her
                fears of the landed magnates, Isabella was obliged to use them
                militarily to complete the reconquest, and the magnates
                claimed their full rewards for supporting the state. Increasingly,
                the lost municipal lands were recovered by the aristocracy,
                their taxing powers were increased, their abilities to sidestep
                disagreeable court decisions were enhanced, and their

                financial control of the monarchy increased immensely. When
                in 1519 Charles V became king of Spain as Carlos I and entered
                his claim to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire, the
                monarchy was largely under aristocratic control. Born and
                raised in Flanders, Charles quickly earned the mistrust of his
                Spanish subjects as a foreigner whose principal concerns were
                his own imperial ambitions and who lived mainly abroad to
                advance them. Virtually all strata of Castilian society viewed
                the newly installed king as a man who regarded Spain as a
                resource for his squabbles abroad, freely bilking the country of
                its wealth.
                To exacerbate matters still further, the central administrative
                apparatus was all but taken over by a coterie of Flemish
                advisors that was notable for its insensitivity to Spanish
                traditions and interests. Inept and clumsy, Charles’s Flemish
                surrogates turned the monarchy into a parasitic entity in which
                the aristocracy was the main beneficiary of the new
                dispensation. Increasing taxes, a grave decline in the honesty
                and effectiveness of the corregidores, a breakdown in the road
                system that led to higher, often unbearable financial levies on
                impoverished village and town populations, a failure by inept
                or corrupt supervisory officials to discharge their
                responsibilities in controlling the bureaucracy and aristocracy,
                a decline in the integrity of the court system, a military system
                that quartered ill-paid and unruly troops with an increasingly
                impoverished population—all, well underway before Charles
                became king, were exacerbated by alien rulers, a suspect
                monarch, the declining prestige of the royal power, and the
                growing encroachments of a self-serving aristocracy.

                On May 30,1520, a crowd of woolworkers seized a hated
                member of Segovia’s Cortes delegation and hanged him,
                leading to a revolt in the city that forced all its royal officials to
                take to their heels. This seemingly local act of crowd violence
                was to unleash one of history’s most extraordinary municipal
                “revolutions,” as many historians call it, the rising of the
                Comuneros (literally translated as Communards). Although this
                comunidad or community revolt was fairly short-lived, it is
                outstanding for its institutional creativity. The action of the
                woolworkers in Segovia pales before the more serious rebellion
                that developed when Toledo’s city council, challenging an
                unfavorable change in royal tax policy, wrote to all the cities
                represented in the Cortes and defiantly called upon them to
                establish a common front against the royal government. What
                may have appeared like one of many urban tax revolts that
                marked the whole period soon turned into a full-scale
                revolution. Within months, city after city in Castile began to
                collect and impound all taxes collected for the monarchy. Civic
                militias were organized, and far-reaching changes were
                introduced to democratize and enhance the autonomy of
                municipal governments. On Toledo’s suggestion, a national
                junta was established with delegates from all the Cortes cities.
                The Comuneros, in effect, had established a parallel or “dual”
                power in opposition to the prevailing royal administration.
                Early reactions to this development ranged from the
                enthusiastic to the tolerant. Even the landed magnates, ever
                mindful of an opportunity to gain from any diminution of the
                central government, placed a tactful distance between
                themselves and the monarchy. By mustering an impressive
251 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                army of citizens with an infrastructure and added detachments
                of professional soldiers, the Comunero Junta moved speedily
                toward a series of victories that threatened to replace the
                entire royal state with a municipal confederation. The
                Comuneros had created their own military system, an
                administrative apparatus that reached deeply into most of
                Castile’s social order, tax resources, and a tremendous
                reservoir of popular goodwill, cutting across seemingly
                insurmountable “class” barriers (including clerical ones) that
                seemed irresistible in the early months of the junta’s existence.
                What brought this movement to an end in April 1521 when its
                last major field detachments were defeated, near the village of
                Villalar? Toledo, it should noted, held out against royalist forces
                until February 1522, and other cities tried to resist after the
                battle of Villalar. Perhaps the most strategic military fact was
                the swing of the nobility from a generally neutral position over
                to the monarchy. No less important was the support that the
                royalists slowly acquired from the city elites—the knights or
                Caballeros who lived in urban areas, well-to-do merchants, the
                higher clergy, and generally more prosperous strata, who were
                alienated by the radicalization and democratization of civic life.
                The Comuneros, like their heirs centuries later in Paris, were
                stridently urban in outlook and retained a basic hostility to the
                peasantry (who actually were their natural allies) as a class
                controlled by the nobles. Finally, the Comuneros could not
                extend their movement beyond the center of Spain. Viewed as
                Castilians by the other “Spains” that surrounded them, the
                movement was seen as the work of a privileged population
                that had revolted against its even more privileged overlords.

                The Catalans, Basques, and Andalusians, to cite the most well-
                known regions hostile to Castilian hegemony, could not be
                brought to identify with a Castilian cause, however much the
                Comuneros solicited their support
                It is easy in view of these reasons to see the revolt of the
                Comunidades as a strictly “class” movement, to speak of it
                variously as “atavistic” because it posed a mere municipal
                challenge to a seemingly “progressive” nation-state or to
                regard it as a conflict of interests between vague, indefinable
                class strata: nobles, a “bourgeoisie,” a “nascent proletariat,”
                and the like. The term “nascent” is what makes such a “class
                analysis” questionable. Of all the clearly definable “classes”
                that were to play a major role in later Spanish history—apart
                from Spain’s enduring peasantry-only the landed magnates
                survived the era as a cohesiye stratum and were to carry on
                intact until recent times. The others are more properly “orders”
                in their indefinability, that is, in their paucity of economic roots,
                their wavering stability as social groups, and the murkiness of
                their concerns. What we have here is a typical, quasifeudal
                “Third Estate,” ranging from well-to-do, even wealthy, strata to
                an amorphous mass of artisans, merchants, “intellectuals” of
                various sorts, clerks, and clerics, to which we may add a
                considerable number of servants, laborers, and beggars. This
                “Third Estate” was united by its urbanity, literally by a shared
                culture as town dwellers. Despite the many material
                differences that were to separate them, either they were
                citizens Of a particular city or they aspired to be. Their
                ideological unity came from the primary loyalty that the city
                claimed and from the political arena it created. It was the city,
253 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                not their “class,” that evoked in them a real feeling of place, a
                meaningful commitment of service, and a clear sense of self-
                definition. This collective loyalty to a patria chica, to a “small
                fatherland,” so intense among urban dwellers during that era,
                is difficult to convey today when nationalism has invaded all
                public sentiments of local loyalty. In the sixteenth century it
                was intense enough to impart an alien, almost exogenous,
                quality to the central power and to focus one’s devotion on the
                village, town, or city in which one lived rather than the still-
                emerging nation-state.
                Nowadays, we would be inclined to believe that such varied
                economic groups would be in chronic conflict with each other, a
                conclusion that seems to be supported by the internal conflicts
                that engulfed many cities of Europe, particularly the Flemish
                and Italian ones. Actually, this is a very one-sided picture of
                urban fife in the past. It is easy for historians to forget how
                readily disparate strata in a city united against invaders or
                other city rivals, despite their divergent economic interests. In
                fact, it would be hard to understand why the Comuneros could
                unite in the first place, given the disparities in wealth and social
                position that existed in their cities, and why a strong sense of
                unity existed to the very last, even after urban elites began to
                fall away from their movement. Their royalist opponents did
                not win all the well-to-do strata of the Castilian cities; in fact,
                there was resistance to the very end, especially in Toledo,
                which held out against royalist opponents for nearly a year
                after the battle of Villalar. What the royalists succeeded in
                achieving was enough of a division between these strata to tip
                the balance in their favor and bring the greater military

                prowess of the aristocracy into an advantageous position over
                relatively inexperienced civic militias.
                What the Comuneros really achieved has yet to be fully
                grasped by some of its historians. The movement opened civic
                life on a scale that had rarely been seen in Europe since
                Hellenic times. It expanded the very meaning of the word
                “politics,” not only at a confederal, city, or town level but at a
                neighborhood or parish level. Comunero demands were
                strikingly radical even for our day: a Cortes, composed of city
                delegations, which would greatly limit royal authority, and a
                municipal democracy whose extent varied from one city to
                another. In a group of articles formulated in Valladolid, the
                Comuneros demanded that delegates for the Cortes be chosen
                with the consent of parish assemblies instead of city councils,
                the practice followed by the monarchy. These delegates in turn
                were to be guided by the mandate of their electors and were to
                acquire the right to consult with their cities if their instructions
                did not adequately cover the problems that surfaced at the
                Cortes, a right that the monarchy had consistently denied city
                delegates to the parliamentary body. Had these demands been
                realized, Spain would have seen the emergence of a broadly
                based local democracy, one deeply rooted in city
                neighborhoods as well as municipalities. Such a democracy, in
                fact, went far beyond radical conceptions of political
                representation. They were an open invitation to revitalize the
                entire public sphere, opening it to all strata of the population
                and advanced urban concepts of citizenship that were all-
                inclusive and completely grass-roots in character. In cities such
                as Toledo and Valladolid, this neighborhood democracy was not

                merely a demand; it became a working reality, one that was
                rarely to be achieved again until the rise of the Parisian
                sectional movement in the Great French Revolution.
                Many Comunero demands constituted a sixteenth-century “Bill
                of Rights.” The Cortes was to meet regularly and all the
                grievances of the Comunidades were to be addressed before it
                could terminate its proceedings. The Comuneros, of course,
                called for the protection of property from legal confiscation
                except in cases of treason; freedom from harsh punishment in
                criminal cases; limits on the quartering of visiting royalty;
                prohibition of the sale of public offices; reforms of judicial and
                appeals procedures; and the complete “Castilianization” of the
                court, which Charles had filled with aliens who knew very little
                about Spanish problems. The demands contained a strong,
                basically egalitarian appeal for choosing officials according to
                their personal merit, professional qualifications, and moral
                probity rather than for their status and social background.
                Charles’s victory over the Comuneros signalled the triumph in
                Spain of statecraft over politics, of the nation-state over
                confederalism. It was a victory that was attained primarily by
                the force of arms, not by a hidden logic of history. The struggle
                of the Comunidades with the monarchy—it was never a
                struggle against monarchism as such although it came very
                close at times to a challenge of monarchical rule in its
                sixteenth-century form—had been preceded by similar
                conflicts between city leagues or confederacies almost
                everywhere on the European continent. It was to be followed
                by greater or lesser struggles of a similar nature after nation-
                states had been well-established. If Spain, one of Europe’s

                strongest absolute monarchies in the sixteenth century, is
                singled out for study, the Comunero movement did not
                establish a tradition that an “ascending” bourgeoisie could
                claim for itself. Quite to the contrary: the Comuneros found a
                later, albeit highly modified, expression in Pi y Margall’s
                Federalist movement of the late nineteenth century, which
                distinctly resisted state centralization, and finally in the largest
                anarchist movement in Europe.
                Charles V did nothing to foster a capitalist society. Indeed,
                absolutism became a lethal cancer in a once prosperous
                country that was devitalized by massive state expenditures for
                imperial adventures abroad. The Comunero movement, by
                contrast, tried to rein this monarchy and ultimately drastically
                diminish its power. Its failure was followed over a period of time
                by an incredible decline of Spanish economic and urban life.
                Cities sank into lethargy, agriculture stagnated under the rule
                and mismanagement of the magnates, roads were permitted
                to decay, and the wealth of the country was vastly diminished.
                On the other hand, the Industrial Revolution in Europe, which
                presumably dates the ascendancy of urban capitalism over
                traditional society, did not foster a city development in Spain
                that was wholesome or vital. It did not revive community life;
                rather, it replaced what remained of community with
                urbanization, anomie, and, under Francisco Franco, with a
                ferociously terrorist regime that has variously been called
                “nationalist” by its admirers and “fascist” by its opponents.
                Whether or not the two terms actually reveal the convergence
                of a development that was to yield centralized authority in its
                most brutal forms is a problem that we have yet to resolve in
257 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                our own time.
                That there is a logic in certain historical premises, one that unf
                olds more as a tendency than a necessity, is certainly not
                arguable: nationalism does foster totalitarianism, and the
                centralized state tends to develop into an all-embracing state.
                But it is certainly difficult to argue, that a suprahuman
                phenomenon called “history” exists and predetermines a
                society’s development. The Comuneros had opened a pathway
                to a cooperative, unified Spain that could have yielded a very
                different dispensation from that which came with a centralized
                nation-state. So, too, had earlier city confederacies, whose
                achievements meet with so much disdain. Politics had to be
                structured around a community of one kind or another,
                whether as a polis, Gemeinde, burg, commune, or city. Lacking
                the flesh and blood of politically involved people and
                comprehensible self-governing institutions, the human
                phenomenon we call “society” tends to disintegrate at its base,
                even as it seems to consolidate at its apex.
                Centralization becomes most acute when deterioration occurs
                at the base of society. Divested of its culture as a political
                realm, society becomes an ensemble of bureaucratic agencies
                that bind monadic individuals and family units into a strictly
                administrative structure or a form of “possessive,” more
                properly acquisitive, individualism that leads to privitization of
                the self and its disintigration into mere egoism. The city, in
                turn, is no longer united by any sort of ethical bond. It becomes
                a marketplace, a destructured and formless economic unit, a
                realm in which the Hobbesian war of “all against all” becomes
                a virtual reality, ironically designated as a “return to nature.”

                Such a condition and the mentality it produces constitute a
                dissolution of nature and society’s evolutionary thrust toward
                diversity, complexity, and community, a problem that
                appropriately belongs to the newly developing field and
                philosophy of social ecology rather than urban sociology. It is a
                social problem because we are talking about one of the most
                elemental forms of human consociation—the city—where
                people advance beyond the kinship bond to share, create, and
                develop the means of life, culturally as well as economically, as
                human beings. Here, humanitas as distinguished from the
                “folk” comes into its own. And it is an ecological problem in the
                sense that diversity, variety, and participation constitute not
                only the basis for the stability of human consociation but also
                for the creativity that is imparted to us by diversity, indeed,
                ultimately, the freedom that alternative forms of development
                allow for the evolution of new, richer, and well-rounded social
                forms.
                Urbanization, which I see as the dissolution of the city’s wealth
                of variety and as a force that makes for municipal homogeneity
                and formlessness, is a threat to the stability, fecundity, and
                freedom that the city added to the social landscape. A critical
                analysis of how urbanization emerged, its genesis partly in the
                nation-state, partly in industrialism, and generally with the
                onset of capitalistic forms of production and distribution—all
                examined from the viewpoint of social ecology—is a problem of
                crucial importance for our time, indeed one that will help us
                define the future of the city, politics, and, above all, citizenship.

                From the sixteenth century onward, Europe was the stage for a
                drama unique in history: the development of nation-states and
                national cultures in which populations tended to identify with
                what we, today, accept as a commonplace—a sense of
                personal nationality. Even the notion of citizenship, long-rooted
                in loyalty to a city and the public body that occupied it, began
                to shift toward a large territorial entity, the “nation,” and to its
                “capital” city. Politics, too, began to acquire a new definition. It
                increasingly denoted the professionalization of power with
                roots in the state and its institutions.
                We would be gravely mistaken to assume that these changes
                and redefinitions occurred within the span of a few centuries or
                that they have been completed even in our own time. The
                development toward nationalism was slow, uneven, and very
                mixed. Nor is it secure in its major European centers. There is a
                strong human proclivity, reaching back to the socialization
                process itself and familial care, that identifies “homeland” with
                home rather than nationalist abstractions, hence even the
                most consolidated nation-states are more divided internally
                than nationalist myths would have us believe. For example, the
                intense domestic conflicts that beleaguer the United States—
                notably between ethnic groups, regions, and even localities,
                not to speak of economic classes and interests—are testimony
                to the hold of specific cultural and territorial identities among
                populations, even those that belong to highly nationalistic
                “superpowers.” These divisions are more strongly evident in
                modern Russia.
                Nationalism exercises its strongest power over the popular
                imagination in oppositional ways when a nation is in some

                sense under attack. As an internally cohesive fdrce, it has
                always been fragile. The success of National Socialism in
                “unifying” the German people has deeper roots in German
                history than in a sense of national allegiance, a history that is
                notable for the tragic decline of German social life after the
                Reformation and the need for compensatory mechanisms to
                counteract the slump that marked that bloody and ennervating
                period.
                But how did these nation-states come into existence? What
                role did European cities play in forming them? And what began
                to happen to cities—and with them, politics and citizenship—
                when the nation-state asserted its sovereignty over public fife?
                We have seen that nationalism existed only in an incipient form
                in the ancient world where, with few exceptions, people
                psychologically and culturally identified themselves with their
                villages, towns, cities, and immediate territorial area. Classical
                antiquity was mainly an era of empire building, not of nation
                building, and ancient imperialism took a very special form. It
                was patrimonial, not strictly political; its center was the royal
                household, not a capital in any nationalist sense. If “all roads
                lead to Rome,” it is not because Rome; was, a city that
                commanded a high degree of national loyalty but’rather
                because it was the hub of ancient power and order. Its
                centrality was derived from its administrative significance, not,
                as is the case with Jerusalem, its symbolic significance. Indeed,
                insofar as Rome was symbolic of anything, it was seen as a
                symbol of oppression. Crucifixion, a mode of punishment
                normally reserved for rebels and intransigent slaves, imparted
                to the cross a symbolic meaning not unlike that which was
261 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                attached to the Nazi swastika during the World War II. The
                adoption of this symbol by the Church instead of the fish, which
                early Christians used as an expression of plentitude and
                conversion, reflected the accommodation of the heavenly city
                to the worldly city—Rome—and of a rebellious creed to the
                institutions it originally opposed. Rome, once the whore of the
                world; to the early Christians became the holy city of the
                papacy and acquired a spiritual status in the very act of
                seducing its most intransigent rebels, a lesson in statecraft that
                far too many rebels have failed to learn.
                Medieval Europe did, not have nations at all. Loyalties were
                mainly localist in character, notably to one’s, village, parish,
                town, city, barons, and rather tenuously to one’s monarch.
                Strong kings such as Henry II of England and Philip Augustus of
                France had an unusual amount of power for their times and, by
                their innovations as well as their actions, exercised a great deal
                of authority over their barons and clerics. More often than not,
                however, tlieir heirs were weaklings and royal authority was
                easily subverted by feudal lords until another strong monarch
                surfaced and managed to centralize power for a brief period of
                time. Personal authority and the forcefulness of a monarch’s
                character created the illusion of a nation-state, but it was still
                along patrimonial lines. The association of the monarch with
                the “nation,” such as it was, was so close that “nationalism” in
                the Middle Ages rarely survived the person of the king. The
                wide swings in royal authority that we encounter in European
                feudalism stem from the tenuous basis of centralized authority
                as such in the ancient arid medieval worlds. Centralized power
                was limited by the hard facts of a primitive communications

                system and a largely Neolithic technology. Armies and officials
                could move no faster than horses; roads were very poor, often
                almost trackless; and weaponry had barely emerged from the
                Bronze Age. The simple fact that obedience depended heavily
                upon personal ties and a reasonable modicum of fear of a
                resolute king resulted in a loosely hanging political system
                based on individual’ commitments and the use of brutal
                punitive measures. The times were cruel rather than barbarous
                because of the nature of statecraft in a world where authority
                was extremely fragile and punishment took a very harsh form
                in order to sustain monarchical and baronial power.
                The one institution that commanded widespread allegiance
                beyond that which any monarch could hope to achieve was the
                Roman Church and the papacy. Shaped over centuries into a
                vast hierarchical bureaucracy, the Catholic Church eventually
                became the most unifying and certainly the most centralized
                apparatus in western Europe. It could reach into villages with
                an effectiveness that was the envy of any royal authority, and
                its command of resources had no precedent on the continent. I
                refer not only to its enormous wealth and landholdings but also
                to its spiritual power—ultimately the power of
                excommunication and interdiction that brought even emperors
                such as Frederick Barbarossa to their knees.
                Yet here one encounters a paradox to which J. R. Strayer gives
                deserved emphasis.{63} The papacy as early as the eleventh
                century, during the time of Gregory VII, was an empire unto
                itself. More important than its centralized institutional structure
                is the compelling fact that it was an elaborate state: a vast
                apparatus not only with its black-robed bureaucracy but a

                system of law and a juridical machinery adequate enough to
                make its legal sovereignty effective. The emergence of
                ecclesiastical law served to open a crucial area for the
                development of secular law. In the great division of power that
                Gregory VII created between church and state, the latter
                essentially disentangled itself from the former. Secular law,
                rarely free in the past of ecclesiastical influence and priestly
                functionaries, could now come completely into its own. In the
                very act of charting and firming up its own authority, the
                Church created an ever-growing space for the expansion of the
                state and for a largely nonreligious form of statecraft that no
                longer required supernatural sanction and legitimation.
                However much monarchs were to claim divine right to support
                their authority, their rights were divine, not their origins—
                origins that even the Roman Caesars claimed. Hence, like all
                rights, they could be challenged even on religious grounds by
                the church, the barons, and later by the people. Rights are
                always subject to rational evaluation and legitimate defiance, a
                problem that monarchs such as Charles I of England and Louis
                XVI of France were to face before accusing regicides. That the
                Church, too, by claiming a legal domain of its own, was to pay a
                heavy penalty by being removed later on from every sphere
                other than its spiritual authority is a part of history that adds a
                dimension of irony and paradox to all assertions of power—the
                paradoxical reality of history’s own dialectical process.
                The great division between state and church, monarch and
                pope, secular and divine can be taken as a symbolic expression
                for the many divisions that riddled medieval society and made
                the nation-state possible. Had medieval society been entirely
264 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                unitary, it might very well have been blanketed by large,
                suffocating, patrimonial empires that would have drained its
                resources and diverted it into a relatively stagnant dead end.
                Ironically, it was the fragmentation of the European world that
                made its unification into several nation-states possible. In
                contrast to empires, nations are relatively self-contained; their
                existence, at least between the sixteenth and eighteenth
                centuries, was possible only because empire building by one
                state was blocked by the power of another. Nation building, in
                effect, occurred not only because monarchs accumulated
                sufficient power to establish a central authority in parts of
                western Europe but also because their ability to extend that
                power beyond a region was arrested by countervailing powers
                external to them. Charles V’s efforts to create an empire in the
                sixteenth century failed because other states acquired enough
                power to successfully resist him and his son, Philip II. The
                successful revolt of the Netherlands and the defeat of the
                Spanish Armada by England ended any serious attempt to
                create an empire within Europe up to our own time, despite the
                Napoleonic wars and Germany’s expansion from 1940 to 1945.
                Nation-states and nationalism have vitiated all efforts to create
                empires on the continent, at least by direct means. Russian
                expansion toward the west, seemingly vigorous after 1945, has
                visibly begun to ebb. American power in Europe, although
                rarely exercised in a direct manner, stands at odds with its
                strongly republican institutions.
                This external system of “checks and balances” that medieval
                Europe produced on a continental level has its parallel in an
                internal system of “checks and balances” that existed on a
265 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                domestic level. The intercity trade that provided economic
                underpinnings to the formation of nation-states repeatedly
                came up against strong localist barriers—artisan gilds,
                relatively self-sufficient village economies, popular hostility to
                trade that formed the legacy of medieval Christianity, and a
                very strong individual desire, particularly among craftsmen
                and free peasants, to live directly by their own skills and on
                their own property with minimal commercial intercourse—a
                state of mind we would call “self-sufficiency,” today, which has
                its roots in the Greek concept of autarkeia. Nor can we ignore
                the immense hold of the Gemeinde, the local community, on.
                the minds of people during that period, a sense of communal
                loyalty that was reinforced not only by cultural bonds but by a
                tradition of communal land ownership and mutual aid.
                The considerable attention that recent economic historians
                have given to the role of foreign trade in producing a
                capitalistic society and the nation-state is somewhat
                ingenuous. That the earliest forms of capitalism in the ancient
                as well as medieval worlds were commercial and that port and
                riverine cities often enriched themselves enormously,
                promoting a domestic market for goods acquired abroad, does
                not remove the need for a balanced perspective toward the
                reach this economy had into the depths of emerging European,
                nations. Owing to the poor condition of the roads that existed
                in Europe, the cost of commodities brought from abroad rose
                enormously as they moved inland. A cartload of hay priced at
                600 denari during Diocletian’s time increased by 20 denari
                every mile so that the cost of transporting it as little as 30 miles
                rendered its sale in a nearby market prohibitive. Unless a good
266 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                network of waterways existed, foreign trade had a limited
                economic impact on the interior of a region. Generally, the
                commodities that passed from port and riverine cities to inland
                towns were luxury items or direly needed goods in limited
                supply. Spices, expensive cloths, skillfully crafted artifacts and
                weapons, and exotic foods from abroad were the usual fare
                that were carried from port cities into the interior of Europe.
                Within the heartland of the newly emerging nations, trade was
                often local rather than national. Intercity trade brought towns
                and villages together but in regional networks and local,
                markets, not in national ones.
                This “parochialism,” to use a term that is distinctly pejorative
                today, gave inland towns a certain degree of economic
                strength: their relative self-sufficiency and ingrown cultures
                provided them with the material and spiritual fortitude to resist
                the overbearing effects of the nation-state, particularly during
                the “Age of Absolutism,” when strong monarchs came to the
                foreground of European political life. Decentralism remained a
                major obstacle—and, for generations, an abiding civic impulse
                —in counteracting the extension of royal power. Hence,
                emerging European nation-states were often checked
                internally as well as externally from successfully engaging in
                empire building. European empire building found an outlet not
                in the “old” continent but abroad, in so-called “new” continents
                such as the Americas, where indigenous peoples, living in tribal
                communities were easily quelled by recently discovered
                firearms, and, in no small part, by dazzling European trinkets.
                Needless to emphasize, European epidemics, too, played a
                major role in depleting aboriginal populations and demoralizing

                them..
                The rise of European nation-states, so unique when compared
                with the imperial systems of antiquity and the fragmented
                social structures of feudalism, can thus be explained by a
                special conjunction of forces. A few are simply negative: the
                internal resistance within emerging nations to centralism that
                made a highly organized patrimonial state difficult to achieve
                and the balance between new states that confined them to a
                “national” scale. Other, factors, more positive in nature, consist
                of the fairly organic links established between municipalities
                primarily by local and regional trade and secondarily by the
                exceptionally rich rewards that port cities acquired from foreign
                commerce. The royal power that built the nation-state, virtually
                brick by brick as it were, used the internal intercity networks as
                political routes for extending its bureaucracies into the depths
                of the country just as the Church, centuries earlier, sent its
                missionaries and holy orders into the forests and farmlands of
                barbarian Europe along trails and footpaths.
                Despite the enormous wealth monarchs gained from the taxes
                these commercial networks provided, nation building was still
                primarily a political phenomenon. Economic explanations to
                the contrary notwithstanding, the absolute monarchs of the
                sixteenth century who dominated the emerging era of
                European nationalism drained the economy as much as they
                fostered its development; The removal of feudal tolls on roads
                and riverways, the domestic tranquility provided by the “King’s
                peace,” the creation of a national currency and presumably a
                reliable monetary system were vitiated by the enormity of
                royal taxes, the ongoing wars between nation-states that
268 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                placed Europe in a chronic state of siege, and the monetary
                instability produced by royal loans and defaults.
                The role cities played in this development was very mixed;
                indeed, to understand it, we must know what kind of city we
                are talking about and what phase of nation building we are
                examining. Generally, the smaller, artisan-oriented towns
                tended to oppose the nation-state and often gained support for
                their opposition from the relatively free peasantry in their
                environs. Indeed, it could be said in a very broad way that
                where artisans were the majority of a free town, they elected
                for municipal freedom and were more predisposed to forming
                town confederations than larger, commercially oriented cities.
                Their high sense of independence and their striking defiance of
                authority was not to end with their opposition to royal rule;
                whether as master craftsmen or as skilled workers, they shared
                an intuitive inclination toward a vague kind of republicanism,
                often even democracy, that clashed with the politically more
                conservative merchant, banking, and professional strata in
                their own communities and in strongly commercial cities.
                The radical role played by skilled artisans in precapitalist
                society and in periods of transition to the nation-state and
                capitalism is only recently gaining the attention it deserves.
                This is not to say that this on-going stratum that was not to
                disappear as a major social force even after the Industrial
                Revolution, which virtually destroyed it, shared a completely
                unified outlook. Between a master craftsman who enjoyed the
                privileges conferred by gild membership and a skilled worker
                who was barred from the status of a master by increasing gild
                exclusivity, a serious gap developed that could rend

                communities in violent struggles. We have seen evidence of
                such struggles in Flanders and Italy, where skilled as well as
                unskilled workers were proletarianized and reduced to
                exploited wage earners. But elsewhere in Europe, the
                traditional bridges between master craftsmen and skilled
                workers served effectively to close the gap that had been
                created by status differences; indeed, in many places gild
                doors remained fairly open well into the Middle Ages.
                What is so noticeable about this town stratum, taken as a
                whole, is the fairly high educational level it attained. Artisans
                were often well-read, surprisingly well-informed, and
                intellectually innovative. Craftsmanship sharpened not only
                one’s dexterity and esthetic sense; it sharpened one’s mind as
                well. The radical heretical movements within medieval
                Christianity consisted of large numbers of well-read artisans,
                not simply “millenarian” peasants, as Marxist historians such
                as Eric Hobsbawn would have us believe.{64} The Brethren of
                the Free Spirit and many revolutionary gnostic sects that
                challenged the church’s hierarchical system were filled with
                artisans. Town revolts against ruling bishops, barons, and
                commercially minded patricians were initiated by well-
                informed, even well-read, artisans who could argue holy writ
                with disquieting acuteness. They often provided the ideological
                coherence for these uprisings that historians often impute to
                professional strata, not only mass support. This tradition did
                not die out with the Middle Ages. It continued for centuries,
                through the Reformation, which was by no means only a
                peasant war, through the era of the democratic revolutions,
                and into the Industrial Revolution, indeed for several
270 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                generations afterward.
                Skilled workers, particularly craftsmen, are remarkably self-
                contained individuals—the urban counterpart of the yeoman
                farmer who formed the basis for the democratic revolutionary
                era. Skill and a minimal competence, whether in the form of a
                personally owned shop or land holding, confers a sense of
                independence and self-esteem upon a person. It is out of these
                traits that the classical—and, to some extent, the modern—
                ideal of citizenship was fashioned. The lack of a respected skill
                and the absence of material independence makes for mobility
                in the pejorative sense of the term, notably, a wayward, fickle,
                and free-floating mob that is easily manipulated, no less by
                patrician demagogues than by dispossessed ones. Rebellion
                that lacks men and women with the moral substance produced
                by a sense of material independence and self-esteem—or, at
                least, a sense of hope that these attributes can be acquired by
                concerted action—tends to degenerate as easily into nihilistic
                counterrevolution as it does into constructive revolutionary
                behavior. The gap that emerged between the skilled popolo of
                Italian cities during the High Middle Ages and the more or less
                lumpenized proletariat was to last for centuries and disappear
                only when craftsmanship was dissolved by the factory system.
                European absolutism repeatedly came up against this human
                element in its endeavor to place its territorial realm under royal
                authority. That many artisans were in the service of the royal
                court as producers of luxury items does not tarnish the
                character of those who lived outside the orbit of absolutism
                and opposed it. These outsiders, in fact, were the great
                majority in Europe and generally serviced local and regional
271 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                markets. By contrast, the bankers, professionals, and
                merchants whose incomes were derived from loans to the
                upper classes, bureaucratic positions, and international trade
                —thej “big bourgeoisie,” as it were—were generally royalist
                and more irresolute than the artisans in their localist loyalties.
                Absolutism provided them not only with domestic security and
                a huge source of revenues; banker and merchant followed in
                the wake of royal armies, garnering the spoils acquired by
                conquest, the need for arms, and the opening of new markets.
                Where these strata were deeply entrenched in a municipal
                establishment, they tended to resist but rarely rebel against
                royal authority. Here they might act as an inertial force against
                nation building but seldom as a major obstacle. Hence they
                formed opportunistic alliances with rebellious artisans that,
                they readily betrayed when things threatened to get out of
                hand and demands for civic autonomy threw municipalities
                into violent and serious opposition with the centralized state.
                The “bourgeoisie” that is said to have given support to
                absolutism against the feudal lords consisted mainly of
                bankers and merchants and later, to some extent, of the new
                industrial bourgeoisie, Indeed, this “bourgeoisie” was strikingly
                conservative; it consistently supported some kind of royal
                power, whether absolutist in the sixteenth century or
                constitutional in the eighteenth. Republicanism and
                democratism (a very revolutionary concept until well into the
                nineteenth century) found its most steadfast recruits in
                artisans and, less reliably, the “mobility” people or rootless,
                statusless, and homeless “mob,” whom even the English
                Levellers viewed warily because of their dependence on the
272 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                largesse of the possessing classes.
                Our picture is further complicated by the aspirations of the
                territorial lords, who openly rose in rebellion time and again
                against the monarchy—and, of course, by the peasantry that
                never lived on comfortable terms with the royal power, the
                manorial estates, or the towns. The story of the conflict
                between the monarchy and nobility, a struggle that reached its
                violent zenith in the Fronde, which literally chased the young
                Louis XIV out of Paris, is the stuff out of which the conventional
                history of European absolutism is written. It does not require
                emphasis here. The peasant wars in England in the late
                fourteenth century and in Germany in the early sixteenth were
                really climactic events in a chronic conflict that went bn for
                centuries from the High Middle Ages to our own time. John Ball
                and Thomas Miinzer were the ancestors of a host of later
                agrarian leaders such as Emilian Pugachev in Russia and
                Emiliano Zapata in Mexico. All of them shared the central goal
                of preserving the village community, its insular lifeways, its
                networks of mutual aid, its common lands and communitarian
                economy.
                Nation building during the era of absolutism was unique
                precisely because it occurred within—and by the tensions it
                produced and fostered—a highly diversified and creative social
                arena for political development. The ancient world had been
                dominated by massive, generally immobile empires that
                suffocated social development with their parasitism and
                massive bureaucratic structures. Medieval Europe was an
                embryonic world—rich in promise, to be sure, but largely
                unformed, lacking in cohesion, indeed more particularistic than
273 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                decentralistic. Absolutism and the early era of nation building
                stood somewhere in between. As Perez Zagorin tells us: “In
                spite of the expansion of absolutism and its critical collisions
                with rebellious subjects, royal government never became
                uniform or monolithic, even in the kingdoms where it suffered
                least limitation. Confusions of jurisdictions and rivalries and
                conflicts among governmental institutions abounded under its
                rule. Its actual power was more like an intricate mosaic of
                particular prerogatives, rights, and powers than a
                homogeneous, all-inclusive authority. The attributes of
                sovereignty that were ascribed to absolute kings by royalist
                lawyers and political philosophers, such as the French thinker
                Jean Bodin, were more often than not greater in theory than
                the powers these same kings could dispose of in practice. The
                monarchies of our early modern states continued to be in
                many regards conservative and traditionalistic, as befitting
                regimes ruling hierarchic societies and of centuries-long
                growth from ancient origins. Absolutist kings did not quarrel
                with social privilege, of which their own position was the
                supreme manifestation. They quarreled only with the
                privileges that resisted their authorities or claimed immunity
                from their government [which, one is obliged to add, seems to
                mean that they opposed all social privilege but their own]. In
                building their more centralized states, they did not sweep the
                stage clean with a new broom and many older and outmoded
                political forms and institutions survived the reign of absolutism,
                like scenery left standing while a new play was
                performed.”{65}
                What Zagorin seems to reproach the absolutist monarchies for
274 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

                -namely their failure to “sweep the stage clean with a new
                broom” and achieve a more homogenized, efficient, and
                smoothly working social order—is what gave the era its
                incredibly mism and creativity. It was precisely the rich social
                features of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
                centunes-the extraordinary diversity of social life and its forms,
                the creative tension from whffih so much mobility in status,
                cultural, and intellectual fervor emerged—that makes the era
                so fascinating and provocative. The absolute monarchies,
                caught in a complex web of ancient priveleges and rights, thus
                became the reluctant conservators and the gnawing
                subversives of an accumulated wealth of old customs
                autonomous jurisdictions, traditional liberties, and hierarchical
                claims to authority.
                Within this immense warehouse of historical rights and duties,
                communities and individuals, institutions and interests could
                move with remarkable freedom and function with exciting
                fecundity often invoking past precedent to defend recent
                innovation in an old guise and play history against present to
                create amew future Marx was to reprove the French
                revolutionaries of 1848 for dressing their rhetoric, claims, and
                ideals in the slogans of the French revolutionaries of 1789–94,
                who in turn borrowed the language and postures of the Roman
                Republic to legitimate then own ideals. Yet it was precisely this
                rich sense of historicity and variety of forms, manners, and
                ideas-whose power and insightfulness we will explore in the
                closing chapter of this book-that gave such fecundity to both
                French revolutions and opened such sense of promise in
                Europe two centuries ago. What an individual “thinks of
275 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                himself”—not simply the hidden economic laws or some
                unknown “spirit” that ostensibly guides history—has a very
                profound effect on how he or she acts as a social being deeply
                influences the course of social development, Marx to the
                contrary notwithstanding. The richly variegated images that
                people had of their own time, their rights, and themselves
                profoundly taped much of the history of that time. Diversity
                made fo greater choice and a more fertile social landscape,
                however often precedent was invoked and reshaped to serve
                new ends. The tensions created by the alternate
                developmental pathways that emerged before communities,
                orders, classes, and, yes, individuals fostered a highly creative
                practice in the achievement of their ends.
                Nor is it true, as Marx tells us, that “No social order ever
                perishes before all the productive forces for which there is
                room in it have developed.”{66} I leave aside the fact that this
                dictum begs the very question it poses: we presuppose that
                the limits of a social order are defined by their “productive
                forces,” notably technology and the various ways of organizing
                labor, indeed that they constitute the essence of a “social
                order.” Actually, we have no way of knowing how far the
                “productive forces” could have developed in precapitalist
                society, nor do there seem to be any limits to the development
                of “productive forces” today, which means, by inference, that a
                market society will be with us forever.
                But what is most disquieting about Marx’s vision of social
                change is the extent to which it denies the power of
                speculative thought to envision a new society long before an
                old one becomes intolerable or is bereft of any room for

                development. Artisans and peasants in the era of nation
                building had many sound ideas about the kind of society they
                wished to create. It is a mechanistic arrogance of the most
                extreme kind to predetermine how far communities can go—
                whether forward, backward, or both, m their vision of the good
                society and the elements that compose it—and literally dictate
                the material or productive limits of their vision, its
                “preconditions,” its possibilities, and its place in a theory of
                history structured around various “stages” and
                presuppositions.
                We may say, returning to Zagorin’s description of absolutism,
                that it was not in spite of a monarch’s “brutal collision with
                rebellious spirits” but because of this collision that the nation
                builders of Bodin’s time failed to “sweep the stage clean with a
                new broom...” English, French, and Spanish monarchs, like
                their ancient counterparts who built huge empires, wanted
                very much to achieve “homogeneous and all-inclusive
                authority. They did not require the existence of local
                hierarchies to justify the development of a national hierarchy,
                nor did they need the challenges created by local privileges to
                justify their own claims to national privilege. To the extent that
                they tolerated local hierarchies and privileged strata, it was
                because they did not have the resources and the economic
                supports to replace them. Jean Bodin’s justification for the all-
                inclusive authority of every national government over the
                rights claimed by lesser, more local jurisdictions is evidence of
                a prevailing vision among the monarchies of his day that
                clashed with the reality of their situation and profoundly
                unsettled the real world. What European monarchs did “think”

                of themselves—namely, all-powerful rulers of highly
                centralized state’s—deeply affected the development of
                European history. Their centralists proclivities clearly
                influenced the thinking of men like Robespierre, France’s
                centralizer par excellence, who also struggled to overthrow
                royalism as such, using Rousseau-like principles of a
                democracy that “forces” men to be free. Herein lies one of the
                great ironies of the modern era: leaders of the popular
                opposition to absolutism were to function in many ways like
                the monarchs they professed to oppose and, ultimately, they
                were to turn against the very popular movements that brought
                them to power.
                It was the artisans and peasants—of the autonomous towns
                whose walls centralistic royalists such as Cardinal Richelieu
                were to demolish, not only self-governing and parochial feudal
                lords who were to rise in rebellions against the monarchies of
                Europe. I have already examined the resistance and alternative
                offered by the Comuneros and the German peasants as
                examples, together with others who typified the most
                important efforts to arrest centralism and statist forms of
                nation building. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, no
                less than the sixteenth, exploded in numerous albeit more
                localized conflicts of the kind that produced so much civil
                turmoil in the sixteenth. To catalogue these smaller but highly
                numerous revolts, particularly those that occurred in France,
                would be tedious. Their overall pattern, however, is described
                by Zagorin very ably:
                In every case, some new exorbitancy of royal finance, a tax on
                taverns, for instance, or the abolition of as exemption from
278 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                certain imposts, sparked the outbreak. Then the residential
                quarters of the poor erupted, mobs of three, five, and even ten
                thousand took to the streets, and the pursuit of the gabeleurs
                [tax collectors] became the order of the day. Riot and
                excitation, violence coupled with aspects of a popular festival
                and its drunken indulgence, dominated these outbreaks, as
                the lower orders dropped their workaday routine for the
                collective action that demonstrated their anger and made
                them feel their strength. The militant base was always the
                urban plebs: not made up entirely, perhaps, of what the
                president of the parlement of Bordeaux called “the lowest part
                of the people,” but com sisting of artisans, journeymen, day
                laborers, small shopkeepers, and sometimes womenfolk, too,
                who participated with their men! At, Bordeaux a boatman and
                a tavernkeeper, at Agen a master glover, a pack-saddle maker,
                and again a tavernkeeper, at Perigeau a physician, stood out
                as leaders and hafanguers of the crowd. Peasants swarmed in
                from the outskirts to unite briefly with the revolt, as happened
                in Bordeaux, At Agen, six thousand peasants who tried to enter
                were kept out by the bourgeois militia and burned the property
                of gabeleurs in the vicinity.{67}
                A more detailed account would include attacks upon the town
                hall, the release of jailed prisoners, the killing of tax collectors
                and finance officials, even of wealthy individuals who were
                suspected of being in collusion with the state. Without the
                leadership provided by artisans, small proprietors, occasionally
                professionals, and even members of the lesser nobility, it is
                unlikely that these uprisings would have gone very far.
                Apparently their extent depended upon “the passivity, neutral
279 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                or ambiguous behavior, and even partial support [of] the
                notables and well-to-do. The bourgeois militia of Bordeaux
                showed little will to act.. At Perigeux the bourgeois guard was
                similarly slack. Only at Agen, where the violence was
                particularly intense and accompanied by a definite social
                antagonism, did elites and authorities take concerted steps
                against the outbreak.”
                The limits of these insurrections, rural as well as urban, should
                be noted. Again, Zagorin comes to our aid:
                Taken as a whole, French urban rebellions were devoid of
                programs or ideas. In the same way as the concurrent agrarian
                revolts, they seemed to reflect a stasis in French society
                despite its exceptional amount of violence and
                insubordination, an inability by insurgent-forces to transcend
                the existing state of things with any informing vision of an
                alternative. Although again and again the centralist offensive
                led to resistance, the latter failed to give rise to demands for
                political changes.... Urban rebellion was essentially a defensive
                response by the whole community. To the plebeian populace,
                the punishment of gabeleurs was a deserved act of communal
                justice. If such people took the largest, most active part in
                these insurrections, that was because they were the most
                sensible of fiscal oppression. But elites usually shared
                responsibility in some measure. Their ‘own opposition to
                exactions helped to legitimize resistance, and they
                encouraged revolt, whether by actual instigation, covert
                approval and sympathy, or inaction, when disorder broke
                out.... But they were helpless to hold back the advance of
                absolutism and its centralizing grip because they had no
280 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                political reforms to propose and conceived of no new
                institutional limits on the power of the royal state. {68}
                Actually, Zagorin’s account of the way these chronic town
                insurrections unfolded—ultimately leading to the French
                Revolution itself a century or so later—fails to explore certain
                important details that help us understand the extent to which
                the uprisings actually did “hold the advance of absolutism and
                its centralizing grip” under control. The French monarchs such
                as Louis XIII and Louis XIV were strong kings who were guided
                by even stronger advisors such as the cardinals Richilieu and
                Mazarin, respectively. They created the strongest armies and
                created the most far-reaching bureaucracies in western Europe
                in their day. They were ruthless centralizers and patently
                hostile to their own nobility, often encouraging trade and
                playing the “bourgeois” classes against the noble classes who
                were as protective of their particularistic privileges as they
                were of their economic. Western Europe in the seventeenth
                and eighteenth centuries was a status-oriented world. It was
                made up more of “orders”—status groups who enriched
                themselves, developed extravagant patterns of conspicuous
                consumption, and spoke in a mannered language according to
                an elaborate body of etiquette—rather than of classes who
                simply and unadornedly pursued their material interests.
                Power and social recognition were no less important than
                wealth; in fact they were major sources of material wealth.
                Personal enrichment, in turn, was often pursued precisely to
                gain more power and greater social recognition. Consumption
                in all its dazzling forms thus assumed greater significance than
                production, even for the bourgeoisie, which tried to elbow its
281 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                way into the social hierarchies of the era. Mary Beard’s account
                of the merchant’s values in the Roman world holds as well in
                the era of absolutism as it does in the era of empire, a
                thousand years earlier. The trader, she observes, “had drained
                the wealth of the West for ‘bones and stones’ [gems and
                ornaments] from the East and thereby brought on currency
                troubles for which there was apparently no remedy.... Because
                he had yielded much to the landed gentleman’s ideal, he
                tended to draw fortunes away from the business to the land,
                taking wealth out of circulation and energy out of business
                enterprise. His children, growing up in the country, were often
                lost to business entirely.”{69}
                In western Europe, especially in “classical” France—the
                country that so many radical and liberal thinkers were to
                regard as the model for “pure” feudalism and the “bourgeois-
                democratic” revolution—this process of moving from the
                status of trader to that of nobleman was especially marked and
                adds considerable ambiguity to what we mean by the word
                “bourgeois.” Many “bourgeois” and noble interests coalesced.
                Both orders generally had a greater fear of the “mob” than of
                each other—and, in moments of crisis, of the monarchy. The
                two orders were united by bonds of marriage, land ownership,
                cultural tastes, values, and‘ a desire for status and the power,
                political as well as economic, that it conferred.
                The “bourgeois militia” of Bordeaux, Perigeaux, and Agen
                probably included many aspiring master craftsmen,
                merchants, and a good sprinkling of “industrialists” who were
                eager to acquire noble status—even if only “nobles of the robe”
                (nobles who had noble status conferred upon them for service
282 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                to the state or, quite crassly, for money) rather than “nobles of
                the sword” (hereditary nobility). They were more like medieval
                burghers, than capitalists in the present-day sense of the term.
                Indeed capitalism, conceived not simply as an economic
                system structured around commercial transactions or trade
                but, in its truly modern sense, as an accumulative system
                (what Marx called “expanding reproduction”) in which
                industrial expansion became an end in itself, was a feeble thing
                in western Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth
                centuries, more characteristically Dutch than either English or
                French. Hence, it would be of value to discriminate between
                the words “bourgeoisie” and “capitalists” rather than turn
                them into synonyms.
                By the same token, the “lowest part of the people,” whom the
                president of the Bordeaux Parlement designated as the
                principal activists in the urban rebellions of the 1630s, were not
                simply laborers, vagabonds, and beggars. In a status-oriented
                society, they could also be said to include master craftsmen,
                artisans, shopkeepers, and small-property owners. The fact
                that tavernkeepers, master glovers, pack-saddle makers, and.
                even a physician “stood out as leaders and haranguers of the
                crowd,” to use Zagorin’s words, tells us something about the
                “crowd” they led and harangued. That nobles, too,
                occasionally became such “leaders” tells us something about
                the transclass nature of such uprisings and the extent to which
                nearly all sectors of society could be united against the
                centralization of power by the monarchy. Most of the people
                hated men like Richelieu, Mazarin, and members of the king’s
                administrative bureaucracy, despite’their ritualistic
283 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                expressions of affection for the king. Such cries as “Long live
                the king without the gabelle!” meant that the king, ostensibly
                beloved for his symbolic status as a caring father, could earn
                popular loyalty only if he was shorn; of the all-important fiscal
                means for maintaining his commanding position in the country
                —a position that amounted to very little without the money for
                provisioning his army, paying his bureaucrats, and carrying on
                domestic wars against recalcitrant towns and nobles.
                Which raises Zagorin’s’ question of how much of a program
                French insurrectionaries actually needed if French society was
                indeed in a “stasis.” Zagorin’s use of the word stasis stands at
                odds with, his notion that the insurrectionaries were “helpless
                to hold back the advance of absolutism and its centralizing
                grip.” The “stasis” of the time consisted precisely of a lasting
                balance of forces between the central power and the regions,
                localities, orders, and classes of the time, not an ever-
                encroaching central power. Richilieu and Mazarin, working
                ruthlessly on behalf of their monarchs, tried to forge a
                completely centralized nation-state around the king and his
                bureaucracy. It is myth, in my view, to believe that any but the
                most naive of the absolutist Frerich kings trusted their nobles,
                although one French monarch, Louis XVI, tried to enlist his
                nobles in 1788 against an ever-demanding “Third Estate.”
                They betrayed him without scruples and, in the most self-
                seeking manner, brought about his downfall as well as their
                own.
                Thus Richelieu and Mazarin did not succeed, in fact. They
                carried centralization far in France, but not so far that it could
                prevent the French Revolution, which tried in its early phases to
284 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                reverse the power of the king and the aristocrats alike, initially
                driving toward a relatively decentralized, indeed minimal,
                state. If centralism is to be identified with the interests of the
                newly emerging capitalist economy insofar as the
                “bourgeoisie” seeks a politically unified country, the French
                Revolution was categorically not a “bourgeois revolution.” Nor
                did the French “bourgeoisie” want a “democracy” or even,
                necessarily, a republic. Indeed, it tried to model France on
                England’s constitutional monarchy. The supreme irony of the
                French Revolution is that a movement designed to curb
                privilege, hierarchy, and, above all, centralized power was
                twisted by liberal intellectuals, “forward-looking” lawyers, and
                marginal strata into the most centralized state in Europe in
                order to defeat its counterrevolutionary enemies. In some
                respects, the Jacobin Republic that followed the collapse of
                these hopes for a constitutional monarchy and a fairly
                decentralized political structure was marbled by feudal
                concepts of government, notably, the famous “maximum” that
                limited the rise of placed prices and wages, state intervention
                in many parts of the economy and society, and a moral posture
                that espoused “republican virtue” as a political calling. The
                Jacobin Republic, in effect, was a wartime state that Napoleon
                was to make fairly permanent. This quixotic turn of events
                etched itself, deeply into French national fife for nearly two
                centuries, and centralism became a focal issue around which
                popular movements were to rebel throughout the nineteenth
                century. The climax of this popular movement was reached in
                May 1871 when the Commune of Paris tried to establish a

                decentralistic notions of socialism in France itself.
                Robespierre and napoleon, more than Richilieu and Mazarin,
                were the true forgers of the nation-state in France, and it was
                they who provided the real “classical” example of centralized
                national authority in Europe.
                What role did the towns and cities play in abetting this
                development from the sixteenth century onward? Towns and
                cities responded, as we have seen, in very mixed ways to the
                emergence of a centralized authority that tried to absorb them.
                Some resisted that authority with very little internal division or
                difference of opinion. Others, particularly where the
                “bourgeoisie” and elite orders prevailed, favored a well-
                coordinated society in which trade could prosper. They thereby
                abetted the work of Richelieu, Mazarin, and Napoleon, both the
                original article and his nephew, Louis Bonaparte, in the 1850s
                and 1860s. But there is a sense in which all the towns of Europe
                unwittingly abetted the formation of nation-states, even as
                they opposed it for social, political, and cultural reasons. They
                did this by creating the arteries and veins, as it were, for
                national consolidation: the elaborate, indeed historically
                unprecedented, road systems and nodal market towns that
                fostered the monetization, commercialization, and
                industrialization of nations—and with these possibilities, the
                effective centralization of the state along national lines.
                I wish to advance the view that this was one of the most
                important achievements of Europe during the Middle Ages and
                well into recent times. So much emphasis has been placed by
                historians on Europe’s development of a market economy, its

                relative freedom of trade, and its openness to industrial
                innovation—features that are certainly uniquely European—
                that we fail to recognize how little they would have been able
                to affect the continent’s development without a network of
                roads, canals, and rivers to make such an economy possible.
                Apart from the trade that created market towns—towns where
                all goods were systematically exchanged—long-distance
                commerce was an elitist affair and served the well-to-do, not
                society at large. Local trade was necessarily very local because
                of the insular nature of most European communities. So, too,
                was political power. Rivers, canals, and maritime
                transportation served to link a fair percentage of Europe’s
                towns and villages together, but by no means the majority. A
                European “hinterland” existed almost everywhere on the
                continent, such that towns and villages were almost entirely
                self-sufficient in the staples of everyday life and culture
                remained highly insular. These “hinterlands” were largely
                beyond the reach of the nation-state and surprisingly
                impenetrable to commerce, monetization, and the “bourgeois”
                incubus that was to claim Europe for itself during the
                nineteenth century.
                We can begin to sense the importance of road systems in
                economic development and political control today (perhaps
                even more than during any other part of our century) because
                of the effectiveness of guerrilla warfare in the Third World. The
                very lack of “development” and the poor road systems that
                exist in Central America, mountainous portions of Asia, and the
                rain forests in southeast Asia have brought even nation-states
                aided by “superpowers” to their knees. All the “colonizers” of
287 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the past recognized the need for effective road systems. The
                Romans were able to hold their empire together precisely
                because it was networked by a highly elaborate system of
                roads that penetrated into the Iberian peninsula, Gaul, and
                portions of Britain and Germany as well as the hinterlands of
                the Mediterranean basin. Even quasi-tribal societies such as
                the Inca of Peru developed “empires” because roads—actually
                well-maintained pathways and footbridges—made central
                coordination possible. It matters little whether elaborate road
                networks emerged because “economic forces” created a need
                for them or because they made the emergence of such
                “economic forces” as a market economy possible. The two, in
                fact, may have interacted reciprocally with each other: road
                building stimulating commerce and commerce stimulating
                road building.
                Judging from Rome’s network, however, good roads in
                themselves did not necessarily foster a high volume of
                commerce, although they were indispensable for commercial
                advances. This great network of antiquity was not constructed
                primarily to transport merchandise. It was created mainly to
                move troops and imperial administrators to various parts of the
                empire. Even the transport of goods to supply the legionnaires
                was a secondary factor in road design and its routes. As R. S.
                Lopez tells us in his absorbing discussion of land transport,
                Roman troops were encouraged to live “as far as possible on
                the food produced in their immediate vicinity and the
                administrative centres were almost all situated either on the
                sea or on internal navigable waterways.”{70} This orientation
                is very “un-European”: it reflects the astonishing extent to
288 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                which a world oriented toward agrarian values dominated its
                merchants and morally denigrated their sources of income.
                Essentially, it was the “merchant, glutted, or rather contented
                with his profit, [who] retires from the port to become a landed
                proprietor,” Cicero tells us, “... [who] seems to me worthy of full
                praise,” not the “small-scale” trader, much less, artisan, “who
                should be of little account.”{71}
                Accordingly, Roman roads wore built almost defensively along
                mountain crests, very much like fortresses, rather than through
                populous valleys. Their seemingly indestructible large blocks of
                stone gave them a rigidity that increased their vulnerability to
                climatic changes, opening large surface cracks that, as Lopez
                tells us, “needed gangs of slaves, or continuous work by those
                obliged to furnish road-services to the state, and even so they
                were unsuitable for heavy or broad vehicles.”{72} The Roman
                road system, indeed ancient road networks generally, were not
                designed to expand local commerce beyond its regional
                confines or open trade routes to a continental exchange of
                ordinary staples. Long-distance trade of luxury goods and
                delicacies transported by sea or along rivers was favored over
                a mosaic of local and regional commercial transactions that
                brought ordinary goods and money into remote areas of the
                continent.[10]
                By contrast, Europe placed a high premium on the local artisan
                and merchant. At a time when so much emphasis is placed on
                the role of long-distance commerce in forming capitalism and
                the modern age, it is important to recognize how local
                producers and local markets slowly reworked the interior of the
                European continent, preparing it for a monetized economy and
289 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                providing the goods and markets for creating a market society.
                This slow but historic change in the economic culture of Europe
                —a slow but decisive change in attitudes toward trade,
                production for sale, and the use of money—was the work in
                large part of small towns, not only busy, glamorous ports.
                Little by little a new network of roads was put into effective
                operation, different totally in structure and methods from the
                ancient one and used by quite different types of transport and
                haulage. The changes in transport which accompanied the
                commercial revolution and the outburst of economic activity in
                this period can themselves be described as a slow revolution, If
                we consider them more closely, we find that they reveal the
                changed political and social face of Europe. For in medieval
                Europe there was no large and powerful state like the Roman
                Empire. Slavery disappeared and in many regions, of which
                Italy was the first, serfdom was abolished. Finally, the dignity of
                the, merchant and of trade won recognition, though with many
                reservations. Hence private initiative or local associations
                largely took the place of coercive government action. The
                routing of roads reflected the needs of commerce rather than
                the convenience of soldiers and civil servants. Maximum use
                was made of animal labour in transport, while human labour
                was safer as possible, economized.
                Lopez goes on to say that road construction “initiative came
                from autonomouslocal bodies or independent private
                companies. Plurality of roads, which is always possible when
                the dogma of the straight line is abandoned, enabled a great
                number of minor centres to be included in the network.”
                To say, Ferdinand Braudel reminds us, that “Napoleon moved
290 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                no faster than Julius Caesar” misses a number of very
                important points. Even if this statement were true, Napoleon
                had a greater variety of transportation choices than Caesar
                and climatic factors limited his strategic decisions far less than
                those of his Roman counterpart; so, too, for the European
                tradesman by comparison with the Roman. Even if we examine
                the regional network of roads created by this gradual
                transportation revolution, new possibilities and a sharper
                division of labor between the artisan and food cultivator—with
                its concomitant elaboration of skills, local inter action, use of
                money, and growing wants—all constituted the indispensable
                spadework for creating a sophisticated market economy.
                What is important is that it was the proliferation of
                craftspeople, of new wares and technics, of more craft
                organizations or gilds, and the intensive as well as extensive
                development of market interactions—generally intimate,
                humanly scaled, and ethical—that is most characteristic of the
                market economy that emerged in Europe. Let me emphasize
                that this rich patchwork of commercial relationships enhanced
                human interaction, unlike the capitalistic type of market
                economy that was to replace it centuries later. Even as it slowly
                advanced over the European continent, trade on a small, local
                scale between closely associated communities and individuals
                fostered cooperation rather than competition. It tended to
                deepen and extend local ties rather than sever them. It was
                more participatory than adversarial, more moral than
                predatory, and politically it provided the individual producer
                with a stronger material base for the exercise of citizenship.
                [11] Finally, it tended to dissolve barriers between local
291 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                communities and adjacent regions, opening the doors to new
                ideas, cultures, values, and the interchange of skills and
                technics. In time, the towns themselves acquired greater
                political and economic weight in the struggle to form nation-
                states. It may have entangled them in the crises of nation
                building, but it also turned them into centers of revolutionary
                social transformation, an advance signalled by the Comunero
                movement in Spain and the sectional movement in France.
                These markets and towns were not capitalistic. Marx has
                appropriately designated their economy as “simple commodity
                production” in which profit making and the plowing of surplus
                earnings back into capital expansion are largely nonexistent.
                Taken in this pure form, his account of their “mode of
                production” is more of a Weberian “ideal type” than an actual
                reality. Capitalism almost certainly did exist in European towns,
                even predominantly in some artisan ones, and even
                dominated many European cities, particularly port and riverine
                cities. But Europe also developed for centuries by elaborating
                its artisan-oriented towns rather than by significantly
                transforming them. Viewed as a whole, the continent from the
                fourteenth century onward until well into the eighteenth and
                early nineteenth centuries seemed to have a mixed economy,
                which was neither predominantly feudal, capitalist, nor
                structured entirely around simple commodity production.
                Rather, it contained and combined elements of all three forms.
                That one of these elements seemed to be of greater
                significance than another in some communities and areas does
                not alter the mixed nature of economic life as a whole.
                Contrary to the widely held belief that a capitalistic economy
292 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                emerged within the “womb” of feudalism and asserted itself as
                a “dominant” form with the attempt to build nation-states in
                the sixteenth century, it seems more accurate in my view to
                say that capitalism coexisted with feudal and simple
                commodity relationships. This long era, perhaps spanning
                more than five centuries, simply cannot be treated as
                “transitional” without reading back the present into the past
                and teleologically structuring European history around an
                Aristotelian “final cause” called “capitalism.”
                At various times and in various places, this mixed economy
                assumed a very balanced form—in some respects more stable
                in terms of everyday life than our own war-ridden century.
                Marxist and liberal historians have been vexed to give this long
                era a name that accords with the dogmatic “stages” theories
                of history that abound in Marx and Engels’s writings. Its
                existence seems to be an affront to the neat categories that
                even radical historians impose on the rich flux of social
                development. Conclusions that it was either “feudal” or
                “capitalist,” or what able writers like Paul Sweezy designate as
                “precapitalist commodity production” (a designation that tells
                us we know more about what it was not than what it really
                proved to be), often stand in flat contradiction to the data at
                our disposal.{73}
                A more open-minded reading of the data and the empirical
                evidence at our disposal on the era—one that extended well
                beyond the sixteenth-century period of nation building—will
                show, I submit, that western Europe existed within a force field
                in which feudal traditions interacted with simple commodity
                and capitalist forms of societal organization. Nor were
293 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                feudalism, capitalism, and simple commodity production
                socially rigid economic systems. They were evolving cultures,
                differing in values, sensibilities, ways of experiencing the world
                and organizing it artistically and intellectually, not simply
                “modes of production,” to use Marx’s terminology again. They
                constituted unique social ecologies, as it were, that were
                patterned in highly diverse ways throughout the continent.
                They also changed with the passage of time in varying degrees
                and with varying accent or emphasis on their components,
                often as a result of their interaction with each other.
                Space does not allow me to make a closer examination of this’
                seemingly “transitional era,” which in actuality forms a yery
                definable and long era of European history. That it fits none of
                the dogmatic interpretations advanced by many moderni
                historians who have an ideological ax to grind says more about
                academic trends in contemporary historiography than the
                richly varied texture of European life over the past thousand
                years: The “stasis” to which Zagorin alludes in his account of
                the state’s development seems also to have occurred in town
                development during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,
                possibly even later in many parts of Europe. Although greatly
                increased in number, European towns seem to have entered
                into a demographic slack period where urban populations
                ceased to grow and in some cases diminished. Trade, too,
                appears to have declined and the development of new towns
                generally came to an end.
                A number of historians have called this period the “crisis of
                feudalism,” a terminology that may very well express a
                typically modern identification of “progress” with expansion.
294 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                This bias tends to overlook qualitative growth and cultural
                elaboration for quantitative growth and cultural change.
                Apparently, “progress” is to be defined primarily as material
                growth, the increasing “domination of nature.” Cultural
                stability and the elaboration of cultural traits, by contrast, is
                often conceived as evidence of stagnation,” even of “crisis”
                and social regression. The received wisdom of historians to the
                contrary, is it not possible that Europe had paused during these
                centuries and begun to live with minimal changes in the “force
                field” of the era, perhaps even reaching a fairly stable balance
                between the three components of the mixed economy that
                began to develop centuries earlier? That violence, was
                endemic at that time, as it generally was before and afterward,
                does not alter the stability of everyday life, especially in the
                small towns that contained the majority of Europe’s urban
                population. This much is reasonably clear: by the seventeenth
                century, western Europe and its towns seem to haye reached a
                historic crossroads. The continent’s further “development,” a
                term that by no means denotes “progress” in any qualitative
                sense, was to depend less on the growth of a centralized state
                and on the expansion of commerce than on technology—on
                the development of machines and transportation techniques
                that were to rework all the traditional ties that had produced
                such an ecologically extraordinary cultural, political, civic, and
                economic diversity of social and urban forms.[12]
                The market society we call “capitalism”—a society that tends
                to reduce all, citizens to mere buyers and sellers and debases
                all the ecologically varied social relationships produced by
                history to the exchange of objects called “commodities”—did

                not “evolve” out of a feudal era. It literally exploded into being
                in Europe, particularly England, during the eighteenth and
                especially nineteenth centuries, although it existed in the
                ancient world, the Middle Ages, and with, growing significance
                in the mixed economy of the West from the fourteenth century
                up to the seventeenth. It is still spreading around the world—
                intensively in, its traditional Euro-American center and
                extensively in the non-European world; Its forms have varied
                from the largely mercantile (its earliest kind) through the
                industrial (its more recent eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                forms) to the statist, corporate, and multinational forms of our
                own time. It has slowly penetrated from its special spheres,
                such as market arenas of exchange and the production of
                commodities in cottages and later in factories, into domestic
                life itself, such as the family and neighborhood. This is a fairly
                recent “advance” that can be dated most strikingly from the
                midpoint of the twentieth century. Its invasion of the
                neighborhood, indeed of villages and small towns into the
                recesses of the domestic or familial relationships, has
                subverted the social bond itself and threatens to totally
                undermine any sense of community and ecological balance
                and diversity in social life.
                Moreover, the newly gained dominance of the capitalistic
                market relationship over all other forms of production and
                consociation is a major source of what I have denoted as
                “urbanization”—the explosion of the city itself into vast urban
                agglomerations that threaten the very integrity of city life and
                citizenship. What makes the market society we call
                “capitalism” unique, even by contrast to its early mercantile

                form, is that it is an ever-expansive, accumulative, and, in this
                respect, a cancerous economic system whose “law of life” is to
                “grow or die.” Capitalism in its characteristically modern and
                “dominant” form threatens not only to undermine every
                “natural economy” (to use Marx’s own terms), be it small-scale
                agriculture, artisanship, simple exchange relationships, and
                the like; it threatens to undermine every dimension of “organic
                society,” be it the kinship tie, communitarian forms of
                association, systems of self-governance, and localist
                allegiances—the sense of home and place. Owing to its
                metastatic invasion of every aspect of life by means of
                monetization and what Immanuel Wallerstein calls
                “commodification,” it threatens the integrity of the natural
                world—soil, flora, fauna, and the complex ecocommunities that
                have made present-day life forms and relationships possible by
                turning everything “natural” into an inorganic, essentially
                synthetic form.{74} Soil is being turned into sand, variegated
                landscapes into level and simplified ones, complex
                relationships into more primal forms such that the evolutionary
                clock is being turned back to a biotically earlier time when life
                was less varied in form and its range more limited in scope.
                The effect of capitalism on the city has been nothing less than
                catastrophic. The commonly used term “urban cancer” can be
                taken literally to designate the extent to which the traditional
                urbs of the ancient world have been dissolved into a primal,
                ever-spreading, and destructive form that threatens to devour
                city and countryside alike. Growth in the special form that
                singles out modern capitalism from all earlier forms of
                economic fife, including earlier forms of capitalism itself, has

                affected what we still persist in calling the “city” by leading to
                the expansion of pavements, streets, houses, and industrial,
                commercial, and retail structures over the entire landscape just
                as a cancer spreads over the body and invades its deepest
                recesses.
                Cities, in turn, have begun to lose their form as distinctive
                cultural and physical entities, as humanly scaled and
                manageable political entities. Their functions have changed
                from ethical arenas with a uniquely humane, civilized form of
                consociation, free of all blood ties and family loyalties, into
                immense, overbearing, and anonymous marketplaces. They
                are becoming centers primarily of mass production and mass
                consumption, including culture as well as physically tangible
                objects. Indeed, culture has become objectified into
                commodities as have human relationships, which are
                increasingly being simplified and mediated by objects. The
                simplification of social life and the biosphere by a growth-
                oriented economy in which production and consumption
                become ends in themselves is yielding the simplification of the
                human psyche itself. The strong sense of individuation that
                marked the people of the mixed society preceding capitalism is
                giving way to a receptive consumer and taxpayer, a passive
                observer of fife rather than an active participant in it, lacking in
                economic roots that support self-assertiveness and community
                roots that foster participation in social life. Citizenship itself,
                conceived as a function of character formation, and politics, as
                part of paideia or the education of a social being, tend to wane
                into personal indifference to social problems. The decline of the
                citizen, more properly his or her dissolution into a being lost in
298 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                a mass society—the human counterpart of the mass-produced
                object—is furthered by a burgeoning of structural gigantism
                that replaces human scale and by a growing bureaucracy that
                replaces all the organic sinews that held precapitalist society
                together. The counselor is the humanistic counterpart of the
                indifferent bureaucrat and the counseling chamber is the
                structural counterpart of the governmental office.
                Let it be said that this debasement of the ecological complexity
                of the city, of its politics, citizens, even of the individuals who
                people its streets and structures, is of very recent origin. It did
                not really begin in a manorial society, with its barons and serfs,
                food cultivators and artisans, and all the “orders” we denote as
                feudal. Nor did it follow from those grossly misnamed
                revolutions, the “bourgeois-democratic” ones of England,
                America, and France, that ostensibly catapulted capital into
                political control of a society it presumably “controlled”
                economically during earlier generations. Rather, this
                development began to appear with technical innovations that
                made possible both the mass manufacture of cheap
                commodities and, that is crucially important, their increasingly
                rapid transportation into the, deepest recesses of western
                Europe, inexpensive and highly competitive with the products
                of local artisans who serviced their localities for centuries. It
                need hardly be emphasized that this development depended
                enormously for its success on the opening of colonial markets
                abroad: the Americas, Africa, and particularly Asia, the area
                where the English crown found its richest jewel, notably India.
                It was the extraordinary combination of technical advances
                \yith the existence of a highly variegated society, relatively free

                of the cultural constraints to trade that prevailed in antiquity,
                that gave economic ascendancy to the capitalistic component
                of the mixed economy over all its other components. Neither
                wealth from the Americans nor the large monetary resources
                accumulated by port cities from long-distance trade fully
                explains the rise of,industrial capitalism—a form of capitalism
                that more than any other penetrated into the very inner life of
                Europe.[13] Had the wealth acquired from the “New World”
                been a decisive factor in creating industrial capitalism, Spain
                rather than England should have become its center, for it was
                Spanish cqnquistadores who initially plundered the Aztec and
                Inca empires and brought their precious metals to Europe. The
                very wealth these “empires” provided for the ascendant
                nation-state in Spain served to weaken town life in the Iberian
                peninsula and provide the means for absolute monarchs to
                embark on an archaic program of continental empire building
                that eventually ruined Spanish cities and the countryside alike.
                Nor did long-distance trade provide the most important
                sources for capitalizing industrial development. Rather it
                fostered consumption more than production, the dissolute
                lifeway that makes for a diet of luxuries instead of the
                parsimonious habits that steer investment into new means of
                production. Indeed, too much state centralization and too
                much commerce, despite the wealth they initially generated,
                ultimately led to excessive expenditures for territorial
                expansion and high living by elite groups in all the orders of a
                courtly society. That nation-building, increased ceritralization,
                or, more properly, national consolidation prepared the way for
                industrial capitalism by opening more “hinterlands” to trade is

                patently clear. So, too, did increases in the population of
                dispossessed, propertyless hands, whether as a result of land
                enclosures or normal demographic growth, hands that were
                available for a factory system that had yet to appear on the
                economic horizon. Europe, in effect, was more open than any
                part of the world to the expansion of its Capitalist’component
                along industrial lines. This was especially true of England, a
                country in which a remarkable balance had emerged between
                a particularly bourgeois-minded aristocracy and monarchy on
                the one hand and a very open economy on the other, peopled
                by a tight-fisted, god-fearing Puritan yeomanry and structured
                around towns with decaying gild systems and cottagers in the
                countryside who were already engaged in a domestic form of
                textile mass production. Whether the new industrial capitalists
                who were destined to totally reshape the country emerged
                from the merchants involved in the sale of raw wool to cottage
                weavers and its sale in the towns, or whether it came from
                well-to-do artisans, yeomen, artistocrats who used sheep to
                create a new form of pastoral agribusiness, or merchants who
                were inclined to siphon their wealth into production—possibly
                even all of them combined at one time or another—need not
                concern us here. What pushed the capitalist component of this
                mixed economy into a nation that could regard itself as the
                “workshop of the world” in the, nineteenth century was a
                series of inventions that made the factory system and the
                distribution of its wares possible.
                Nor need we be concerned with whether the needs of a “rising
                bourgeoisie” produced the Industrial Revolution or the
                Industrial Revolution gave rise to the “bourgeoisie,” which in
301 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                any case was always a presence in all the major cities of
                Europe. Factories, in fact, had begun to appear in eighteenth-
                and even seventeenth-century England long before an
                industrial technology had emerged. Wherever the
                “bourgeoisie” entered into the productive sphere rather than
                the commercial, it tried to bring labor together and rationalize
                output even with tools, hence a strictly technological
                interpretation of the rise of industrial capitalism would be
                greatly misleading. My concern here is how industrial
                capitalism managed to gain ascendancy over other forms of
                production, including commercial capitalism, and alter all
                social relationships that encountered its power. Waterwheels
                had preceded the steam engine as a prime mover, and
                worksheds organized around simple tools had preceded
                mechanized factories. But without the inventions that
                introduced the Industrial Revolution in the late eighteenth and
                early nineteenth centuries, it is doubtful that industrial
                capitalism could have impacted so powerfully on Europe and
                ultimately on the entire world.
                England, perhaps more so than other countries in the western
                European orbit, seems to have been an ideal terrain for
                technological innovation. Its society was highly mobile socially
                and extremely fluid territorially. The few remaining feudal
                inhibitions to change of its various elites, aristocratic as well as
                commercial, had already been shattered by the civil war of the
                Cromwell period, a conflict that brought armed Puritans to
                power and added a strongly plebeian character to the
                country’s system of government. Even the English aristocracy
                had been readied for a gainful capitalistic economy by the
302 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                wealth it acquired from the sale of wool. We shall have
                occasion to note that landed squires and industrial capitalists
                were not without serious differences over the distribution of
                manpower in the country’s economy, nor did the rural patronal
                system disappear completely. But it can be said that England,
                more than any other European country at the time, had begun
                to acclimate itself to industrialization owing to the relative
                weakness of absolutism, which might have drained the
                nation’s wealth to fulfill imperial ambitions and the growth of a
                money-minded yeomanry and a highly avaricious merchant
                class.
                One must consult Max Weber’s The Protestant Ethic and the
                Spirit of Capitalism to understand how much gain became a
                quasireligious “calling” among England’s merchants and its
                well-to-do yeomanry and artisans; how much they were
                readied psychologically for the plundering of their own
                communities and country. The Spanish conquistadores had
                ruthlessly sacked the
                Indian “empires” of the Aztecs and Inca in order to enrich
                themselves, not to “save” their “souls.” They were maniacally
                involved in acts of destruction that often verged on self-
                destruction with only indirect effects upon the texture of
                Spanish society. The English Puritans, by contrast, dourly
                plundered their own country in a systematic and lasting
                manner to accumulate capital. Their behavior seemed to be
                guided by a moral imperative that made greed an end in itself,
                an imperative that was to transform the lifeways of the
                precapitalist society from which they had derived. Long after
                Puritanism had passed away as a movement, English society
303 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                had become secularized. The joyless spirit that the Puritans
                brought to England then lived on, largely bereft of the few
                moral constraints that religion generally imposed on the
                acquisitive spirit engendered by the Reformation.
                Within a span of some two generations, England was
                transformed on a scale unprecedented in the history of
                western Europe. Frederick Engels’s The Condition of the
                Working-Class in England, a period piece based on personal
                observations in 1844, could justly call the changes introduced
                by the new industrial inventions—principally in textiles,
                metallurgy, and transportation—a historic change of
                unpredented proportions. The rapidity of the transformation is
                what makes these changes so startling in a domain of human
                endeavor—technology—which had developed over centuries
                at a slow, piecemeal pace. The social and cultural ramifications
                of this technological revolution were nothing less than
                monumental. “Sixty, eighty years ago, England was a country
                like every other,” Engels tells us, “with small towns, few and
                simple industries, and a thin but proportionately large
                agricultural population. Today {1844} it is a country like no
                other, with a capital of two and a half million inhabitants; with
                vast manufacturing cities; with an industry that supplies the
                world, and produces almost everything by means of the most
                complex machinery; with an industrious, intelligent, dense
                population, of which two thirds are employed in trade and
                commerce, and composed of classes wholly different, forming,
                in fact, with other customs and other needs, a different nation
                from the England of those days.”{75}
                Engels’s words are meant as much to praise the

                “revolutionary” work of the English industrial capitalist as they
                are intended to startle the German readers, who first
                encountered his book. The Enlightenment’s uncritical
                commitment to technical progress completely infects the
                author’s generalizations, however much he is bitterly critical
                of, the misery inflicted by,industrial capitalism on the new
                proletariat. Accordingly, we learn that the preexisting cottage
                weavers, who were to be devastated economically and
                culturally by the new textile machines invented around the
                middle of the eighteenth century, “vegetated throughout a
                passably comfortable existence, leading a righteous arid
                peaceful life in all piety and probity; and their material position
                was far better than that of their successors. They did not have
                to overwork; they did no more than they chose to do, and yet
                earned what they needed: They had leizure for healthful work
                in garden or field, work which, in itself, was recreation for them,
                and they could take part besides in the recreations and games
                of their neighbours, and all games—bowling, cricket, football,
                etc., contributed to their physical health and vigour. They were,
                for the most part, strong, well-built people, in whose physique
                little or no difference than that,of their peasant neighbours was
                discernable. Their children grew up in the fresh country air,
                and, if they could help their parents at work, it was only
                occasionally; while of eight or twelve hours work for them
                [introduced, later, by the factory system] there was no
                question.”{76}
                The mixed messages in this passage reflect the characteristic
                tension created among the “progressives” of the era between
                the, claims of an abstract sense of “history” and an existential

                sense of humanity that was to rend apart major socialists such
                as Engels and ultimately, owing to his commitment to
                industrial progress as a “precondition” for a free society, justify
                the most horrible barbarities of a Stalin as the “modernizer’ of
                Russia, The unquestioning humility” of the English cottage
                weavers and yeomen, “their silent vegetation ... which, cosily
                romantic as it was, was nevertheless not worthy of human
                beings,” to use Engels’ pejorative remarks, is doubtful on its
                own terms, particularly from the standpoint of our own time
                when the ebullient concept of ‘ progress” that prevailed over
                the past two centuries is so much in doubt.[14]{77} But placed
                in a broader historical context, it is hard to square this
                denigration of the cottage weavers and lesser yeomanry with
                their vigorous role in the English Civil War of the 1640s and
                their resistance to the introduction of machinery—indeed, the
                role they played in the’ Chartist movement, the most radical
                cause, culturally as well as economically, that England has
                seen since the Puritan revolution.
                The explosive nature of the Industrial Revolution and the
                emergence of industrial capitalism can best be understood by
                rioting the limited time span in which the new technology
                surfaced and swept over England—a period so brief that it is
                almost difficult to call it an “era,” as so many historians do.
                James Watt’s steam engine, which freed the factory system
                from its reliance on waterpower, was invented by 1769; James
                Hargreaves’ spinning jenny, which enormously increased the
                output of yarn, by 1764; Richard Arkwright’s throstle, a
                sophistication of the spinning machine calculated for the use of
                a mechanical prime mover, by 1767; Samuel Crompton’s
306 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                mule, by 1785, followed around the same time by Arkwright’s
                carding machine and preparatory frames; finally, Edmund
                Cartwright’s workable power loom by 1785. All of these
                inventions totally revolutionized the production of textiles as it
                had been pursued for thousands of years and catapulted
                English cottons, woolens, linens, even lace and silken goods
                (as a result of another group of machines invented in the first
                decade of the nineteenth century) into a largely agrarian
                domestic and world market. The opening of extensive
                coalfields and iron mines, owing in large part to the use of coke,
                and the staggering enlargement of smelting furnaces on a
                scale fifty times bigger than earlier, more customary sizes
                paved the way for transportation changes that were to open
                the most remote areas of the country to industrialization and
                “commodification.”
                The men who invented the textile machines and prime movers
                that powered them were plebeians and, by no means
                accidentally within the context of modern English history,
                included a sprinkling of very pious individuals, even clergymen.
                Watt was an instrument maker; Hargreaves, an engineer;
                Arkwright, a barber; and relegate the past, with all its humane
                as well as barbarous traditions, to a historical “junk heap.”
                Eventually socialism, like Puritanism, was to be deprived of all
                its ethical content and turned into a doctrine very much like the
                egoistic political economy of the industrial bourgeoisie itself.
                Crompton, an ordinary textile worker; and Cartwright, a
                minister, who went on to work with Robert Fulton in the
                development of the steamship. English society had opened
                itself, more than most European societies, to advancement by
307 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                individuals in the “lower classes/’ Moreover, many of the
                inventors whose work introduced the Industrial Age were to
                become major capitalists in their right. Only a few exhibited the
                breadth of spirit that characterized Robert Owen, a textile
                manufacturer who demonstrated at New Lanark that relatively
                humane conditions for workers did not conflict with the
                acquisition of high profits and later placed his life and his
                fortune in the service of the rising labor movement.
                The transportation revolution that paralleled the Industrial
                Revolution is of monumental proportions in the development of
                modern capitalism itself, a revolution that a century and a half
                later was to turn into a “communications revolution” whose
                effects have yet to be fully grasped. During the first forty years
                of the nineteenth century, Scotland, much of which had been
                an untamed “hinterland” only two generations earlier, was
                interlaced by nearly a thousand miles of good roads and an
                even larger number of bridges. This was largely “the work of
                private enterprise,” Engels tells us, “the State having done
                very little in this direction.”{78} Indeed by 1844 England,
                apart from Scotland, had well over two thousand miles of
                canals, substantially in excess of its navigable river mileage.
                Finally, the early railroad fines that finked Manchester to
                Liverpool, were rapidly extended across the entire industrial
                midlands, sweeping in Lancester, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle,
                and, of course, London further to the south.
                English industrial and commercial towns, too, exploded in sifee
                and population. Within the first thirty or forty years of the
                nineteenth century, Birmingham increased its inhabitants from
                73,000 to 200,000; Sheffield from 46,000 to 110,000; Halifax
308 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                from 63,000 to 110,000; Leeds from 53,000 to 123,000. Such
                astonishing rates of growth among comparatively small
                communities in so short a time had never been seen before in
                European history. The congestion and diseases they produced
                have been fully chronicled in the novels as well as the histories
                of the period. For the first time, apart from a few cosmopolitan
                centers in antiquity and perhaps some Flemish and Italian
                towns in medieval times, we begin to see the authentic
                devouring of cities, not only the countryside, by urbanization.
                Birmingham, Sheffield, Halifax, and Leeds, among many others
                in England, were beginning to lose their identity as cities in any
                classical meaning of the term. Their factories, sprawling out
                into the countryside, were phasing into urban agglomerations,
                sweeping in villages and small towns that had existed with
                relatively little change for centuries. William Wylde’s
                panoramic painting of Manchester in 1851 reveals a forest of
                smokestacks and a dense collection of squalid dwellings, a
                new, formless, and repellent urban world that industrial capital
                began to introduce into the world—first in England, then in
                France, Belgium, Germany, and, of course, across the Atlantic
                where the grimmest images of Pittsburgh as a steel-making
                center seem interchangeable with Wylde’s picture of
                Manchester as a textile center generations earlier.
                Yet, what is very important about this period of rampant
                industrialization is the fact that the more commercial and
                administrative cities of England and even the industrial towns
                that blighted the island’s landscape were to develop a
                communal character of their own. Growing industry,
                commerce, and “commodification” did not seep completely

                into the neighborhood fife of the new cities, nor did it totally
                destroy the conditions for the regeneration of domestic fife.
                The buffeting that towns and cities of the nineteenth century
                took from industrialization, however disastrous its initial effects
                on traditional fife ways, did not destroy the inherently
                villagelike subcultures of workers and middle-class people who
                were only a generation or two removed from a more rural
                culture. Like the ethnic groups that entered the New World
                through New York City throughout much of the nineteenth and
                early twentieth centuries, displacement was followed by
                resettlement and recommunafization, even in the most
                desperately poor slums of the overpopulated cities of Europe
                and America. The pub in the industrial cities of England, the
                cafe in France, and the beer hall in Germany, no less than the
                various community centers around which the ethnic ghettos
                formed in New York and other American cities, provided foci for
                a distinctly working-class culture, largely artisan in its outlook,
                class-oriented in its politics, and knitted together by mutual
                self-help groups.
                This recolonization of community life was greatly abetted by
                the organized labor movement in all its different forms.
                Socialist clubs, trade-union centers, local cooperatives, mutual-
                aid societies, and educational groups created a public space
                that included classes in reading, writing, literature, and history.
                The socialist clubs and union centers provided libraries,
                periodicals, lectures, and discussion groups to “elevate”
                worker consciousness as well as mobilize them for political and
                economic ends. Picnics, athletic activities, outdoor forays into
                the countryside served to add a very intimate dimension to
310 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                purely educational projects. The casas del pueblo established
                by Spanish socialists and the centros obreros established by
                the Spanish anarchists, which existed up to the late 1930s, are
                reminders of the vigorous development of community life even
                in the most depressed areas of Europe—indeed, of an
                “underground” culture that always paralleled the received
                culture of the elite orders and classes.
                There was always a plebeian cultural domain at the base of
                society, even in the most dismal and squalid parts of ancient,
                medieval, or modern cities, that was beyond the reach of the
                conventional culture and the state apparatus. No economy or
                state had the technical means, until very recently, to freely
                infiltrate this domain and dissolve it for a lasting period of time.
                Left to itself, the “underground” world of the oppressed
                remained a breeding ground for rebels and conspirators
                against the prevailing authority. No less urban in character
                than agrarian, it also remained a school for a grass-roots
                politics that, by definition, involved groups of ordinary people,
                even in sizable communities, in a plebeian political sphere and
                often brought them into outright rebellion. This “underground”
                school created new political forms and new citizens to deal
                with changing social conditions. Even after the great
                boulevards of Baron Haussmanri ripped into the plebeian
                quartiers of Paris, opening the city to artillery fire and cavalry
                charges against barricades, the sizable neighborhood pockets
                left behind retained an imperturbable rebellious vitality that
                finally culminated in the Paris Commune. Few of Europe’s
                major cities were spared crowd actions and uprisings in the
                nineteenth century, indeed well into the first half of the

                twentieth. As industrial capitalism spread out from England
                into western Europe and America, the initial destabilization it
                produced as a result of urbanization and mechanization was
                followed by a regeneration of popular culture along new
                patterns that also included the integration of old ones. Just as
                the French village was reproduced as quartiers in French cities
                and the Spanish pueblo as barrios in Spanish cities, so the
                Jewish shtetl, the “Little Italys,” and “Little Irelands” were
                reproduced in altered form but with much Of their cultural
                flavor, personal intimacies, and traditional values in world
                cities such as New York. Even the industrial cities replicated on
                a local basis the specific cultural origins of their variegated
                populations and regions.
                The elaboration of the Industrial Revolution into a textile
                economy in England, a luxury goods economy in France, an
                electrochemical economy in Germany (itself a second
                industrial revolution in the last half of the nineteenth century),
                and an automotive economy in America did not eliminate this
                “underground” communal world. Which is not to say that any
                of the countries cited above did not also, expand economically
                and technologically into the key industries that distinguished
                each from the other. But the textile manufacturing that
                catapulted England into the world market and even helped to
                make it; the fashioning of luxury goods that gaye France,
                especially Paris, its distinction as the artistic center of the
                world; and the mass production of electrochemical
                commodities and automobiles by Germany and the United
                States, respectively, which finally began to transform the world
                into its present form—all seemed to carry over into the popular
312 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                culture and give it specific national features. We find a fixidity
                in England along industrial lines that appears in its
                conventional and underground cultures as well: a strong
                system’of orders, open enough to add titles to the names of its
                gifted plebeians but consciously hierarchical in its cultural and
                social structure with a tendency to. retain social status and
                elaborate it along stable lines. The intellectuality of France,
                expressed by its esthetic emphasis in industrial production,
                carried over into the popular culture as a discursive politics
                that nourished an ideologically innovative working class,
                largely ar tisanal in its outlook but with all the intellectuality of
                that stratum. Germany, which seems to have straddled the
                hierarchical culture of England and the intellectual culture of
                France, gave rise to a philosophically inclined popular Culture
                that took pride in its academic spokesmen as surely as English
                workers were endeared to noblemen who often spoke on their
                behalf. The pragmatism and dynamism of American culture,
                with its strong republican values, carried into the popular
                culture as various images of the “American Dream,” partly
                utopian, partly materialistic, in which the automobile
                symbolized enhanced sexuality together with freedom of
                movement, both socially upward and territorially outward. This
                symbolism was to shape American architecture and city

                Yet every class culture was always a community culture,

                cultures of the past. This continuity has been largely
                overlooked by contemporary socialists and sociologists. While
                the factory and mill formed the first fine of the class struggle in
                the last century, a struggle that in no way should be confused
                with the class war that is supposed to yield working-class
                insurrections, its fines of supply reached back into the
                neighborhood and towns where workers lived and often
                mingled with middle-class people, farmers, and intellectuals.
                Wage earners had human faces, not merely mystified
                proletarian faces, and functioned no less as human beings than
                class beings. Accordingly, they were fathers and mothers,
                brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, citizens and
                neighbors, not only “factory hands.” Their concerns included
                issues such as war and peace, environmental dislocation,
                educational opportunities, the beauty of their surroundings as
                well as its ugliness, and in times of international conflict, a
                heavy dose of jingoism and nationalism—indeed a vast host of
                problems and concerns that were broadly human, not only
                class-oriented and rooted in wages and working conditions.
                This communal dimension of the industrial era is of
                tremendous importance in understanding how class conflicts
                often spilled over beyond economic issues into broadly social,
                even utopian, concerns. Indeed as long as the market did not
                dissolve the communal dimension of industrialism, there was a
                richly fecund, highly diversified, cooperative, and innovative
                domain of social and political fife to which the proletariat could
                retreat after working hours, a domain that retained a vital
                continuity with precapitalist fife-ways and values. This partly
                municipal, partly domestic domain formed a strong

                countervailing force to the impact of an industrial
                economy and the nation-state. Here, workers mingled with a
                great variety of individuals, particularly artisans, intellectuals,
                and farmers who brought their produce into the towns. In a
                purely human fashion that revealed all the facets of their
                personalities, they developed a sense of shared, active
                citizenship. This communal or municipal citizenship kept
                political fife alive even in highly centralized and bureaucratized
                nation-states. It would be difficult to understand not only the
                radical uprisings of the nineteenth century but also the
                twentieth—particularly the series of urban and agrarian
                uprisings that culminated in the Spanish Civil War—without
                keeping this communal dimension of the “class struggle”
                clearly in mind. Every class movement from the late
                eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries was also a civic
                movement, a product of neighborhood, town, and village
                consociation, not only the factory, farm, and office. It was not
                until a technology developed that could make deep, perhaps
                decisive, inroads into this “underground” municipal domain
                that politics and citizenship were faced with the total
                “commodification” of society, the supremacy of statecraft, and
                the subversion of the city’s ecological diversity and creativity.
                The older generation of our time is still too close to the present
                and the younger too far from the past to realize the extent to
                which communal, precapitalist cultural traditions permeated
                the first half of the twentieth century. Nor do we fully realize
                how rapidly these traditions are being simplified and the extent
                to which they are disappearing in the second half of the
                century, largely as a result of sweeping technological and
315 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                cultural developments that occurred during the Second World
                War and its aftermath. Science systematically applied to
                technics has only recently revealed the deepest secrets of
                matter and fife with nucleonics and bioengineering. We are just
                making contact with the possibilities opened by cybernetics,
                space travel, and communications systems for public
                surveillance, not to speak of mass “mind bending” with
                techniques that will make conventional advertising methods
                seem childish and means of detection that will make
                fingerprints seem primitive.
                The psychological implications of these chilling advances are
                as significant as their cultural and institutional ones. The
                military armamentorium they have produced is as
                disempowering to the individual as it is frightening to the
                public. The result is that the ego itself tends to become
                passive, disembodied, and introverted in the face of a
                technological and bureaucratic gigantism unprecedented,
                indeed unimaginable, in earlier human history. Public life,
                already buffeted by techniques for engineering public consent,
                tends to dissolve into private life, a form of mere survivalism
                that can easily take highly sinister forms. Citizenship, in turn,
                tends to retreat into an increasingly trivialized egoism in which
                banal conversation and venal pursuits replace searching
                discourse and rebellious demands. Even more than ordinary
                individuals, the people of mind and art who formed for ages the
                troubled conscience of past societies and were deeply
                engaged in public life as the principal catalysts for achieving
                the good society—in short, those socially involved thinkers
                whom the Russians of the last century called the intelligentsia

                —retreat into the confines of the academy and are transformed
                into mere intellectuals. Research tends to replace creative
                speculation; libraries tend to replace the cafes that nourished a
                Diderot; classrooms replace the squares that brought a
                Desmoulins to the surface of public life; the academic
                conference and its journals replace the clubs and presses that
                provided the public forum for a Thomas Paine.
                Industrial capitalism in the nineteenth century treated a
                market economy in which production and exchange still
                formed a layer;of social life, not a substitute for society. The
                “cash nexus” that Marx and Engels regarded as the core of the
                new economy in The Communist Manifesto—culturally as well
                as commercially—was evidence more of their foresight than a
                description of the f actual conditions of their times. Important
                barriers stood between the penetration of the “cash nexus”
                created by the factory and by commerce into the community
                and domestic life, where the oppressed in all their different
                forms and even the agrarian squirearchy seethed with hatred
                of the new economy. The Speenhamland Law, which English
                country squires passed in the 1790s to provide the material
                means for keeping the rural population out of the emerging
                factory system, reveals the stronghold precapitalist patronal
                traditions had on a society in the very midst of the Industrial
                Revolution.
                What is Unique about the post-World War II era, now unfolding
                four decades after tbe war’s end, is that the market economy
                to which industrial capitalism gave a firm and dominant
                productive base is turning into a market society. The “cash
                nexus” has become an all-embracing commodity nexus in
317 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                which consumption, not only production, has become an end in
                itself. Objects now mediate nearly all the social relationships
                that once had a living and creative flesh-and-blood character.
                Popular culture, which meant the disdained culture produced
                from below by the people, has now become “pop culture,” the
                synthetic “culture” generated from above by the mass
                manufacture of books, sounds, pictures, movies, radio shows,
                and, above all, television “goodies”—from news to situation
                comedies, soap operas, and even serialized novels that
                transfix millions of viewers to their “tubes.” Human
                relationships are increasingly defined in terms of material
                things and expressed in a commercial vernacular—be it
                marriage as an “investment,” child rearing as a “job,” life as a
                “balance sheet,” ideals as things one “buys,” and community
                as a “business.” The notion that towns and cities should be
                “managed” by “entrepreneurs” as though the civic bond has
                no dimensions to it other than its “efficiency” in coordinating
                “services” and its capacity for generating “revenues”
                permeates the language not only of bankers, merchants,
                politicians, and retailers but even liberal and—most tellingly—
                socialist public officials. Social life, so conceived and lived in
                the form of marriage, child rearing, education, friendship,
                conviviality, entertainment, culture, and values, reveals a
                degree of commodity penetration and commercialism
                unprecedented even in the halcyon days of “free trade” and
                capitalist production.
                Which is not to say that the period following the Second World
                War did not have its preludes in the pre-war era.
                Technologically, the radio and particularly the cinema had a

                strong grip on popular culture throughout the twenties and
                thirties. The automobile and the vast economy created were
                already part of American life well before the outbreak of the
                war. Mercifully, the Great Depression of the 1930s froze this
                development for a decade, and the war aborted it for an added
                five years while the world reverted to the barbarism of
                organized slaughter and urban demolition. The assembly line
                was a portent of what was soon to come as was the increasing
                wedding of science to technology, which the war put on a
                thoroughly systematic basis.
                But there was much that these pre-war preludes to the post-
                war era left untouched. The Depression had given a bad name
                to capitalism and placed its legitimacy in grave doubt. This loss
                of faith stimulated a sweeping drift toward cultural and social
                movements that challenged the system’s integrity and claims
                to meet human needs. Agrarian life still had a strong base in
                American and French society, even as depression foreclosures
                reduced its economic significance. As late as 1929, twenty-five
                percent of the employed labor force in the United States owned
                or worked labor-intensive farms that had changed very little
                from the last century. Approximately three-fourths of American
                agricultural produce was sold at home. Although tractors were
                beginning to appear in growing numbers, horses were still in
                wide use and kerosene was still a major fuel for illuminating
                farm homes. Culturally, agrarian values were very much alive
                in America. They were embodied in the high proportion of
                immigrants from the villages of eastern Europe, Italy, and
                Ireland, and in the yeoman farmers who were being scattered
                throughout the continent by the dust storms that swept over

                middle America.
                The Depression, in fact, witnessed a remarkable regeneration
                of precapitalist agrarian values. The end of the First World War
                had seen a cultural mystification of urbanism and substantial
                migrations of young people from rural areas to cities. Songs
                such as “How Can You Keep Them Down on the Farm After
                They’ve Seen ‘Par-ee!’ ” typified a glorification of urban
                lifestyles in the 1920s. The rural “hick,” once conceived as the
                source of America’s sturdy republican values and the
                “pioneer” of continental settlement, had become a caricature
                in the cartoons, literature, and cinema of the twenties, a
                “country-cousin” bumpkin who would do well to conceal his
                identity in the “big city.” This remarkable change in the
                historical imagery of Americans reflected the ascendancy of
                the industrial city and the modern age over the small town and
                the Jeffersonian age—in short, the cosmopolitan capitalistic era
                over the parochial precapitalist era.
                The Depression decade reversed this imagery dramatically. For
                millions of unemployed or economically uncertain Americans,
                capitalism was patently not a working system. For all the
                hoopla about the decline of socialism as a movement from its
                high point in the period immediately preceding the First World
                War, it is worth recalling that Norman Thomas, the presumed
                heir of Eugene V. Debs, received 900,000 votes in 1932 as the
                Socialist Party’s presidential candidate, a figure that comes
                very close to Debs’s highest vote some fifteen years earlier.
                The Depression reversed the migration from farm to city, at
                least until the dust storms of later years drove many farmers to
                other parts of the country. Rural culture also began to thrive in
320 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the mass media of the decade, particularly as an evocation of
                community values, mutual aid, and compassion for less
                fortunate people. The extraordinary degree of social vitality
                that marked the 1930s stands in marked contrast to the
                socially devitalizing selfishness of the 1920s, which celebrated
                Calvin Coolidge’s maxim: “America’s business is business”—
                and, one might reasonably add, let morality go to the devil.
                Social justice, not personal venality, rings through the thirties
                as the motif of the radical left and radical right. Indeed, for
                much of the political spectrum, the business ethic was
                relegated to damnation together with the values of the
                twenties, which to many Americans had brought on the crises
                of the thirties.
                Characteristically, the cinematic foppery of the twenties and
                early thirties began to give way to movies that focused on such
                themes as poverty, unionism, justice, and the pristine values of
                agrarian lifeways. Even where capitalists are shown in a benign
                light, such as in The Devil and Miss Jones, businessmen were
                seen as converts to the new humanitarianism and the high
                sense of public responsibility that marked the decade. Others,
                like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Grapes of Wrath, unabashedly
                lauded precapitalist rural values and vilified the rich,
                hypostasizing the face-to-face simplicity and high moral sense
                of the small town. The rural community was set ethically
                against the spiritual poverty and cynicism of the city. A cultural
                populism swept over America after 1935 that has no parallel
                with any time before the 1890s, one that gave to community,
                public service, political idealism, and social justice a premium
                that makes the decade unique in twentieth-century American

                history.
                To a leftist of the 1930s, it seemed that industrial capitalism
                had reached its economic, social, and cultural limits; that from
                an ascending society, it had begun to descend historically, just
                as feudalism did centuries earlier. The Depression held on
                doggedly up to the Second World War; indeed, in the
                judgement of some economists, the closing years of the
                thirties appeared to be drifting into a new economic crisis
                comparable to or worse than the one that had darkened the
                decade’s opening years. Technological advance, saddled by
                the inertial weight of an increasingly monopolistic economy,
                seemed to have come to a virtual end. The monographs of the
                Temporary National Economic Committee of the late thirties,
                established to assess the growth and effects of business
                concentration in the United States, were filled with citations of
                technological stagnation, indeed the suppression of technical
                innovations that made for higher productivity and lower prices.
                That these innovations, seen as a source of economic
                instability and oligarchic control, had been generally arrested
                was’ cited by the literature of the time as evidence of a
                “decline” of capitalism itself and as proof of the Marxian thesis
                that “bourgeois social relations” stood in a “historical
                contradiction” to the “mode of production.” Capitalism, it was
                argued by liberals and leftists alike, was incapable of furthering
                the “productive forces” of society and could no longer play a
                “historically progressive” role.
                Yet there were also harbingers of significant tendencies
                counteractive to the radical analyses that marked the decade.
                Rural electrification was to basically alter the traditional

                agrarian life-ways that the Depression decade celebrated. It
                brought the radio into the home and exposed a socially pristine
                population to the mass media. The spate of public works that
                marked the Roosevelt era opened roads into the remaining
                hinterlands of the continent and the automobile culture
                improved existing roads for engine-powered vehicles. The
                great federal highway system of a later generation was to give,
                the coup de grâce to regional isolation and network the entire
                country with a remarkable road system that all but obliterated
                centuries-old cultural variations and customs. Distance and
                time were being overcome by the internal combustion engine,
                whether by rail, road, or air.
                Finally, the need for state intervention into a failing “free
                enterprise” economy vastly strengthened the nation-state and
                enlarged its bureaucratic apparatus. Rural life, however much
                it was celebrated culturally, was being locked into urban life
                and the city increasingly placed in a position subordinate to the
                nation-state. Business, too, was becoming concentrated and
                centralized. By 1929, nearly half of American industrial wealth
                was controlled by 200 large corporations and by 1932, despite
                the ravages of the Depression—or perhaps because of them—
                600 corporations controlled nearly two-thirds of the country’s
                industrial economy. Politically and economically, power was to
                concentrate and centralize into fewer hands, linked together
                by an endless number of bureaus, bureaucrats, and shared
                interests that were to prepare the way for the
                “technobureaucratic” nation-state so characteristic of our own
                time.
                The Second World War, while holding the values of die thirties

                somewhat in place during the first half of the forties, foisted
                another Industrial Revolution on western society whose scope,
                as we are now beginning to see, rivals the shift of humanity
                from a hunting-gathering society to an agricultural one. By
                1946, the technical basis had been created for a world that
                men and women of the thirties could never have anticipated.
                Electronics, nuclear power, giant strides in biochemical
                research, and the sophistication of rocket propulsion, not to
                speak of less visible but monumental advances in physics,
                chemistry, and biology that were tb yield revolutionary
                applications of scientific knowledge to industry, were to totally
                change the economic landscape. Political change for “total
                war” had already given rise in Europe to a new phenomenon in
                the west—the totalitarian state—beside which royal absolutism
                seems in retrospect like a feeble thing. The population
                dislocations created by military mobilization as well as war
                refugees, followed by the expansion of migration of industry to
                the western United States, and the pouring of billions into
                European reconstruction, vastly transformed the urban
                landscape. Los Angeles, a “small” city in the thirties by
                present-day standards, became the “paradigm” for unlimited,
                unplanned, and sprawling urbanization with its individual
                anomie, and a predatory form of capitalistic enterprise that
                overshadowed the “Roaring Twenties,” with its naive imagery
                of personal greed and vice. The fifties introduced a more
                anonymous and faceless phenomenon: corporate greed and
                commercialized vice, the marketing of managerialism and
                suburban self-indulgence (material as well as sexual) as a new
                way of life and a new set of values.

                Cities were to lose not only their territorial form; they were to to
                lose their cultural integrity and uniqueness. The Man in the
                Gray Flannel Suit, particularly as embodied in the sartorial
                conventions of Gregory Peck, became the avatar for the new
                managerial bureaucratism, despite the movie’s tribute to
                suburban family fife. Social justice, idealism, and agrarian
                values of community gave way to privatization, self-
                indulgence, and suburban cookouts. The desiderata of a
                corporate age, its synthetic and highly personalized culture,
                was a sanitized and socially vacuous world, held together not
                by the “underground” culture of past centuries but by an
                “above-ground” culture engineered by government and
                corporations. A mass society, notable for its de-spiritualized
                and amoral version of “possessive individualism” had emerged
                from the debris of the thirties, a mass society structured
                around television networks, counseling offices, bureaucratic
                agencies, and, above all, commodities. The market society had
                begun to come into its own, destructuring the city, the
                domestic world, the psyche, and ultimately the natural world.
                “Man,” brought into collision with “man” in a highly
                competitive world mediated by commodities, was finally
                brought into collision with nature on a scale unprecedented in
                history.
                Urbanization may be taken as the symbol and the reality of this
                historic ecological disarray of the modern landscape—indeed
                this reversal of the evolutionary clock—from organic to
                synthetic human and biotic relationships. Nor can this disarray
                be sorted out and pieced together on the summits of social fife.
                Historically, the power of preindustrial fifeways to survive and
325 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                preserve a moral sense of social fife depended on the
                existence of an “underground” culture in towns,
                neighborhoods, and cities—even during the stormiest periods
                of nation-building, industrialization, and “commodification”—to
                countervail the power of the market and the official culture.
                They depended, in effect, upon the power of a popular culture
                to resist the elite culture and, in no small part, on the inability
                of the elite culture to successfully penetrate the popular one.
                The crisis of our time as expressed in the decline of political fife
                and citizenship, of community and individuality in the classical
                sense of these concepts, stems from the invasion and
                colonization of culture’s subterranean domain by a highly
                metastatic capitalistic technics and its commodities.
                Objectified and fragmented, the social bond itself faces
                dissolution. What we call the “grassroots” of society is turning
                into straw, and its soil—the locality or municipality—is turning
                into sand. Whatever evidence of “fertility” and “fife” these
                roots exhibit seems to be the result of toxic chemicals—mass
                media, bureaucratic sinews, and managerial controls—the
                nation-state and corporations seem to be pouring into its
                bedrock, just as agribusiness generates “food” out of the
                chemically saturated sponge we call “soil” today.
                Redemption must come from below, from the municipal level
                where the “underground” culture of past times flourished, not
                from an “above” that constitutes the very source of the
                problems we face. The “long march through the institutions,”
                which sixties radicals such as Rudi Dutschke advocated in
                Germany and Herbert Marcuse evoked in America more than a
                decade ago, has demonstrated that it is the institutions that
326 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                ultimately absorb modern rebels, not the rebels who capture
                the institutions.
                Urbanization, insofar as it still permits the city to retain any
                identity, alters not only its form but its function as a civilizing
                arena for humanity. The “stranger” who could once find a
                home in the city and a role in its political fife as a citizen
                atavistically reverts to his or her status as an alien.
                Ghettoization moves hand in hand with urban sprawl, the
                dissolution of the self hand in hand with the city’s dissolution.
                Bureaucracy fills the vacuum created by the absence of an
                active community fife, notably the police officer who is the last
                custodian of order in disintegrating neighborhoods and the
                social worker who is the last custodian of order in domestic life.
                Critically viewed, the social ecology of urbanization is the’
                compelling story of the destructuring of all social life from
                home to community, the erosion of heterogeneity, interaction,
                and civic creativity. The return of the stranger expresses the
                change from the “lonely crowd,” explored by David Reisman
                three decades ago in his book of same name—indeed, to, the
                fearful crowd of today, a crowd in which everyone moves
                guardedly through the modern city with a sense of subdued
                dread toward surrounding people and unfamiliar
                neighborhoods. As urbanization spreads, so too does the state
                machinery needed to administer it. Whatever its form, the
                nation : state increasingly approximates a totalitarian state
                and the privatized individual, riddled by egoism and fear,
                increasingly becomes more like one commodity among many
                rather than a consumer. Ultimately, society threatens to
                become as inorganic as an ecosystem that has been divested
327 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                of its flora and fauna. When totalitarianism eventually does
                emerge, it is likely that the coherent self, so direly needed to
                resist it, will have undergone such erosion that it may well lack
                the psychological resources to recognize the danger, much
                less oppose it.
                Chapter Eight: The New Municipal Agenda
                From the moment nomadic hunter-gatherers began to settle
                down into stable villages, they introduced radically new
                changes that go beyond the turn’from food gathering to food
                cultivation. Where villages became towns, human beings
                began to “detribalize” themselves, and create those civic
                institutions we associate with “civilization/’ The blood tie, the
                male-female divisions in functions, and status groups based on
                age formed the sinews of tribalism and were slowly absorbed
                into an entirely new social dispensation: the city. Cities were to
                be structured primarily around residence, a vocational division
                of labor, and a variety of “orders” and classes, some of which
                were united by economic interests but others by power and
                prestige. The biological facts of blood, sex, and age, in effect,
                began to slowly phase into the social facts of propinquity,
                Vocation, wealth, and privilege.
                Out of this sweeping historical transformation, new ways of
                ordering life began to emerge. The biological realm of life,
                seemingly “natural” in its origins, became what we normally
                regard as the social: the realm in which people formed to meet
                their material needs, to reproduce as well as produce, to
                “relate” with each other as individuals and family groups, to
                fraternize in a variety of personal associations and degrees of
328 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                intimacy. The town and city, even the village, provided a
                political realm of life, human-made in origins, in which
                individuals related to each other as citizens in order to manage
                their communities and cope with its “civic” affairs. Until
                comparatively recent times, to be sure, “biological” and
                political realms overlapped significantly so that political elites
                such as aristocracies legitimated their authority over towns
                and cities by the highly tribalistic claims of ancestry and
                genealogy. Until the Emperor Caracalla made all free men in
                the Roman Empire citizens of the state, citizenship was largely
                regarded as an ancestral privilege. The rights it conferred to
                citizens in the management of the community were marked by
                various degrees of ethnic exclusivity.
                But the city, initially the Hellenic polis, created a new social
                dispensation: minimally, a territorial space in which the
                “stranger” or “alien” could reside with a reasonable degree of
                protection—later even a measure of participation—that few
                tribal communities allowed to outsiders, however hospitably
                they were treated. Two new civilizatory categories—politics
                and citizenship—began to absorb the largely biosocial forms
                that held early familial and tribal lifeways together.
                The professionalization of power and violence that we
                associate with the state came much later. Indeed, in its
                national form it is a fairly recent phenomenon. State and the
                practice of statecraft has no authentic basis in community life
                —by which I mean that, until recently, the acquisition of power
                by professionals encountered the greatest difficulty in
                legitimating itself. Tribal institutions can be easily understood
                because human beings are, after all, natural organisms. They

                must feed themselves, acquire their means of subsistence,
                reproduce, live in safety, and, given their evolution as
                primates, engage in some kind of communal intercourse. In
                contradistinction to other animals, however, they organize
                these activities into institutions and make them operationally
                systematic—hopefully rational, predictable, and ideologically
                legitimate. Animals, including the genetically programmed
                “social insects,” do not have institutions, however habituated
                and predictable their behavior may be; in short, they do not
                have consciously formed ways of ordering their communities
                that are continually subject to historical change.
                It is important to distinguish the social in humanity from the
                political and, still further, the political from the statist. We have
                created a terrible muddle by confusing the three and thereby
                legitimating one by mingling it with the other. This confusion
                has serious consequences for the present and future. We have
                lost our sense of what it means to be political by assigning
                political functions and prerogatives to “politicians,” actually to
                a select, often elite, group of people who practice a form of
                institutional manipulation called statecraft. Inasmuch as many
                politicians are viewed with a certain measure of contempt, we
                have degraded the concept of politics—once a participatory
                dimension of societal life and the activity of an entire
                community—by confusing it with statecraft, a distinctly power-
                oriented form of activity. Accordingly, we have lost our sense of
                what it means to be a citizen, a status we increasingly accept
                as mere “constituents” or, worse, voters and taxpayers who
                are the passive recipients of the goods and services provided
                to us by an all-powerful state and our “elected”
330 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                representatives.
                Ideologically, we tend to justify this historical degradation of
                our status as political beings by invoking the “nation” as the
                basic and most elemental unit of social life, an entity that is
                itself of very recent origin. That nations are made up of cities,
                towns, and villages on which our well-being, culture, and
                security ultimately depend has begun to elude us and slip from
                our consciousness. It remains a lasting contribution of Jane
                Jacobs to have demonstrated in a very compelling way that our
                economic well-being depends on cities, not on nation-states;
                indeed that while nations may be “political and military entities
                it doesn’t necessarily follow from this that they are also the
                basic, salient entities of economic life or that they are
                particularly useful for probing the mysteries of economic
                structure, the reasons for rise and decline of wealth.... We can’t
                avoid seeing, too, that among all the various types of
                economies, cities are unique in their abilities to shape and
                reshape the economies of other settlements, including those
                far removed from them geographically.”{79} We may leave
                aside Jacobs’s conventional use of such words as politics, her
                imagery of the economy as a strictly market, indeed, a
                capitalistic economy, and her strongly economistic
                interpretation of cities primarily as centers of production and
                exchange. Her argument invites a debate about the superfluity
                of the state that has been too long neglected, and her
                examples can only be ignored for the most dubious ideological
                reasons.
                A close reading of history has demonstrated that the state—
                and, in our own time, the nation-state—is not only the
331 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                repository of agents and institutions that have made a
                mockery of politics; it shows, in fact,’ that these state agents
                and institutions have degraded the individual as a public being,
                as a citizen who plays a ‘ participatory role in the operations of
                his or her community. In this respect, the nation-state has
                impeded the development of much that is uniquely human in
                human beings^ disempowering the individual and rendering
                him or her a warped and self-degraded being. ’
                It is equally demonstrable that the state—and, again, the
                nation-state—parasitizes the community, denuding it of its
                resources and its potential for development. It does this partly
                by draining the community of its material and spiritual
                resources; partly, too, by steadily divesting it of the power,
                indeed of its legitimate right, to shape its own destiny. Despite
                recent rhetoric to the contrary, nothing has seemed more
                challenging to the state than demands for local self-
                management and civic liberty. Decentralization, a term that is
                often abused these days for the most cynical ends of
                statecraft, is not merely rich in geographic, territorial, and
                political values; it is eminently a spiritual and cultural value
                that links the reempowerment of the community with the
                reempowerment of the individual.
                Municipal freedom, in short, is the basis for political freedom
                and political freedom is the basis for individual freedom—a
                recovery of a new participatory politics structured around free,
                self-empowered, and active citizens. For centuries, the city was
                the public sphere for politics and citizenship, and in many areas
                the principal source of resistance to the encroachment of the
                nation-state. In its acts of defiance it often delayed the

                development of the nation-state and created remarkable forms
                of association to counteract the state’s encroachment upon
                municipal freedom and individual liberties.
                The case for the nation-state today is almost entirely logistical
                and administrative. Social life, we are normally told, is too
                “complex” to allow for municipal autonomy and participatory
                citizenship. This argument does not stand up very well against
                historical and contemporary evidence. Fascinating examples
                can be found of economic and political coordination within and
                between communities that render statecraft and the nation-
                state utterly superfluous.
                Aside from Hellenic, Italian, medieval German, and Castilian
                endeavors, one of the most lasting are the Swiss communes
                whose practice of using local resources without turning them
                into private property was to be an object of fascination for
                generations to visitors in the mountain areas of central Europe.
                These communes and the confederations they formed for their
                common welfare, and safety seem to have absorbed almost
                tribalistic forms of intimacy into their practices, even attitudes
                that Viewed sharing according to need rather than work into
                their ways of dealing with material goods. According to some
                accounts, the word “land,” which was often open to use by all
                who needed it, included streams, clay pits, quarries, or, in H.
                Mooseburger’s words, “the entire region with every and all its
                products and fruits.”{80} Let me emphasize that this was a
                municipal form of “ownership” about which we shall have more
                to say later, riot the nationalized forms advocated by Marxian
                socialists, the “economic democracy” advanced by many
                liberals, or systems of “workers’ control” demanded by

                orthodox anarchists—all of which, I may add, involve some
                degree of state involvement or a particularistic and potentially
                competitive body of interests within the community, however
                collectively “owned” or, democratically “managed” an
                enterprise may be.
                The Gray Leagues (Graubunden), the source of the Swiss
                referendum and the town meetings of its 222 communes, have
                to be singled out as the most libertarian of all. Until Napoleon
                forced it into the Swiss Confederation, the Freistaat der Drei
                Bunde (literally, the Free State of the Three Leagues) arid
                specifically the Graubund itself, the league that give its name
                to the confederation of the three leagues that composed it,
                was to exist for nearly three centuries (1524–1800) and place
                its distinctly decentralistic imprint on Switzerland as a whole.
                This Free State “was not merely democratic,” observes
                Benjamin Barber in his superb account of the league and its
                standards of community freedom. The fact is that “it was
                democratic in a particular way not easily accounted for by the
                conceptual perspective of Anglo-American thought...
                Graubunden’s experience with democracy has been
                inseparable from its experience with community, and as a
                model of integral community, no region of Switzerland can
                equal it”{81}
                Barber’s conclusions cannot be emphasized too strongly. What
                they concretely indicate is that the ultimate source of
                sovereignty reposed in the commune—the village, town, and
                city—whose assent or opposition to a course of action was
                achieved by referendum. The confederal system that united
                the communes had the right to deal with foreign affairs, and
334 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                little more. Beyond this sphere, confederal bodies were
                concerned mainly with preventing their component leagues
                from making foreign alliances on their own than with any
                formulation of foreign policy. Issues such as war and peace
                were decided directly by the communes themselves. “The only
                instrument of the central government was a three-man
                commission (Haupter) made up of the heads of each of the
                leagues that, with the assistance of an elective assembly
                (Beytag), prepared the referendum and executed the will of the
                communes,” Barber tells us. “In the new structure power was
                an inverse function of level of organization. The central
                ‘federal’ government had almost none, the regional
                communes had a great deal.”{82} Whatever its capacity to
                deal with the problems that confronted the Free State, the
                people were provided “with several centuries of real thoughtful
                independence and a measure of autonomous self-government
                rare in Germanic Europe.”
                The challenges faced by the Free State and its component
                leagues over these centuries require a lengthy study of the
                kind provided by Barber. The problem of dealing with foreign
                intervention; the incorporation of sizable towns and the
                expansion of older ones into cities; the disparities in status,
                wealth, and power that developed, not to speak of local
                parochialism at one extreme and cosmopolitian “modernity” at
                the other, were never fully resolved. But they were held in
                remarkable balance for most of the Free State’s history. Even
                after Napoleon had reduced the Free State to a canton in the
                more centralized Swiss Confederation, Barber notes that the
                peasant still turned the harshness of his sparse land “into a
335 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                discipline of individuality, a teacher of autonomy. He held the
                intuitive conviction that his rural mountain life, his
                uncomplicated involvement in a pastoral economy that left
                him considerable leisure time, was inextricably bound up with
                his independence and his freedom.”{83}
                By no means should this strong sense of individuality be
                mistaken for the “individualism” associated with traditional
                “natural law” ideologues and the modern-day proprietary
                emphasis on egoism. The hardships inflicted on Alpine
                dwellers, locked in a glacial land of heavy snowfalls,
                avalanches, and floods, placed a high premium on “collective
                labor and common decision making. ... Thus as the hardness of
                life molded a man’s sense of autonomy, it also compelled him
                to cooperation and collective action.” As Herman Weilenmann
                has put it, to the villagers of the Graubunden freedom involved
                “not individual emancipation from his obligations to the whole,
                but the right to bind himself by his own choice.”{84} Neither
                the individual nor the collective, in effect, claimed sovereignty
                over each other but rather they formed a complementary
                relationship that supported each other.
                These are abiding notions that are difficult for modern Euro-
                Americans to accept nowadays. Yet they are deeply rooted in
                the American tradition itself. I refer more to the New England
                town meeting tradition from which so many of the authentic
                libertarian aspects of the “American Dream” derive rather than
                the “cowboy” tradition that presumably “tamed the West” and
                threatens to reduce it to a battleground of sheer avarice. We
                are only now becoming aware of the localist and
                communitarian motives that drove Puritan settlers to New

                England. Religious persecution by Charles I was only one of
                several reasons that the lives of the Puritans were intolerable
                under the Stuart kings. “If Charles I is remembered at all today,
                it is as an ineffectual monarch who lost his head on the
                chopping block,” observes T. H. Breen, whose work on Puritan
                institutions is perhaps one of the best that has been published
                in recent years. “During the first years of his reign, however, he
                brought considerable energy to his position. He instituted or
                tried to institute far-reaching changes in civil, ecclesiastical,
                and military affairs. These unprecedented, often arbitrary
                policies disrupted the fabric of local society, and they were a
                major preoccupation of the men and women who moved to
                Massachusetts Bay. One cannot fully understand the
                institutional decisions that the colonists made in America
                unless one realizes how gravely Stuart centralization
                threatened established patterns of daily life in England’s local
                communities.”{85}
                The men and women who formed the New England townships
                of the seventeenth century sought not only to restore
                Christianity to its “pure,” ecclesiastically untainted, biblical
                forms; they also sought to restore society itself to its pristine,
                egalitarian, and devoutly communitarian patterns, presumably
                paralleling the ethical and social covenants that appear in
                “Acts” and the quasitribal democracy of the Hebrew Bedouins
                and their compacts. A shared assumption seemed to exist that
                the English town corresponded to the Hebrew tribal
                community and that its restoration was a necessary move
                toward social as well as religious purification. Every community
                was conceived as an ethical compact, not simply a form of
337 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                association for personal and collective survival—a notion
                decidedly antithetical to the Hobbesian and Lockean principles
                that enter into liberal conceptions of republicanism as we know
                them today. Men and women, in the Puritan world view, formed
                communities to achieve a “good society” in the moral, not
                merely the material, sense of the term: a society marked by
                virtue as defined in Christian precept. Individual and
                community, in this sense, were no less inseparable among the
                early colonists of New England than they were among the
                villagers of the Swiss Graubund.
                The stormy declamations of angry prophets such as Amos,
                whom Ernst Bloch has so aptly called a “barn burner,” sear the
                Puritan soul, and explain the institutional development of
                Puritan communities. It was Charles I and his “ill-advised
                attempt to increase his authority by attacking local English
                institutions” who appears as the Moloch in this drama, and the
                Puritan divines as the prophets who denounced royal
                encroachments on the “liberties of Englishmen,” to use the
                language of the day. Despite the diversity of their origins,
                ranging from “populous commercial centers such as London
                and Norwich” to “isolated rural communities ... most had been
                affected in some personal way by the king’s aggressive efforts
                to extend his civil and ecclesiastical authority ... The
                experience of having to resist Stuart centralization, a
                resistance that pitted small congregations against meddling
                bishops, incorporated boroughs and guilds against grasping
                courtiers, local train-bands against demanding deputy
                lieutenants, and almost everyone in the realm against the
                collectors of unconstitutional revenues, shaped the New
338 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Englanders’ ideas about civil, ecclesiastical, and military polity.
                The settlers departed from England determined to maintain
                their local attachments against outside interference, and to a
                large extent the Congregational churches and self-contained
                towns of Massachusetts Bay stood as visible evidence of the
                founders’ decision to preserve in America what had been
                threatened in the mother country.”{86}
                In view of the grim reputation the Puritan towns acquired as
                dour “theocracies” and parochial, self-righteous, dogmatic
                nests of intolerance, we must provide, with more nuance, a
                picture of their variety, roundedness, and militancy—not
                simply as they existed at any given moment in time but as
                they evolved, eventually to become centers of social rebellion,
                civic autonomy, and collective liberty. Nor can we ignore the
                strong-minded yeomanry they produced, the high sense of
                individuality and citizenship they nourished. We must bear in
                mind that these personal and social traits persisted in New
                England for some three centuries—not as mere historical
                ephemera that pass like wispy clouds across the social horizon
                but as an established democratic legacy. No less ingrained in
                the mythology of the American tradition than the reality of
                business and its virtues, this legacy has always acted as a force
                countervailing the egoistic sensibility fostered by reactionary
                nationalists and liberal centralists in other parts of America.
                Let us quickly rid ourselves of the idea that this Yankee
                yeomanry was “tight-fisted,” “commercially oriented,”
                “grasping,” and emotionally guarded. This imagery mistakes
                Boston, a commercially oriented and acquisitive port, for New
                England as a whole. The port cities, in fact, often stood at odds
339 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                with the many small townships that were networked into the
                interior of the New England colonies and states. These colonies
                and their interiors were unique insofar as they were municipal
                entities, vital towns, in contrast to other regions of America,
                which were generally marked by dispersed settlements and
                farmsteads. Two facts emerge that deserve emphasis. Firstly,
                Boston and other port cities in New England were no different
                in their outlook and interests than Baltimore or Charleston,
                hence they were fairly atypical of the Yankee spirit of the
                region. Indeed, they were no different as commercial ports
                than port cities elsewhere in the world. Secondly, the fact that
                small towns could be planted so firmly, indeed, doggedly in
                New England’s thin, rocky, glaciated soil was an act of ethical
                defiance, for the region is a poor agricultural area that offers no
                congenial home for flourishing communities.
                The towns and townships that emerged on the rocky soils of
                Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and particularly
                New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont were a challenging moral
                statement of firm intentions to live in a very definite way, a
                structural expression of what constitutes a virtuous life, not
                merely a bountiful one. Whereas Boston eventually visualized
                itself as the “New World’s” counterpart of London, many New
                England townships saw themselves as biblical communities,
                united by Old Testament convenants that hypostasized simple
                living, a high regard for essentials over frivolities, fairness and
                mutuality in relationships, egalitarianism in status, self-
                sufficiency in the development of needs and their satisfaction,
                and more elaboration of communitarian values than
                fetishization of change. In short, they were committed to a

                moral economy and society, not to lifeways premised on the
                market and gain.
                We must look at these lifeways closely if we are to understand
                the political institutions and economic relationships that
                expressed them and were designed to reinforce them.
                However much these moral lifeways varied—owing, in part, to
                their ties with the commercially oriented port cities—they were
                remarkably self-sufficient. I speak, here, of a world in which the
                yeomanry comprised 70 percent of the agrarian population.
                Crops were cultivated mainly for survival rather than trade. As
                one yeoman wrote in the 1770s, a farm gave “me and my
                whole family a good living on the produce of it. Nothing to
                wear, eat or drink was purchased, as my farm provided
                all.”{87} That surplus crops were used to purchase
                manufactured goods such as iron, nails, glass, weapons,
                gunpowder, and medicine does not alter the marginality of
                commerce for most townships. Land utilization reflected the
                domestic nature of the economy. It was very sparsely used
                despite the large amount that was available for cultivation.
                Although yeomen often had fifty or more acres of land,
                generally only a fifth to a tenth was actually put to pasture and
                food cultivation, and usually only for the family and its
                livestock. Women were engaged in caring for the home, child
                rearing, making homespun clothing, and other family and farm
                chores; men, in the also arduous tasks of farming,
                woodcutting, and construction. Diversified crop cultivation is
                evidence of efforts to meet domestic more than market needs.
                If anything, this yeomanry seems to have viewed commerce
                disdainfully, indeed as parasitic and demeaning to a productive

                and spiritually oriented way of life. In the words of the
                Bostonian, George Richards Minot, writing in the 1780s,
                yeoman-landed property “had always been held in higher
                esteem and more valuable nature than any personal estate.”
                Indeed, its “possession ... seems to be of greater gratification
                to the pride and independence of men.”{88} This image of
                agriculture, divested of acquisitive and commercial ends,
                provided the New England farmer with a sense of personal and
                ethical autonomy that made him eschew the word “farmer” or
                “peasant” for “yeoman” or “husbandman,” an example of the
                way in which men think of themselves that was to profoundly
                alter their behavior and the course of history.
                Yet as David P. Szatmary points out, “a feeling of independence
                did not necessarily lead to individualism. Although priding
                themselves on their autonomy, yeomen lived in a community-
                oriented culture. To ease their backbreaking work during
                planting and harvesting, they asked family and friends for help.
                The independent status of yeomen, then, resulted neither from
                self-s uffi ciency nor a basically competitive system but led,
                rather, to cooperative, community-oriented
                interchanges.”{89} More concretely, this communal
                orientation brought women directly into food cultivation and
                enhanced their social status, all talk of Puritan “patriarchy” to
                the contrary notwithstanding. The enormous respect—and
                troubled concern—that made dissenters such as Anne
                Hutchinson the center of religious and political controversy in
                the early years of the colony attest to the forwardness of
                women in this society and their enormous strength of
                character.

                Barter and the sharing of resources reinforced neighborliness
                and fostered a warmly hospitable openness to people, even to
                newcomers, as the Marquis de Chastellex was to observe in his
                tour of New England during the early 1780s. The all-
                encompassing egalitarianism that pervaded this yeoman world
                included even agricultural laborers, a mere ten percent of the
                rural workforce, who usually owned some land in their own
                right or were given land in reward for their services. New
                England did not really have a rural proletariat Indeed,
                disparities in wealth were too insignificant to give rise to a
                stable class society.
                Out of this world emerged the town meeting, a direct
                democracy in which local and, in times of social unrest, broadly
                political issues were fervently debated and resolved. Here, in
                contrast to Swiss democracy, attempts to trace the New
                England town meeting back to Germanic tribal traditions may
                well be examples of historical overkill. The immediate source of
                the town meeting lies very much at hand. Puritans were mainly
                Congregationalists, a form of Protestantism that denies by
                definition the need for any ecclesiastical hierarchy or
                centralizing body. In this utterly anarchic conception of
                Christianity, all powers of religious interpretation belong to the
                local congregation, which is mystically united to others of the
                same kind by the presence of Christ, a spiritual metaphor
                rather than an institution. This radically decentralistic
                interpretation of the community as an autonomous
                congregation can easily extend outward into the civil, world in
                the form of an equally autonomous political body, the town
                meeting. The periodic meeting of the entire male population of
343 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                a community in order to govern its own affairs is a logical
                outcome of Puritan religious belief and forms of organization.
                Property and income restrictions on the right to participate in
                town meetings were not taken too seriously. Disparities in land
                ownership and the payment of taxes could have excluded only
                a small number of residents in most New England towns. In the
                more rural areas, these restrictions counted for virtually
                nothing. By the 1760s, when colonial unrest was to lead to
                outright revolution^ town meetings were so notoriously open
                that even newly arrived or transient residents could participate
                ih them. Historians who tend to tie property qualifications to
                New England’s franchise system have proven themselves to
                be sticklers for regulations that went unenforced two centuries
                ago or were essentially nonexistent.
                The reaction to Charles I’s attempts to place localities under
                centralized control and weaken local militias heightened the
                sensitivity of the New England towns to their autonomy and
                right to bear arms. It is contemporary libel regarding the role of
                an armed people to invoke the insecurities of the American
                frontier as an excuse to ban arms ih the more “stable” and,
                presumably, more “secure” society of our own day. By the late
                eighteenth century, the New England states were largely free
                of Indian attacks. The prevalent notion of a covenanted
                township and a covenanted militia had very little to do with
                personal safety. The yeomen of New England were not so much
                in fear of Indian forays against their persons as they were
                concerned with statist forays, against their liberties. In one of
                the most radical state constitutions to be adopted during the
                American Revolution, Vermont yeomen, gathering at Windsor
344 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                in July 1777, not only abolished slavery and property
                qualifications for the franchise, they also avowed that “as
                standing armies, in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty,
                they ought not to be kept up.” Accordingly, “the people have a
                right to bear arms for a defense of themselves and the State,”
                a right that explicitly goes far, beyond the reticent wording of
                ‘the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.
                These, sentiments reflected the yeomanry’s state of mind two-
                hundred years ago. They had nothing to do with the West’s
                “gun slinging” and its bullying machismo. Rather they
                expressed the sound conviction that the state cannot be
                trusted to claim a monopoly of violence over its citizenry and
                the full custody of public freedom. Democracy, if it was to
                mean anything, presupposed the active involvement of the
                citizen in developing a participatory politics, public security,
                and the direct face-to-face resolution of community problems.
                Hacking the means and instruments, particularly the weapons,
                to enforce its decisions, such a citizenry in the eyes of the
                yeomanry would be reduced to a mere instrument of the state,
                whose legitimacy in their eyes was extremely dubious.
                The township formed the living repository of institutions such
                as the town meeting and the militia. “When the eighteenth-
                century Yankee reflected on government,” observes Robert A.
                Gross, “he thought first of his town. Through town meetings, he
                elected his officials, voted his taxes, and provided for the well-
                ordering of community affairs. The main business of the town
                concerned roads and bridges, schools, and the poor—the
                staples of local government even today. But the colonial New
                England town claimed authority over anything that happened
345 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                within its borders. It hired a minister to preach in the town-built
                meetinghouse and compelled attendance at his sermons. It
                controlled public uses of private property, from the location of
                slaughterhouses and tanneries to the quality of bread sold at
                market. And it gave equal care to the moral conduct of its
                inhabitants ... No issue was in theory exempt from a town’s
                action, even if in practice the provincial government
                occasionally intervened in local disputes and told the
                inhabitants how to run their lives.”{90}
                Not surprisingly, the town meeting in even more secular form
                swept out of New England during the Revolution and was to
                extend as far south as Charleston. With the end of the
                Revolution itself, municipal “counterrevolutions” (to use the
                language of the historians) essentially pushed it back to the
                region of its origin and replaced municipal assemblies with
                mayors and aldermanic councils. New England and a number
                of towns bordering the region tenaciously, even defiantly, held
                on to their democratic municipal institutions, at least in the
                smaller towns and villages.
                The “Founding Fathers” who fashioned the national
                constitution of 1788 created a fairly centralized republic, but
                they were also obliged to tolerate a basically confederal, face-
                to-face municipal democracy within their instrument of
                government and a fairly radical “Bill of Rights” that had been
                foisted upon them by a restless yeomanry. The United States
                Constitution, in effect, expresses a precarious compromise
                between demands for a municipal democracy and a
                centralized nation-state. Running at cross purposes throughout
                the document and the quasilegal “Declaration of
346 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Independence” are agrarian, precapitalist commitments to
                freedom, a participatory politics, and an involved citizenry on
                the one hand, and a distinctly capitalistic imagery of
                acquisitive individualism favored by the rising commercial
                elements in the port cities and inland market towns of the new
                nation.
                Having examined the yeoman world of New England in the
                eighteenth century, our account would be incomplete if we
                failed to look at the urban commercial world that coexisted
                with it. It was in this world that the seeds of urbanization were
                already planted. Port cities and inland market towns of New
                England “lived in a largely commercial culture,” notes
                Szatmary, “The market-oriented way of life included the drive
                toward acquisition and accumulation and emphasized the
                individual over the community. Merchants, shopkeepers,
                professionals, commercial farmers, urban artisans, sailors, and
                fishermen formed the most important economic groups in this
                society. New England merchants, residing in large port towns
                such as Boston, Newport, and Providence, dominated and
                represented the most successful sector in the commercial
                culture. Handling and transporting farm goods, manufactured
                commodities, and, at times, human cargoes, they primarily
                sought personal wealth. Such middlemen, although they
                worked at as lower pace than modern industrialists, had the
                accumulation of money as their primary goal.”{91}
                Commerce and acquisitiveness, as I have emphasized, are not
                new to the precapitalist world. What makes the merchant
                stratum unique in the modern social landscape is that it
                funneled its earnings into its various enterprises and sought
347 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                unceasingly to expand them—partly as a response to the
                intense competition that existed in new markets, partly in an
                effort to gain control of home markets. This difference between
                an acquisitive and expanding market economy on the one
                hand and precapitalist markets that were not nearly as
                accumulative on the other is important. The yeomanry outside
                the cities bartered produce to meet its basic survival needs.
                The merchants within the city exchanged goods to expand and
                absorb rivals. The simple commodity markets of the village,
                even of many medieval communes, encountered cultural
                constraints to growth that placed socially accepted moral limits
                on the acquisition of wealth. Gilds and public opinion enforced
                these limits hand-in-hand with religious precepts. Acquisition
                seemed demonic rather than elevating. Hence trade could be
                held in check and a mixed economy developed that
                maintained its integrity against the corrosive, homogenizing
                effects of an uncontrolled market economy.
                By contrast, the rising capitalists of the eighteenth century in
                their port and inland commercial towns removed virtually all of
                these moral, public, and religious constraints to acquisition and
                expansion. Even land, once the refuge of the ancient capitalists
                from a life devoted to commerce, became a mere commodity
                so that its acquisition in the eighteenth century, particularly in
                the “New World,” conferred no special status on the new
                merchant stratum.‘The Ohio Land Company, a speculative
                enterprise formed in the late 1780s by New England and New
                York merchants, did not intend to cultivate any of the vast
                territories it acquired on the western frontier. Its goal was “to
                profit from their purchases through quick sales to incoming
348 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                settlers.”{92} As one Boston lawyer put it in 1785: “Money is
                the only object attended to, and the only acquisition that
                commands respect.”{93}
                This monetary and speculative mentality, while not
                unprecedented historically, is unique when it acquires such
                complete centrality! What is significant here is that
                moneymaking became an ethic such that prestige, personal
                integrity, indeed social status depend upon the acquisition of
                capital, not upon the ownership of land and the acquisition of
                titles. By the eighteenth century, the new republican ethos of
                the cities was altered such that it placed a high premium on the
                accumulation of money and the means for making money, not
                on social position and. high living. The aristocratic values that
                had permeated merchant strata from time immemorial were
                replaced by acquisitive values, egoism, and a brutalizing
                appetite for profit. In such a highly acquisitive and competitive
                economy, the virtues of community were subordinated to the
                value-of personal gain and capital expansion.
                From an ethical association for mutual support community was
                turned into an entrepreneurial nexus for competition and
                manipulation. This sweeping inversion of the very meaning of
                consociation and friendship has no precedent in human history.
                Whatever else the seafaring warriors of the Bronze Age did
                during their acts of brigandage or the merchants of the
                classical and feudal eras did in their forays abroad, their own
                communities were seen as refuges from their predations, and
                they made lavish contributions to civic beautification! The new
                merchant and particularly the industrialist who followed, began
                to view his own community as an object of predation and often
349 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                plundered it ruthlessly. This behavior, graduated to the level of
                the “business ethic,” began to supplant the religious precepts
                and cultural values that had been passed on from time
                immemorial, even to earlier merchants and entrepreneurs.
                Herein lay its enormous power: the ability to replace one set of
                ethical ideals with another, in short, to make gain itself a value
                that could be used to countervail and ultimately overcome all
                traditional constraints to asociality and predation. Enveloping
                this distinctly antisocial form of individualism was a new
                ideological support system: laws that gave an almost religious
                sanction to contracts irrespective of their content and clerics
                who legitimated gain as a heavenly calling. The courtierlike
                profligacy and extravagance of French merchants and, the
                passion for titles’ that existed among English merchants, were
                dissolved by American merchants into an ethos of prudence,
                simple living, and the embellishment of gain with the myth of
                “republican virtue.”
                Let it be noted that this ethos did not roll over the new
                American republic like a moral tidal wave. Most of the country
                still adhered to yeoman values, albeit in a less communitarian
                form than we still find among rural New England Yankees,
                Southern plantation owners still held to aristocratic values that
                placed a higher premium on consumption than acquisition. To
                spend one’s substance in a grand fashion was the sign of a
                gentleman, in contrast to the craven acquisitiveness of the
                New England merchant. On the frontier, material self-
                sufficiency and personal autonomy were still ends in

                adventurers to the West in pursuit of gold originated more in

                visions of luxurious living than capital expansion. It was not
                until the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War that
                American capitalism, seen as a system of growth for its own
                sake, began to hypostasize all of these acquisitive values and
                steadily destructure earlier institutional, ethical, and personal
                ideals.
                Urbanization became the physical expression of this
                destructuring process, the way in which it assumed visibility. I
                speak here of the industrial, commercial, and residential sprawl
                that we call urban belts. Already early in the twentieth century
                cities such as New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and, in
                Europe, London, Manchester, Berlin, even Paris began to
                absorb adjacent towns and cancerously afflict the landscape
                with overbuilt, densely populated, and overextended
                structures. The new electric trolley systems that networked
                communities within regions supplemented the railroads that
                networked regions into nation-states. Vast areas of the western
                world, once relatively impenetrable to the deadening effects of
                capitalistic forms of urbanism, were ruthlessly opened to
                exploitation and homogenization. By the 1920s, the
                automobile became the vehicle of choice for expanding
                suburban development and for subverting the remaining
                distinctions between town and country that were so vital for
                maintaining the identity of both. The famous “antagonism
                between town and country,” so celebrated by historians as a
                driving force in social development, had produced much of the
                political and cultural variety we associate with the mixed
                economy preceding modern capitalism and energized the
                movements that gave us modern concepts of democracy. The

                tension between rural and urban society and the diversity it
                created as people moved between both worlds accounts in
                very great part for the fecundity of social life in the past. The
                1930s, perhaps mercifully, arrested urban homogenization and
                reinforced agrarian values that had nourished the democratic
                images of the yeomanry and artisans. Placed in the urban
                context of the decade, this remarkable marriage of countryside
                and town had produced a vitally creative hybridization of
                outlooks from which the Depression years gained so rich a
                sense of humanism and social commitment.
                The end of the Second World War—notwithstanding the 1960s
                decade—revived the trends initiated by the twentieth century.
                The acquisitive individualism that existed on a pocket-size
                scale in American society during the eighteenth and early
                nineteenth centuries ballooned out over the entire country.
                Today it constitutes a social malignancy, more properly a
                cancer of society that threatens to destructure and undermine
                not only the social bond but the natural world. Its primary
                effect is simplification, the unraveling of all social ties into the
                loose threads of the marketplace with its anonymous buyers
                and sellers, its objectification of all values, its monetization of
                ideals—and its unrelenting “growth,” which takes the demonic
                form of turning everything organic into the inorganic, ossifying
                community and individual alike. That it may yield a society
                divested of all cultural variety, a human psyche divested of all
                uniqueness, and a natural world divested of all diversity is the
                hidden intuition of our times for which nuclear immolation and
                the wasteland it may yield is as much a metaphor for our times
                as it is a potential reality. Politics and citizenship are not only
352 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the victims of this corrosive process. It may well be that they
                are also the antidote for it—provided, to be sure, that we can
                reconstruct them in ways that are redolent of their classical
                meaning and enlarged by what we can learn from the modern
                world.
                Any agenda that tries to restore and amplify the classical
                meaning of politics and citizenship must clearly indicate what
                they are not because of the confusion that surrounds the two
                words.
                Politics is not statecraft, which, alas, is what we ordinarily mean
                when we speak of “politics” today. And citizens are not
                “constituents” or “voters.” Statecraft consists of operations
                that engage the state: the exercise of its monopoly of violence,
                its control of the entire regulative apparatus of society in the
                form of legal and ordinance-making bodies, its governance of
                society by means of professional legislators, armies, police
                forces, bureaucracies, and the ancillary professionals who
                service its operations such as lawyers, educators, technicians,
                and the like. Statecraft takes on a political patina when so-
                called “political” parties attempt, in various power plays, to
                occupy the offices that make state policy and execute it. This
                kind of “politics” has an almost tedious typicality. A political
                “party” is normally a highly structured hierarchy, fleshed out
                by a membership that functions in a top-down manner. It is a
                miniature state, and in some countries, notably modern Russia,
                actually constitutes the state itself.
                The Soviet example of the state qua party is simply the logical
                extension of the party into the state if only because every party
353 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                has its roots in the state, not in the citizenry. The conventional
                party is hitched to the state like a garment on a clothing hook.
                However varied the garment and its design may be, it is not
                part of the body politic; it merely clothes it. There is nothing
                authentically political about this phenomenon: it is meant
                precisely to contain the body politic, to control it and to
                manipulate it, not to express its will—or even permit it to
                develop a will. In no sense is a conventional “political” party
                derivative of the body politic or constituted by it. Leaving
                metaphors aside, “political” parties are replications of the state
                when they are out of power and often synonomous with the
                state when they are in power. They are formed to mobilize, to
                command, to acquire power, and to rule. Thus they are as
                inorganic as the state itself—an excrescence of society that
                has no real roots in it, no responsiveness to it beyond the needs
                of faction, power, and mobilization.
                Politics, by contrast, is an organic phenomenon. It is organic in
                the very real sense that it is the activity of a public body—a
                community, if you will—just as a plant is rooted in and
                nourished by soil. Politics, conceived as an activity, involves
                rational discourse, public empowerment, the exercise of
                practical reason, and its realization in a shared, indeed
                participatory, activity. It is the sphere of societal life beyond the
                family and the personal needs of the individual that still retains
                the intimacy, involvement, and sense of responsibility that is
                enjoyed in private arenas of life. Groups may form to advance
                specific political views and programs, but these views and
                programs are no better than their capacity to answer to the
                needs of an active public body. A clear failing of many
354 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                “political” parties is the fact that their programs or “ideologies”
                are imposed on the public by individuals or their acolytes
                whose relationship to the community is tenuous and largely
                conceptual: One thinks here of the insights of a Karl Marx
                whose ideas were developed within the confines of the British
                Museum and then foisted on the world with a scriptural
                authority that still generates an endless stream of academic
                dissertations even though they exercise virtually no influence
                in public life. By contrast, political movements, in the authentic
                sense of the word, emerge out of the body politic itself, and
                their programs are formulated not only by theorists, invaluable
                as they may be, but in great part by the public itself, which
                plays a participatory role in their elucidation and
                dissemination. The populist movements that swept out of
                agrarian America and Tsarist Russia or the anarchosyndicalist
                and peasant movements of Spain and Mexico—all, despite
                their ideological patina, emerged from the populace and
                articulated their deepest social and political aspirations. They
                developed into political cultures that solidified completely into
                the body politic.
                Social theorists seem to lack a sufficient awareness of the
                public’s power to create its own political institutions and forms
                of organization. Twentieth-century popular uprisings such as
                the Russian, German, Spanish, and, most recently, the
                Hungarian revolutions witnessed the widespread self-
                organization of the people into councils (some that were
                networked into regional and national congresses), popular
                assemblies in a wide variety of areas, and autonomous
                municipalities—often without party leadership. The notion, so
355 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                common across the political spectrum, that a party structured
                along conventional hierarchical lines and guided by a
                commanding leadership is indispensable to political change is,
                in fact, thoroughly belied by experience.
                Robert Michels, despite his jaundiced view of the
                “competence” of the “masses” in Political Parties and his
                proclivity for charismatic leaders, provides a compelling
                argument for the inertial effect of conventional political parties
                in periods of rapid social change. They tend to take over
                institutions that the people create rather than innovate them,
                indeed, ultimately reworking them along statist lines.
                The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917–21 is a textbook example of
                the appropriation of a popular movement by a highly
                centralized party. The revolution ended, in the evisceration of
                an elaborate grass-roots council system (the Soviets) by a
                state-oriented party and the complete divestiture of all power
                that the populace had so painstakingly acquired. A new state
                apparatus was largely embodied in the Bolshevik party. By the
                1920s in Russia, statecraft had completely replaced politics,
                and constituents—more properly, subjects—had replaced
                citizens. The Russian Bolsheviks had introduced a new wrinkle
                in the concept of a constituent, Deprived even of the status of
                “voters” and any representation in the state, the Russian
                people were turned by Bolshevism into a “mass.” Bolshevism,
                in effect, established a pattern for “mass mobilization” that
                was to be emulated and used with socially disastrous effects
                by National Socialism in Germany.
                The recovery and development of politics must, I submit, take
                its point of departure from the citizen and’his or her immediate
356 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                environment beyond the familial and private arenas of life.
                There can be no politics without community. And by
                community! mean a municipal association of people reinforced
                by its own economic power, its own institutionalization of the
                grass roots, and the confederal support of nearby communities
                organized into a territorial network on a local and regional
                scale. Parties that do not intertwine with these grass-roots
                forms of popular organization are not political in the classical
                sense of the term. In fact, they are bureaucratic and
                antithetical to the development of a participatory politics and
                participating citizens. The authentic unit of political life, in
                effect, is the municipality, whether as a whole, if it is humanly
                scaled, or as its various subdivisions, notably the
                neighborhood.
                Nor can politics be structured around the delegation of power.
                The words “representative democracy,” taken literally, are a
                contradiction in terms. Democracy, conceived as the “rule by
                the people” is totally inconsistent with the more republican
                vision of “rule by representatives” of the people. It is historical
                cliche to emphasize that the authors of the United States
                Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation in
                the 1780s, meant that they and their social strata were the
                “People” in the opening sentence of the document. The
                Constitution did not create a democracy along Hellenic lines; it
                created a republic along Roman lines. And like the Roman
                Republic it unavoidably and reluctantly incorporated inherited
                democratic institutions such as popular assemblies, which the
                brothers Gracchi tried to radically expand—an endeavor that
                ended in tragic failure.

                All statist objections aside, the problem of restoring municipal
                assemblies seems formidable if it is cast in strictly structural
                and administrative forms. New York City has no way of
                “assembling” if it tries to emulate Athens with its
                comparatively small citizen body. New York City, in fact, is no
                longer a city in the classical sense of the term and hardly rates
                as a municipality even by nineteenth-century standards of
                urbanism. The “city” is a sprawling urban belt that sucks up
                millions of people daily from communities at a substantial
                distance from its commercial center. But New York City is made
                up of neighborhoods—that is to say, largely organic
                communities that have a certain measure of identity, whether
                they are defined by a shared cultural heritage, economic
                interests, a commonality of social views, or even an esthetic
                tradition such as in Greenwich Village. However much its
                administration as a logistical, sanitary, and commercial artifact
                requires a high degree of coordination by experts and their
                aides, it is quite open to political decentralization. Popular,
                even block, assemblies can be formed irrespective of the size
                of a city, provided its organic cultural components can be
                identified and their uniqueness fostered. Discussions about the
                “optimal” size of such components, while interesting to
                statistically minded sociologists, are politically irrelevant.
                Assemblies can be formed from populations that may consist
                of anywhere from a typical residential block to a dozen or
                more. They can be coordinated by strictly mandated delegates
                who are rotatable, recallable, and, above all, rigorously
                instructed in written form to support or oppose any issue that
                appears on the agenda of local confederal councils composed
358 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                of delegates from several neighborhood assemblies. There is
                no mystery involved in this form of organization. The historical
                evidence of their efficacy and their continual reappearance in
                times of rapid social change is considerable and persuasive.
                The Parisian sections of 1793, despite the size of Paris
                (between 700,000 and a million) and the logistical difficulties of
                the era (a time when nothing moved faster than a horse)
                functioned with a great deal of success on their own,
                coordinated by sectional delegates in the Paris Commune.
                They are notable not only for their effectiveness in dealing with
                political issues based on a face-to-face democratic structure;
                they also played a major role in provisioning the city, in
                preventing the hoarding of food, and in suppressing
                speculation, supervising the maximum for fixed prices, and
                many other complex administrative tasks. No city, in fact, is so
                large that it cannot be networked by popular assemblies for
                political purposes. The real difficulty is largely administrative:
                how to provide for the material amenities of city life, support
                their immense logistical and traffic burdens, or maintain a
                sanitary environment.
                This issue is often obscured by a serious confusion between the
                formulation of policy and its administration. For a community
                to decide in a participatory manner what course of action it
                should take in dealing with a problem does not oblige all its
                citizens to execute that policy—unless, to be sure, there are
                obvious forms of behavior that involve everyone in the
                community. The decision to build a road, for example, does not
                mean that everyone must know how to design and construct
                one. That is a job for engineers, who can offer alternative
359 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                designs—a very important political function of experts, to be
                sure, but one that the people in assembly can be free to
                decide. But to design and construct a road is a strictly
                administrative responsibility. To debate and decide the need for
                a road, including the choice of its site and the suitability of its
                design, is a political process. If the distinction between policy
                making and administration is kept clearly in mind, the role of
                popular assemblies and the people who administer their
                decisions easily unscrambles logistical problems from political
                ones, both of which are normally entangled with each other in
                discussions on decentralistic politics based on municipalities
                and assemblies. Superficially, the assembly system is a
                “referendum” form of politics: it is based on a “social contract”
                to share decision making with the population at large and
                abide by the rule of the majority in dealing with problems that
                confront a municipality, a regional confederation of
                municipalities, or, for that matter, a national entity.
                Why, then, is there reason to emphasize the assembly form as
                crucial to self-governance? Is it not enough to use the
                referendum, as the Swiss profess to do today, and resolve the
                problem of democratic procedure in a simple and seemingly
                uncomplicated way?
                A number of vital issues, involving the nature of citizenship and
                the recovery of an enhanced classical vision of politics, must be
                considered in answering these questions. The autonomous
                individual qua “voter” who forms the social unit of the
                referendum process in liberal theory is a fiction—whether in
                seemingly democratic notions at one extreme or a totalitarian
                politics of mass mobilization at the other. The individual, left to

                his or her own destiny in the name of autonomy and
                independence, becomes a seemingly asocial being whose very
                freedom is denuded of vital traits that provide the necessary
                flesh and blood for genuine individuality. Indeed, “individuality
                is impaired when each man decides to shift for himself,”
                observes Max Horkheimer in a pithy critique of personalistic
                atomism. “... as the ordinary man withdraws, from
                participation in political affairs, society tends to revert to the
                law of the jungle, which crushes all vestiges of individuality.
                The absolutely isolated individual has always been an illusion.
                The most esteemed personal qualities, such as independence,
                will to freedom, sympathy, and the sense of justice, are social
                as well as individual virtues. The fully developed individual is
                the consummation of a fully developed society. The
                emancipation of the individual is not an emancipation from
                society, but the deliverance of society from atomization, an
                atomization that may reach its peak in periods of
                collectivization and mass culture.”{94}
                One can take these observation still further. The dependent
                individual violates the justifiably high premium we place on
                autonomy, will, control of one’s destiny, and untrammeled
                assertion of ideas. In liberal society, this has led to a mythic
                “individualism” that in popular parlance is presumably
                “rugged”—that is to say, totally “independent” and “self-
                seeking.” “Rugged individualism” is as little a desideratum as
                dependence, which we normally associate with an inadequate
                formation of selfhood. The real anthropology of our species
                involves the prolonged dependence of the infant and young on
                elders, a socialization process that, until recent times,
361 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                ultimately led to a deep sense of interdependence in
                adulthood, riot a brash sense of “independence.” The notion of
                “independence,” which is often confused with
                independentthinking and autonomy of behavior, has been so
                marbled by pure bourgeois egoism that we tend to forget that
                our freedom as individuals depends heavily on community
                support systems arid solidarity. It is not by childishly
                subordinating ourselves to the community on the one hand or
                by detaching ourselves from it on the other that we become
                authentically human. What distinguishes us as social beings,
                hopefully with rational institutions, from solitary beings,
                presumably with minimal or no institutions, are our capacities
                for solidarity with each other, for mutually enhancing our self-
                developnient and creativity and attaining freedom within a
                socially creative and institutionally rich collectivity.
                “Citizenship” apart from community is as debasing to our
                political selfhood as “citizenship” within a totalitarian
                community. In both cases, We, are thrust back to the state of
                dependency that characterizes our infancy and renders us
                dangerously vulnerable to manipulation, whether by powerful
                personalities in private fife or the state and corporations in
                public life. In neither case do we attain individuality or
                community. Both, in fact, are dissolved by removing the
                communal ground on which authentic individuality depends.
                Rather, it is interdependence within an institutionally rich and
                rounded community that fleshes out the individual with the
                rationality, solidarity, sense of justice, and, ultimately, the
                reality of freedom that makes for a creative arid caring citizen.
                Paradoxical as it may seem; the authentic elements of a
362 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                rational and free society are communal ones, not individual
                bnes. Conceived in more institutional terms, the municipality is
                the basis for a free society, the irreducible ground for
                individuality as well as society. The significance, of
                the’municipality is all the greater because it constitutes the
                discursive arena in which people can intellectually and
                emotionally confront each other, indeed, experience each
                other through dialogue, body language, personal intimacy, and
                face-to-face modes of expression in the course of making
                collective decisions. I speak, here, of the all-important process
                of communizing, of the on-going intercourse of many levels of
                fife, that makes for solidarity, not only the “neighborliness,” so
                indispensable for truly organic interpersonal relationships. The
                referendum, conducted in the privacy of one’s voting booth or,
                as some “Third Wave” enthusiasts would have it, in the
                electronic isolation of one’s home privatizes democracy and
                thereby subverts it. Voting, like registering one’s “preferences”
                for soap and detergents in opinion polls, is the total
                quantification of citizenship, politics, individuality, and the very
                formation of ideas as a mutually informative process. The mere
                vote reflects a preformulated “percentage” of our perceptions
                and values, not their full expression. It is the technical debasing
                of views into mere preferences, of ideals into mere taste, of
                overall comprehension into quantification such that human
                aspirations and beliefs can be reduced to numerical digits.
                Finally, the “autonomous individual,” lacking any community
                context, support systems, and organic intercourse, is
                disengaged from the character-building process—the paideia—
                that the Athenians assigned to politics as one of its most
363 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                important educational functions. True citizenship and politics
                entail the on-going formation of personality, education, a
                growing sense of public responsibility and commitment that
                render communing and an active body politic meaningful,
                indeed that give it existential substance. It is not in the privacy
                of the school, any more than in the privacy of the voting booth,
                that these vital personal and political attributes are formed.
                They require the existence of a public presence, embodied by
                vocal and thinking individuals, a responsive and discursive
                public sphere, to achieve reality. “Patriotism,” as the origin of
                the word indicates, is the nation-state’s conception of the
                citizen as a child, the obedient creature of the nation conceived
                as a paterfamilias or stern father, who orchestrates belief and
                commands devotion. To the extent that we are the “sons” and
                “daughters” of a “fatherland,” we place ourselves in a
                mindless, indeed infantile, relationship to the state.
                Loyalty, by contrast, implies a sense of commitment to a
                human community that is guided by knowledge, training,
                experience, and a sense of caring—in short, by a political
                education created in the course of political participation, not by
                institutional obedience. The Greek term, philia, ordinarily
                translated as “friendship,” but which I prefer to call “solidarity,”
                is the ultimate result of the educational and self-formative
                process that paideia was meant to achieve. In the absence of a
                humanly scaled, comprehensible, and institutionally accessible
                municipality, this all-important function of politics and its
                embodiment in citizenship is simply impossible to achieve.
                Indeed, it ceases to even enter into contemporary notions of
                “politics” and “citizenship.” Accordingly, we begin to gauge
364 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                “political involvement” by the “percentage” of “voters” who
                “participate” in the “political process”—a degradation of words
                that totally denatures their authentic meaning and eviscerates
                their ethical content. If the class-oriented politics in the past
                was ultimately a civic politics, individual politics today is
                ultimately a municipal politics. In both cases, I use the term
                “politics” to denote not only the direct self-management of the
                polis or community by its citizens but the educational process
                of forging a self that is capable of the self-management of the
                municipality.
                There are many questions that arise when one tries to develop
                a new municipal agenda today, and many possibilities, I may
                add, that open the way to a new, richly imaginative politics as
                well as a traditional conception of citizenship as participatory,
                educative, and community oriented.
                In an era of growing power in nation-states and corporations,
                when administration, property ownership, production,
                bureaucracies, and the flow of capital as well as power are
                notoriously centralized, how can we invoke a localist,
                municipally oriented society without seeming to be starry-eyed
                visionaries? Is this municipalist, decentralist, and participatory
                vision of self-governance and selfhood utterly incompatible
                with the overwhelming trend toward public massification?
                Does the notion of clearly definable, humanly scaled
                communities not seem to be redolent of atavistic, backward-
                looking parochial ideas of a premodern world, indeed of the
                “folk community” (Volksgemeinschaft) advocated by German
                Nazism? Do its advocates, specifically this writer, wish to undo
                the technological gains achieved by the several industrial
365 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                revolutions that followed the first one, two centuries ago? Can
                a “modern society” be governed any longer by local groups in
                an era when centralized power is presumably “here to stay”?
                To these largely theoretical questions, I can add a host of very
                practical ones. How will politically localized citizens’ assemblies
                be coordinated to deal with the practical questions of such
                simple facts as rail transportation, road maintenance, the
                supply of resources and foodstuffs, from distant or select
                regions? How can we readapt an economy based on the
                business ethic (including its plebeian counterpart, the “work
                ethic”) to one that is guided by an ethics of self-fulfillment and
                self-realization in productive activity? How can we change
                present-day instruments of government such as national
                constitutions and city charters to reflect a system of self-
                governance based on municipal autonomy? How can we
                restructure a profit-oriented market economy, reinforced by a
                centralists technology, into a humanly oriented moral
                economy, reinforced by an alternative decentralis,tic
                technology? Finally, how can all of these visions be brought into
                accord with an ecological society that seeks a harmonious,
                indeed participatory, relationship with the natural world, free of
                social hierarchy,’ class and gender domination, and cultural
                homogeneity?
                This work, let me emphasize, is not a handbook for social
                recipes that meet the taste of every palate. To make it so—and
                more than enough books exist that profess to do so is to
                subvert the very meaning of the libertarian municipal project it
                seeks to advance. In the last analysis, these pages are an effort
                to apply the principles of social ecology to ah interpretation of
366 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the present and to a past that really is always with us, informed
                by a deep concern for the contours of a liberatory and
                ecological future society. To provide a detailed institutional and
                economic map of what such a future society should or “must”
                look like is to use a seemingly ecological interpretation of the
                future against one of the most fundamental precepts of social
                ecology: unity in diversity. The ecological belief that every
                human community, indeed every individual—not to speak of
                every natural ecocommunity is deliciously unique permeates
                this book from its opening lines to those that close it. Detailed
                recipes that profess to resolve every problem that every
                decentralized human community will face—and should
                creatively face, given its uniqueness and specificity—is to cut
                across the grain of all the ecological ideas that give coherence
                to this book. It is to assume precisely what social ecology
                emphatically denies: namely, that all our social problems are
                so universal, indeed so “global” (to use the pop vernacular of
                environmentalism today), that we have no need to “act
                locally.” Localism, taken seriously, implies a sensitivity to
                speciality, particularity, and the uniqueness of place, indeed a
                sense of place or topos that involves deep respect (indeed
                “loyalty,” if I may use a term that I would like to offset against
                “patriotism”) to the areas in which we live and that are given to
                us in great part by the natural world itself.
                Once this is emphasized, there are still broad answers that can
                be advanced to the questions I have raised, particularly to
                those that have a highly polemical character. In trying to
                answer these questions, I presuppose a thorough
                understanding of the essential principles raised in this book:
367 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                not only is politics to be sharply distinguished from statecraft,
                but policy making is to be distinguished from administration;
                not only is “rugged individualism” to be’ distinguished from
                authentic individuality, but the notion of the isolated individual
                is to be distinguished from the rounded individual who is rooted
                in a rounded community; not only is independence to be
                distinguished from dependence, but authentic independence
                is indistinguishable from interdependence.
                These caveats cannot be restated often enough. The notion
                that decentralized communities are premodern, indeed
                antimodern, “atavisms” reflects an almost willful failure to
                recognize that an organic community is not necessarily an
                “Organism” in which the individual parts are subordinated to
                the collective whole. That such highly bourgeois prejudices
                should be echoed by socialists and liberals alike reflects a very
                clouded view of individualism that confuses individuality with
                egoism. Our market society, riddled by its preoccupation with
                objects called “commodities” and its gross monetization of all
                aspects of life, has never produced authentic individuality,
                unless one chooses to mistake buccaneering industrial and
                commercial predators for authentic personalities. While any
                attempt to fashion an ecological society out of free,
                autonomous, and organic communities—organic no less in
                their respect for land, flora, and fauna than in their attempts to
                foster human solidarity and social support systems—always
                risks the possibility of becoming a “folk community” in the
                parochial, even fascistic, sense of the term, they also open the
                possibility of producing a highly fecund terrain for promoting
                the development of deeply individuated and richly creative

                personalities. Ironically, Nazism, for all its bombast about the
                desirability of a German Volksgemeinschaft, opportunistically
                surrendered the utopian content of this popular yearning for a
                sense of place and community to a leadership principle” that
                totally subordinated localism to centralism, community to
                nationalism, technical conservatism to industrial innovation,
                particularly in the design of weapons and methods of political
                surveillance. The academic frippery that clothes the hard
                realities of Nazism with myths that it patently discarded is
                almost textbook evidence of the yawning separation of
                campus scholasticism from the real world beyond its confines.
                There is nothing that is either “backward looking” or “forward
                looking” about humanity’s effort to find community together
                with individuality. The impulse to achieve these
                complementary aims—especially in times like our own, when
                both of them are faced with sweeping disintegration—is an
                abiding human goal that has been expressed as much in
                religion as in secular radicalism, in utopian experiments as in
                city neighborhoods, in self-enclosed ethnic groups as in
                expansive cosmopolitan cities. Nothing but a feeling for truth
                and its custody by the human mind has ever kept any notion of
                community and individuality from tipping over into spiteful
                parochialism at one extreme or fragmented atomism at the
                other.
                The result is that consciousness—not pat formulas—ultimately
                determine whether humanity will achieve a rich sense of
                collectivity without sacrificing a rich sense of individuality. A
                creative politics without a creative citizenry is as unattainable
                as a creative citizenry without a creative politics. The guarded

                mind, whether we call it “class consciousness” or “social
                consciousness,” is the sole guarantor of a social and personal
                life that will be guided by the thin line of truth. The tendency of
                radicals and liberals who emphasize abstractions such as
                “class” and “social” over the more existential need for
                consciousness is the true “betrayal of the intellectuals” that
                was mourned in earlier times. Any expectation that a formula,
                even a salad of democratic institutions, will in itself rescue us
                from any impulses that yield totalitarianism, whether in its
                “futuristic” or atavistic forms, is sheer myth. The guarded
                mind, informed by knowledge and a humane sense of
                solidarity, is all that we possess as a fortress against
                authoritarian “reversion” at one extreme and authoritarian
                “progress” at the other. Indeed the “dark past” has become
                the counterpart of the “dark future” in an age that seeks form
                rather than content to guide us through its modern dilemmas
                and panaceas.
                Paradoxical as it seems and dialectically irascible as it may be,
                the conflict—more precisely, the tension—that exists between
                a localistic vision and a nationalistic reality is the most
                important basis for a new politics that we can redeem from the
                present crisis for which “urbanization” is a metaphor. The
                growing power and centralization of the state and its corporate
                underpinnings are not necessarily the harbingers of victory
                over the municipality. It may well be that they are the
                harbingers of a deepening social crisis that may give new
                vitality to municipal politics and alter the very shape of politics
                itself. One does not have to be a visionary (apparently, a
                pejorative term, these days) to see that every human impulse

                is now being affronted by the disempowerment of ordinary
                people in everyday life. Locked increasingly into an inward
                world in which society and collectivity are excluded, transclass
                desires seem to be slowly welling up in countless individuals
                who are seeking the open air of a meaningful public life, not to
                speak of a more creative personal one. Like the tensions that
                gathered together in western society during the four centuries
                directly preceding the emergence of industrial capitalism, we
                are witnessing a new period of transition with deep-seated
                tensions that are emerging in our own era.
                Localism, in fact, has never been so much in the air as it is
                today—all the more because centralism and corporatism have
                never seemed more overwhelming than they are today. The
                state and the corporations have “ghettoized” the western
                world, particularly North America, to such a suffocating extent
                that public sentiment threatens to overflow the barriers they
                have created and perhaps in time to burst them. Demands for
                local control and attempts to redefine democracy along ever-
                expansive lines are yielding a multitude of interest groups and
                citizen-initiative committees. Demands for local control and
                redefinitions of democracy that are normally preceded by such
                adjectives as “grass-roots” are yielding a multitude of various
                local associations, “alliances,” and block committees that
                stress local control as well as economic justice. “Socialist”
                mayors have been elected in several American communities
                for the first time since the 1930s. The town meeting, initially a
                New England institution, is becoming a byword in regions of
                the United States that have no shared tradition with the,
                American Northeast. Community and action groups have
371 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                invaded local politics, a terrain that was once the exclusive
                preserve of political parties, on a scale that has significantly
                altered the entire landscape of municipal policy making.
                That these grass-roots organizations are often ephemeral or
                co-optable does not alter the fact that the underlying ferment
                at the base of American society is vitalized precisely by the fact
                that the centralized state has made the most elementary
                hmnan demands for self-expression and self-empowerment
                highly problematical, a fact that may well change the entire
                texture of American politics. The tension between vision and
                reality is no less a creative force than it was in times past,
                particularly in periods of social and economic transition.
                Put bluntly, a latent “dual power” seems to be emerging today
                in which, the local base of society is beginning to challenge the
                authority of its seemingly invulnerable state and corporate
                apex. It. is precisely the inaccessibility of this apex to grass-
                roots influence that threatens to disintegrate the very
                architecture of power as such. The fact that public control over
                public fife has never seemed more visionary is precisely what
                makes the demands for such control particularly compelling,
                just as intractable resistance by power tends to foster
                opposition rather than mute it. Almost intuitively, people seem
                to be molding their own institutions for expression in the public
                realm with an obstinacy that may well render localist politics an
                irrepressible force. The very ephemeral nature of many such
                grass-roots institutions and organizations is evidence less of
                failure than of persistence. I am no longer talking of the
                explosive episodes that marked the’ uprisings of the 1960s,
                such as those in black ghettos or antiwar street actions. Grass-

                roots politics, specifically popular municipal politics, is
                becoming an integral part of American politics as a whole, one
                that has yet to find a coherent voice and sense of direction. But
                the fact is that it is here to stay and has worked its way,
                however confusedly, into the real world of the political
                landscape.
                In trying to formulate a municipal agenda for our time, the real
                question is how will this often formless political energy be
                institutionalized? What structures will it create that will turn it
                into a powerful force to countervail the growing power of the
                state and a centralized corporate economy? What kind of
                political culture can it create that will play a transformative role
                in an era of urban and governmental gigantism? And what kind
                of political economy can it fashion that will avoid the pitfalls of
                a property-oriented market economy on the one hand and a
                totalitarian nationalized economy on the other?
                I do not profess to have answers to these questions that apply’
                to all municipalities—nor, giyen their variety, would it be
                anything but presumptuous to provide them. But certain basic
                coordinates can be formulated that are integrally wedded to
                any conception of municipal freedom, certainly of a kind that is
                meant to recover a participatory idea of politics and a classical
                idea of citizenship.
                The most important of these coordinates is the’revival of the
                citizens’ assembly, be it in the form of town meetings
                inhumanly scaled communities or neighborhood assemblies in
                large, even metropolitan urban entities. Such assemblies are
                not merely a historical legacy that belong to the archaeology of
                urbanism. A large portion of this book would be completely
373 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                meaningless if the reader failed to see that in nearly all periods
                of social upheaval people have turned to assembly forms as a
                way of entering the doors of history and taking control of their
                destiny, If these assemblies seem remote, even archaic, when
                we stray back to ancient Mesopotamia and classical Greece,
                they become very close to our fives when we see them in
                revolutionary America and France, and even seem to make
                direct contact with us when we find them in the Paris
                Commune of 1871 and the post-World War II era. Apparently,
                we have something at work here that has a more abiding
                reality than the distant “age of cities,” which has since been
                supplanted by the “age of nation-states.” They seem to be
                speaking to something in the human spirit that demands
                systems of governance based on face-to-face! decision
                making, a personafistic as well as a participatory politics. It is
                as though the need for community and communing were not
                simply a social desideratum but an ethical one that emanates
                from the human spirit itself.
                The second of these major coordinates is the need fpr the
                assemblies to “speak” to each other, literally, to confederate.
                Leagues of towns and cities, as I have argued earlier, have
                always surfaced, however, temporarily, as centripetal forms of
                municipal association. Calls for the creation of nationlike
                entities structured around confederations of municipalities go
                back to Greek times and range over history up to the Paris
                Commune, indeed into very recent times when the centralized
                nation-state threatens to become an overbearing force in local
                affairs. The concept of confederation is as old as the fact of
                municipal life itself. Initially more defensive than creative in
374 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                character, it has provided us with extraordinary, indeed
                inspiring, examples of freedom within localities and in the
                relationships between localities. Even as a word,
                “confederation” implies a commitment to liberatory ways of
                associating that “nationalism,” with its jingoistic and
                totalitarian nuances has rarely possessed. It is notable that the
                first American constitution was deliberately called “the Articles
                of Confederation,” which, for all its limitations, was cynically
                and secretively replaced by a so-called “federal” Constitution,
                one that Hamilton and his supporters foisted on the American
                people as the next best alternative to a constitutional
                monarchy.
                The third of the major coordinates for guiding us toward a
                municipal democracy is the need to create politics as a school
                for genuine citizenship. Ultimately, there is no civic
                “curriculum,” as it were, that can be a substitute for a living
                and creative political realm. But what we must clearly do in an
                era of commodification, rivalry, anomie, and egoism is
                formulate and consciously inculcate the values of humanism,
                cooperation, community, and public service in the everyday
                practice of civic fife, not only in our schools, religious
                institutions, and local societies. Grass-roots citizenship must go
                hand in hand with grass-roots politics. The Athenian polis, for
                all its many shortcomings, offers us remarkable examples of
                how its high sense of citizenship was reinforced not only by
                systematic education, but by the development of an etiquette
                of civic behavior and an artistic culture that adorned its ideals
                of civic service with the realities of civic practice. Deference to
                opponents in debates, the use of language to achieve
375 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                consensus, on-going public discussion in the agora in which
                even the most prominent of the polis’s figures were expected
                to debate public issues with the least known, the use of wealth
                not only to meet personal needs but to adorn the polis itself
                (thus placing a high premium on the disaccumulation rather
                than the accumulation of wealth), a multitude of public
                festivals, dramas, and satires largely centered on civic affairs
                and the need to foster civic solidarity—all of these and many
                other aspects of Athens’s political culture created the civic
                loyalty and responsibility that made for actively involved
                citizens with a deep sense of civic mission.
                The development of citizenship, in effect, must become an art,
                not merely an education—and creative art in the esthetic
                sense that appeals to the deeply human desire for self-
                expression in a meaningful spiritual community. It must be a
                personal art in which every citizen is fully aware of the fact that
                his or her community entrusts its destiny to his or her moral
                probity, loyalty, and rationality. The very essence of state
                power and statecraft today is that the “citizen” is an
                incompetent being, indeed infantile and normally
                untrustworthy, while the state is a disciplinary institution, not
                an avenue of self-expression. Even liberal theory, not to speak
                of Christian theology, justifies the existence of the state as a
                whip to keep its “naturally” irascible subjects in hand and
                correct their inherent “incompetence” by entrusting public
                affairs to professional politicians and bureaucratic institutions.
                For citizens to directly intervene in public affairs beyond
                obediently voting annually for preselected candidates and
                paying their taxes with a reasonable modicum of honesty has
376 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                been regarded as a safety valve for public dissatisfaction at
                best and “anarchy” at worst.
                The municipalist conception of citizenship assumes precisely
                the opposite. Every citizen is regarded as competent to
                participate directly in the “affairs of state,” indeed what is
                more important, encouraged to do so. Every means is
                provided, whether esthetic or institutional, to foster
                participation in full and see it as an educative and ethical
                process that turns the citizen’s latent competence into an
                actual reality. Social and political fife are consciously
                orchestrated to foster a profound sensitivity, indeed a real
                sense of caring for the adjudication of differences without
                denying the need for vigorous dispute when it is needed. Public
                service is seen as a uniquely human attribute, not a “gift” that
                a citizen confers on the community or an onerous task that he
                or she must fulfill. Cooperation and civic responsibility are seen
                as expressions of care, concern, and sociability, not as
                ordinances that the citizen is expected to honor in the breach
                and evade where he can do so.
                Put bluntly and clearly, the municipality is seen as a theater in
                which life in its most meaningful public form is the plot, a
                political drama whose grandeur imparts nobility and grandeur
                to the citizenry that forms the cast. By contrast, our modern
                cities have become in large part agglomerations of bedroom
                apartments in which men and women spiritually wither away
                and their personalities are trivialized by the petty concerns of
                entertainment, consumption, and small talk.
                The last and perhaps the most intractable of our coordinates is
                economic. Today, economic issues tend to center around “who
377 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                owns what,” “who owns more than whom,” and, above all, how
                disparities in wealth are to be reconciled with a sense of civic
                commonality. Nearly all municipalities have been fragmented
                by differences in economic status, pitting poor, middle, and
                wealthy classes against each other often to the ruin of
                municipal freedom itself as the bloody history of Italy’s
                medieval and Renaissance cities so clearly demonstrates.
                These problems have not disappeared in recent times. Indeed
                in many cases they are as severe as they have ever been. But
                what is unique about our own time—a fact so little understood
                by many liberals and radicals in North America and Europe—is
                that entirely new transclass issues have begun to emerge that
                concern environment, growth, transportation, cultural
                degradation, and the quality of urban life generally—issues
                that have been produced by urbanization, not by citification.
                Cutting across conflicting class interests are such transclass
                issues as the massive dangers of thermonuclear war, growing
                state authoritarianism, and, ultimately, global ecological
                breakdown. To an extent unparalleled in American history, an
                enormous variety of citizens’ groups have brought people of all
                class backgrounds into common projects around problems,
                often very local in character, that concern the destiny and
                welfare of their community as a whole.
                Issues such as the siting of nuclear reactors or nuclear waste
                dumps, the dangers of acid rain, and the presence of toxic
                dumps, to cite only a few of the many problems that beleaguer
                innumerable American municipalities, have united an
                astdnishing variety of people into movements with shared
                concerns that render a ritualistic “class analysis” of their

                motives utterly irrelevant. No less remarkable in crossing
                traditional class, ethnic, and economic barriers is the
                emergence of feminism, a movement that sees the gender
                oppression that afflicts wealthy women, no less than poor, a
                matter of dignity and self-respect. Carried still further, the
                absorption of small communities by larger ones, of cities by
                urban belts, and urban belts by “standard metropolitan
                statistical areas” has given rise to militant demands for
                communal integrity and self-government, an issue that
                surmounts strictly class and economic interests. The literature
                on the emergence of these trans-class movements, once so
                secondary’ to internecine struggles within the cities of earlier
                times, is so immense that to merely list the sources would
                require a sizable volume.
                I have given this brief overview of an emerging general social
                interest over old particularistic interests to demonstrate that a
                new politics is already coming into being—indeed one that is
                not only restructuring the political landscape on a municipal
                level but the economic landscape as well. The old debates
                between “private property” and “nationalized property,”
                between “individual ownership” and “public ownership,” are
                becoming threadbare. Not that these different kinds of
                ownership and the forms of exploitation they imply have
                disappeared; rather, they are being increase ingly
                overshadowed by new realities and concerns. “Private
                property?’’ in the traditional sense of the term, with its case for
                perpetuating the citizen as an economically self-sufficient and
                politically self-empowered individual, is fading away. It is
                disappearing not because “creeping socialism” is devouring

                the “free entrepreneur” but because “creeping corporatism” is
                devouring everyone—ironically, in the name of “free
                enterprise,” The economy of North America, like that of Europe
                and even Third World countries, is becoming either
                “corporatized” or “nationalized”—or to use the one term that
                embraces both, “bureaucratized.” The Greek ideal of the
                politically sovereign citizen who can make a rational judgment
                in public affairs because he is free from material need or
                clientage has been reduced to a mockery. The oligarchic
                character of economic life, whether in the “western bloc” of the
                “eastern,” threatens democracy such as it is—not only on a
                national level but also on a municipal level, where it still
                preserves a certain degree of intimacy and leeway.
                We come here to a breakthrough approach to a municipalist
                economics that innovatively dissolves the mystical aura
                surrounding corporatized property and nationalized property,
                indeed workplace elitism and “workplace democracy.” I refer to
                the municipalization of property, not its corporatization or its
                nationalization. As for the workplace, I refer to more than
                “economic democracy” or “economic collectivization.” Rather,
                I refer to the substitution of public democracy for both of these
                traditional images of productive management and operations.
                Significantly, “economic democracy” in the workplace is no
                longer incompatible with corporatized or nationalized
                economy. Quite to the contrary: the effective use of “workers’
                participation” in production, even the outright handing over of
                industrial operations to the workers who perform them, has
                become another form of time-studied, assembly-line
                rationalization, the systematic exploitation of labor by bringing
380 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                labor itself into complicity with its own exploitation.
                Many workers, in fact, would like to get away from their
                factories and find more creative types of work, not simply
                “participate” in their own misery. What “economic democracy”
                meant in its profoundest sense was free, “democratic” access
                to the means of life, the guarantee of freedom from material
                want, not simply the involvement of workers with onerous
                productive activities that we would do better to turn over to
                machines. It is a blatant bourgeois trick, in which many radicals
                unknowingly participate, that “economic democracy” has been
                reinterpreted to mean “employee ownership” or that
                “workplace democracy” has come to mean workers’
                “participation” in industrial management rather than freedom
                from the tyranny of the factory, rationalized labor, and
                “planned production.”
                A municipal politics, based on libertarian principles, scores a
                significant advance over all of these conceptions by calling for
                the municipalization of the economy—and its management by
                the community as part of a politics of self-management.
                Syndicalist demands for the “collectivization” of industry and
                “workers’ control” of individual industrial units are based on
                contractual relationships between all “collectivized”
                enterprises, thereby reprivatizing the economy and opening it
                to traditional forms of private property—whether collectively
                owned or not, while libertarian municipalism politicizes the
                economy and dissolves it into the civic domain. Neither factory
                nor land becomes a separate or potentially competitive unit
                within a seemingly communal collective. Nor do workers,
                farmers, technicians, engineers, professionals, and the like
381 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                perpetuate their vocational identities as separate interests that
                exist apart from the citizen body in face-to-face assemblies.
                “Property” is integrated into the municipality as a material
                constituent of its free institutional framework, indeed as part of
                a larger whole that is controlled by the citizen body in
                assembly as citizens—not as “workers,” “farmers,”
                “professionals,” or any other vocationally oriented special-
                interest groups.
                What is equally important, the famous “contradiction” or
                “antagonism” between town and country, so crucial in social
                theory and history, is transcended by the “township,” the
                traditional New England jurisdiction, in which an urban entity is
                the nucleus of its agricultural and village environs—not a
                domineering urban entity that stands opposed to them. A
                township, in effect, is a small region within still larger ones,
                such as the county and the bioregion.
                So conceived, the municipalization of the economy should be
                distinguished not only from “corporatization” but also from
                seemingly more “radical” demands such as “nationalization”
                and “collectivization.” Nationalization of the economy
                invariably has led to bureaucratic and top-down economic
                control; collectivization, in turn, could easily lead to the
                emergence of a privatized economy in a collectivized form with
                the perpetuation of class or caste identities. By contrast,
                municipalization brings the economy as a whole into the orbit
                of the public sphere, where economic policy can be formulated
                by the entire community—notably its citizens in face-to-face
                relationships working to achieve a general interest that
                surmounts separate, vocationally defined specific interests.

                The economy ceases to be merely an economy in the strict
                sense of the term, composed of capitalistic, “worker-
                controlled” enterprises. It becomes a truly political economy
                (to use a very traditional terminology in a very untraditional
                sense): the economy of the polis or the municipality. The
                municipality, more precisely, the citizen body in face-to-face
                assembly, absorbs the economy into its public business,
                divesting it of a separate identity that can become privatized
                into a self-serving enterprise.
                What can prevent the municipality, now reinforced by its own
                economic apparatus, from becoming a parochial city-state of
                the kind that appeared in the late Middle Ages? Once again I
                would like to Emphasize that anyone who is looking for
                guaranteed solutions to the problems raised here will not find
                them in the form of blissfully insulated institutions that take on
                a life of their own apart from the role of consciousness and
                ethics in human affairs. But if we are looking for
                countertendencies rather than “guarantees,” there is an
                answer that can be given. The most important single factor
                that gave rise to the late medieval city-state was its
                stratification from within—not only as a result of differences in
                wealth, but also in status positions, partly originating in family
                origins, partly, too, in vocational differences. Indeed, to the
                extent that the city lost its sense of collective unity arid divided
                its affairs into private and public business, public life itself
                became segmented into the “blue nails” or plebeians who.
                dyed cloth in cities such as Florerice and the’ more arrogant
                strata of artisans who produced quality goods. Wealth, too,
                factored heavily in a privatized economy where material
383 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                differences could expand and foster a variety of hierarchical
                differences.
                The municipalization of the economy not only absorbs the
                vocational differences that could militate, against a publically
                controlled economy; it also absorbs the material means of life
                into ‘ communal forms of distribution. “From each according to
                his ability and to each according to his needs” is now
                institutionalized as part of the public sphere. This traditional
                maxim, which is meant to assure that people will have, access
                to the means of life irrespective of the work they are capable of
                performing, ceases to be merely a precarious credo: it
                becomes a practice, a way of functioning politically—one that
                is structurally built into the community as a way of existing as a
                political entity.
                Happily, no community can hope to achieve economic
                autarchy, nor should it try to do so unless it wishes to become
                self-enclosed and parochial. Interdependence between
                communities is no less important than interdependence
                between individuals. Divested of the cultural crossfertilization
                that is often a product of economic intercourse, the
                municipality tends to shrink into itself and disappear into its
                own civic privatism, Shared needs and resources imply the
                existence of sharing and, with sharing, communication,
                rejuvenation by new ideas, a wider social horizon that yields a
                wider sensibility to new experiences. The recent emphasis in
                environmental theory on “self-sufficiency,” if it does not mean
                a greater degree of prudence in dealing with material
                resources, is regressive. Localism should never be interpreted
                to mean parochialism nor should decentralism ever be
384 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                interpreted to mean that smallness is a virtue in itself. Small is
                not necessarily “beautiful.” The concept of human scale, by far
                the more preferable expression for a truly ecological
                community, is built around the ability of people to completely
                grasp their political environment, not to parochially bury
                themselves in it to the exclusion of cultural stimuli from outside
                their community’s boundaries.
                , Given these coordinates, it is possible to envision anew
                political culture with a new revival of citizenship, popular civic
                institutions, a new kind of economy, and a countervailing dual
                power, confederally networked, that could arrest and hopefully
                reverse the growing centralization of the state and corporate
                enterprises. Moreover, it is also possible to envision an
                eminently practical point of departure for going beyond the
                town and city as we have known them up to now and
                developing future forms of habitation as genuine
                ecocommunities—human ecocommuniti.es, in this case, that
                seek to achieve a new harmonization between people and
                between humanity and the natural world. I have emphasized
                the word “practical” because it is now clear that any attempt to
                tailor a human community to a natural “ecosystem” in which it
                is located cuts completely against the grain of centralized
                power, be it state or corporate. Centralized power invariably
                reproduces itself in centralized forms at all levels of social,
                political, arid economic life. It is not only “big”; it thinks big.
                Indeed, this way of being and thinking is a condition for its
                survival, not only its growth.
                Not surprisingly, the ecotechnologies that came very much
                into vogue during the 1970s, such as solar, wind, and methane
385 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                power, later to be explored and toyed with by the national
                governments of the world, literally collapsed under their own
                weight. Governments almost invariably designed them with
                technical gigantism in mind. One thinks here of the huge tidal
                dams that were constructed in France, the plans for immense
                solar installations that were designed in American universities,
                the oversized windmills that were reared by federal agencies,
                some of which were almost calculated to fail and few of which
                could have significantly affected local life. Organic agriculture,
                while given a ritualistic nod of approval and a modicum of
                funding by state agencies, was virtually elbowed out by the
                more earnest attention that was given to conventional
                agribusiness and industrial techniques for cultivating food.
                Ecotechnologies of this kind have been earnestly used almost
                entirely by individuals and local communities. To the extent
                that solar and wind power are used today, it is mainly because
                ecologically concerned citizens and their neighbors have
                introduced them as part of their home dwellings, not because
                their use has been taken very seriously as part of a national
                agenda. To induce the nation-state and corporations to think
                about energy, designers are obliged to speak about the
                feasibility of nuclear power plants, immense, ecologically
                destructive hydroelectric dams, and large fossil fuel
                installations. The ideological terrain of the nation-state is
                primarily continental, not local, just as the ideological terrain of
                the medical profession is primarily disease, not health. The
                very notion of sensitively tailoring technology to fit the natural
                ecocommunity in which people five is possible to a serious
                extent only within a locally oriented political community where

                the uniqueness of the natural environment can be fully
                experienced in all its intimacy.
                Moreover, it is the only level in which natural cycles can be
                respectfully lived out—not as the mere rhetoric of
                “environmentally”-oriented politicians but as the everyday
                experience of householders who are able to return domestic
                wastes to their organic gardens and recycle the American
                consumers’ kitchen-middens of discardable trash for more
                rational ends. Nation-states are instruments for the domination
                of other nation-states and for the domination of the natural
                world. If we are to remove this fixation on domination that first
                appeared with the emergence of hierarchy, particularly with
                the domination of women by men, we are in dire need of local
                communities, technologies, and a political culture that will
                bring people into a face-to-face relationship with their natural
                habitat and the communities around them. In such
                communities, technology will then hopefully cease to be a
                force for “dominating nature” as the received wisdom of our
                era would have it. Indeed, like the political culture that is meant
                to bring citizens into a participatory relationship with each
                other, we can expect that such ecologically oriented
                municipalities will see themselves as integral parts of the
                natural world and technology as a way of fostering natural
                fecundity rather than exploiting or vitiating it.
                We five today in a world that casts relationships oppositionally,
                not integratively. Mind is set against body, thought against
                materiality, individual against community, urban belts against
                towns, towns against country—and humanity as a whole
                against a natural world that is seen as “stingy,” “cruel,” and
387 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                “intractable,” a world that has to be conquered by science and
                technology before society can hope to be free. Nation-states
                and corporate enterprises invoke large-scale technology
                presumably to achieve this very end. They not only
                presuppose the basic divisions that have separated humanity
                from nature but exacerbate them as justification for the
                rationalization and exploitation of human labor. Urbanization is
                the physical expression of this divisive reality at one of its most
                fundamental levels: the place where people live, produce
                goods, and consume them, indeed the most immediate arena
                in which they enter into contact with each other apart from
                their places of work. Urbanization not only removes these
                relationships and activities from the individual’s control; it
                undermines, simplifies, and literally fossilizes them such that
                people and their habitats become entirely inorganic, indeed
                synthetic objects that can be easily manipulated and
                ultimately divested of all their living attributes.
                To restructure our institutions into richly articulated forms, to
                reorganize our relationships into creative forms of human
                solidarity, to reempower our communities and cities so that
                they can effectively counteract state and corporate power—
                indeed replace the nation-state with politically confederated
                and economically vital municipalities—and to create a new,
                nonhierarchical and participatory relationship between
                humanity and nature by means of a sensibility and technics
                that fosters a participatory form of complementarity rather
                than atomistic antagonisms—all, taken together as one
                coherent ensemble, constitute not only a desideratum of major
                proportions but anew ethical calling. The incarnation of this

                human project is the immediate, indeed unmediated,
                community that enters so profoundly into the fashioning of our
                humanity. This is the community in which we genuinely
                encounter each other, the public world that is only a bare step
                above our private world, in short, our towns, neighborhoods,
                and municipalities. How we begin the great project of
                refashioning this, public world and articulating it institutionally,
                economically, eonfederally, and technically will determine
                whether we exist as public beings, interactively as discursive
                and rational human beings, or whether we disappear in the
                huge maw of modern-day urbanization.
                It is always tempting—and perhaps eminently human—to
                break away from abstractions about municipalism arid
                personalize them in the hard realities of one’s own
                experiences. I have hesitated to fix my general coriclusions in
                speculative details. Utopias have a bad way of becoming fixed
                blueprints—after which they degenerate into inflexible
                dogmas. But perhaps it would not be amiss if I take the liberty
                of fleshing out some of my speculations with my lived
                experience, notably in the urban area with which I am most fa
                mil iar at the present time—Burlington, Vermont—and in the
                “bioregion” I know best, the excitingly libertarian state of
                Vermont. Reduced to basics, it is in these two areas that my
                speculations may take on some concrete meaning that has
                relevance to problems that face many urban dwellers today.
                Vermont, the fourteenth state to enter the original union of
                thirteen American colonies,‘was a free republic between 1777
                and 1791, and it still retains many of the libertarian traditions,
                of that revolutionary era. This historical legacy may make it

                somewhat exceptional, but it does not make the area any less
                real. That Vermont exists is a fact that is existentially more real
                than many myths that have moved human beings over the
                ages to greater acts of nobility than reality itself. One thinks,
                here, of the Judeo-Christian tradition that kept the Jews intact
                for two thousand years of incredible persecution and also sent
                other millions—their Christian brethren—into bloody spiritual
                conflicts over the same span of time. This is true, too, for
                Moslems and men and women of other faiths. Here, I Would
                like to, repeat the caveat that what humans think of
                themselves, however fancifully, often determines their
                behavior more decisively than their “objective” material
                interests—many social thinkers, including Marx, to the contrary
                notwithstanding.
                So it is with Vermont, or, for that matter, America and the rest
                of the world. If history would have it otherwise and people
                acted immediately, even ultimately, according to their
                “objective” or material interests, this world would long have
                been the best of all possible worlds—or maybe the worst,
                depending very much on what one regards as objective. Iriany
                case, Vermont thinks of itself as what America “used to be”
                rather than what it is today and often acts upon this self-
                conception as though it were true. Generally, this means that
                the state is remarkably unencumbered by the extravagant
                amount of statecraft that afflicts so many other American
                states. It has a citizens’ legislature in which no elected official
                apart from the executive branch (the governor, a modest
                bureaucracy, the police, and judiciary) receives a livable, full-
                time salary for public service and must answer for his or her
390 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                public service every two years in contrast to the four-year
                terms that prevail in most of the United States. The
                accessibility of nearly all public officials, including the state’s
                governor, to the public has few equals in most Euro-American
                republics; face-to-face discussion, inquiries, and debates turn
                politics into a very intimate affair; Vermonters would not have
                it otherwise. They take for granted a wide array of political
                rights that would be regarded as deferential privileges in
                almost any sizable political jurisdiction.
                Vermont is also town-meeting country—indeed vigorous town-
                meeting country notwithstanding the ritualistic articles that
                appear annually in The New York Times and Wall Street Journal
                that lament the decline of these remarkable democratic
                institutions. Having attended many town meetings over the
                past fifteen years, I can personally attest to their vitality. In fact,
                I have seen a remarkable resurgence of town meetirig
                democracy in Vermont, partly because the citizenry has begun
                to treasure the power this institution accords them in a period
                of growing centralism elsewhere; partly, too, because town
                meetings have intervened into international affairs such as the
                nuclear-breeze issue and have given these Yankee Americans
                an enhanced sense of “grass-roots” control over seemingly
                historic public affairs. This control, to be sure, is strictly moral; it
                does not carry the ponderous weight of law. But it is’
                characteristically American that a republican national
                constitution, permeated by a countervailing revolutionary
                democratic tradition, has given rise to a state of mind that
                imparts a higher authority to a grass-roots moral movement
                than a legislative mandate. In this case, American politics can
391 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                be credited with being more vulnerable to moral movements
                than its critics fully realize, Vermont’s town meetings, like those
                of its New England neighbors, are often more effective
                nationally than they truly realize, precisely because they are
                hallowed by moral traditions that give America its national
                identity. It is the enormous weight of their moral voice, their
                invocation of an ethically charged past that ha un ts the
                present with its ambience of virtue and freedom, that gives
                them enormous potential power for social change.
                This past affects the so-called “cities” of Vermont, not only its
                small towns and villages. Despite the fact that Vermont’s few
                sizable towns—particularly Burlington, its largest, with a
                population of 37,000—are structured around a mayoralty
                system with a typical board of aldermen, election day is still
                called “town-meeting day.” The possibility of restructuring
                Burlington’s “big city” apparatus around town meetings, each
                located in one of the city’s six wards, has been in the air for
                more than a decade. Personally, this writer raised such a
                proposal fifteen years ago, and it began to surface in the city’s
                political discourse in 1981, when a conference of Burlington’s
                neighborhood organizations passed a very strong “resolve,”
                taking up my proposal and voting it through almost
                unanimously. Thereafter, in September 1982, Burlington’s
                Board of Aldermen accepted a more attenuated structure of
                “Neighborhood Planning Assemblies” (NPAs) to implement
                citizen participation in the allocation of federal community-
                development block grants. NPAs were thereupon established in
                each of the wards and proceeded to formulate constitutions for
                periodic meetings, coordinating committees, and the like. They
392 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                were open to all registered voters of a given ward, although
                their agendas were often presented by agencies in the mayor’s
                office.
                By adding the word “planning” to the words “neighborhood
                assembly,” the city’s mayoral administration (which is headed
                by a fairly authoritarian “socialist” mayor for whom leadership
                often is equatable with a high degree of “paternalism”) limits
                the assemblies’ power to a largely consultative role. At this
                writing, the situation is very much in flux: the NPAs are
                occasionally “assembled” by agencies in the mayor’s office to
                rubber stamp or give legitimation to the mayor’s pet schemes.
                In still other cases, they do exhibit a certain amount of
                initiative. Generally, the life of the assemblies has been muted
                by the centralistic or paternalistic behavior of this highly self-
                centered “socialist” mayor who is committed, together with his
                “class enemy,” the business community, to economic growth,
                expansionist “planning” notions, and a presumably “radical”
                version of Reaganesque “supply-side” economics in which the
                “poor, the elderly, and the working people” (to use City Hall’s
                most favored nouns) are supposed to indirectly benefit from
                the construction of hotels, condominiums, boutiques,
                department stores, and the like. That this kind of “growth” has
                significantly changed Burlington physically and produced
                major economic differences between its poorer neighborhoods
                and more well-to-do ones is an experience that is not unique to
                the otherwise easy-going communities of northern New
                England.
                What can be done in a city like this—and, for that matter, in a
                state like Vermont?
393 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Minimally, Burlington could benefit enormously from a
                municipalist political movement whose candidates are
                ultimately mandated and recallable by citizens’ assemblies. I
                refer not to the NPAs, which are actually gerrymandered ward
                organizations, but to assemblies that are rooted in authentic
                neighborhoods where the citizenry shares common economic,
                cultural, and political interests. Such neighborhoods exist in
                Burlington, as they do in many cities and towns of America. But
                they have been shrewdly amalgamated with other
                neighborhoods, often very different in character, to produce a
                melange of conflicting interests that favor oligarchic control of
                municipal politics.
                These mandated and recallable delegates—in no way to be
                confused with “representatives” who are free to make policy
                decisions—could initially form a “board of aldermen” or, if you
                like, a council of assembly delegates to parallel the official
                aldermanic board itself. The council, while legally powerless in
                its initial phases, could exercise a very effective moral
                influence on the official Board of Aldermen until it acquires
                increasing legal power of its own. It could track the agenda and
                business of the official board in every detail, expand it at will, or
                challenge such legislative measures that it finds unsuitable in
                the public interest. By the same token, it could run its own
                regular aldermanic candidates who, hopefully, would be
                expected to act as a voice for the parallel council within the city
                administration. All actions of the council, in turn, would have to
                be confirmed or could be altered by the assemblies so that
                each delegate would merely be the repository of his or her
                assembly’s views on specific issues.
394 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Optimally, it would be the goal of the Council of Assembly
                Delegates to replace the Board of Aldermen and institute
                genuine town-meeting democracy in Burlington. There is no
                reason why, from a strictly administrative viewpoint, such a
                change would affect in any way the normal operations of the
                city. The only objection to this system of self-governance I have
                encountered is that it is “too democratic,” not that it is
                “disruptive.” Such objections generally imply that the citizenry
                of the city is “incompetent” to deal with public matters, an
                objection that could obviously be raised against town-meeting
                governance itself if its centuries of success were not
                compelling testimony to the contrary.
                What I have described for Burlington could exist for Vermont as
                a whole. Actually, until the late 1960s, state government in
                Vermont was largely run by the municipalities. The state’s
                House of Representatives was chosen by townships, riot by
                electoral districts based on population numbers. Accordingly,
                large Vermont, towns had two representatives for example,
                and small communities had one. Towns thus directly controlled
                the House, not anonymous voters who were demographic ally
                agglomerated together with no political roots in a civic
                collectivity. Admittedly, a system so constricted to one or two
                representatives from a city or township favored a minority of
                voters, generally rural at the expense of urban populations, but
                politics was conducted in a more organic fashion than it is
                today. Town-meeting discussions favored a decent measure of
                public consensus and widespread public participation in a
                richer political process than mere “voting.” Voters were not
                mere spectators in a legislative duel conducted in the state
395 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                capital; they came fairly close to being direct participants in it,
                placing their representatives under regular public review at
                town meetings or in the daily life of their communities. A 1966
                U.S. Supreme Gourt decision, the famous “one vote for one
                voter” decision, swept this structure away as an
                “undemocratic” archaism. However faulty the original system
                —faults that could have easily been corrected by increasing
                the representation of larger communities, not by eliminating
                this kind of representation completely—Vermonters were not
                reduced to a mere electorate or its politically concerned people
                turned into mere constituqnts..
                Federal law preempts state law—in Vermont, of course, no less
                than other American states, although the Vermont Senate,
                from its inceptioii early in the nineteenth century, has always
                been elected from couritywide voting,districts. Hence, there is
                a sense in which both systems, the strictly electoral one as well
                as the municipal one, coexisted throughout most of the state’s
                history and, balanced each other out. Short of changing the
                federal Constitution itsfelf, there is no way in which this
                balance can be restored or made more equitable. Nor would it
                be desirable for any legislative body to structure itself around a
                system that provides one vote in the House for a, sparsely
                populated township and the same for another that is densely
                populated. But there is no reason why a third house in addition
                to the Senate and House of Representatives cannot be
                established on a statewide basis, a Council of Assembly
                Delegates, from all the townships and cities of Vermont, which
                would function as a moral monitor of the official state
                legislature. This “parallel” ethical system of governance,
396 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                legitiinated by the will of the people in yermont’s municipalities
                and corresponding to the “second chamber” in Burlington’s
                civic government, could “enact” its own “laws” and
                ordinances^ carefully scrutinizirig, criticizing, and correcting
                legislation that is under consideration in the Senate and House.
                It could function as the popular voice of the citizenry
                articulated into communities rather than anonymous voters.
                No less than in Burlington, the delegates of such a statewide
                council could be mandated and recallable by the communities
                from which they are chosen, and their choice would be more
                reflective of populatiori differences than the House that existed
                before the 1966 Supreme Court decision.
                I would like to advance a more general argument: firstly, that
                the emergence of paralegal and morally powerful assemblies
                of delegates from the, townships and cities of Vermont as well
                as within the state’s cities could begin to create a radically new
                political climate, activating Vermont’s citizens and profoundly
                influencing the very nature of legislation and ways of
                legislating in the state. With a visibly grass-roots and
                institutionalized assembly of municipal delegates tracking a
                less representative state legislature, Vermont’s politics could
                probably change in a very crucial way. Governance by
                legislative command, with its panoply of penalties and
                coercion, would begin to yield to governance by moral suasion,
                with its evocation of public responsibility and individual probity.
                Statecraft, which has always been premised on the public’s
                incompetence to govern itself and its ultimate recourse to
                violence, would increasingly give way to politics with its
                classical vision of community life as an ethical compact. This

                conceptual framework, which sees human consociation as a
                distinctly human, and humane, attribute of individual
                socialization—so markedly in contrast to the egoistic and
                interest-oriented, indeed disciplinary image of the
                contemporary public sphere—would mark a highly significant
                turn in the way we conceive the management of society and
                the participation of its citizenry in the political process. A dual
                structure of municipal government, paralleling the state’s
                conventional legal structure, could open a creative institutional
                restructuring of the body politic—one that would not only
                countervail the centralizing and destructuring process of
                urbanization and growing state power but introduce a new
                principle of politics based on morality as well as cooperation
                and personal responsibility.
                Secondly, I would like to point out that the leap from local to
                statewide forms of municipal control, even in so small a state
                as Vermont, may well open an institutional gap between town
                and state that could create a problematic area for a hybridized
                form of statecraft, neither political nor statist—one that would
                vitiate the entire project of a moral politics. What is worth
                recognizing is that the county system in Vermont provides a
                remarkable arena not only for closing this structural gap but
                also for enhancing this new kind of politics. Vermont’s
                seventeen counties, patched together by their quiltwork of
                numerous townships, provide an almost ideal jurisdictional unit
                for municipal confederations, each of which could be united by
                its own County Confederation of Municipalities and organized
                in all essentials like the councils of assembly delegates within
                the cities and the Council of Assembly Delegates for the entire

                state. These countywide confederations would have the
                extremely important function of pooling the resources of
                Vermont’s townships and cities to maintain roads, schools,
                public lands, and provide many other vital services that have
                been preempted by the conventional state government and
                legitimate its increasingly centralized powers. The countywide
                confederations would thus not only enhance the moral
                authority of Vermont’s municipal assemblies and form a
                connecting link between the townships and their statewide
                council; they would become the all-important material
                repository for reclaiming the financial control exercised by the
                legislature and executive branch over vital services such as
                road maintenance, services that cannot be dealt with alone by
                smaller communities in the state.
                The municipalization of Vermont’s economy would have to
                occur in piecemeal steps, I suspect, and on many different
                levels, indeed in such a way as not to infringe on the
                proprietary rights of small retail outlets, service
                establishments, artisan shops, small farms, local
                manufacturing enterprises, and the like. Rather, this process
                might begin as a transitional measure with the reclamation of
                public lands by the municipalities, indeed where funds exist
                with the purchase of sizable enterprises, particularly those that
                are failing financially and could be managed more efficiently by
                their workers than by profit-oriented entrepreneurs. The use of
                land trusts as a means not only for providing good public
                housing but promoting small-scale, often artisanal production
                would occupy a high place on the agenda of a municipality’s
                economic program. Cooperatives, farms, and small retail
399 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                outlets would be fostered with municipal funds and placed
                under growing public control—a policy that might very well
                command greater consumer loyalty than we would expect to
                find toward failing corporate enterprises.
                Viewed in a still broader perspective, it is crucially important
                that a municipal movement foster a new psychological
                ambience—a sense of civic loyalty and responsibility that
                would make each citizen feel committed to the success of a
                moral economy. Even more than the well-known “underground
                economy” that has revived barter and mutual aid in the
                exchange of goods and services, the municipality’s citizens
                would have to feel that they have a personal stake in the
                community’s welfare. This is a function of citizen
                empowerment, not of political rhetoric. A citizen’s stake in a
                moral economy has to be real and visible in the sense that the
                municipality’s economy has to be public business in a highly
                expressive and democratic form—the subject of vigorous
                discussion in neighborhood assemblies and town meetings,
                the object of voluntary services, stemming from a highly
                personalized knowledge of how the economy is functioning as
                well as how it can he enhanced by greater citizen participation.
                A moral economy is either a moral enterprise that is guided by
                a genuine spiritual desire to create one, even at the expense of
                strictly economic considerations, or it will degenerate into
                another profit-oriented and exploitative, use of resources.
                Citizens who are not prepared to pay higher prices to support
                such an economy and volunteer their own efforts on its behalf
                are not likely to be prepared for self-governance in. any form.
                Hence the need for a new municipal politics to become an
400 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                intensely educational and participatory experience at every
                level of civic life. The appalling failure of so many “progressive”
                movements in the towns and cities of America to recognize the
                need for civic paideia in the classical meaning of the term
                accounts for the repeated compromises that have made the
                heroic periods of their administrations so listless and routine
                after a few years in office. Doubtless, a full armamentorium of
                economic, fiscal, and administrative devices can be psed to
                make a municipalist politics workable; for example, Proudhon’s
                vision of a “People’s Bank” that will collect funds from the
                populace at large to finance municipal projects; the direct sale
                of locally grown food from farmer to consumer that will provide
                special price advantages for both; more barter, comprehensive
                mutual aid networks, and the use of public land to foster
                domestic gardening—these are only some of the many
                possible projects that could give tangibility to a moral
                economy. The fostering of civic voluntarism, such as unpaid
                public efforts to construct community centers, parks, squares,
                and other structures that would provide citizens with places for
                public discussion and personal intercourse, and efforts to
                collect funds (a sort of voluntary taxation, if you like) to
                beautify and improve the community—all can be viewed as
                moral challenges to the citizenry’s civic probity and its
                commitment to assume responsibility for its own community.
                But none of these efforts or projects are likely to succeed if a
                new politics is not educational, indeed if it is not a new form of
                civic enlightenment that challenges the citizenry to take
                control of its own community.
                It may well be that this civicisme, as the French called it two
401 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                centuries ago, can no longer flourish in an urbanized world that
                has been so extensively commodified and permeated by a
                market economy. But it may well be that precisely because of
                the deep frustration this urbanized and commodified world has
                produced, the will to create a new politics, citizenship,
                ecologically viable habitat, and municipal economy lies directly
                below the surface of conventional behavior as we know it
                today, waiting to break through if creative and imaginative
                alternatives are developed. Much of this book consists
                primarily of accounts drawn mainly from the past that
                demonstrate how the hidden aspirations of ordinary people
                welled up and exploded into powerful localist movements that
                profoundly redefined politics and citizenship in ways that
                emphasized the authority of the community over the state and
                self-empowerment over statecraft. There is no reason to
                believe that the most human of impulses, the need for
                consociation and community support, can be irretrievably cast
                into a limbo from which there is no redemption. Indeed, once
                released, this impulse often tends to surge forward beyond all
                the prescribed boundaries we normally impose upon it. If state
                power begets state power, so too does self-governance beget
                self-governance. It has seldom failed that whatever power
                people gain from the state, the state, in turn, loses
                institutionally as well as legitimately. A historic verdict that will
                finally place the state over the municipality has yet to be
                rendered conclusively. The greater danger we, face is that even
                those localists most committed in theory may have lost the
                existential commitment to turn their visions into practice.
                Sweeping as urbanization may be today, it has still not swept
                the ideal of the free, confederally organized municipality from
402 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the agenda of history—and as long as it exists there, it is
                something devoutly worth fighting for.
                Never has it been so necessary to place every innovative
                practice in the light of a visionary ethical ideal. Ironically, this is
                the great edge that reaction has over progress: its shrewd
                emphasis on ethics and matters of spirit in an increasingly
                meaningless as well as materialistic world. It has been noted
                With irony that Nazism achieved much of its success among
                the German people a half century ago not because of any
                economic panaceas it offered in opposition to its competitors
                from the center and left but because of its mythic ideal of
                nationhood, community, and social regeneration. In more
                recent times, reactionary movements in America have won
                millions to their cause on such moral grounds as the integrity
                of the family, religious dogma, the renewal of patriotism, and
                the right to life—a message, I may add, that has been
                construed not only as a need for antiabortion legislation but as
                a hypostasization of the sacredness of the individual, born as
                well as unborn.
                Characteristically, liberal and radical causes are still mired in
                economistic and productivistic panaceas. Their moral
                message, once a heightened plea for social justice, has given
                way increasingly to strictly material demands. Far more than
                the right, which avows egoism even as it emphasizes
                community virtues, the political middle ground and the left
                avow a solid bourgeois gospel of bread on the table and money
                in the bank. The spiritual emptiness that a market society
                produces in such large numbers of Americans has largely
                ceased to be a problem of the very people who profess to
403 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                oppose that society, a failure in ethical vision that has left them
                isolated and puzzled.
                The word “moral” must be repeated—not as rhetoric to match
                the claims of reaction but as the felt spiritual underpinnings of
                a new social vision. It must be repeated not as part of a
                patronizing sermon but as a living practice that people
                incorporate into their personal lives and their communities.
                The vacuity and triviality of life today must be filled precisely
                by those visionary ideals that sustain the human side of life as
                well as its material side, or else the coordinates by which the
                future should be guided will totally disappear in that
                commodity oriented world we call the “marketplace of ideas.”
                The more serious indecency of this “marketplace” is that these
                ideals will be turned into objects—mere commodities—that will
                lack even the value of things we need to sustain us. They will
                become the mere ornaments needed to garnish an inherently
                antihuman and antiecological society that threatens to
                undermine moral integrity as such and the simple social
                amenities that foster human intercourse.
                A municipal agenda to countervail urbanization and all that it
                signifies is not a mere program, such as we expect from rival
                parties and electoral coalitions. Programs, whether “green” or
                “red,” radical or liberal, are shopping fists of demands,
                precisely suited for that “marketplace of ideas” we have
                misnamed “politics.” They are ideological agents for effacing
                crucial differences in outlook. The need for thinking out ideas
                and giving them coherence, which alone imparts meaning to
                an agenda for a new municipal politics, is lost and in that loss is
                replaced by the chaos of ideological confusion. A cranky
404 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                pluralism replaces a stern appreciation of focused thinking; a
                confused eclecticism replaces the need for wholeness, clarity,
                and consistency. The ecology movement and movements for a
                new politics have been plagued by this indigestible fare for
                decades, a problem that has grown even worse due to the
                cultural illiteracy that plagues American society.
                Any attempt to countervail urbanization and replace it with a
                new politics and authentic citizenship must not only be a
                movement for ethical renewal, clearly focused in its analysis
                and goals; it must also be a movement that has a sense of
                “home,” as it were, as well as a sense of mission. Most
                movements that derive from the liberal center or the left are
                notable for their lack of any roots in traditions that are dear to
                Americans or articulate the best in their history. Given the
                emphasis of these movements on centralism, planning,
                coordination, and mass mobilization, they stand inherently at
                odds with a creative American legacy that formulated its ideals
                of freedom around decentrafism, popular initiative,
                confederation, and individualism—ideals that admittedly can
                be degraded by manipulative reactionaries for authoritarian
                ends but can also be enlarged and given a more responsive,
                humanistic meaning for more emancipatory goals. That
                decentrafism can mean local parochialism, even racism;
                confederation, a denial of any rational coordination of
                resources and services; and individualism, a psychology of
                rampant egotism—all are simply the most negative way of
                viewing a constellation of notions whose logic can yield
                genuine freedom. That these very ideals of freedom guided the
                radical movements of heretical Christianity centuries ago,
405 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                nourished the English, American, and French revolutions in a
                more recent time, inspired the Communards of 1871, and
                surfaced again in Spain during the 1930s as well as among
                various citizens’ and civic movements during the past two
                generations should be enough to give the most sectarian
                radicals pause before denouncing them. It remains to the great
                credit of early populism, not only in America but in Russia and
                Spain, embellished by their own anarchistic traditions, to have
                extracted the diamond of radicalism from the rubbish heap of
                reaction. A new politics and sense of citizenship in America still
                awaits a movement that can occupy itself with the difficult
                process of separating the jewel from its matrix and making it
                glitter as it once did.
                It will not do to live on a diet of hating America because of its
                adventures abroad or its mistreatment of ethnic minorities at
                home any more than it will due to immunize the country from
                criticism by dressing it in a flag and perverting its revolutionary
                origins in a struggle for freedom. Indeed, it would be a far more
                worthy and historically sound enterprise to disengage the
                democratic traditions and institutions of the country such as its
                town meetings and its Bill of Rights from a very mistaken
                notion that they are, entangled with the “bourgeoisie,”
                whatever this word means these days. The words “bourgeois
                democracy” turn history into a canard: the real bourgeoise of
                the past never favored democracy in any form. A more
                searching account of the great democratic revolutions of two
                centuries ago reveals that they were committed primarily to a
                constitutional monarchy and only resigned themselves to an
                oligarchic form of republicanism whose model was senatorial

                Rome. It was the people, often of varied class origins, who
                foisted the liberties we enjoy today on the possessing classes,
                classes that consistently tried to pervert them and are still in
                the business of perverting them. Tragically; reaction has been
                permitted to appropriate the “American Dream” and give it a
                chauvinistic meaning while liberals arid radicals have mocked
                it, degrading it in their own way for ends that are often no less
                authoritarian than those of their opponents.
                Yet this “American Dream” has many faces, and it still remains
                to be seen whether its most liberatory, visionary, and utopian
                aspects will find expression in the credo of a new politics. One
                face of the dream was born in yeoman New Erigland, where
                community acquired ascendancy over privatism; individuality
                over egotism; decentralism over the concentration of power;
                direct democracy over republicanism. Another face was born in
                the cowboy west, where the privatism of the ruggedly
                individualistic “lone rider” was hypostasized over the “fence-
                rearing” farmer and his family; where egoism was enclosed by
                the perimeter of the lonely campfire; where to be armed was a
                token not of the free citizen but the marauding gun slinger; and
                where social chaos prevailed over democracy and
                republicanism,alike. Still another face of the “American Dream”
                was added by the late-coming immigrant for whorri American
                cities were not only refuges from European oppression but, as
                the maxim has it, where “the streets were paved with gold.”
                This face featured no particular virtues beyond personal
                security from arbitrary rule and material well-being. History
                has scrambled these faces together so that they now appear a
                blur, not a unified tradition in which one face stands at odds

                with the others.
                A municipal agenda that does not piece together the
                emancipatory features of the “American Dream” such that this
                agenda can speak in a clear and unqualified voice to the
                American people will not be worth the paper on which it is
                written. Americans, no less than Europeans, must recover, a
                whole that has been served up to them in fragments: their
                history as a story of human freedom, not merely as the history
                of the freedom of property, trade, and the unbridled egoism of
                greed. For decades, social innovators have talked to the
                American people in German (Marx), Russian (Lenin), Chinese
                (Mao), Vietnamese (Ho Chi Minh), indeed in virtually every
                language but English—which is to say, in the language of
                traditions and “isms” that are largely incomprehensible to
                Americans. An ethical and visionary case can now be made,
                perhaps more than at any time before, that community,
                individuality, decentralism, and direct democracy are
                ideologically more “homelike” than “rugged individualism,”
                egoism, gun slinging, and chaos. Arriericans have welcomed
                this yeoman American message eagerly—as the cynical right
                and one of the country’s oldest presidents have clearly
                demonstrated—only to see it betrayed into a cowboy parody.
                They no longer believe that their “streets are paved with gold,”
                if only because the immigrant generation that accepted this
                myth has already passed into history. The political landscape is
                open again for the revival of a dream that emphasizes
                community, decentralism, individuality, and direct democracy.
                The yearning to render it applicable to a modern America is
                intense, if only it can be properly articulated and earnestly

                advanced. It will be an unpardonable failure in political
                creativity if a movement that professes to speak for a new
                politics does not try to occupy that landscape but rather, in a
                self-indulgent “hate America” mood, debarks to a “Third
                World” ideological ghetto abroad with shrieks about the ‘‘mad
                dogs of imperialism,” snarling perpetually at its most natural
                allies at home—the ordinary citizen desiccated by his or her
                own spiritual poverty.
                Nor can a new politics ignore the most essential attribute of
                that dream: its molecular nature and its gradual development
                from neighborhood and town to county and region. Dreams are
                more than party platforms, which are normally violated or
                ignored. Attempts to reconstruct an authentic politics—not
                another ensemble of statecraft techniques—involve a
                remaking of the body politic itself: politics conceived as the
                recovery of citizenship and civic education. This kind of politics
                has an almost cellular form of growth, a process that involves
                organic proliferation and differentiation such as that of a child
                in a womb. To “engineer” a politics into existence the way one
                puts together an automobile engine with its engine block,
                gaskets, cylinders, spark plugs, and the like is to desecrate the
                meaning of the word “politics,” itself, not to speak of the
                disdain it exhibits for the human freight that this engine is
                meant to bring to polling booths and the “citizenry” or “voters”
                it is meant to mobilize. Until the social innovators of our day
                discard the notion that the “political process” is a matter of
                mobilization rather than education, of charismatic leaders
                rather than participatory citizens, of “bread-on-the-table”
                panaceas rather than visionary ideals charged with ethical

                meaning, their politics, far from being “new,” will be the old
                authoritarian statecraft garnished with mere rhetoric.
                A new political agenda is necessarily a municipal agenda—or it
                is neither an agenda for remaking society nor politics in any
                meaningful sense of the term. The living cell which forms the
                basic unit of political life is the municipality from which
                everything else must emerge: confederation,
                interdependence, citizenship, and freedom. There is no way to
                piece together any politics—old or new—unless we begin with
                its most elementary forms: the villages, towns, neighborhoods,
                and cities in which people live on the most immediate level of
                political interdependence, the only level that is the next step
                beyond private life. It is on this level that they can begin to gain
                a familiarity with the political process, a process that involves a
                good deal more than “voting” and “information”—a term that
                has become the modern substitute for wisdom. It is on this
                level that they can go beyond the privateness and
                parochialism of family life—a life that is celebrated for its
                inwardness and seclusion—and improvise those public
                institutions that make for participation and consociation. In
                short, it is from the municipality that people can reconstitute
                themselves from isolated monads into a creative body politic
                and create an existentially vital, indeed protoplasmic, civic life
                that has institutional form as well as civic content: the block
                committees, assemblies, neighborhood organizations,
                cooperatives, citizens’ action groups, and public arena for
                discourse that go beyond such episodic acts as
                demonstrations and retain a lived as well as organized
                continuity. To ignore this irreducible civic unit of political life is

                to play chess without a chessboard, for it is here that the
                coordinates exist for playing the game in its most direct, basic,
                and intimate sense.
                I have tried in this book to formulate a body of ideas that have
                meaning for the political restructing of our times, not another
                handbook that offers recipes for how to make a “revolution” in
                one’s backyard or front lawn. I have tried to suggest a political
                philosophy that lends itself to modification, extension, and a
                decent regard for the great variety of needs that distinguish
                one community from another, not a blueprint that dogmatizes
                and rigidifies the idea of freedom into an inflexible credo. But I
                do not seek to rarify this political philosophy of civicism into a
                mere intellectual duel with abstract philosophies that stand in
                opposition to it. This book has been thoroughly informed by
                history—not because I seek lived “precedents” for truths that
                deserve to rest on their own intrinsic worth rather than
                “expediency” or, to use what has become a synonym for that
                term, “efficiency.” Political life is not legitimated by how well it
                “works.” If it were, totalitarianism could be more successfully
                legitimated because it is generally more “efficient” than
                democracy, just as business techniques are more “effective”
                than that “wasteful” process involved in’ debates and free
                forms of decision making. Doubtless, “time is money,” but
                freedom is a way of life that even money cannot buy—or
                certainly should not.
                My recourse to history and to speculations about my own
                community, Burlington, and its Vermont setting is primarily an
                endeavor to show that living human beings, not their science-
                fiction replicas, actually engaged in and continue to involve
411 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                themselves in a political process that may initially seem
                visionary when it is presented abstractly. I have tried to show
                that our contemporary market society; only three or four
                decades old at best, and our two-centuries-old market
                economy were preceded by a far more mixed society and
                economy, possibly four centuries old, that phased out of a
                rigidly structured feudalworld, later to phase into a chaotically
                destructured capitalist world. What men and women have
                done in the past and, in some degree, continue to do today can
                certainly be recovered again. These people were no less real
                than we—all rhetoric about the fixidity of human nature to the
                contrary notwithstanding; If they went from a highly structured
                world through a centuries-long “transition” formed around a
                highly mixed, almost ecological economy and society, to a very
                recent destructured market society, who is to say which of the
                three is merely “transitional,” “climatic,”’ or constitutes
                evidence of a steady ascent in history? It may well be that our
                present-day market society is evidence of social regression,
                not of social progress; indeed that the insane proliferation of
                commodity relationships that embodies all human ties in mere
                objects constitutes a cancer of social life as such, not, as Marx
                would have it, a “precondition” for a free society in an
                idealized, Eurocentric image of social progress.
                This book has also been informed by another belief: power that
                is not retained by the people is power that is given over to the
                state. Conversely, whatever power the people gain is power
                that must be taken away from the state. There can be no
                institutional vacuum where power exists: it is either invested in
                the people or it is invested in the state. Where the two “share”
412 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                power, this condition is only temporary and extremely
                precarious. Sooner of later, the control of society arid its
                destiny will either shift toward the people and their
                communities at its base or the professional practitioners of
                statecraft at its summit. Only if the whole pyramidal structure
                is dismembered and turned from a vertical hierarchy into a
                horizontal ecocommunity—modelled more on what ecologists
                diagram as a “food web” than a “food pyramid” (with humans
                invariably at its apex)—will the issue of power and domination
                as such disappear and be completely replaced by participation
                and the principle of complementarity.
                Power, however, must be conceived as real, indeed solid and
                tangible, not only as spiritual and psychological. To ignore the
                fact that power is a muscular fact of life is to drift from the
                visionary into the ethereal and mislead the public as to its
                crucial significance in affecting society’s destiny. What this
                means is that if power is to be regained by the people from the
                state, the management of society must be deprofessionalized
                as much as possible. That is to say, it must be simplified and
                rendered transparent, indeed, clear, accessible, and
                manageable such that most of its affairs can be run by ordinary
                citizens. This notion, with its emphasis on amateurism as
                distinguished frorn professionalism, is not new. It formed the
                basis of Athenian democratic practice for generations. Indeed,
                it was so ably practiced that sortition rather than election
                formed the basis of the polis’s democracy. It was to resurface
                again repeatedly, for example, in the very simple constitution
                written by Vermont’s yeomanry two centuries ago, a
                constitution that is still notable for the brevity of its articles and
413 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                the minimal amount of statute law that clothes it.
                Power is also a solid and tangible fact to be reckoned’with
                militarily, notably in the ubiquitous truth that the power of the
                state or the people eventually reposes in force. Whether or not
                the state has power depends upon whether or not the state
                exercises a monopoly of violence. By the same token, whether
                or not the people have power depends upon whether or not it
                is armed and creates its own grass-roots militia, not only to
                guard itself from criminals or invaders but also from the ever-
                encroaching power of the state itself. Here, too, the Athenian
                and Vermont yeomen knew only too well that a professiorial
                military was a threat to liberty and the state was a vehicle for
                disarming the people.
                A true civicism that tries to create an authentic politics, an
                empowered citizenry, and a municipalized economy would be
                a vulnerable project indeed if it failed to replace the police, the
                professional army, even that pseridomilitia, the National
                Guard, with an authentic militia, a civic guard, composed of
                rotating patrols for police purposes and well-trained citizen
                military contingents for dealing with external dangers to
                freedom. Greek democracy would never have survived the
                repeated assaults of the Greek aristocracy without its militia of
                citizen hoplites, those foot soldiers who could answer the call
                to arms with their own weapons and elected commanders. The
                tragic history of the state’s ascendancy over autonomous
                municipalities, even the history of the rise of oligarchy within
                free cities of the past, is the story of armed professionals who
                commandeered power from unarmed peoples or disarmed
                them presumably (as so many liberals would have it today)

                from the “hazards” of domestic and neighborhood
                “shootouts.” Typically, this is the cowboy or “gunslingers”
                image of the “American Dream,” often cynically imposed on its
                more traditional yeoman face.
                Beyond the immediate agenda i have presented thus far lies
                another one: a political world in which the state as such will
                finally be replaced by a confederal network of municipal
                assemblies; the corporate economy reduced to a truly political
                economy in which municipalities, interacting with each other
                economically as well as politically, will resolve their material
                problems as citizen bodies in open assemblies, not simply as
                professionals, farmers, and blue- or white-collar workers. Not
                only will they then transform themselves from occupational
                beings into public beings, but they will create a world in which
                all weapons can indeed be beaten into plowshares and
                ultimately a human ecocommunity that will be exquisitely
                tailored psychologically and spiritually as well as
                technologically, archictecturally, and structurally to the natural
                eco-communities that compose our planet.
                I would hope that such an agenda would offer an image of a
                nonhierarchical as well as a classless community in which
                differentiation, natural as well as social, is respected without
                that divisive sense of “otherness” that has produced such
                disastrous effects—on our relationship with our own kind and
                the life forms that share the planet with us.
                This second agenda for a more distant future embodies the
                “ultimate” vision I have elaborated in greater detail in my
                previous writings. Its achievement can no longer be seen as a

                sudden “revolution” that within a brief span of time will replace
                the present society with a radically new one. Actually, such
                revolutions never really happened in history as the litany of
                their failures so dramatically reveals. Even the French
                Revolution, which radicals have seized upon as a “paradigm”
                of sudden social change, was generations in preparation and
                did not come to its end until a century later, when the last of
                the sans culottes were virtually exterminated on the barricades
                of the Paris Commune.
                Nor can there be any myth today that barricades are more
                than symbols and a civic guard is little more than a first step
                toward disarming the state, a feeble step at that, albeit a
                crucial assertion of where the “monopoly of violence” should
                really repose—if violence can be mitigated in a world that is
                overstocked with nuclear bombs. What links my minimal
                agenda to my ultimate one is a process, an admittedly long
                development in which the existing institutions and traditions of
                freedom are slowly enlarged and expanded. “Revolution”
                originally meant the restoration of.traditional rights in the
                context of a changed world, a legitimation of emancipation by
                the power and dignity of tradition. For the present, we must try
                to democratize the republic, a call that often is simply
                defensive and consists of preserving and expanding freedoms
                we have earned centuries ago together with the institutions
                that give them reality. For the future it means that we must
                radicalize our democracy, imparting a utopian and creative
                content to the democratic institutions we have rescued.
                Admittedly, at that point we will have moved from a
                countervailing position that tries to play our democratic
416 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                institutions against the state into an aggressive attempt to
                replace the state with municipally based confederal structures.
                It is to be devoutly hoped that by that time, the state power
                itself will have been hollowed out institutionally by local or civic
                structures, indeed that its very legitimacy, not to speak of its
                authority as a coercive force, will simply lead to its collapse in
                any period of confrontation. If the great revolutions of the past
                can be used to provide us with examples of how so major a
                shift is possible, it would be well to remember that seemingly
                all-powerful monarchies that the republics replaced two
                centuries ago were so denuded of power that they crumbled
                rather than “fell” much as a mummified corpse turns to dust
                after it has been suddenly exposed to air.
                Another ultimate vision also faces us: one in which
                urbanization will so completely devour the city and the
                countryside that the word “community” will become an
                archaism; a market society filtering into the most private
                recesses of our lives as individuals and effacing all sense of
                personality, much less individuality; a state that will not only
                render politics and citizenship a mockery of these words but a
                maw that will absorb the very notion of freedom itself.
                This “vision,” if such it can be called, is still sufficiently removed
                from our most immediate experience so that its realization can
                be arrested by those countervailing forces—that dual power—I
                have outlined in the previous pages. Given the persistent
                destructuring of the natural world as well as the social, more
                than human freedom and autonomy are in the balance. The
                proliferation of nuclear reactors, like that of nuclear weapons,
                is a reminder that we are reaching a point of almost cosmic
417 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                finality in our affairs on this planet; that the recovery of an
                authentic politics and citizenship is not only a precondition for a
                free society. It is also a precondition for our survival as a
                species. Hanging over us is the shadow of a completely
                destructured and simplified natural world as well as a
                completely destructured and simplified urban world—a natural
                world so ossified and divested of its variety that we, like all
                other complex life forms, will be unable to exist as viable
                beings.
                [1] See Murray Bookchin: The Ecology of Freedom (Palo Alto:
                Cheshire Books, 1982), pp. 62–88
                [2] How paradoxical can be judged by the fact that “statified” is
                a word I have had to create for my own needs to denote the
                extent of the state’s penetration into social and political life. It
                does not exist in the English language. This term, which I used
                extensively in my Post-Scarcity Anarchism, produced
                numerous tiffs with a dedicated editor and repeated misprints
                with a knowledgeable printer.
                [3] Quite often, in fact, the word polis, for which there is no
                comparable term in English, is translated as state.
                [4] I use the word “civilized” throughout this book to mean
                literally the world of the civitas or city in the broad Latin sense
                this term was used, not in any culturally pejorative sense.
                Readers of my book, The Ecology of Freedom, will know that
                the word denotes no monumental advance in the human
                condition over so-called “primitive” societies—apart from
                certain technical and scientific amenities that may have
                lightened humanity’s material burdens.

                [5] Literally, politea. The word republic—the Latin for res
                publica, literally public things—has no meaning or analogue in
                Greek, and, in this writer’s view, no place in the title of Plato’s
                famous dialogue.
                [6] For a more detailed discussion of the decline of Rome and
                the problems the empire created, the reader should read my
                book, The Limits of the City (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1973,
                pp. 32–35).
                [7] This is a feature that existed even in New York during the
                1930s, which I distinctly recall as a young man. This great city,
                at one time an agglomeration of a thousand ethnically unique
                neighborhoods, seemed to have been stopped in time, for a
                generation or two, and created much the same degree of
                neighborhood loyalties and distinctive accents. I have
                encountered such differences in New Orleans today, although
                they are rapidly disappearing. The emergence of civic variety,
                loyalty, and cultural diversity even in modern American cities is
                an important theme to which we shall return later in this book,
                and the consequences of its loss will be fully explored as a
                consequence of contemporary urbanization.
                [8] France, it is worth noting, had extended its newly adopted
                decadenal metric system from weights, measures, lengths,
                and areas directly into the calendar with the result that a week
                was measured in ten days. This did not displease the French
                bourgeoisie, which was only too glad to have a longer work
                week than existed under the older religious calendar.
                [9] Hence my strong objections to the way European,
                particularly German, city confederacies are treated in the
419 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                mainstream historical literature of the time, particularly by
                Toynbee and Mumford. In this respect, Kropotkin’s writings are
                still exceptional for their sympathy, although they are not
                given sufficient attention in his work.
                [10] Which is not to say that grain, that all-important import of
                the Greek cities and Rome, was not a major staple in the
                Mediterranean basin and along European water routes. But the
                inland transportation of grain by carts was quite secondary to
                luxury objects once we look beyond a regional economy in
                Europe.
                [11] I find it fascinating that so many radicals, socialists and
                anarchists alike, almost intuitively rally to the support of small-
                scale farmers against agribusiness and small family
                enterprises against giant supermarkets, this despite their
                hostility to private property of any kind. Americans seem to
                suspect that domestic forms of society, however propertied,
                are a desideratum in themselves and foster individuality in a
                mass society. This Jeffersonian legacy acts as one of the most
                important inertial elements against the full colonization of
                society by corporations and big business, even though its
                historical context in the making of the free city and free citizen
                has not been fully understood; so, too, for our appreciation of
                craftsmanship.
                [12] Put bluntly: there was no “transition” from feudalism to
                capitalism in the simple sense presented by most Marxist and
                liberal historians and theorists. Nor is it true to say that
                capitalism developed “within the womb” of feudalism and then
                “emerged” as a dominant social order through a series of
                “bourgeois-democratic revolutions” whose “paradigm” is the
420 of 428 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Urbanization Without Cities | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                French Revolution of 1789–94 (in the view of some historians,
                the span of the revolution is expanded to included the
                Napoleonic era, notably up to 1814!). The remarkably mixed,
                diversified, and complex society that is often presented to us
                as a “transitional period” was, in fact, an era in its own right
                that social ecology can describe and interpret more insightfully
                than economistic interpretations. We shall see that the view of
                this remarkable era as merely “transitional”leads to a host of
                errors, particularly its depiction of the revolutionary era and its
                democratic aspirations as “bourgeois,” an imagery that makes
                capitalism a system more committed to freedom, or even
                ordinary civil liberties, than it was historically.
                [13] This I believe probably accounts for Karl Marx’s strongly
                productivist bias in economic theory over the more
                consumptionist biases of contemporary economists. Marx, I
                believe, was quite correct when he pointed out that under
                capitalism, at least, it was production that created demand, not
                demand that created production, although there is an obvious
                interplay between the two at a surface level of economic life.
                Where he was most lacking was in his failure to recognize the
                cultural constraints that limited production and profoundly
                influenced the vulner· ability of a society to technological
                innovation. In this respect, ancient society was always a
                mystery to him, and its development was often explained in
                surprisingly conventional ways.
                [14] That Engels’s commitment to a harsh concept of
                technological progress, indeed, the whole Marxist theory of
                “historical materialism,” was meant to slap not only the face of
                philosophical idealism but also of the high spirit of European

                romanticism is an issue that has yet to be fully explored. Gray
                became a favorite color of Marxian socialism as part of its
                deliberate endeavor to disenchant the world and relegate the
                past, with all its humane as well as barbarous traditions, to a
                historical “junk heap.” Eventually socialism, like Puritanism,
                was to be deprived of all its ethical content and turned into a
                doctrine very much like the egoistic political economy of the
                industrial bourgeoisie itself.
