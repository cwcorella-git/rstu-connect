                The End of Arrogance:
                Decentralization and Anarchist
                Organizing
                Author: Curious George Brigade

                For too long, anarchist projects have been mismanaged by
                arrogant fantasies of mass. We have unconsciously adopted
                the Statist, Capitalist and Authoritarian belief that “bigger
                equals better” and that we must tailor our actions and groups
                towards this end. Despite our intuitive understandings that
                large organizations rarely accomplish more than small, tight
                groups working together, the desire for mass remains strong.
                We must re-examine how we organize projects in order to
                awake from the nightmare of over-structure that inevitably
                leads to bureaucracy, centralization and ineffective anarchist
                work. This article suggests a few ideas on how anarchists can
                reject the trap of mass and reinvent ourselves, our groups and
                our work: from local community activities to large
                revolutionary mobilizations. The rejection of mass
                organizations as the be-all, end-all of organizing is vital for the
                creation and rediscovery of possibilities for empowerment and
                effective anarchist work.

                The Tyranny of Structure
                Most mass structures are a result of habit, inertia and the lack
                of creative critique. Desire for mass is accepted as common
                sense in the same way it is ‘common sense’ that groups must
                have leaders, or that that they must make decisions by voting.
                Even anarchists have been tricked into accepting the necessity
                of super structures and large organizations for the sake of
                efficiency, mass, or unity. These super structures have become
                a badge of legitimacy and they are often the only conduits by
                which outsiders, whether the media, the police or other leftists,
                can understand us. The result is an alphabet soup of mega-
                groups which largely exist to propagate themselves and, sadly,
                do little else. Unfortunately, we haven’t just been tricked into
                accepting superstructures as the overriding venue of our work:
                many of us have gone along willingly, because the promise of
                mass is a seductive one.
                Large coalitions and super-structures have become the coin of
                the realm not only for leftist groups in general but also for
                anarchist enterprises. They appeal to activists’ arrogant
                fantasies of mass: the authoritarian impulse to be leading (or
                at least be part of) a large group of people that reinforce and
                legitimize our deeply held ideologies and beliefs. Even our best
                intentions and wildest dreams are often crowded out by visions
                of the black clad mob storming the Bastille or the IMF
                headquarters.
                The price of the arrogant dream of mass is appallingly high and
                the promised returns never come. Super-structures, which
                include federations, centralized networks and mass

                organizations, demand energy and resources to survive. They
                are not perpetual motion machines which produce more
                energy than what is poured into them. In a community of
                limited resources and energy like ours, a super-structure can
                consume most of these available resources and energies,
                rendering the group ineffective. Mainstream non-profits have
                recently illustrated this tendency. Large organizations like the
                Salvation Army commonly spend 2/3 of their monies (and even
                larger amounts of its labor) on simply maintaining its
                existence: officers, outreach, meetings and public appearance.
                At best, only 1/3 of their output actually goes to their stated
                goals. The same trend is replicated in our political
                organizations.
                We all know that most large coalitions and super-structures
                have exceedingly long meetings. Here’s a valuable exercise:
                The next time you find yourself bored by an overlong meeting,
                count the number of people in attendance. Then multiply that
                number by how long the meeting lasts: this will give you the
                number of person-hours devoted to keeping the organization
                alive. Factor in travel time, outreach time and the propaganda
                involved in promoting the meeting and that will give you a
                rough estimate of the amount of activist hours consumed by
                greedy maw of the superstructure. After that nightmarish
                vision, stop and visualize how much actual work could be
                accomplished if this immense amount of time and energy were
                actually spent on the project at hand instead of what is so
                innocently referred to as ‘organizing’.
                Affinity or Bust
3 of 9 3/17/25, 5:06 PM The End of Arrogance: Decentralization and Anarchist ... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Not only are super-structures wasteful and inefficient, but they
                also require that we mortgage our ideals and affinities. By
                definition, coalitions seek to create and enforce agendas.
                These are not merely agendas for a particular meeting but
                larger priorities for what type of work is important. Within non-
                anarchist groups, this prioritization often leads to an
                organizational hierarchy to ensure that all members of the
                group promote the overall agenda.
                A common example is the role of the media person or
                ‘spokesman’ (and it is almost always a man) whose comments
                are accepted as the opinion for dozens, hundreds or
                sometimes thousands of people. In groups without a party line
                or platform, we certainly shouldn’t accept any other person
                speaking for us — as individuals, affinity groups or collectives.
                While the delusions of media stars and spokespeople are
                merely annoying, superstructures can lead to scenarios with
                much graver consequences. In mass mobilizations or actions,
                the tactics of an entire coalition are often decided by a handful
                of people. Many of the disasters of particular recent
                mobilizations can be squarely blamed on the centralization of
                information and tactical decisions on a tiny cadre of individuals
                within the larger coalition/organization (which might include
                dozens of collectives and affinity groups). For anarchists, such
                a concentration of influence and power in the hands of a few is
                simply unacceptable.
                It has long been a guiding principle of anarchist philosophy that
                people should engage in activities based on their affinities and
                that our work should be meaningful, productive and enjoyable.
                This is the hidden benefit of voluntary association. It is arrogant
4 of 9 3/17/25, 5:06 PM The End of Arrogance: Decentralization and Anarchist ... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                to believe that members in a large structure, which again can
                number in the hundreds or thousands of people, should all
                have identical affinities and ideals. It is arrogant to believe that
                through discussion and debate, any one group should convince
                all the others that their particular agenda will be meaningful,
                productive and enjoyable for all. Due to this nearly impossible
                situation, organizations rely on coercion to get their agendas
                accepted by their membership. The coercion is not necessarily
                physical (like the State) or based on deprivation (like
                Capitalism) but based on some sense of loyalty or solidarity or
                unity. This type of coercion is the stock and trade of the
                vanguard.
                Organizations spend a significant amount of their time at
                meetings trying to convince you that your affinities are disloyal
                to the greater organization and that your desires and interests
                obstruct or remove you from solidarity with some group or
                another. When these appeals fail, the organization will label
                your differences as obstructionist or breaking ‘unity’ — the
                hobgoblin of efficiency. Unity is an arrogant ideal which is too
                often used against groups who refuse to cede their autonomy
                to a larger super-structure.
                Many anarchists whose primary work is done in large
                organizations often never develop their own affinities or skills
                and instead, do work based on the needs of super-structures.
                Without affinity groups or collective work of their own, activists
                become tied to the mass abstract political goals of the
                organization, which leads to even greater inefficiency and the
                ever present “burn-out” that is so epidemic in large coalitions
                and super-structures.

                Liberty, Trust and True Solidarity
                “All Liberty is based on Mutual Trust” — Sam Adams
                If we seek a truly liberated society in which to flourish, we must
                also create a trusting society. Cops, armies, laws,
                governments, religious specialists and all other hierarchies are
                essentially based on mistrust. Super-structures and coalitions
                mimic this basic distrust that is so rampant and detrimental in
                the wider society. In the grand tradition of the Left, large
                organizations today feel that due to their size or mission, they
                have a right to micromanage the decisions and actions of all its
                members. For many activists, this feeling of being something
                larger that themselves fosters an allegiance to the organization
                above all. These are the same principles that foster
                nationalism and patriotism. Instead of working through and
                building initiatives and groups that we ourselves have created
                and are based in our own communities, we work for a larger
                organization with diluted goals, hoping to convince others to
                join us. This is the trap of the Party, the three letter acronym
                group and the large coalition.
                In large groups, power is centralized, controlled by officers (or
                certain working groups) and divvied out, as it would be done by
                any bureaucratic organization. In fact a great deal of its
                energies are devoted to guarding this power from others in the
                coalition. In groups which attempt to attract anarchists (such
                as anti-globalization coalitions) this centralization of power is
                transferred to certain high profile working groups such as
                ‘media’ or ‘tactical’. Regardless of how it appears on the
                outside, superstructures foster a climate in which tiny

                minorities have disproportionate influence over others in the
                organization.
                As anarchists, we should reject all notions of centralized power
                and power hoarding. We should be critical of anything that
                demands the realignment of our affinities and passions for the
                good of an organization or abstract principle. We should guard
                our autonomy with the same ferocity with which the super-
                structure wishes to strip us of it.
                Mutual aid has long been the guiding principle by which
                anarchists work together. The paradox of mutual aid is that we
                can only protect our own autonomy by trusting others to be
                autonomous. Super-structures do the opposite and seek to
                limit autonomy and work based on affinity in exchange for
                playing on our arrogant fantasies and the doling out power.
                Decentralization is the basis of not only autonomy (which is the
                hallmark of liberty), but also of trust. To have genuine freedom,
                we have to allow others to engage in their work based on their
                desires and skills while we do the same. We can hold no power
                from them or try to coerce them into accepting our agenda.
                The successes that we have in the streets and in our local
                communities almost always come from groups working
                together: not because they are coerced and feel duty-bound,
                but out of genuine mutual aid and solidarity.
                We should continue to encourage others to do their work in
                coordination with ours. In our anarchist work, we should come
                together as equals: deciding for ourselves with whom we wish
                to form affinity groups or collectives. In accordance with that
                principle, each affinity group would be able to work individually
                with other groups. These alliances might last for weeks or for

                years, for a single action or for a sustained campaign, with two
                groups or two hundred. Our downfall is when the larger
                organization becomes our focus, not the work which it was
                created for. We should work together, but only with equal
                status and with no outside force, neither the state, god nor
                some coalition, determining the direction or shape of the work
                we do. Mutual trust allows us to be generous with mutual aid.
                Trust promotes relationships where bureaucracies, formal
                procedures and large meetings promote alienation and
                atomization. We can afford to be generous with our limited
                energies and resources while working with others because
                these relationships are voluntary and based on a principle of
                equality. No group should sacrifice their affinity, autonomy or
                passions for the privilege to work with others. Just as we are
                very careful with whom we would work within affinity group,
                we should not offer to join in coalition with groups with whom
                we do not share mutual trust.
                We can and should work with other groups and collectives, but
                only on the basis of autonomy and trust. It is unwise and
                undesirable to demand that particular group must agree with
                the decisions of every other group. During demonstrations, this
                principle is the foundation of the philosophy of “diversity of
                tactics”. It is bizarre that anarchists demand diversity of tactics
                in the streets but then are coerced by calls for ‘unity’ in these
                large coalitions. Can’t we do better? Fortunately, we can.
                Radical Decentralization: A New Beginning
                So let us begin our work not in large coalitions and super
                structures but in small affinity groups. Within the context of our
8 of 9 3/17/25, 5:06 PM The End of Arrogance: Decentralization and Anarchist ... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                communities, the radical decentralization of work, projects and
                responsibility strengthens the ability of anarchist groups to
                thrive and do work which best suits them. We must reject the
                default of ineffective, tyrannical super structures as the only
                means to get work done and must strengthen and support
                existing affinity groups and collectives. Let us be as critical of
                the need for large federations, coalitions and other super-
                structures as we are of the State, religion, bureaucracies and
                corporations. Our recent successes have defied the belief that
                we must be part of some giant organization “to get anything
                done”. We should take to heart the thousands of anarchist DIY
                projects being done around the world outside super structures.
                Let us come to meetings as equals and work based on our
                passions and ideals, and then find others with whom we share
                these ideals. Let us protect our autonomy and continue to fight
                for liberty, trust and true solidarity.
                Anarchy works!
                All power to the affinity groups!
