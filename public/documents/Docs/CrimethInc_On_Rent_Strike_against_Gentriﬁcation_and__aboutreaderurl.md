Ex-Workers Collective 20-25 minutes In the Mission District of San Francisco, Station 40 has served the Bay Area community as an anti-authoritarian collective living and organizing space for nearly two decades. Five years ago, their landlord attempted to evict them, only to be forced to back down by a powerful coordinated solidarity campaign. Now, Station 40 has taken the initiative to respond to the crisis currently playing out across the world, unilaterally declaring a rent strike in response to the economic precarity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We interviewed residents of Station 40 about the history of their project and the context and objective of their bold refusal. What is Station 40? Station 40 is a 17-year-old collective living space that has seen hundreds of residents and thousands of guests and many iterations over the years. This space has hosted numerous and diverse events, housed countless people, served food to the masses, beat the odds on everything from infestations to evictions. We’ve been a hub for organizing Mutual Aid workshops, healing pop-ups, memorials for fallen anarchists, 1 of 17 10/29/25, 11:36 PM ``` -- ## Page 2 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 2](images/page_002_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 2 Complete](images/page_002_full.png) CrimethInc. : On Rent Strike against Gentrification and ... learn anything important from it? At the time, there was a large push for development in San Francisco. In response to the influx of venture capitalists and start-up companies, our landlords were looking for quick capital by selling their constellation of properties for a fast payout. The “Monster of the Mission”--a giant box of luxury housing not unlike the other developments that were popping up--was supposed to be erected across the street; property prices were skyrocketing. We had a pro bono lawyer who helped us, but ultimately the lawyer wanted us to settle and take the cash-for-keys so everyone would get a cut--of a payoff that could never match long-term affordable housing costs in the heart of this city. The housemates who were living together in Station 40 at that time decided to stay here instead. They employed a myriad of tactics, such as calling on the friends of Station 40 from around the world (an autonomous group of supporters who organized to support us), “knowing the enemy” (gathering information about our landlords via public records), holding a press conference and events and fundraisers, consulting housing militants and the local Land Trust, and coordinating with supportive independent journalists. We demanded that the building should go into a land trust and that our residency would be secured in perpetuity. We also made it clear that we would fight by any means to stay here. Two weeks into the fight, our landlords called us wanting to make peace; this resulted in a verbal agreement to leave us alone and revisit the issue in three years. 3 of 17 10/29/25, 11:36 PM ``` -- ## Page 4 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 4](images/page_004_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 4 Complete](images/page_004_full.png) CrimethInc. : On Rent Strike against Gentrification and ... • Tenants Fight Longtime Neighborhood Landlord at 16th and Mission • Housing collective avoids eviction from Mission district home Why did you decide to go on strike this time? Coronavirus first began getting traction around these parts via memes, fleeting stories from news sources, and whispers from friends of friends in social services. We began listening to the whispers early and prepared as much as possible. It was less than a week later when news from Italy started coming in, travel bans were put in place, and--most notably--the toilet paper was gone. Within a couple more days, all events were canceled, bars and restaurants had closed, and a soft lockdown quarantine was underway. At that point, 90% of the house had either lost work entirely or had their hours cut significantly. Meanwhile, the other 10% is now being asked to work twice as hard in social services to help maneuver through this crisis--but they are not getting paid any more for their extra efforts. This crisis has shined a glaring light on the injustices relating to housing inequality, the absence of affordable medical care, the astronomical costs of rent in the Bay Area, and the ways that capitalism robs us of our time, energy, and quality of life. When this situation became clear, there was no other choice but to declare a rent strike. Trying to hustle during a mandatory shut-in not only puts us in danger but also endangers others who are more vulnerable. However, this opens a larger question. Some projections say that after several weeks of this shutdown (though it may be 5 of 17 10/29/25, 11:36 PM ``` -- ## Page 6 ### Complete Page View ![Page 6 Complete](images/page_006_full.png) CrimethInc. : On Rent Strike against Gentrification and ... connect with community for the unforeseeable future, all-out dystopian biopolitical authoritarianism. But for us, it’s more interesting and exciting to think about what the best-case scenarios might be--the moments of imagination and creation--like a caterpillar dissolving in its cocoon, imagining itself into a butterfly. Imagine a world entirely without rent, in which people would have more time and space to envision and practice the things they love, the things that benefit them and their community alike. Imagine there being zero homelessness in the world because we took the ample empty housing currently available and gave it to houseless people, rather than letting those spaces sit vacant while real estate speculators wait to try to sell them to the highest bidder. How about not having to work 40 to 70 hours a week as a capitalist cog, making money for rich people who don’t care about whether we live or die? Imagine no one having crippling debt. Imagine there being free medical care and food for all, instead of us having to spend all our money funding colonization and murder worldwide. How wonderful would it be if the people took the streets, gathered together to dance, break bread, practice ritual… honestly, the possibilities are endless. I imagine a healthier population that respects the earth and all living beings, giving the land back to indigenous stewards, reparations for all enslaved peoples, the end of incarceration and the entire military-industrial complex. But we have to start somewhere. A widespread rent strike seems like as good a place as any. For our part, we would like our housing to be secure in 7 of 17 10/29/25, 11:36 PM ``` -- ## Page 8 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 8](images/page_008_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 8 Complete](images/page_008_full.png) CrimethInc. : On Rent Strike against Gentrification and ... Appendix II: Communiqué from the Anti- Eviction Campaign, March 2015 Station 40 Tenants Fight Eviction of Their Home and Propose “Win-Win” Land Trust Solution About a week ago, we received eviction papers (an unlawful detainer) from our landlords, Ahuva, Emanuel, and Barak Jolish. Their legal documents aim to displace the dozen of us tenants from our affordable, eleven-year-old home, Station 40, located at 3030B 16th Street. It is no coincidence that Station 9 of 17 10/29/25, 11:36 PM ``` -- ## Page 10 ### Complete Page View ![Page 10 Complete](images/page_010_full.png) CrimethInc. : On Rent Strike against Gentrification and ... home, which is now owned by the SF Land Trust. Patricia Kerman and Tom Rapp also won their eviction case against their landlord, but still struggle courageously to stay in their home. We have now been served eviction papers, too. Our turn has come, and we don’t intend to make it easy for our landlords. In the context of the rapid development and displacement in our neighborhood and on our corner, our own eviction comes as no surprise. When the proposed Maximus luxury apartments were announced, we all knew that we’d be next. If we were surprised, it was only with how quickly it happened. Within a week of that announcement, the Jolish family had already begun talking about getting us out. Ahuva Jolish repeated the now all too common refrain of “wanting to get out of the business”--a phrase that tenants throughout the city have come to dread as a signal for a brutal wave of eviction and redevelopment. Our position in this has remained the same: if the Jolish family wishes to sell this building, they should sell it to the San Francisco Community Land Trust--an option that would allow them to sell at a more than fair price and allows us to stay, still with affordable rents, while also keeping many of the other struggling neighbors in place. The offer from the land trust would make it possible to maintain and even create more housing for working-class and struggling people--in perpetuity. As soon as this offer was on the table, however, our landlords changed their tune. They now insist that they do not want to sell our building. This is a half-truth--in other words, a lie. Our home is sandwiched between two adjacent properties owned 11 of 17 10/29/25, 11:36 PM ``` -- ## Page 12 ### Complete Page View ![Page 12 Complete](images/page_012_full.png) CrimethInc. : On Rent Strike against Gentrification and ... apartment building that would take out a whole corner of businesses, a plaza used by hundreds of poor--mostly black and Latino people--and cast an ominous shadow over the playground of nearby Marshall Elementary. It turns out that one of the political consultants for Maximus, Jack Davis, is one of the main organizers of the Clean Up the Plaza scheme. Then the police occupation of the plaza began. Day and night, SFPD menaced over those who kick it in the plaza, such as immigrants, SRO residents and people without homes, addicts, working people, multigenerational families, and outcasts of all stripes. We watched from our windows across the street in horror as more and more of these people were targeted, criminalized, and disappeared. The insidious power plays used to displace people along with their culture at 16th and Mission are happening throughout the Mission District, Bay Area, and in many cities nationwide. There’s first the most obvious issue: evictions. Evictions come in the form of lawsuits where losing means potentially being forced to pay for your own attorney and your landlord’s attorney (who is likely getting paid $300 or much more per hour). This process takes months, and necessitates that you are able to go to meetings with lawyers and attend several court dates during work hours, among numerous other tasks that become a full-time job. Everyday people, the very people who make up the heart and soul of San Francisco cannot compete with this apparatus that is set up to work against them. The property “rights” of millionaires trump the basic needs of the rest of us to simply live. Then there’s the police state. Not only will the police come and 13 of 17 10/29/25, 11:36 PM ``` -- ## Page 14 ### Complete Page View ![Page 14 Complete](images/page_014_full.png) CrimethInc. : On Rent Strike against Gentrification and ... All this is happening while mysterious fires are destroying the homes of working-class people throughout the Mission District, leaving the next-door condos completely intact, and the city moves on plans to build an even bigger jail to replace the one at 850 Bryant. We know that the eviction of our space is a stepping-stone toward the eviction and demolition of this entire block. As of yet, the Jolish family has made no offer that we could accept and still hold our heads high. We want to maintain, defend, and build collective, autonomous, and working-class space in this neighborhood. We cannot accept any offers that do not make that possible. Even if we were made such an offer, we do not conceive of winning in solely individual terms. The choice to stay and fight is also a choice to fight for this neighborhood as a whole. We want to stay, but we also want everyone else to stay as well. We draw inspiration from all who are fighting for their lives and a place to live them: the indigenous people all over this continent who are occupying their sacred places to resist development; the squatters in the deindustrialized urban centers of the Midwest who are building homes amid the ruins; those in Athens and Barcelona who take to the streets in reaction to the evictions of long-standing occupied social centers; the Kurdish and international fighters in Kobane who have used all means to defend against fascist occupation; the fighters in Ferguson who have used similar means to resist the police occupation of their streets as well; and especially everyone in this neighborhood who has already stood up and refused to be moved now and in the past. 15 of 17 10/29/25, 11:36 PM ``` -- ## Page 16 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 16](images/page_016_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 16 Complete](images/page_016_full.png) CrimethInc. : On Rent Strike against Gentrification and ... 17 of 17 10/29/25, 11:36 PM ``` --
