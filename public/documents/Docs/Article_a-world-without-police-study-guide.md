## A World Without Police: Study Guide

## 1. The creation of police forces

Whitehouse, David. (2012).“Origins of the Police.”Libcom.org.Williams, Kristian. (2004).Our Enemies in Blue: Police and Power in America. New York: Soft Skull Press. Chapter 3.

- Why, in Whitehouse’s view, did police become necessary with the development of capitalist
society? How were police different from the forms of social control that existed before?- Summarize Williams’ account of the development of police departments alongside the development of capitalism, white supremacy, and state bureaucracies. How did the function and administration of police forces change along with society?- Williams complicates the view that police are simply hired thugs for the white ruling class. How do different sections of the capitalist class and middle classes compete to have their interests served by police, in Williams’ account?

## 2. The police role in capitalist society

Pg. 22-39.Gordon, Todd. (2006).Cops, crime and capitalism: The law and order agenda in Canada. Halifax: Fernwood. Chapter 2.

- Both authors argue that police power worked not only to repress, but also to create a
working class suitable for capitalism. What are some of the fundamental characteristics of capitalist “order”? What working class behaviors endanger it, and what behaviors fit within it?- How does policing distinguish and drive a wedge between the “respectable” working class and
the dangerous, indigent poor? How is this process related to racial and gender divisions in society? Does policing do the same thing today? How?

- What is your understanding of the police role in capitalist society, so far? Why might fulfilling
this role also require upholding white supremacy?- How has policing upheld white supremacy and racism in the past? How did policing shift with the Civil Rights movement, and how does “color-blind” policing uphold white supremacy today?- What role does Williams’ believe police have played in the struggle between capital and labor? As Williams says, labor struggles are more institutionalized today–do police still play the same role? If so, how? If not, what role do they play now?

- What role do the police play in enforcing the gender binary (the idea that there are only two
genders, male and female, each marked by specific behaviors and appearances)?- What are some ways that law enforcement of immigration, domestic violence, sex work, and drug enforcement policies serve to make women and gender non-conforming people more vulnerable to sexual violence?- How are non-normative or queer sexualities regulated and criminalized under capitalism? What forms of punishment and repression does that criminalization take on, and how are those shaped by the the time period & historical context in which they occur?

fight for their own group interests, is this good or bad for working class people?- When and why do police unions come into conflict with local city governments? What are the possible endgames of these conflicts?- How might a powerful social movement fuel, intervene in, or redirect conflicts between police and the government?
