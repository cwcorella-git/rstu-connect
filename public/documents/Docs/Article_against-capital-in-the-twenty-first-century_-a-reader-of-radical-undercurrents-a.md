## Praise for
## Against Capital in the Twenty-First Century

“In Against Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Asimakopoulos and GilmanOpalsky have assembled a collection of texts that traverses the borders of Marxism, feminist radicalisms, anarchism, and the interstices existing between them. This will be the leading collection for contemporary students of radical thought and practitioners of freedom for decades to come.” —Dr Sannn, editor of The End of the World as We Know It? Crisis, Resistance, and the Age of Austerity and coauthor of Political Sociology: Oppression, Resistance, and the State
“Against Capital in the Twenty-First Century is more than just a reader. Drawing upon a vast body of theoretical, scholarly, and political literature, ranging from the theoretical ideas of Cornelius Castoriadis to the transformative analysis of Staughton Lynd, this book generates stunning insights into the continuity and transformation of radical thought. It deserves the widest possible readership.” —Andrj Grbačć, Professor and Chair of the Department of Anthropology and Social Change at the California Institute of Integral Studies
“In this extremely timely volume, Asimakopoulos and Gilman-Opalsky do an excellent job of weaving together the loose and disparate ends of transformative theory into a unified, mutually reinforcing whole. Against Capital in the Twenty-First Century is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the theoretical and practical trajectory of radical thought in today’s world.” —Naan J. Jn, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Midwestern State University

Against Capital in the
## Twenty-First Century

         Introduction
        Against Capital in the Twenty-First Century
        R G-O  J A
UndercUrrents In December 1917, the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci wrote a short essay, “The Revolution against Capital,” the title of which alludes to the title of Karl Marx’s major work. Gramsci observed that the Bolsheviks had made a revolution that undermined and refuted several of Marx’s defining theoretical insights. The revolution challenged Marx’s critique of ideology and his theory of historical conflict and change.
    Gramsci observes that the revolution
consists more of ideologies than of events. . . . This is the revolution against Karl Marx’s Capital. In Russia, Marx’s Capital was more the book of the bourgeoisie than of the proletariat. It stood as the critical demonstration of how events should follow a predetermined course: how in Russia a bourgeoisie had to develop, and a capitalist era had to open, with the setting-up of a Western-type civilization, before the proletariat could even think in terms of its own revolt, its own class demands, its own revolution.
However, war-torn Russia was far from the industrial capitalism of the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and France. The revolution seemed to happen prematurely, before capitalist development made it necessary, before capital could prepare society for the great conflict and change. Gramsci insisted that Marx’s theory of revolution would hold true “in normal times”

## 2 | I n t rodU c t Ion

and “under normal conditions” but that the proliferation of radical ideas and other unexpected instabilities might bring revolution under completely different circumstances.
     Gramsci, who remained a Marxist, did not intend to oppose the whole
of Marx’s major work. His critique of Marx and Marxism was not a rejection but an effort to make Marx speak to unforeseen conditions. Indeed, the creative development and future relevance of Marx’s radical thinking depended (and still depends) on others to come after and rethink it in new directions.
     Needless to say, we have less affection for Thomas Piketty than Gramsci
had for Marx. But although our disagreements run deeper, and our critical knives are sharper, Against Capital in the Twenty-First Century is not an attack on Piketty’s famous book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century.
     Piketty’s book was more of an event than a book. It interrupted and intervened in many discussions within and beyond academia. Most scholarly
books would like to be such an event as Piketty’s, but few are. And although we read Capital in the Twenty-First Century with much appreciation for its content and reception, the fact that it simultaneously condemns and accepts the failures of capitalism demands the response of this volume.
     The authors in this volume do not address Piketty directly, but all of
them undermine and reject his acceptance of the logic of capital and his foregone conclusion that the twenty-first century will be given over to capital just as the previous two centuries were. Against Capital in the Twenty-First Century presents a diversity of rival analyses and visions opposed to the idea that capital should have yet another century to govern human and nonhuman resources in the interest of profit and accumulation. Piketty demonstrates with decisive clarity that capitalism generates inequality through its own logic, no matter where and how well it is working, and more so now than ever. Nonetheless, he concludes that what capital really needs is to be more effectively and aggressively regulated through taxes.
     Against Capital in the Twenty-First Century adopts an opposing thesis:
that radical alternatives are necessary and possible. In fact, transformative, revolutionary, and abolitionist responses to capital are even more necessary in the twenty-first century than they ever were. Some of that argumentation is undertaken in this introductory essay. And further to that end, this book presents a reader of radical undercurrents to substantiate its opening claims.
     Radical undercurrent does not, for us, mean obscure or unknown. While
some of the authors in this volume would rightly be regarded as relatively obscure, others’ names will stand out as major or even famous figures in their fields. Some pack university auditoriums and overflow rooms. Why, then, the invocation of undercurrents?

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 3

     An undercurrent is a strong force underneath the main flow. The undercurrents we pool together in this volume are also countercurrents of counterhegemonic directions and thus not prominently expressed with clarity and
regularity in plain sight. A theoretical undercurrent is much like the physical undercurrent of water in that it moves below the surface and in a different direction than the current on the surface. It carries the promise, the potential of a new reality.
     So many questionable positions are accepted as indisputable facts (e.g.,
that the United States is a democracy). In the dominant surface currents (which still run deep!), communism and anarchism represent traditions of antihuman violence and tyranny. Yet the violence of capital and the military are scarcely recognized as violent at all. In the surface currents, government is always and obviously necessary, for we swallow the Hobbesian notion that we would kill one another without it. And capitalist society, for all of its faults, is accepted as a natural and inevitable human situation. In the surface currents, the total acceptance of capital and state is perfectly synonymous with being reasonable.
     The surface currents also carry ideals of justice, human rights, fairness,
equality, and ecology forward as clear virtues, but only in a dilapidated and superficial way (an ironic superficiality within the surface). In fact, these words have been stripped of all original meanings and rebranded to mean anything good but nothing in particular. They have become “simulacra,” in Jean Baudrillard’s terms. For example, those who sing the praises and virtues of democracy regularly condemn the demos whenever it speaks in the streets or does not vote the way elites wish. Those who demand justice often accept as just a for-profit carceral state. Those who claim to love human rights and fairness regularly accept the pretensions of humanitarian warfare conceptualizing fairness only within the context of competition. That old, abused, classical virtue of equality is more often wielded as a bludgeon against any attempt to highlight a real differential of needs between real people in the real world. In the name of equality, we are often asked to ignore real inequalities on the basis of race, class, gender, and sexuality. And finally, ecological sensibilities are personalized so that one may be expected to shop and live green while ignoring massive and systematic deforestation and historical destruction and waste that we are encouraged to accept as out of our hands.
     All of this and more flows in the surface current and characterizes it. But
this surface current is not the only flow. There are different directions underneath, and there are advantages to depth, to getting down to the ground below, to the roots of things (more on which things in a moment).
     In a strange way, Piketty is an undercurrent. What he has to say about
capitalism, the social state, and taxation is still not said by anyone running

## 4 | I n t rodU c t Ion

for the presidency in the United States. Piketty, Robert Reich, and Elizabeth Warren represent different sides of the same capitalist coin. This is partly why we specify not simply undercurrents but, rather, radical undercurrents. Like undercurrent, the term radical also indicates a digging down underneath the surface, but in a different way.
     We are interested in the contrary undercurrents that would radically
transform the whole flow of things, the flow of life, of human (exchange) relations, of time and space. Inasmuch as Piketty is an undercurrent, he is just under the surface (like a Bernie Sanders). Not all undercurrents are of equal depth, and some are too close to the main flows. Piketty, for example, does not grasp at the roots in order to pull them out. He reaches up only to push against the flow at certain points, to divert its direction where the water meets his hands, but he holds out no hope for a stoppage or reversal; nor does he seem to even want something different than the currents he condemns. He wants only a less condemnable capital, an obedient capital that has been brought to heel—a contradiction in terms.
     From the seventeenth century, radical referred to the root of a word, and
earlier in the fourteenth century, the Latin radicalis indicated the roots as in the origins, as in the word radish, which shares its etymology. The radish is a root vegetable, with its most coveted part growing underground. It was not until the early nineteenth century that the word radical took the meaning of dealing with social and political problems by going to their root causes. Interestingly, Piketty finds capital at the root of growing global inequality, and yet he remains distinctly committed to leaving its roots firmly planted and well watered. Not so odd, perhaps, given that Piketty is not a radical.
     On the contrary, we have selected texts that we feel are important to
the theorization of a twenty-first-century radical politics capable of a deep critique of both the logic and conditions of the existing capitalist world. For us, revolutionary change must be transformative, meaning structural transformation. To this end we have identified content that we believe significantly contributes to present and future conversations about the possibility and desirability of global revolutionary transformations.
     Many of our authors are Gramsci’s contemporary organic intellectuals.
They represent not the juxtaposition of different forms of capitalism but the evolution of humanity into new forms of social organization. Their rival visions propose a diverse range of historical developments based on community, ecological balance, and happiness, rather than exploitation, ecological destruction, and suffering. Capitalist reform aims to repair the irreparable, a stillborn proposition. As individuals, our contributors may sound like fringe voices. But together, they give voice to the crises and hopes of a global ma-

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 5

jority of impoverished and increasingly precarious people. They amplify the voice of capital’s victims.
     Contributions have been selected according to three basic criteria. First,
they offer a deep critique of capitalism; inequality; cultural, social, political, and ecological conditions; and everyday life as it is presently structured. We are committed to transformative projects that are not reconciled with a state of affairs they object to. Although some have nothing else in common with Marx while others have plenty, they all agree with his interest in “the real movement which abolishes the present state of things.”
     Second, the authors in this volume do not share a unitary perspective on
the state. Some criticize the top-down politics of statist leftism, while others are deeply suspicious of the efficacy of state-based solutions.
     In the twentieth century, states did not even come close to solving the
problems of capital or inequality, although many tried. To sharpen this point, we observe that today racism flourishes and flares up everywhere in response to immigrants, refugees, and uprisings of black and brown people around the world. Sexism rages on and is even extended and emboldened in reaction to new challenges confronting sanctioned norms of gender and sexuality. Inequality and poverty have only grown worldwide, as Piketty and others expertly demonstrate, despite the liberal reformism of governors everywhere. So many states have thrown their weight in the direction of solving these problems, but either they do not really want to or they cannot succeed (or maybe both). Moreover, states have invariably repressed, co-opted, and contaminated, criminalized, or outright combated the revolutionary energies of society. Government prefers to divert revolutionary energies into its own parties and institutions to instrumentalize social disaffection for its own purposes.
     This does not mean our book is decisively anarchist, although we do
draw in affirmative and constructive ways from a rich history of anarchist theory and action. In fact, many radicals, communists, artists, and other theorists and writers have criticized both anarchism and statism. What you will find in this volume is a general attraction to politics by other means than political institutions.
     Third, we hope to embody and reflect a real diversity in radical thinking,
reaching beyond a few narrow themes or disciplines, beyond the borders of any one ideological perspective. To be nonideological is not to be apolitical. To be nonideological is to be open to a synthetic and critical consideration of good ideas, regardless of their source—a task that sectarianism is incapable of.
     Indeed, we maintain that radical politics must leave behind nineteenthand twentieth-century ideological dogma. Is it really too much to finally

## 6 | I n t rodU c t Ion

acknowledge that the anarchists were right about many things where the Marxists were wrong? Is it too much to appreciate that good anarchists will have learned much from Marx, who has done more than anyone since to name and understand the power of capital? Is it not possible to fully reject idiotic false choices between class and gender? Can we finally insist on the necessity of taking seriously all the work that takes up all of these cleavages in social life? And what do we do with culture, ideology, and ecology? Do we continue to choose a commitment to one against the others, say to economy or ecology? Or do we instead strive to make our analysis as multifarious as the reality it seeks to understand, as complex as the world it wants to transform?
    Nonetheless, this book leaves out a whole lot. Readers who will eagerly
point out all that is missing here, who will lament any of the many deficits and oversights, will likely have our sympathies. One might imagine a small library of similar books in numbered volumes to even come close to bringing together the diverse universe of radical undercurrents. We have made difficult choices so that we can compile an anticapitalist and antistatist work from multiple traditions and trajectories, bringing together different forms of Marxism, anarchism, libertarian socialism, critical theory, radical feminism, and autonomist politics, among other affinities within our milieu. The choice to centralize these tendencies reflects both the theoretical and political commitments of the editors.
PIketty’s LaUnchPad Thomas Piketty’s fifteen-year study on wealth and inequality was “based on much more extensive historical and comparative data than were available to previous researchers, data covering three centuries and more than twenty countries,” and thus it provides an impressively multinational and historically rich picture of capitalist tendencies and effects. Quibbles with and challenges to Piketty’s picture have on the whole been surprisingly minor. Most of the disagreement takes issue with certain interpretations and methodologies but nothing that refutes or reverses his general conclusions, which have been widely accepted as authoritative by scholars across the social sciences. Disagreement could have been predicted with absolute certainty, since Piketty finds that capital generates the opposite of what neoliberal and neoclassical economists claim: the freedom and historical tendencies of capital generate more inequality, less democracy, less opportunity, and consolidations of wealth and political power that are dangerous to life.
    Piketty both appreciates and criticizes Marx. He posits that “economic
theory needs to be rooted in historical sources that are as complete as possible, and in this respect Marx did not exploit all the possibilities available to

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 7

him.” From Piketty’s economistic view, Marx was not a very good economist. Of course, Marx wrote a dissertation in philosophy on the Democritean and Epicurean philosophy of nature, was consumed in his early years with the Hegelianism of midnineteenth-century Berlin, and was not particularly interested in being an economist any more than a historian, anthropologist, sociologist, or revolutionary. He found plenty to condemn in David Ricardo, Jean-Baptiste Say, and Adam Smith. Marx was never keen to be measured by disciplines, and his life’s work still stands as an iconic critique of disciplinarity as such.
     Piketty measures Marx’s work not from a wide interdisciplinary academic
or even political point of view but only as an economist. When he comments directly on Marx’s Capital, he observes:
    Marx usually adopted a fairly anecdotal and unsystematic approach
    to the available statistics. . . . The most surprising thing, given that
    his book was devoted largely to the question of capital accumulation,
    is that he makes no reference to the numerous attempts to estimate
    the British capital stock that had been carried out since the beginning
    of the eighteenth century and extended in the nineteenth century. . . .
    Marx seems to have missed entirely the work on national accounting
    that was developing around him, and this is all the more unfortunate
    in that it would have enabled him to some extent to confirm his intuitions . . . and above all to clarify his explanatory model.
     We concede that Piketty rightly highlights statistical oversights and
methodological failures that are surprising from an economist’s perspective. And we may add that there are many other oversights and failures in Marx’s work, from sociological, historical, political, and philosophical perspectives, which of course, so many sociologists, historians, political scientists, and philosophers have written about over the past 160 years. But when the best of Marx’s critics (e.g., Antonio Gramsci, Georg Lukács, and Silvia Federici) criticize him, they do not throw out the whole discourse on social and political transformation, human liberation, human suffering, and revolution. The best of Marx’s critics nonetheless agreed with Marx when he wrote, “Our concern cannot simply be to modify private property, but to abolish it, not to hush up class antagonisms but to abolish classes, not to improve the existing society but to found a new one.”
     But Piketty is not among the best of Marx’s critics. He abandons everything in Marx’s critical and revolutionary thinking, even though the
statistical oversights that Piketty points out and compensates for further substantiate Marx’s basic economic analysis. In fact, Piketty goes much further

## 8 | I n t rodU c t Ion

than Marx ever could in documenting and demonstrating the catastrophic tendencies and material effects of capitalism. Yet Piketty ultimately adopts a less critical and an antirevolutionary position. His research both strengthens Marx’s arguments and rejects them without argument. But if the missing economic analysis in Marx’s work is not dissuasive of his general perspective, then we might wonder what is.
     We might wonder if the problem for Piketty (and so many of his readers)
is not so much that Marx was not the optimal economist but rather that Piketty is too much the (neo)liberal. It is precisely the radical content of Marx that (neo)liberals always reject, not so much by way of argumentation but by way of ideological commitment. In other words, Piketty’s rejection of Marx’s critical and revolutionary perspective cannot simply be due to the fact that Piketty is an economist. It is worth pointing out here that one coeditor of this book is classically trained in, and professor of, economics, political science, and sociology. The other coeditor is classically trained in, and professor of, philosophy and political science. We aim to deploy the interdisciplinary resources that Piketty admires yet neglects.
     Piketty himself explains why the field of economics, especially in the
United States, affirms the existing capitalist reality: “Among the members of these upper income groups are US academic economists, many of whom believe that the economy of the United States is working fairly well and, in particular, that it rewards talent and merit accurately and precisely.” Therefore, economic analysis alone guarantees no sure precision, for as Piketty claims, it is commonly disfigured by the ideological and class positions of the economists. But what of Piketty’s own ideology and its role in shaping his work and conclusions? He is himself an upper-income academic (bourgeois) economist who, in interviews, is quick to point out that he is neither a Marxist nor against capitalism.
     Although Piketty claims that inequality “cannot be reduced to purely
economic mechanisms,” he fails to consider that inequality is only one feature of a system that does harm on so many other levels, including the ecological, psychological, and social. Here we see the poverty of disciplines and the value of intersectionality that is so central to autonomist communist and anarchist analyses. While the present volume leaves gaps of its own, it aims to fill in many of those left by Piketty. But the holes we seek to fill are not left by a simple oversight. The problems taken up in this volume derive from a much more dangerous and fundamental error in the world—namely, from all of the thinking, speaking, and writing about capital and capitalism without even knowing what capital or capitalism is! As David Graeber writes, “All this raises the question of what ‘capitalism’ is to begin with, a question on which there is no consensus at all.”

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 9

    Piketty has written the most influential book on capital and capitalism in
the past several decades, and yet he does not know what the basic terms and concepts of his work mean. Consider his decision to “use the words ‘capital’ and ‘wealth’ interchangeably, as if they were perfectly synonymous.” This was not only a decision, as Piketty claims, “to simplify the text.” It was a decision that guaranteed his book would not be about capital or capitalism, but rather, about wealth and income inequality.
    Wealth is not capital. Capital is not something in the world that we can
measure, although its effects can be measured. Capital is a logic that organizes the world, work, education, home life, social life, entertainment, news media, our free time, and indeed, most of our wakeful state. So capital is not merely a logic in some philosophical sense, for it concretely organizes real life from birth to death. It is an ideology materialized. Wealth can be defined at and above a certain income level, but it is one of thousands of outcomes of the capitalist organization of life. However, poverty is yet another outcome of capital, and it would have made no less sense to equate capital and capitalism with poverty, especially since most people living in the capitalist world are poor. Capital is no more wealth than it is poverty—a basic point lost on Piketty.
    As Marx defined it in 1844, “capital is thus the governing power over labor
and its products. The capitalist possesses this power, not on account of his personal or human qualities, but inasmuch as he is an owner of capital. His power is the purchasing power of his capital, which nothing can withstand. Later we shall see first how the capitalist, by means of capital, exercises his governing power over labor, then, however, we shall see the governing power of capital over the capitalist himself.”
    Thus, while one could be said to own capital, capital is a power that
governs, including those who own it. Governments are governed by capital. Work is governed by capital, but so is nonwork inasmuch as the times and spaces when we are not working are also largely determined by the logic of capital. But Marx’s definition of capital specifies other necessary dimensions, specifically capitalist purchasing power. This means that capital converts the ability to buy things in the capitalist marketplace into power. Thus, capital makes it sensible to speak of the “power” to have food, the “power” to move from one place to another (power of mobility), the “power” to have housing or medicine or education or water or a few extra inches of legroom on a plane. Power does not need to be defined as capital defines it, and neither does value or freedom or virtue.
    Critical to Marx’s definition is that the governing power of capital governs the capitalist himself. Here, we can and must also distinguish capital
from wealth in the following way: Whereas wealth is an instrument of the

## 10 | I n t rodU c t Ion

capitalist, the capitalist is an instrument of capital. The capitalist does what he does, thinks what he thinks, aspires what he aspires to do and to be, and accepts a moral point of view—a comprehensive worldview—all made by capital. The aspirations of capitalists do not come from nowhere. Capitalist society educates and acculturates generations of true believers to accept the virtues of a highly individualist “familial-vocational privatism.” A world without capitalists is no capitalist world. Understanding this is critical to the rejection of Piketty’s conflation of wealth with capital. In recent U.S. politics, for example, consider the millions of Trump supporters from the impoverished white working class who energetically defend capitalist society while possessing no wealth of their own. From bottom to top, those who defend and perpetuate capitalist ideology are instruments of capital.
     In short, capital is a governing power, a purchasing power, a power that
governs both the governed and the governors themselves. Capitalism, then, refers to the whole ideological apparatus that promotes and proliferates capital as the ideal logic of social (and economic, political, cultural, and ecological) organization. And finally, capitalist describes (or names) forms of life, social, political, and economic systems, and the people who embody, reflect, and reproduce the power of capital.
     This basic understanding of capital is absent when Piketty conflates capital with wealth. It turns out that wealth is only a form of capital inasmuch
as it corresponds to and determines purchasing power. Nonetheless, it is possible to make public space, education, food, water, health care, and housing free for everyone who needs or wants them, and thus to decouple such things from wealth, from the commodity form altogether. This is not utopian. It refers to a past, present, and future populated with many familiar examples. Public parks, universities, health care systems, and so on can be found in capitalist societies, so they are not even radical or revolutionary. The closest we can come to Piketty would be to say that in capitalist societies, all wealth is capital (in terms of purchasing power), but not all capital is wealth. In reducing capital to wealth, Piketty not only makes a fatal mistake in defining the central concept of his study but also betrays his opening declaration that we must not make economic reductions. In this volume, wealth is taken up as a feature of capitalist society, but so are many features other than wealth. Max Weber comes to mind; in contrast to Marx, he analyzed stratification by class, prestige, and power.
     Another reason we are against capital in the twenty-first century, whereas
Piketty is not, is that we understand capital as a power that governs everything to the detriment of everything. We are against capital in the twentyfirst century because it is unacceptable not only in terms of income inequality

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 11

but also in terms of ecological crisis, human psychological and physical health, human security, and an ethical and democratic political situation.
    Even if we restricted ourselves to the sole focus on inequality provided
by Piketty, allowing capital to govern another century would be unacceptable. Piketty informs his readers that “global inequality ranges from regions in which the per capita income is on the order of 150–250 euros per month (sub-Saharan Africa, India) to regions where it is as high as 2,500–3,000 euros per month (Western Europe, North America, Japan), that is, ten to twenty times higher. The global average, which is roughly equal to the Chinese average, is around 600–800 euros per month.” Aside from the fact that millions in Western Europe, North America, and Japan are making closer to (and less than) the global average, the average itself is unacceptable, and not only from a radical perspective. This global average is well under 10,000 euros per year, which is not a livable wage. On an annual basis, it breaks down to roughly 5 euros an hour at a thirty-five-hour workweek.
    Compared to this global average, even after controlling for the relative
valuation of the euro, the recent “leftist” demand in the United States for $15 an hour appears just as radical as it’s made out to be by advocates and critics. Activists and advocates in the “fight for 15” take pride in their high wage demand, while detractors agree that the demand is high—indeed, too high to be practical. And yet $15 an hour comes out to about $25,000 a year (at a thirty-five-hour workweek). This would have been less than a living income for a lower-middle-class family of two to three in 1950. Therefore, what is put forward as a radical demand in 2016 would have been a tepid and reasonable expectation over sixty years ago. Moreover, the average hours worked by Americans increased as incomes stagnated. Americans now work more hours per year than in any other country, surpassing Japan. And Americans receive fewer holidays and less vacation time or sick days than is standard in much of the world. This should give the reader some sense of the beaten-down and dilapidated state of today’s liberal wage politics.
    Piketty’s focus on practicality partly explains why his conclusions are so
conservative (more on this later). But in light of the politics of global income inequality, it turns out that what is “practical” is not only unacceptable but possibly even impossible—that is, unlivable—for most. Thus capitalism defines practicality as the acceptance of a reality that is impractical for most of us.
    Piketty understands well the distribution problem that he presents with
clarity and an appropriate severity: “The current per capita national income in Britain and France is on the order of 30,000 euros per year, and national capital is about 6 times national income, or roughly 180,000 euros per head.” That the populations of these countries generate massive national

## 12 | I n t rodUc t Ion

wealth that they cannot keep or share is fundamental to capitalism. People’s incomes could of course reflect a fairer distribution of this national wealth— the money is there—but that is not capitalism. The British and French governments, despite the rhetorical and ideological differences of the parties in power, do not and cannot oppose this capitalist separation of national capital from national income. That is because the parties do not govern capital. To the contrary, the parties are governed by capital(ists). President François Hollande, with a life in the French Socialist Party dating back to the 1970s, knew well that this capitalist separation of people from the very capital that they generate (capital in Piketty’s sense of wealth) was off-limits to his “socialist” regime. If Hollande had sought to reverse this separation, he would not have been president.
    Piketty has a different view here. For example, he recognizes that prior
to the end of the Cold War, the forms of inequality we now see were almost nonexistent in the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc. “All signs are that the distribution was strictly the opposite: private wealth was insignificant (limited to individual plots of land and perhaps some housing in the Communist countries least averse to private property but in all cases less than a year’s national income), and public capital represented the totality of industrial capital and the lion’s share of national capital. . . . In other words, at first sight, the stock of national capital did not change, but the public-private split was totally reversed.”
    Following this, one might expect a defense of Soviet “communism,” but
Piketty knows better than to romanticize or to take as his model post-Stalinist Russia. And although he does call for a kind of state capitalism, he knows better than to call for a revival of the collapsed bureaucratic capitalism of the previous century. One major reason why Piketty does not call for anything like the Soviet example is that, for him, the bureaucratic state capitalism of the twentieth century is simply what is meant by communism, and of course, we cannot be communists today. Anarchists, Marxists, and other radicals have theorized communism in multifarious ways, few of which romanticize or defend Soviet statism. The idea that what is called revolution, communism, and, more broadly, anticapitalism amounts to nothing more than the iconic caricatures and catastrophes of twentieth-century Stalinism and Cold War ideology is a major part of the problem. That notion makes us fear and reject anything other than capitalism and has effectively done so for over a century. In a critical con, post-Fordist capitalism (integrated spectacle) has convinced us not to accept the old capitalism (concentrated spectacle) in favor of a more flexible, “freer,” and supposedly more democratic capitalism. If one accepts that every alternative to capitalism has proven disastrous, then a resigned acceptance of capitalist permanence stands to reason. And alas, like so many

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 13

of the neoclassical economists he criticizes, Piketty likewise falls prey to the same tired conflation, namely, that all radical alternatives have been tested and failed, echoing the discredited “end of history” thesis. Piketty simultaneously proves capitalism disastrous and accepts its permanence.
    In Chapter 11 of Capital in the Twenty-First Century, “Merit and Inheritance in the Long Run,” Piketty demonstrates that inequality will grow, poverty will be more consolidated and devastating, and exclusions more brutal in
the twenty-first century than in the nineteenth and twentieth. He shows how the old meritocratic belief about people getting what they’re worth and what they’ve actually earned is not evidenced in the research and “that the most meritocratic beliefs are often invoked to justify very large wage inequalities, which are said to be more justified than inequalities due to inheritance.” Perversely, capitalism continues to actively defend inequality with a meritocratic ideology, and capitalists have the same reply ready at their lips.
aPoLogetIcs and taxes To Piketty’s credit, his research exposes with remarkable clarity the increasing financial violence of capital over the past three hundred years. He shows that capital’s tendencies are to exacerbate, not to remedy economic violence. No methodological or interpretive quibble refutes this well-demonstrated tendency toward severe inequality, surpassing that during feudal times.
     Yet the meritocratic discourse that Piketty skewers remains a central
part of a highly developed capitalist “apologetics,” to use Marx’s term.  Capitalist apologists today defend the poverty and power that capital consolidates globally. They explain away crises as miraculously having nothing to do with capital or capitalism directly. As Marx put it, “Instead of investigating the nature of the conflicting elements which erupt in the catastrophe, the apologists content themselves with denying the catastrophe itself and insisting, in the face of their regular and periodic recurrence, that if production were carried on according to the textbooks, crises would never occur.” Economists today, expressing the meritocratic ideology of neoliberal capitalism, reliably insist that the current crisis was in no way caused by capitalism but by any number of epiphenomenal factors. And to its credit, Piketty’s book serves as a fierce tome against such apologetics. What apologists do not realize is that real-world capitalism has indeed operated according to the textbooks. The actual outcomes of capitalist economics are disowned by apologists who refuse to acknowledge capitalism’s paternity.
     In light of this, could Piketty have written the introduction to this book,
Against Capital in the Twenty-First Century? Based on the first 467 pages of

## 14 | I n t rodU c t Ion

his book, it would seem that no other position could survive the evidence of his research than one opposing capital in the twenty-first century.
     But then Piketty wrote Part Four of his book, espousing a position far
worse than that of the meritocratic apologists who deny the most basic contradictions of capital. The final four chapters of Part Four contain Piketty’s stupefying full acceptance of the capital he condemns. This leads him to conclude with an unimaginative repetition of the same hackneyed recommendations: redistribution (read: alleviation) through tax policy like those of Joseph Stiglitz. Piketty calls for a new social state that can levy “a truly global tax on capital.” He insists this is not utopian, and we believe him!
     For all his talk about the poverty of narrow economistic analyses, Piketty’s tome ignores the workings of the political system under capitalism
that he relies on for his solutions. Had he attended to the problem of governments governed by capital, it would have been necessary to acknowledge that the political structure is a mirror image of capitalism. This is basic political economy. Here is one of his biggest logical fallacies. Piketty argues that capitalism is an economic system that needs to be regulated by a political system based on the assumption that political systems are distinct from economic systems. But if the political and economic systems are interconnected as a unitary capitalist structure, would we not need regulation within both the economic and political structures? Who, other than capital, will reregulate the political structure?
     Piketty may not know or wish to publicly acknowledge what is necessary
to wrest even such mundane concessions as tax redistribution from governments beholden to and run by elites. Marxists, some socialists, autonomists, anarchists, and many others agree: change cannot occur within the limits of the existing political structure. It is imposed from outside institutional processes. Therefore, there will be violence for change. What constitutes violence, and what justifies it (if anything does), are major and defining questions in philosophy and politics. What is easier to conclude is that the state is responsible for most of the worst violence in human history. Some advocate property destruction because violence can only be committed against a person. Some, such as Mikhail Bakunin, accept violence against people (e.g., elites and state functionaries), whereas others believe in peaceful civil disobedience. Some Marxists believe in revolution to take over the state, a violent proposition. Some anarchists believe in a revolution to end the state. The editors of this volume have argued for insurrection, since insurrections are the active processes of revolutionary transformation—a topic addressed by both in other works. We argue that insurrection may be the radical undercurrent of revolution. For example, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and the Egyptian Revolution established new situations with

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 15

new problems that could only be addressed by new insurrections. Uprisings from within (and against) the new reality give impetus to change it. In the French, Russian, and Egyptian examples, one can see revolution setting the stage for autocracy, state capitalism, and military rule, respectively. We do not defend the earlier monarchical, tsarist, and dictatorial forms but recognize that insurrection is the real dialectical force of negation.
     In fact, getting governments to govern the capital that governs them is
less likely than global revolt. Even if the global tax were possible, what would it do? Would national capital be distributed (more) equally? If so, by whom and by what powers? Piketty presents “the return of the state,” which shares his egalitarian values and hopes, as an answer to the most recent economic crisis of 2008. Such a state can then reverse the current relationship of capital to governance. He does not call for the return of the failed “socialist state” but rather for a new “social state” that can bring capital back under its administrative control. We understand Piketty’s instinct to defend against the charge of utopianism here, especially since the past four decades have witnessed the neoliberal abolition of the last known social states (e.g., in Western Europe).
     In Piketty’s proposal, everything old is new again: “Modern redistribution does not consist in transferring income from the rich to the poor. . . . It
consists rather in financing public services and replacement incomes that are more or less equal for everyone, especially in the areas of health, education, and pensions.” What we have seen instead is the privatization of health, education, and pensions. Public universities have shifted increasingly to a tuition revenue model. Piketty recognizes that “parents’ income has become an almost perfect predictor of university access.” And health care is increasingly outsourced to and/or underwritten by private for-profit corporations, even in the case of public options that depend on private firms, and a pharmaceutical industry that sees illness as profit. What about pensions? Aside from rising retirement ages globally, pensions (not to mention social security) don’t even exist in many of the states where they once did. Pensions are among the first things commonly placed on the chopping block under the auspices of budget cuts and austerity. Where does the hope for a social state that will rise to these challenges come from?
     We now know that it was not the hopeful antiausterity-movementturned-government of Syriza in Greece. Syriza stood up to the troika, saying
no to a future governed by European austerity, and then agreed to exactly that future. Even a “radical” government like Syriza, which was made possible only by years of insurrection and a culture of revolt following the crises of 2008, could do nothing to reverse unemployment, shrinking pensions, and high taxes on impoverished people. Syriza was the brightest political light

## 16 | I n t rodU c t Ion

against capital since the recent global crisis broke out into world news. Now, Syriza participates in the realization of capital’s dream: no opposition, further privatization, and debt bondage.
    Perhaps Piketty found hope in the pseudosocialist rule of his own President Hollande in France, who was more fiercely and overwhelmingly opposed by the Left than any regime since 1968. The powerful movement of
Nuit Debout from March 2016 expressed the revolutionary disaffection of millions against Hollande, who trust their insurrection more than they trust their “socialist state.” And does anyone really think that Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the Labour Party will reverse recent introductions of university tuition and restore the services hobbled by austerity? In fact, Corbyn’s leadership was soon challenged by the Brexit referendum vote in June 2016, the outcome of which testified to the enduring strength of nationalist and capitalist self-interest in Europe today.
    The irrefutable fact of the matter is that capital is going in the exact opposite of the direction in which Piketty would like it to go. Worse, capital
governs precisely those governments that would be the most likely to tame it. There is more hope in the groundswells of revolt that made Syriza and Corbyn possible, and there is more hope in Nuit Debout, than there is in Syriza, the Labour Party, or the French Socialist Party—unless they enter formal politics, which we would argue was the trajectory of Syriza: insurrection coalesces into social movement; the movement chooses to form a political party as the best way to obtain change; the political party struggles for representation in political institutions (e.g., parliament); it may become a powerless opposition; sometimes it forms a government; and then comes the realization of why many consider working through existing political processes a fool’s errand.
    But like most liberals, Piketty never takes a serious look at such powers
from below, at the expression of social and political energies beneath and against the administrative apparatus of the state. Such forces and expressions may help or hinder the emergence of the great social state, but what we really need, Piketty maintains, is the power of an administered economy back once again, one more try, and this time for good.
    If you think we are melodramatic, unduly fixated on a minor disagreement, or perhaps a little unfair, we can correct that misperception now. To
demonstrate the ultimate poverty of Piketty’s perspective, let us finally look at the single most dumbfounding and backward claim in his whole book.
    He claims that taxation is “preeminently a political and philosophical
issue, perhaps the most important of all political issues. Without taxes, society has no common destiny, and collective action is impossible.” The poverty of this claim is exasperating. Thomas Hobbes had a far richer understanding of the commonwealth in 1651 than Piketty in 2014. Whereas Graeber

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 17

demonstrates that taxes were established as a way for kings to finance wars (still true today), for Piketty taxation is the apex of human association. For him, taxation demonstrates commonality and human solidarity more than actual relationships or human community. And after nearly two centuries of tax resistance as a political and philosophical issue (by no means beginning or ending with Henry David Thoreau’s famous example), Piketty claims that collective action is impossible without taxes.
     That collective action is impossible without taxes may come as a surprise
to social movements going back to the abolitionists and suffragists; to recent participants in global uprisings over the past decade; to a long history of slave revolts, insurrection, armed rebellion, strikes, sit-ins, town and factory takeovers, and organized movements of boycott and divestment; to not only revolutions but revolutionaries and their insurgent cultures. On the nonpolitical front, the fact that a common destiny (or some sense of common cause for a shared future hope) is impossible without taxes may come as a surprise to families around the world; to religious communities and their Gemeinwesen; to humanists of any kind, from Immanuel Kant to Jean-Paul Sartre; and to LGBT people, impoverished blacks in the United States, indigenous peoples and the Zapatistas, and so many other distinct communities of choice or fate. From the broad ideals of hospitality and inclusion to the coordinated human actions of striking workers, occupation movements, and jail solidarity, the claim that society can only have a common destiny through taxes announces nothing short of a brazen historical stupidity or an astonishing example of Orwellian doublethink.
     Silvia Federici has influentially written of “the commons” and John Holloway has written of many kinds of “other-doing,” pointing to examples from
birth and child rearing to community gardens and autonomous localities, all of which demonstrate commonality through forms of collective action that neither pass through the state nor depend on taxes. Does the very existence of feminism, or of community for that matter, depend on the codification of the policies of a social state? Have feminism and community done nothing at all for people that cannot be measured in dollars and cents by the tax collector? We can agree with Piketty that taxation is indeed one way to make common cause, to act through capital as a collectivity. But taxation is, from the perspective of any theory of collective action, a weak and nominal example of how to act with others for some common cause. Piketty’s ideal form is collective action by filing a tax return.
     He claims that the purpose of a global tax on capital “is not to finance
the social state but to regulate capitalism. The goal is first to stop the indefinite increase of inequality of wealth, and second to impose effective regulation on the financial and banking system in order to avoid crises.” The

## 18 | I n t rodUc t Ion

regulation of capitalism—that is the plan. For one, this ignores the fact that crises are a consequence of capitalism. But even if capital’s tendencies toward exploitation, accumulation, and consolidation could be regulated, all the would-be regulators have been busy for many decades giving away their regulatory and juridical powers and jurisdictions. This has enabled capital to run amok, codified in trade policies from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Economic Forum, and G8. This long and incomplete list is familiar not only to economists but increasingly to everyday people ever since the 1999 Seattle and 2001 Genoa protests against the WTO and G8 global forums. These developments in policy and institutional power attest to the death of the regulatory model Piketty wants to resurrect.
     There is no political will among power holders to reassert sovereignty
over the new post-Fordist economy of finance capital. While many states in the post-9/11 era are attempting to limit the movement of people, including immigrants and refugees, capital has eliminated any reregulation of its own movement. Today, capital only tolerates social commitments and initiatives inasmuch as they do not challenge or reverse its profit logic. This has been demonstrated throughout Europe with austerity, and of course, very sharply in France against the contentious 2016 loi travail (labor law) that gives private companies new and greater powers to fire their employees in the name of “flexibility.” Simply put, states have authorized capital to govern, both by force and by choice.
     Isn’t there something terribly obvious in this criticism? Indeed, Piketty
is aware of his critics and even anticipates the objections of radicals. He recognizes that “Karl Marx and many other socialist writers in the nineteenth century” were “far more radical and, if nothing else, more logically consistent.” He cites, in particular, the abolition of private property and of the private ownership of the means of production. And yet Piketty’s sole and central example of the “more radical” and “more logically consistent” alternative is always the discredited “Soviet experiment,” while quickly pointing out that his “tax on capital would be a less violent and more efficient response.” Thus, it would appear, there is only the less radical solution of his global tax, or the more radical solution of the Soviet Union. For Piketty, all rival visions are examples of failures from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries that have in no way stopped or reversed the privatizing, globalizing, and consolidating capitalist logic of growth and accumulation. In many ways, Piketty

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 19

seems to have accepted the central thesis in Francis Fukuyama’s “The End of History?”
     In the end, Piketty equates all the more radical and consistent solutions—if they are not already Stalinist—as always at risk of some totalitarian destination. He does not consider that capital is also a totalitarian power,
since it functionally and demonstrably governs not just one state but most states (if not all, on some level). In fact, it is amazing that although Piketty is keen on history, he ignores the relationship between fascism and capitalism, as can be seen in the major German and Italian examples of authoritarianism and standardization in politics coupled with capitalist economy. Had he done so, he would realize that fascism and Soviet-style “socialism” were in fact totalitarian forms of capitalism. This undermines the famous false dichotomy of regulated capitalism versus Stalinism and nullifies everything in his book beyond the statistical data and the basic analysis of the historical consolidation of inequality and wealth.
     He also does not take seriously anything on the vast terrain of nonStalinist Marxism or in any of the diverse revolutionary traditions or trajectories in thought and action, and unsurprisingly he finds nothing of value (or
even worth looking at) in the anarchist tradition. So it is not just a matter of making the Marxist defense against Stalinism by pointing out, for example, that Stalin himself rejected Marx’s basic system of thought.
     The conservative discourse about the totalitarian state is different from
the critique of statism by communists and other radicals. The communist and capitalist share a peculiar footing in their antistatism. But the details beyond this generality make them different. Piketty traces conservative fearmongering of the growing state (and the shrinking rights of individuals) to Milton Friedman and Chicago school economists who “fostered suspicion of the ever-expanding state and created the intellectual climate in which the conservative revolution of 1979–1980 became possible.” In opposition to this fearmongering, Piketty points to the New Deal: “Saving capitalism did not require a welfare state or a tentacular government: the only thing necessary was a well-run Federal Reserve.” But in the light of Piketty’s evidence, it seems strange to even be talking about “saving capitalism.” That is the standard reply of the Left to the conservative critic, and it reveals whom Piketty is thinking about as his audience. He is writing for liberals and conservatives who agree in wanting to save capitalism in crisis, to save it in ways that would recalibrate necessary commitments to basic human rights through global taxation and the social state.
     We are not Piketty’s intended reading public, and we are not his conservative critics. If he were writing for us, for his radical critics from the Left,
his book would have not been such an event. But we do want to ask a big,

## 20 | I n t rodU c t Ion

basic, and irresistible question that Piketty’s work raises so powerfully yet hasn’t the courage or interest to consider: What if our future is not the future of capitalism? In other words, what if we can live in other ways than those that are governed by capital? What if we are more convinced by Piketty than Piketty himself, and because of that, what if we are not looking forward to another capitalist century with desperate liberal commitments to the same failed plans? We have imaginations and we reject any menu on which the only options are capitalism or tyranny, which is like choosing between one catastrophe or another.
     Throughout, Piketty hones in on the irreducible contradiction of capitalism that he calls r > g. “The principal destabilizing force has to do with the
fact that the private rate of return on capital, r, can be significantly higher for long periods of time than the rate of growth of income and output, g.” More simply, past and existing wealth grow at a rapid pace such that already existing wealth accumulates and consolidates far more quickly than wages rise. Indeed, wages often go up very slowly and minimally. As Piketty puts it, “The past devours the future.” The long-run trend of this tendency, which occurs on a global scale, is the drastic exacerbation of inequality, which translates into deepening disparities of political and social power. Whereas the contradictions of capital, for Marx, gave hope in a destabilization of the existing reality that would make revolution possible, Piketty studies the contradictions in order to guard against all destabilizing forces.
     This clarifies why the only form of collective action that Piketty recognizes is taxation. Revolt, insurrection, global uprisings, revolution: all of these
terms correspond to social upheavals that contribute to the basic destabilization Piketty wants to guard against. We propose the opposite: given centuries of capitalist impoverishment and the global tendencies of growing inequality, the last thing we need is to “stabilize” capitalism by way of regulations that secure it for another hundred years.
     To his credit, Piketty calls for noneconomists to get into the numbers,
to overcome the widespread fear of numbers, and he importantly recognizes that “accumulating data is not always indispensable or even (I concede) especially imaginative.” This last point is perhaps the main one. Does Piketty appreciate just how much the radical imagination could help us to overcome present impasses of political economy? Perhaps what we really need is less statistical analysis and more imagination. Consider the fact that what now exists is not the only possible situation. Such a basic formulation makes the point appear obvious. Yet without imagination, what now exists is regularly presupposed as the only possible situation, and the analysis pursues solutions to problems of the present situation alone, as if its basic structure were permanent.

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 21

    The logical conclusion of Piketty’s research, which he himself resists and
rejects, is inevitable: Capital is the problem. Taxation is not the problem. To claim that taxation is the problem, and not capital, is another form of doublethink. Taxation is, in fact, the private property of capital. Taxation belongs to capital as its most cherished tool, as evidence of its morality, used by capital to justify capitalism. Taxation only gives false hope that one day we will have a capitalism without its brutal contradictions. This is a faith held out against a history of taxation that has not reversed any of the contradictions or tendencies of capital, a history compiled decisively in Piketty’s work.
    Piketty exchanges the apologetics of meritocracy for the apologetics of
taxation. We do not seek the reregulation of capital. We seek its abolition.
on the contrary Aside from this introductory essay, our book does not take up Piketty’s work directly. This is no accident or oversight. We want to say not only that “Piketty is not enough!” but more importantly, “Enough with Piketty liberalism!” We could not present the desired range and imagination of abolitionist and transformative thinking while remaining tethered to Piketty’s text. Our engagement with and invocation of Piketty’s work here is not only to mark it as a launchpad for this book but also to offer it as an example of the contradiction we seek to overcome. Namely, we are against the thorough critique of capital that simultaneously assumes its permanence and our indefinite acceptance. That Piketty of all people proposes the reregulation of capital makes him the perfect example of this contradiction, because unlike others who propose tax policy solutions, he doesn’t have the excuse of knowing nothing about the deregulating logic and history of capitalism.
     On the contrary, we provide diverse analyses of social, economic, political,
and ecological crises that think beyond capitalist boundaries and a compendium of examples of the many ways of being against capital. Piketty is not necessary or necessarily relevant to the critical analyses we present here, though we can imagine the ideal pairing of his book with ours for anyone interested in thinking seriously about capitalism today. Readers may take up this book without Piketty’s, although its critical contributions are perhaps starker alongside it.
     We begin with critical texts on the relationship of theory and praxis.
Praxis is not practice. Praxis challenges the separation of thought from action. It is the development of new thinking and understandings, which emerge by way of events and actions in the world. Social and political movements are not cut off from theory but, rather, inform it. Theory that is not informed by the reality and activity of everyday people is bad theory. As opposed to the famous philosophical dictum cogito ergo sum (I think, therefore I am),

## 22 | I n t rodUc t Ion

praxis specifies human being and action first—that is, action as a modality of thinking.
     The overarching purpose of Chapter 1 is to explore basic questions of
how theory is related to, and comes out of, movements. Global economic crises since 2008 have brought about diverse global uprisings, which compel us to consider income inequality, neoliberalism, and globalization. We do not accept that only economists can understand crises, assuming they are even capable. Rather, we posit that critical theorists, organic intellectuals, and insurrectionists have understood and explained the dynamics of capital clearly since its conceptualization.
     As a theorist, John Holloway has long invoked lessons from the Zapatistas: “Asking, we walk. We advance by asking, by trying to connect with the
other dignities that surround us, the other rebellions that surround us. We try and move forward through discussion, through hearing, through asking people about their rebelliousness, about their dignity.” Indeed, challenging what is and listening closely to the disaffection and indignation of others is part of the process of reflecting on problems and solutions. We do not need to confidently agree on certain solutions before we act, for then we would never do anything. Happily, uprisings against austerity, global poverty, and rising precarity do not wait for answers from academics and are not content with the reality being sold in spectacular capitalist society.
     In the social and political sciences, focusing on policy analysis and reform
diminishes the relevance of any upheaval or uprising. Asking “what the uprising has changed” puts the focus on specific policy agendas and reforms as measures of the insurrection’s effectiveness. Thus, insurrection is often seen as an ineffectual strategy for obtaining new policies. But that is often not the case at all. Insurrection embodies and reflects the revolutionary aspirations of the oppressed who long for a different arrangement of life, not for a new policy with fine print to “accept” as instructed. According to Rudolf Rocker, one of the most articulate exponents of anarchist theory:
     The peoples owe all the political rights and privileges . . . not to the
     good will of their governments, but to their own strength. Governments have employed every means that lay in their power to prevent
     the attainment of these rights or to render them illusory. Great mass
     movements among the people and whole revolutions have been necessary to wrest these rights from the ruling classes, who would never
     have consented to them voluntarily. . . . Only after the workers had by
     direct action confronted parliament with accomplished facts, did the
     government see itself obliged to take the new situation into account
     and give legal sanction to the trade unions. What is important is not

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 23

    that governments have decided to concede certain rights to the people, but
    the reason why they have had to do this.
     Ideology reigns over society and politics. In Piketty’s critique of the ideology of meritocracy one finds a minor accounting of this power. But inasmuch as the liberal ideology—indeed, that of Piketty—also dissuades all
forms of revolt and structural transformation, we recognize ideology as a major counterinsurgent force. Chapter 2 provides selections that contribute to an understanding of ideology today. Ideology is not the open questioning of philosophical inquiry. Ideology only comes onto the scene at the end of an inquiry, or worse, it is the preemptive strike against any inquiry at all. It offers a functional and finished worldview like eyeglasses that screen out facts that do not fit with one’s preferred outlook. But these glasses are no simple accessory that can be taken off, for they have been etched onto the eyes of our subconscious.
     To address such problems, it is necessary to diagnose them well, but ideology often functions as an impediment to the diagnostic process. When
we speak of revolution, communism, capitalism, anarchism, ecology, racism, sexism, gender, and class composition, we quickly confront the many impasses of a concrete ideological blockade against any serious consideration of rival visions and arguments.
     Moving on from theory and ideology to the key Marxian focus on class,
we aim to account for developments and reconsiderations. For one, there is no agreement on what class is, or what exactly Marx understood it to be, or who was included in each, questions raised by Ralf Dahrendorf. Being what it may, class composition has changed, in both ideological and material terms. First, upward mobility has gone from marginal to nearly nonexistent, and has even reversed over the past several decades. Second, and in contradiction with the new reality, the ideology of mobility has only flourished and been expanded with new categories and expectations for short-term precarious work and demands for flexibility. This can be seen, for example, in the dangerous French loi travail in 2016. The brutal contradiction, or cognitive dissonance, summed up: less real mobility coupled with an expectation for greater mobility. This is only one feature of the class problem.
     In Chapter 3, we present readings that help us explore what conventional
class analysis misses and how to complicate and improve it in accordance with current conditions of life. The authors in this section offer a more nuanced analysis than Piketty in fundamental ways. As discussed, Piketty analyzes in great detail the difference and distance between income and national capital, showing that income inequality has reached dangerous levels. But class is not about income alone. It is about power, identity, material distribution, and exclusion, among other things.

## 24 | I n t rodU c t Ion

     Following this, we move on to other questions of exclusion and power
beyond the theorization of class. Contrary to a now-old slander, revolutionary Marxists such as Sylvia Pankhurst, Rosa Luxemburg, C.L.R. James, Raya Dunayevskaya, and other revolutionary anticapitalists (e.g., Frantz Fanon, Lucy Parsons, Silvia Federici, Nancy Fraser, and Enrique Dussel) have indeed made major contributions to the expansion of class analysis with studies of race, gender, and sexuality. Nonetheless, we mustn’t whitewash the historical tendency in Marxian (more so) and anarchist radical thought to treat these other categories as subordinate to class. One could even see in Lucy Parsons, who was far from the conventional Marxist, a kind of analytical class fundamentalism.
     As a notable distinction, it is more common to find in the anarchist
literature many influential women who directly took up women’s issues in the early twentieth century, such as Charlotte Wilson, Emma Goldman, and Voltairine de Cleyre. Moreover, anarchist prison writings included remarkably rich encounters with impoverished and incarcerated populations across racial and ethnic divides. But for anarchists, it has been more characteristic to contrast the importance of individuals over and against the Marxian emphasis on class than it has been to shift the terrain from class to race and gender. The aim of Chapter 4 is to compensate for some of these deficits in the literature of radical undercurrents; to bring in some of the analyses of the colonial and postcolonial reality; and more broadly, to bring in thinkers from excluded demographics—as we do throughout the whole volume.
     We would point out that the shortcomings of our milieu are far more
catastrophic in the mainstream traditions of liberalism and conservatism. We point this out not to excuse the shortcomings of the radical milieu but, rather, to emphasize the overarching and growing racism and sexism of the main currents. This can be seen in many examples, such as the epidemic police murder of black men, the well-demonstrated racism of the carceral state, and the reductive conflation of feminism to a tepid politics of gender quotas. However, criticism leveled against radical theorists for overlooking issues of gender and sexism could be leveled far more severely and unsparingly at the whole history of Western philosophy. And whereas renewed attention to income inequality has revitalized discussions on class and social stratification, it has not guaranteed renewed attention to feminist and antiracist critique.
     Chapter 5 helps readers think through current problems in education and
pedagogy and the role education plays in social and political transformation. In the anarchist tradition, going back at least to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, education was an integral part of social and political transformation. For example, he (and other anarchists like Charlotte Wilson and Errico Malatesta) preferred the idea of social revolution to the idea of political revolution, which

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 25

meant a transformation in and of the social body instead of in the political institutions of the state. Today, there are new challenges to consider in light of the global privatization of education, demanding new inroads into what Peter McLaren calls revolutionary critical pedagogy that need to be developed inside and outside institutional settings.
     We think of education and pedagogy while continuing the discussion of
ideology, theory, and class composition. A part of the concrete ideological problem we face derives from the fact that educational institutions have been captured by capital more fully (in some cases, totally) than at any point in history. Even public institutions, with long historical commitments to free schooling (e.g., the City University of New York and the University of California system), have shifted to private tuition revenues for their main operating budgets—a necessity created by systematic defunding.
     But we know better than to expect states to put education in the service of social transformation. We cannot act as if decades of privatization
had never occurred; nor can we ignore the fact that the best offer from Clinton-Democrat liberalism is to forgive student loan debts for young entrepreneurs. This plan was rearticulated by the Clinton campaign with new energy in June 2016, making it loud and clear that the official liberal vision for public education is to continue instrumentalizing it for capitalist innovation. Neoliberalism has created a situation in which we must rethink education in noninstitutional terms, in new directions, and now, against the forces of education itself! We have got to find new ways of transforming education from a tool for capitalist assimilation into a transformative process of rethinking all that is.
     Next, we focus on the importance of culture for radical politics. Let us
drive the last nail into the coffin of old debates about cultural Marxism and postmodern theory versus materialist class politics. What we mean by culture is no joke or masturbatory abstraction. Culture is a complex of shared practices and discourses (ways of speaking and thinking), which are taught not by direct instruction but, rather, by socialization and acculturation (cultivation). Culture provides a shared sense of meaning for a life with others around you. The etymological origins of the word culture derive from the Latin cultura and first indicated cultivation in a mainly agricultural sense. We speak of cultivation in social and political senses.
     In the Marxist tradition, much of culture is reduced to “the superstructure,” an epiphenomenon of the material bases of life. In the middle of the
twentieth century, many Marxists revised the materialism that was developed as a philosophical riposte for G.W.F. Hegel. Critical theorists of the Frankfurt School, from Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to Erich Fromm and Herbert Marcuse, and to related thinkers like Wilhelm Reich and Jürgen

## 26 | I n t rodUc t Ion

Habermas, famously reintegrated the importance of culture with the Marxian critique of capitalism.
     In the anarchist tradition, culture was recognized as a major battlefield
for revolutionary activity. Emma Goldman wrote about drama, theater, and novels as inroads for radical criticism against capitalist ideology. For Raoul Vaneigem, revolution needs poetry, and what he means by “poetry” is a form of cultural revolt. To that end, Julia Kristeva writes about what she calls the “culture of revolt,” which she says must be fostered against the prevailing culture of privatization, alienation, and mass depression. We agree. Culture is critical, even when its content is determined by capital and is itself a part of the problem. It cannot simply be marginalized as epiphenomenal to economic reality, as it mainly appears in both Marx and Piketty.
     Closely linked to culture—one could say its constitutive parts—are literature and art, major conduits of cultural transmission. Art has been an integral component of every social movement, including labor and civil rights.
It was through theater, literature, song, and more that popular analyses of class, race, gender, and oppression generally have been disseminated through the social body. The creative and participatory nature of art also increases activity, communicative power, and a collective sense of our affective and effective capabilities.
     Our volume cannot be silent on the basic questions of ecology. We are
convinced by the critical scholarship that ecological capitalism is a contradiction in terms. Some months before Rachel Carson published her Silent Spring, Murray Bookchin argued the more radical and convincing thesis that ecological principles are incompatible with contemporary capitalist society, and that our future survival on Earth would require a transition to anarchist social organization. Bookchin called this “social ecology.” Out of the Marxist tradition, James O’Connor claims that ecological crisis is the “natural disaster” of capitalism. The chapter on ecology informs new opportunities and an urgent need for ecological thinking connected to the abolitionist critique of existing society and life.
     The theory of history and change known as historical materialism has
been central to Marx and Marxism, developed as a basis for understanding the past, present, and future. Accordingly, history and change were to be understood in the context of class conflict and the resolution of contradictions and antagonisms. We claim that there are other ways to understand history and change that move beyond the limitations of historical materialism, which we think must inform the analysis and action of radicals.
     Historical materialism has narrowed and governed the revolutionary interpretation of events. From 1871 to 1968 in France, to 1994 in Chiapas,
1999 in Seattle, 2001 in Genoa, 2011 in the Occupy movements, the so-

## I n t rodUc t Ion | 27

called Arab Spring, 2013 in Turkey, 2015 in Baltimore, and 2016 in France in Nuit Debout, among so many other revolts and locations, collective action appears a permanent part of the radical imagination. The old aspiration of collective action, from the standpoint of historical materialism, is for the grand antagonisms that could or would set the stage for revolution. But aren’t there other ways to think about collective action beyond the context of worldhistorical transition? We believe so, and we offer some ideas.
     It would be ideal if readers of Piketty’s book would take up this book as
a contrary accompaniment. It would be even better if our readers would take up the fuller and other works of the authors featured here as their interests lead them beyond the limitations of the present volume. We hope the book is successful as an introduction to important undercurrents in radical thought. Inasmuch as you are familiar with some of the authors herein, certainly there are others in the following pages to whom you are now being introduced.
     One of our guiding ideas has been to bring together works that are typically separated along ideological lines, works that are considered disparate
and not commonly grouped together. Some groupings of these texts may even feel inappropriate to those deeply familiar with internal debates and irreconcilable differences. If so, we will be glad. We have assembled this hybridization so that its disparate contents may inform each other richly, convinced that they possess a special utility for constructing transformative theory for the twenty-first century.
     Whatever limitations of the present volume, its purpose is to contest the
normalized acceptance of capitalism indefinitely.
     You may say, “Yes, the reader is full of good ideas that traverse a wide
range of thinking, but it’s also all too similar. All these authors desire an end to the present state of affairs, and they all dream of something new.” You may also ask, “Where is the real diversity, the one that would include a defense of capital and the existing world order? Where is the other side?” To this we would point out that the defense of capital and the existing world order is already all around you, in the architecture, culture, ideology, work, academy, media, politics, and materiality of everyday life. If the side you are looking for is the side that accepts the existing reality, then you can close this book and find it everywhere. That our book aspires to something else is what, fundamentally, distinguishes it from Piketty’s. This is a book of other sides—indeed, the missing sides we should be demanding.

    Perhas it oesn’t atter. Perhas we on’t nee to have hoe o a ierent worl. Perhas it is enouh ust to strule aainst the ores o estru-

    “Now is the tie to learn hoe,” Ernst Bloh tol us when he returne

III The hoe that we an reate a raially ierent or o soiety ilies soe sort o historiity—that is, the unerstanin that this syste in whih we live is historially seii, that it has not always existe an that there is no reason to think that it will exist orever.
     This oes not ean that history is on our sie, that there is soe sort

     To think hoe is to rea the existin worl ro the ush o the worl

     The telluri oveent o the Not Yet is all aroun us. In Crack Capitalism I talk about the illions o ways in whih eole break the loi o aital an thereore o aitalist labor (alienate or abstrat labor) an evelo

     An yet (years ater that book was ublishe!) aitalis is still here, an

ault line. When we srea in rotest, we want to hear an eho insie the wall that we are sreain at.
     This is the entral aruent o Marx. We have to ove beyon tieless
hoin to unerstan the raility o aitalis. This raility is ouse in risis. Marxis, as I unerstan it, is a theory o risis. Historiity ilies a notion o risis, a oent in whih the relations o the ol worl are broken an the new atterns ush throuh. Marx onnets this ortality o aital with the reurrent isrutions that are tyial o aitalist eveloent. In risis our subetive hoin (our subetive reatin o a ierent worl, our strules aainst aitalis) eets the hoeability, the raility or breakability o aitalis. Eah risis is a breakin o the relations o the ol worl an a real or otential ushin orwar o the relations o a new worl. “Think hoe, think risis” is a hallene or us to ask, “In what sense an we say that the resent risis is a breakin o the relations o the ol worl an a ushin orwar o the relations o a new worl?”
     In risis, hoe eets hoeability. We shoul be anin or oy an
lauhin at the oent, seein the iiulties o aital. But are we? Yes an no. There is ertainly an eleent o oyous rae, a elebration o hoe— in Arentina, Greee, Turkey. Chaulin.

     Greee is the eret exale. The ost eroious attak by aital in any

     To think hoe is to think ro the ush o the unborn worl. To think

V Can Marx hel us here? Perhas not in his resentation o risis in Capital, whih akes the risis see external to us, but yes, in the substane o what he says. My unerstanin o Marx on risis is that he is sayin that aital as a historially seii oe o oination (an in istintion ro other oes o oination) suers ro a ruial illness that onstitutes its eroity, its instability, an its ortality. That illness is its own insatiability, the hroni, onvulsive, an rowin inaequay o its own oination over the worl.
     All ors o oination suer ro a hroni roble: the eenene
o the rulers on the rule, their eenene on bein able to ake the rule o what the rulers want the to. In aitalis, that eenene aquires a new iension: ro bein a onstant roble, it beoes a real illness. Unlike other ors o oination, aital is unable to exist on the basis o a stable relation o oination/exloitation. To reroue itsel, it ust onstantly intensiy its oination/exloitation. The at that it is not able to o so aequately onstitutes its risis.
     In Capital, Marx introues this onstant rive to intensiy by sayin that
value is easure by the soially neessary labor tie require to roue a ooity. This soially neessary labor tie is onstantly allin, so there is a onstant reorulation o the labor neessary to roue value, what Marx alls “abstrat labor,” a onstant restruturin o the onversion o our huan ativity into labor that roues aital or suorts the roution o aital. Value, the struturin o soial relations on the basis o exhane, involves a onstantly intensiyin attak on huan ativity an on the whole attern o soial relations an relations between huans an nature o whih that ativity is art. This oes u aainst onstant resistane, resistane that an easily overlow into rebellion. Caital lees into ahinery, to relae the reratory han o labor, as Marx uts it, but this is no solution, beause aital then has to intensiy exloitation in orer to over the osts o the ahines. Caital’s inability to o so suiiently leas, Marx arues, to the teneny or the rate o roit to all an to risis—both as the hroni ina- equay o aital’s exloitation (i.e., aital’s aaity to suborinate huan ativity to its nees) an as the erioi exlosion o this inaequay as the ruture o existin soial relations an the strule by aital to restruture the aorin to its nees. Crisis as hroni inaequay eres in oern aitalis into the erioi isrution, so that the ter “the urrent risis o aitalis” oes (at least sine the i-1970s) to reer to a hroni onition untuate by intensiiations.
     I o not ean that aital’s ontrol over the worl is weakenin—quite
the ontrary, unortunately—but that, at the sae tie as its ontrol is row-

in, this ontrol is inreasinly inaequate to ensure its own reroution. Growin oination oinies with rowin inaequay o oination. This sees to e what Marx was exressin in his insistene in Capital that a rowin ass o roit oinies with a allin rate o roit. It is iortant to kee both o these trens in view: i we see only the rowin oination o aital, this an easily lea us to esair, but i we see only the rowin inaequay o that oination, that an lea us to an unustiie otiis. Hoe an essiis walk han in han: rea Bloh with one eye an Aorno with the other.
     Kee the two toether, but erhas we nee to ous ore on the ina-
equay o aitalist oination, or we are that inaequay; we are the risis o aital. We are the risis o aital, an rou o it. It is our resistane, our rebellion, our reusal to be onverte into ahines, our lauhter, our love, our rienshi, our rive to o thins in a ierent way, to eaniate our reative aaities, our ore o roution ro the loi o aital: it is all that that stans in the way o aital’s eserate rive to intensiy its oination o all huan lie.
     We are the risis o aital, an what oes aital o to overoe its
risis? First, it oes everythin ossible to intensiy its ontrol over us, over our aily ativity, over the worl in whih we live. But seon, it is ore to reonize that even with this intensiiation, even with all it has ahieve in the estrution o huanity an the estrution o the lanet, it is not enouh.

     We are the inaequay o aital; we are its risis. Our insuborination

## 2 | Ideology

         lie-process as the inversion o objects on the retina does rom their
         physical lie-process.
         —Karl Marx, The German Ideology
         People with advantages are loath to believe that they just happen to
         be people with advantages. hey come readily to deine themselves as
         inherently worthy o what they possess; they come to believe themselves
         “naturally” elite; and, in act, to imagine their possessions and their
         privileges as natural extensions o their own elite selves. In this sense, the
         idea o the elite as composed o men and women having a iner moral
         character is an ideology o the elite as a privileged ruling stratum, and this
         is true whether the ideology is elite-made or made up or it by others.

n most countries the working class is organized in gigantic trade unions and Ipolitical parties, numbering tens o millions o members. But these unions and parties are every day more openly and more cynically playing the role o direct agents o the ruling class and o the capitalist state, or o the bureaucratic capitalism that reigns in Russia.
    Only a ew minute organizations seem to have survived the general shipwreck, organizations such as the “Fourth International,” the Anarchist Federations, and a ew sel-described “ultraletist” groups (Bordigists, Spartacists,
Council Communists). hese organizations are very weak, not only because o their numbers (numerical strength by itsel is never a criterion), but above all because o their political and ideological bankruptcy. Relics o the past rather than harbingers o the uture, they have proved themselves utterly incapable o understanding the undamental social transormations o the twentieth century and even less capable o developing a positive orientation toward them.

## I  o o  y | 57

     In some countries, the Anarchist Federations still enjoy the support o a
number o workers with a healthy class instinct—but those workers are very backward politically, and the anarchists keep them that way. he anarchists’ constant reusal to venture beyond the sterile slogan “No Politics,” or to take theory seriously, contributes to the conusion. his makes anarchism one more blind alley or workers to get lost in.
     Meanwhile, various “ultraletist” groups cultivate their pet sectarian deviations, some o them (like the Bordigists) even going so ar as to blame the
proletariat or their own stagnation and impotence, others (like the Council Communists) living happily in the past and seeking therein their recipes or the “socialist” kitchens o the uture.
     Within the ramework o a world system based on exploitation, new
economic orms and new types o exploitation have appeared. While maintaining the most undamental eatures o capitalism these new orms dier signiicantly rom traditional capitalism in that they have superseded and broken radically with such traditional capitalist orms as the private ownership o the means o production. hese new economic orms even supericially resemble some o the objectives the workers’ movement had set itsel, objectives such as the statiication or nationalization o the means o production and exchange, economic planning and the coordination o production on an international scale.
     he bureaucracy was the social expression o these new economic orms.
As traditional orms o property and the bourgeoisie o the classical period are pushed aside by state property and by the bureaucracy, the main con- lict within society gradually ceases to be the old one between the owners o wealth and those without property and is replaced by the conlict between directors and executants in the process o production. In act, the bureaucracy justiies its own existence (and can be explained in objective terms) only insoar as it plays a role deemed essential to the “management” o the productive activities o society and, thereby, o all other orms o activity.
     his has taken place without there resulting or the toiling masses anything other than a more intense, better coordinated, and, in a word, rationalized exploitation. he objective outcome o this evolution has been a more
eicient and more systematic organization or exploiting and enslaving the proletariat.
     he beneiciary o this exploitation o the proletariat is an enormous and
monstrous bureaucracy (consisting o the bureaucrats in the political and economic apparatus, o technicians and intellectuals, o leaders o the “Communist” party and o the trade unions, and o the top military and police personnel). Economic “planning” proceeds in the interests o the bureaucracy and aects all areas o production.

     hus there evolved a system that cynically calls itsel “socialist” yet where
side by side with the appalling poverty o the working masses can be seen the lie o luxury led by about 10 or 15 percent o the population who make up the exploiting bureaucracy. his is a system where millions o people are held in concentration and orced labor camps, where the state police (o which the Gestapo was but an imitation) exercises total terror, where “elections” and other “democratic” procedures would be deemed sinister arces were they not the tragic expressions o the terrorization, the brutalization, and the degradation o man under the most overwhelming dictatorship alive today.
     How did things reach this pass? How did the power established by the
irst victorious proletarian revolution transorm itsel into the most eective instrument or exploiting and oppressing the masses? And how did the parties o the hird International, created to abolish exploitation and to instaurate on earth the power o workers and peasants, become the instruments o a new social ormation with interests as radically opposed to those o the proletariat as had been those o the traditional bourgeoisie itsel? hese are the questions that all advanced workers will anxiously ask themselves, once they have understood that to see anything “socialist” in Russia is to calumniate the very word socialism.
     he October Revolution succumbed to the bureaucratic counterrevolution under the combined pressures o external and internal orces, o objective
and subjective actors. hey all boil down to the ollowing idea: Between the second and third decade o this century neither the world economy nor the working class was as yet quite ripe or the total abolition o exploitation. A revolution, even a victorious one, would be overthrown i it remained isolated in a single country. It would either be overthrown rom outside, through civil war and the armed intervention o other capitalist countries, or it would degenerate rom within, through a change in the nature o the regime to which it had given birth.
     A undamental question thereore has to be answered on the morrow
o every successul revolution. Who will be the master o society once it is purged o the capitalists and their tools? he structure o the new regime, its political orm, the relationship between the working class and its own leadership, the management o production, the type o system prevailing in the actories—all these are but particular aspects o this general problem.
     Should a hird World War lead to the uniication o the world system o
exploitation, the civilization and social lie o humanity would be threatened with total collapse. he unlimited totalitarian domination o a single group o exploiters (whether Yankee monopolists or Russian bureaucrats) would give them ree rein to plunder the earth. he all in the productivity o labor under such a regime o ever-increasing exploitation and the complete transormation

212 Ideology is the intellectual basis o class societies within the conlictual course o history.

214 Ideology, whose whole internal logic led toward what [Karl] Mannheim calls “total ideology”—the despotism o a ragment imposing itsel as pseudoknowledge o a rozen totality, as a totalitarian worldview—has reached its culmination in the immobilized spectacle o nonhistory. Its culmination is also its dissolution into society as a whole. When that society itsel is concretely dissolved, ideology—the final irrationality standing in the way o historical lie—must also disappear.
215 he spectacle is the epitome o ideology because in its plenitude it exposes and maniests the essence o all ideological systems: the impoverishment, enslavement, and negation o real lie. he spectacle is the material “expression o the separation and estrangement between man and man.” he “new power o deception” concentrated in it is based on the production system in which “as the quantity o objects increases, so does the realm o alien powers to which man is subjected.” his is the supreme stage o an expansion that has turned need against lie. “he need or money is thus the true need produced by the modern economic system, and it is the only need which the latter produces.” Hegel’s characterization o money as “the lie o what is dead, moving within itsel” has now been extended by the spectacle to all social lie.
216 In contrast to the project outlined in the “heses on Feuerbach” (the realization o philosophy in a praxis transcending the opposition between idealism and materialism), the spectacle preserves the ideological eatures o both materialism and idealism, imposing them in the pseudo-concreteness o its universe. he contemplative aspect o the old materialism, which conceives the world as representation and not as activity—and which ultimately idealizes matter—is ulilled in the spectacle, where concrete things are automatic masters o social lie. Conversely, the dreamed activity o idealism is also ulilled in the spectacle, through the technical mediation o signs and signals—which ultimately materialize an abstract ideal.
217 he parallel between ideology and schizophrenia demonstrated in [Joseph] Gabel’s False Consciousness should be considered in the context o this eco-

Ideology is at home; separation has built its own world.
218 “In clinical accounts o schizophrenia,” says Gabel, “the deterioration o the dialectic o totality (with dissociation as its extreme orm) and the deterioration o the dialectic o becoming (with catatonia as its extreme orm) seem closely interrelated.” Imprisoned in a lattened universe bounded by the screen o the spectacle, behind which his own lie has been exiled, the spectator’s consciousness no longer knows anyone but the fictitious interlocutors who subject him to a one-way monologue about their commodities and the politics o their commodities. he spectacle as a whole is his “mirror sign,” presenting illusory escapes rom a universal autism.
219 he spectacle, which obliterates the boundaries between sel and world by crushing the sel besieged by the presence/absence o the world, also obliterates the boundaries between true and alse by repressing all directly lived truth beneath the real presence o alsehood maintained by the organization o appearances. Individuals who passively accept their subjection to an alien everyday reality are thus driven toward a madness that reacts to that ate by resorting to illusory magical techniques. he essence o this pseudo-response to an unanswerable communication is the acceptance and consumption o commodities. he consumer’s compulsion to imitate is a truly inantile need, conditioned by all the aspects o his undamental dispossession. As Gabel puts it in describing a quite dierent level o pathology, “he abnormal need or representation here makes up or a torturing eeling o being on the edge o existence.”
220 In contrast to the logic o alse consciousness, which cannot truly know itsel, the search or critical truth about the spectacle must also be a true critique.

It must struggle in practice among the irreconcilable enemies o the spectacle and admit that it is nothing without them. By rushing into sordid reormist compromises or pseudo-revolutionary collective actions, those driven by an abstract desire or immediate eectiveness are in reality obeying the ruling laws o thought, adopting a perspective that can see nothing but the latest news. In this way delirium reappears within the camp that claims to be opposing it. A critique seeking to go beyond the spectacle must know how to wait.
221 he sel-emancipation o our time is an emancipation rom the material bases o inverted truth. his “historic mission o establishing truth in the world” can be carried out neither by the isolated individual nor by atomized and manipulated masses but only and always by the class that is able to dissolve all classes by reducing all power to the de-alienating orm o realized democracy—to councils in which practical theory veriies itsel and surveys its own actions. Only there are individuals “directly linked to world history”—there where dialogue has armed itsel to impose its own conditions.

     he “social scientist” claims to be empirical and objective; he claims to
make no value judgments. Yet by reducing the person to the bundle o tastes, desires, and preerences to which he’s restricted in capitalist society, the “objective scientist” makes the bizarre claim that this bundle is what the worker is; and he makes the antastic value judgment that the worker cannot be other than what he is in capitalist society. According to the “laws o human behavior” o this “science,” the solidarity o students with workers, the occupation o actories by workers, the desire o workers to run their own production, distribution, and coordination, are all impossible. Why? Because these things are impossible in capitalist society, and or these “scientists” who make no value judgments, existing societies are the only possible societies, and the corporate-military society is the best o all possible societies.
     o the American social scientist, “human nature” is what people do in
corporate-military America: a ew make decisions, and the rest ollow orders; some think, and others do; some buy other people’s labor, and the rest sell their own labor; a ew invest, and the rest are consumers; some are sadists, and others masochists; some have a desire to kill and others to die. he “scientist” passes all this o as “exchange,” as “reciprocity,” as a “division o labor” in which people are divided along with tasks. o the “social scientist” this is all so natural that he thinks he makes no value judgments when he takes it all or granted.

(American psychologists—especially “behaviorists”—make the ambiguous “contribution” o demonstrating that animals also have a “human nature”: the psychologists drive rats mad in a situation similar to a war, which the psychologists themselves helped plan, and then they show that rats, too, have a desire to kill, that they have masochist tendencies.)
     In terms o what the American “social scientist” takes or granted, when
students and workers in France started to ight to do away with “reciprocity,” “exchange,” and the division o labor, they were ighting not against the capitalist police but against “human nature.” And since this is obviously impossible, the events that took place in May 1968 did not take place.

     “Persona originally means ‘mask’ and it is through the mask that the individual acquires a role and a social identity,” Giorgio Agamben says, describing
a patrician’s insignia. Persona becomes “the ‘personality’ that deines the place o the individual in the dramas and rituals o social lie. Eventually persona came to signiy the juridical capacity and political dignity o the ree man.” “he struggle or recognition is,” he stresses, “a struggle or a mask but this mask coincides with the ‘personality’ that society recognizes in every individual.” Hence “the moral person constitutes himsel . . . through, at once, an adhesion to and a distancing rom, the social mask.” We have here a reversal o our liberal-therapeutic holistic sel. he mask as person(a) allows us to play not on our surace but beneath it, secure, unseen. hink o the director Jacques Copeau’s rustration with an actor who “could experience but not express an emotion,” the demand that he “struggle with his own blood.” Having per- ected the person(a) o his character he must imbue it with his own person: he traverses the irreducibly liminal space o the sel/person(a). his person(a) turns the interchangeable neoliberal subject, ever malleable to market direction, into a masked ugitive, revealed by will and choice alone. eachers and students should cultivate this person(a) as both intensiication and protection o creative upheaval beyond liberal conormity and neoliberal promiscuity.
     Rainer Maria Rilke’s letters (1903–1904) to Franz Kappus, a soldier seeking advice on his poetry, oer cryptic counsel. Rilke begins his mentorship
by denying its possibility: “You ask whether your verses are any good. You ask me. You have asked others beore this. . . . I beg you to stop doing that sort o thing.” His gentle pedagogy is strictly staged. First, achieve “vast, inner solitude”: “walk inside yoursel and meet no one or hours,” gazing “upon it all as a child would.” Only in radical solitude do we ind our person. Second, engage “your innermost eeling, in your quietest hour” so “the natural growth o your inner lie will eventually guide you.” hird, perceive the relationship to creativity; “ask yoursel in the most silent hour o your night: must I write?” his stage also occasions your “search into the depths o hings,” to “ind out i this way o perceiving the world arises rom a necessity o your being.” Fourth, Rilke says one must accept that “in important matters we are unspeakably alone”—the condition o natality.
     Most striking is his insistence that poetic words seek what eludes words.
“Most experiences are unsayable,” he readily announces. You must “let each impression and each embryo o a eeling come to completion, entirely in itsel, in the dark, in the unsayable, the unconscious.” What language desires, he ruminates, “is so very delicate, is almost unsayable.” When Gilles Deleuze oddly reers to “Rilke reusing to give any advice to a young poet,” he may

mean his initial warning was sincere: poetic guidance itsel may be unsayable. But Rilke submits to the wordless unconscious, the process o becoming his inner experience. At this moment, one is not liberal subject o a sel but posthumanist object o a lie. In Deleuze’s words:
    It’s a strange business, speaking or yoursel, in your own name, because it doesn’t at all come with seeing yoursel as an ego or a person or a subject. Individuals ind a real name or themselves, rather,
    only through the harshest exercise in depersonalization, by opening
    themselves up to the multiplicities everywhere within them, to the
    intensities running through them.
Or in Guy Debord’s exhortation, “In a dérive one or more persons during a certain period drop their relations, their work and leisure activities, and all their other usual motives or movement and action, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions o the terrain and the encounters they end there.” When we inally recognize our persona as our misrecognized person, as the stage o our liberal subjectivity, we may experience ourselves genuinely as objects o objects, causes o causes, at home in our bodily becoming. his artistic-philosophical urge tracks to “Montaigne’s method,” that “peculiar orm o his Essays” in which “he ollows his own inner rhythm, which, though constantly induced and maintained by things, is not bound to them, but reely skips rom one to another.” Michel de Montaigne’s ounding humanist rejection o sel-mastering piety may ound a posthumanist rejection o neoliberalism’s equally sel-mutilating theology.

## 3 | Class Composition and Hierarchy

         All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
         —George Orwell, Animal Farm
         The market has always been one of exploitation and thereby of
         domination, insuring the class structure of society. However, the
         productive process of advanced capitalism has altered the form of
         domination: the technological veil covers the brute presence and the
         operation of the class interest in the merchandise.
         —Herbert Marcuse, An Essay on Liberation

TH SOi TyMOOGy Of TH OpT Of SS Evaluative shifts of meaning have accompanied the concept of class throughout its history. When the Roman censors introduced the word classis to divide the population into tax groups, they may not have anticipated the eventful future of this category. Yet even their classification implied at least the possibility of evaluative distinctions: on the one end of their classification were the assidui, who might well be proud of their 100,000 as; on the other end were the proletarii, whose only “property” consisted in their numerous offspring—proles—and who were outdone only by the lumpenproletariat of the capite censi, those counted by their heads. Just as the American term “income bracket,” although originally no more than a statistical category, touches upon the most vulnerable point of social inequality, it was true for the classes of ancient Rome that they divided the population into more than statistical units. “The movie was classy,” teenagers say, meaning “high-class,” “firstclass.” Similarly, to say that some Roman was classis or classicus meant that he belonged to the prima classis, to the upper class—unless he was explicitly described as a “fifth-class” proletarian. Since Gellius we know the adjective classicus in its application to “first-class” artists and works of art, a usage which
                                          S S  OM p O S i T iO    H i     H y | 79
survives in our word “classical” and was eventually related to the authors of the term themselves and their times: they lived in “classical” antiquity.
     When more recently sociologists remembered the word, they naturally
gave it a slightly different connotation. Initially the word “class” was used— for example, by [Adam] Ferguson and [John] Millar in the eighteenth century—simply to distinguish social strata, as we should say today, by their rank or wealth. In this sense the word “class” can be found in all European languages in the late eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century the concept of class gradually took on a more definite coloring. Adam Smith had already spoken of the “poor” or “laboring class.” In the works of [David] Ricardo and [Andrew] Ure, [Henri de] Saint-Simon and [Charles] Fourier, and of course in those of [Friedrich] Engels and [Karl] Marx the “class of capitalists” makes its appearance beside the “laboring class,” the “rich” beside the “poor class,” the “bourgeoisie” beside the “proletariat” (which has accompanied the concept of class from its Roman origins). Since this particular concept of social class was first applied in the middle of the nineteenth century, its history has been as eventful as that of the society for which it was designed.
     Indeed, the greatness and fatality of his work become apparent in Marx’s
theory of class. In this theory, the three roots of his thought are joined. Marx adopted the word from the early British political economists; its application to “capitalists” and “proletarians” stems from the French “utopian” socialists; the conception of the class struggle is based on [Georg] Hegel’s dialectics. The theory of class provides the problematic link between sociological analysis and philosophical speculation in the work of Marx. Both can be separated, and have to be separated, but in this process the theory of class is cut in two; for it is as essential for Marx’s philosophy of history as it is for his analysis of the dynamics of capitalist society.
     Marx postponed the systematic presentation of his theory of class until
death took the pen from his hand. The irony has often been noted that the last (fifty-second) chapter of the last (third) volume of Capital, which bears the title “The Classes,” has remained unfinished. After little more than one page the text ends with the lapidary remark of its editor, Engels: “Here the manuscript breaks off.”
     The following elements of Marx’s theory of class appear particularly
worth emphasizing for sociological analysis:
     It is important to realize what [Theodor] Geiger called the “heuristic purpose behind the concept of class.” Wherever Marx used the concept in a sociological sense, he was not concerned with describing an existing state of society.
He was concerned, rather, with the analysis of certain laws of social development and of the forces involved in this development. To use the misleading terms of

modern sociology, the heuristic purpose of the concept of class was for Marx not “static” but “dynamic,” not “descriptive” but “analytical.” What these terms may mean and what they cannot mean will have to be discussed later in some detail. Here it is sufficient to emphasize that for Marx the theory of class was not a theory of a cross-section of society arrested in time, in particular not a theory of social stratification, but a tool for the explanation of changes in total societies.
     This heuristic purpose explains the often criticized two-class model underlying the dynamic theory of Marx. Had Marx wanted to describe his
society with photographic accuracy, this model would indeed have been most unsatisfactory. As a matter of fact, Marx does refer occasionally (without always using his concept of class in an entirely unambiguous manner) to a multitude of classes. He refers to the “two great categories into which the interest of the bourgeoisie is divided—land ownership and capital,” to the petty bourgeoisie as a “transitional class,” and to the class of small peasants.
     But the legitimacy of assuming for analytical purposes the dominance
of only two conflicting classes must not blind us to the fact that Marx has linked with his two-class model a number of additional postulates whose legitimacy appears rather more dubious. For Marx the category of class defines one side of an antagonism which entails the dominant issues of conflict in every society as well as the direction of its development. This means for Marx that (a) every conflict capable of generating structural change is a class conflict, (b) the contents of class conflict always represent the dominant issues of social conflict, and (c) the two classes stand in the relation of Hegel’s “thesis” and “antithesis,” in the sense that one is characterized by the affirmation (or possession) of those features of which the other is the complete negation.
     Marx states quite clearly that class conflicts do not originate in differences
of income, or of the sources of income. His classes are not tax classes in the sense of the Roman censors. Rather, the determinant of classes is “property.” Property, however, must not be understood in terms of purely passive wealth, but as an effective force of production, as “ownership of means of production” and its denial to others. In this sense, the “relations of production”—i.e., the authority relations resulting from the distribution of effective property in the realm of (industrial) production—constitute the ultimate determinant of the formation of classes and the development of class conflicts. The capitalists possess factories and machines, and buy the only property of the proletarians, their labor power, in order to produce a surplus value with these means of production and augment their capital. But our question cannot be answered all that easily. The role of property in Marx’s theory of class poses a problem of interpretation, and on this interpretation the validity of Marx’s theory of class stands or falls. Does Marx understand, by the relations of property or production, the relations of factual control and subordination in the enter-
                                          S S  OM p O S i T iO    H i     H y | 81
prises of industrial production—or merely the authority relations insofar as they are based on the legal title of property? Does he conceive of property in a loose (sociological) sense—i.e., in terms of the exclusiveness of legitimate control (in which the manager also exercises property functions)—or merely as a statutary property right in connection with such control? Is property for Marx a special case of authority—or, vice versa, authority a special case of property? These questions are of considerable significance. If one works with the narrow concept of property, class conflict is the specific characteristic of a form of production which rests on the union of ownership and control. In this case a society in which control is exercised, for example, by state functionaries, has by definition neither classes nor class conflicts. If, on the other hand, one works with the wider concept of property, class structure is determined by the authority structure of the enterprise, and the category of class becomes at least potentially applicable to all “relations of production.”
     Marx does not always make his answer to our questions entirely clear. But
it can be shown that his analyses are essentially based on the narrow, legal concept of property. This procedure, and this procedure only, enables Marx to link his sociology with his philosophy of history—a brilliant attempt, but at the same time a fault that robs his sociological analyses of stringency and conviction, a fault made no more acceptable by the fact that orthodox Marxists have remained faithful to their master in this point to the present day.
     One of the critical pivots of Marx’s theory of class is the undisputed identification of economic and political power and authority. Although classes are
founded on the “relations of production”—i.e., the distribution of effective property in the narrow sphere of commodity production—they become socially significant only in the political sphere. But both these spheres are inseparable. “The political power” of a class arises for Marx “from the relations of production.” The relations of production are “the final secret, the hidden basis of the whole construction of society”; industrial classes are eo ipso also social classes, and industrial class conflict is political class conflict. Nowhere has Marx explicitly discussed the basis of this empirical proposition—nor has he seen sufficiently clearly that it is an empirical proposition rather than a postulate or premise. The thesis that political conditions are determined by industrial conditions seems to stem, for him, from the generalized assertion of an absolute and universal primacy of production over all other structures of economy and society.
     Classes do not constitute themselves as such until they participate in
political conflicts as organized groups. Although Marx occasionally uses the concept of class in a less determinate, more comprehensive sense, a multitude of statements leave little doubt that for him class formation and class conflict were phenomena belonging to the sphere of politics. “As long as the proletariat has not sufficiently developed to organize itself as a class, . . . the

## 82 | H pT 3

struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie has not yet assumed a political character.” This means conversely that the carriers of class conflict have organized themselves as classes, and have become classes, only if class conflict has assumed a political character.
     The work of Marx falls into two separable parts. [One part is scientific,
based on sociology, and the other is based on philosophy that is unprovable.] Marx’s theory of class contains elements of both kinds. Indeed, nowhere has Marx linked both kinds of propositions as cleverly, and hence as deceptively, as in his theory of class.
     In a logically independent approach Marx investigates the society of his
time. There he notes empirically three factors, among others: (a) the presence of a conflict between social groups (classes), (b) the presence of effective private property, and (c) the presence of relations of domination and subjection. He believes furthermore that he can discern in this society a tendency for private property to be abolished and replaced by communal property—an observation which at least to some extent has proved correct. And what happens if effective private property disappears? It is precisely at this point that Marx jumps from sociology into philosophy and back by introducing his undoubtedly brilliant trick of definition. By asserting the dependence of classes on relations of domination and subjection, and the dependence of these relations on the possession of or exclusion from effective private capital, he makes on the one hand empirically private property and on the other hand philosophically social classes, the central factor of his analyses. One can retrace step by step the thought process to which Marx has succumbed at this point. It is not the thought process of the empirical scientist who seeks only piecemeal knowledge and expects only piecemeal progress but that of the system builder who suddenly finds that everything fits! For if private property disappears (empirical hypothesis), then there are no longer classes (trick of definition)! If there are no longer any classes, there is no alienation (speculative postulate). The realm of liberty is realized on earth (philosophical idea). Had Marx, conversely, defined private property by authority relations, his empirical observation would not have “fitted,” and he would have had to drop his philosophy of history. For effective private property may disappear empirically, but authority relations can do so only by the magic trick of the system maniac.
     Perhaps a Marx without the Marxian philosophy of history would have
realized that power and authority are not tied to the legal title of property. Marx himself could not realize this, and certainly could not admit it, for had he done so, his philosophical conception of the classless society would have become impossible both empirically and intellectually.
     There is, moreover, a strange irony in the fact that the same Marx who
so often attacked the uncritical assertion that private property is universal
                                           S S  OM p O S i T iO    H i     H y | 83
introduces the same assertion in a concealed way but equally uncritically by speaking of the universality of classes, which for him are tied to the presence of private property.
     A society is classless if it is “powerless”—i.e., if there is no authority exercised in it at all, or if such authority is distributed equally among all citizens.
But in this sense the category of classless society is sociologically meaningless. It may be possible to conceive of a society in which all differences of income and prestige are leveled and which is therefore “stratumless,” but it is hardly possible to imagine a society in which there is no differentiation of roles in terms of legitimate power. Permanent anarchism is socially Utopian. Any society, and, indeed, any social organization, requires some differentiation into positions of domination and positions of subjection. No matter what the formal nature of the authority mechanism, it is a functional imperative of social organizations. Since classes can be explained in terms of the differential distribution of authority, there is no sociological substance in the assumption of a classless society devoid of differentiated authority structures.
     However, the idea of a classless society may be understood in a second
sense. It is possible to conceive of a society whose structure contains positions equipped with different authority rights but which does not enable any group of persons to occupy these positions regularly and exclusively. The same might hold in imperatively coordinated associations other than the state—e.g., in industry. Associations may be governed by the principle of an alternating chairmanship, according to which the incumbency of positions of domination may or may not be patterned. The collective settlements (kibbutzim) of Israel seem to provide a case in point. At least originally it was stipulated that every member in turn was to occupy the positions of leadership for relatively short periods of time. In view of examples of this kind, it seems plausible to argue that where there is no group which is capable of monopolizing the positions of authority, it is virtually impossible for coherent conflict groups to emerge, and the society or association in question is therefore classless. To be sure, this is a kind of classlessness rather different from that of the Utopian anarchy; still, it cannot be denied that it makes sense to speak of classlessness in this case also. We might say that societies and associations governed by a permanently “alternating chairmanship” are classless so far as social mobility is concerned, for it is not the structure of positions but the fluctuation of personnel that in this case prevents the formation of classes and conflict between them.

3.2 Sex, Race, and Class
         S J
T here has been enough confusion generated when sex, race, and class have
     confronted each other as separate and even conflicting entities. That they
are separate entities is self-evident. That they have proven themselves to be not separate, inseparable, is harder to discern. Yet if sex and race are pulled away from class, virtually all that remains is the truncated, provincial, sectarian politics of the white male metropolitan Left. I hope to show in barest outline, first, that the working-class movement is something other than what that Left has ever conceived it to be. Second, locked within the contradiction between the discrete entity of sex or race and the totality of class is the greatest deterrent to working-class power and at the same time the creative energy to achieve that power.
     Beginning with the female (caste) experience, we redefined class to include women. That redefinition was based on the unwaged labor of the
housewife. We put it this way: “Since Marx, it has been clear that capital rules and develops through the wage—that is, that the foundation of capitalist society was the wage laborer and his or her direct exploitation. What has been neither clear nor assumed by the organizations of the working-class movement is that precisely through the wage has the exploitation of the nonwage laborer been organized. This exploitation has been even more effective because the lack of a wage hid it. . . . Where women are concerned their labor appears to be a personal service outside of capital.”
                                         S S  OM p O S i T iO    H i     H y | 85
     But if the relation of caste to class where women are concerned presents
itself in a hidden, mystified form, this mystification is not unique to women. Before we confront race, let us take an apparent diversion.
     The least powerful in the society are our children, also unwaged in a
wage labor society. They were once (and in tribal society, for example, still are) accepted as an integral part of the productive activity of the community. The work they did was part of the total social labor and was acknowledged as such. Where capital is extending or has extended its rule, children are taken away from others in the community and forced to go to school, against which the number of rebels is growing daily. Is their powerlessness a class question? Is their struggle against school the class struggle? We believe it is. Schools are institutions organized by capital to achieve its purpose through and against the child. “Capital . . . sent them to school not only because they are in the way of others’ more ‘productive’ labor or only to indoctrinate them. The rule of capital through the wage compels every able-bodied person to function, under the law of division of labor, and to function in ways that are if not immediately, then ultimately profitable to the expansion and extension of the rule of capital. That, fundamentally, is the meaning of school. Where children are concerned, their labor appears to be learning for their own benefit.”
     So here are two sections of the working class whose activities, one in the
home and the other in the school, appear to be outside of the capitalist wage labor relation because the workers themselves are wageless. In reality, their activities are facets of capitalist production and its division of labor.
     One, housewives, are involved in the production and (what is the same
thing) reproduction of workers, what Marx calls labor power. They service those who are daily destroyed by working for wages and who need to be daily renewed; and they care for and discipline those who are being prepared to work when they grow up.
     The other, children, are those who from birth are the objects of this care
and discipline, who are trained in homes, in schools, and in front of the television to be future workers. But this has two aspects.
     In the first place, for labor power to be reproduced in the form of children, these children must be coerced into accepting discipline and especially
the discipline of working, of being exploited in order to be able to eat. In addition, however, they must be disciplined and trained to perform a certain kind of work. The labor that capital wants done is divided and each category parceled out internationally as the life work, the destiny, the identity of specific sets of workers. The phrase often used to describe this is the international division of labor. We will say more of this later, but for now let the West Indian mother of a seven-year-old sum up her son’s education with precision: “They’re choosing the street sweepers now.”

## 86 | H pT 3

     Those of us in the feminist movement who have torn the final veil away
from this international capitalist division of labor to expose women’s and children’s class position, which was hidden by the particularity of their caste position, learned a good deal of this from the Black movement. A mass movement teaches less by what it says than by the power it exercises, which, clearing away the debris of appearances, tells it like it is.
     What gave us the boldness to break, fearless of the consequences, was the
power of the Black movement. We found that redefining class went hand-inhand with rediscovering a Marx the Left had never understood.
     There were deeper reasons too why caste and class seemed contradictory.
It appears often that the interests of Blacks are contradicted by the interests of Whites, and it is similar with men and women. To grasp the class interest when there seems not one but two, three, four, each contradicting the other, seems to be one of the most difficult tasks that confront us in both theory and practice.
     Another source of confusion is that not all women, children, or Black
men are working class. This is only to say that within the movements in which these form are layers whose struggle tends to be aimed at moving up in the capitalist hierarchy rather than at destroying it. And so within each movement there is a struggle about which class interest the movement will serve. But this is the history also of white male workers’ movements. There is no class “purity,” not even in shop floor organizations. The struggle by workers against organizations they formed there and in the society generally—trade unions, labor parties, etc.—is the class struggle.
     Let’s put the relation of caste to class another way. The word culture
is often used to show that class concepts are narrow, philistine, inhuman. Exactly the opposite is the case. A national culture that has evolved over decades or centuries may appear to deny that society’s relation to international capitalism. It is a subject too wide to go into deeply here, but one basic point can be quickly clarified.
     The lifestyle unique to themselves that a people develop once they are
enmeshed by capitalism, in response to and in rebellion against it, cannot be understood at all except as the totality of their capitalist lives. To delimit culture is to reduce it to a decoration of daily life. Culture is plays and poetry about the exploited; ceasing to wear miniskirts and taking to trousers instead; the clash between the soul of Black Baptism and the guilt and sin of White Protestantism. Culture is also the shrill of the alarm clock that rings at 6 .. when a Black woman in London wakes her children to get them ready for the baby-minder. Culture is how cold she feels at the bus stop and then how hot in the crowded bus. Culture is how you feel on Monday morning at eight when you clock in, wishing it were Friday, wishing your life away. Culture is making the tea while your man watches the news on the telly.
                                         S S  OM p O S i T iO    H i     H y | 87
     And culture is an “irrational woman” walking out of the kitchen into the
sitting room and without a word turning off the telly “for no reason at all.”
     From where does this culture spring that is so different from a man’s if
you are a woman and different too from a White woman’s if you are a Black woman? Is it auxiliary to the class struggle (as the White Left has it), or is it more fundamental than the class struggle (as Black nationalists and radical feminists have it) because it is special to your sex, your race, your age, your nationality, and the moment in time when you are these things?
     Our identity, our social roles, the way we are seen, appear to be disconnected from our capitalist functions. To be liberated from them (or through
them) appears to be independent of our liberation from capitalist wage slavery. In my view, identity—caste—is the very substance of class.
     Here is the “strange place” where we found the key to the relation of
class to caste written down most succinctly. Here is where the international division of labor is posed as power relations within the working class. It is volume 1 of Marx’s Capital: “Manufacture . . . develops a hierarchy of labor powers, to which there corresponds a scale of wages. If, on the one hand, the individual laborers are appropriated and annexed for life by a limited function; on the other hand, the various operations of the hierarchy are parceled out among the laborers according to both their natural and their acquired capabilities.”
     In two sentences is laid out the deep material connection between racism,
sexism, national chauvinism, and the chauvinism of the generations who are working for wages against children and pensioners who are wageless, who are “dependents.”
     A hierarchy of labor powers and a scale of wages to correspond. Racism and sexism training us to develop and acquire certain capabilities at
the expense of all others. Then these acquired capabilities are taken to be our nature, fixing our functions for life, and fixing also the quality of our mutual relations. So planting cane or tea is not a job for White people, and changing nappies is not a job for men, and beating children is not violence. Race, sex, age, nation, each an indispensable element of the international division of labor. Our feminism bases itself on a hitherto invisible stratum of the hierarchy of labor powers—the housewife—to which there corresponds no wage at all.
     Divided by the capitalist organization of society into factory, office,
school, plantation, home, and street, we are divided too by the very institutions which claim to represent our struggle collectively as a class.
     In the metropolis, the Black movement was the first section of the class
massively to take its autonomy from these organizations and to break out of the containment of the struggle only in the factory. When Black workers

## 88 | H pT 3

burn the center of a city, however, White Left eyes, especially if they are trade union eyes, see race, not class.
     The women’s movement was the next major movement of the class in the
metropolis to find for itself a power base outside the factory as well as in it. Like the Black movement before them, to be organizationally autonomous of capital and its institutions, women and their movement had also to be autonomous of that part of the “hierarchy of labor powers” that capital used specifically against them. For Blacks it was Whites. For women it was men. For Black women it is both.
     Strange to think that even today, when confronted with the autonomy of
the Black movement or the autonomy of the women’s movement, there are those who talk about this “dividing the working class.” Strange indeed when our experience has told us that in order for the working class to unite in spite of the divisions that are inherent in its very structure—factory versus plantation versus home versus school—those at the lowest levels of the hierarchy must themselves find the key to their weakness, must themselves find the strategy that will attack the point and shatter it, must themselves find their own modes of struggle.
     It is not the first time either that a women’s movement received its impetus from the exercise of power by Black people. The Black slave who formed
the abolitionist movement and organized the Underground Railroad for the escape to the North also gave White women—and again the more privileged of them—a chance, an occasion to transcend the limitations in which the female personality was imprisoned. Women, trained always to do for others, left their homes not to free themselves—that would have been outrageous— but to free “the slave.” They were encouraged by Black women, ex-slaves like Sojourner Truth, who suffered as the breeders of labor power on the plantation. But once those White women had taken their first decisive step out of the feminine mold, they confronted more sharply their own situation. They had to defend their right, as women, to speak in public against slavery. They were refused, for example, seating at the abolitionist conference of 1840 in London because they were women. By 1848 at Seneca Falls, New York, they called their own conference, for women’s rights. There was a male speaker. He was a leading abolitionist. He was Black. He had been a slave. His name was Frederick Douglass.
     The strategy of feminist class struggle is, as we have said, based on the
unwaged woman in the home. Whether she also works for wages outside the home, her labor of producing and reproducing the working class weighs her down, weakens her capacity to struggle—she doesn’t even have time. Her position in the wage structure is low especially but not only if she is Black. And even if she is relatively well placed in the hierarchy of labor powers (rare
                                              S S  OM p O S i T iO    H i     H y | 89
enough!), she remains defined as a sexual object of men. Why? Because as long as most women are housewives, part of whose function in reproducing labor power is to be the sexual object of men, no woman can escape that identity. We demand wages for the work we do in the home. And that demand for a wage from the state is, first, a demand to be autonomous of men on whom we are now dependent. Second, we demand money without working out of the home and open for the first time the possibility of refusing forced labor both in waged work and in the home itself.
     What is their role in the revolution? How can the unwaged struggle without the lever of the wage and the factory? We do not pose the answers—we
can’t. But we pose the questions in a way that assumes that the unemployed have not to go to work in order to subvert capitalist society.
     How the working class will ultimately unite organizationally we don’t
know. We do know that up to now many of us have been told to forget our own needs in some wider interest that was never wide enough to include us. And so we have learned by bitter experience that nothing unified and revolutionary will be formed until each section of the exploited will have made its own autonomous power felt.
     Power to the sisters and therefore to the class.

3.3 Wageless of the World
       S J
T he problem of the revolution is the unity of the working class internationally. The working class is divided by the power of those whose work is

## 90 | H pT 3

waged (men) over those whose work is unwaged (women). But the hierarchy within the working class is by no means confined to the power of men, identified with the wage, over women, identified by wageless and therefore invisible work. There is also the power of the waged worker in the metropolis over the unwaged worker in the third world. Both are fundamental to the capitalist division of labor nationally and internationally.
    In the same way as the proletarian character of the laborer in the home is
hidden by the lack of a wage, so the proletarian character of the laborer on the land, “the peasant,” land-owning or landless, is hidden by the wagelessness of that labor.
    The majority of Latin American women are either Indian or of Indian
extraction, existing on subsistence agriculture and doing a double load of unwaged labor: both as jornaleras (day workers), minifundistas (smallholders) or ejiditarias (collective farm workers), and as housewives. The unit of production is the family. Women’s work in the home, where they transform primary materials into the few consumer goods of food and clothing, is a fundamental aspect of the production of that family unit.
    Even where there is payment in the form of a wage (to los jornaleros) or in
the form of payment for sale of crops, it is the man who probably receives it. Women and children who work alongside him work for capital through his command. But at least the work of women and children is undisguised; it is recognized as work. Which is more than can be said for the urban housewife who is directly dominated by the wage; her housework, being unwaged, is not considered work at all.
    So it is that capital has seized on every mode of production, and on the
“train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions” that spring from these modes, to exploit all those temporarily trapped in them and reinforces that exploitation by the prejudices and opinions they generate, from which women suffer most and in a most specific manner. To obscure and thus ignore the specific nature of the exploitation of women (and children), and the specific and autonomous nature of the struggles this must produce, with the blackmail of universal poverty or universal repression is to resort to a moralism that in fact is a political attack on the least powerful—and therefore of course on the poorest and most repressed. And when the least powerful are attacked, all the forces of subversion are weakened.
    It is impossible to speak of the relation of women to capital anywhere
without at the same time confronting the question of development versus underdevelopment. It is even more unavoidable when it is women of the third world of whom we speak, since their situation cannot be wrested from the general context of predominant underdevelopment; rather they are a honed

edge with which to approach the Gordian knot that confronts all workingclass struggle in the third world.
WOkiG fO piT The tendency has been to subsume all those who are not city proletarians under the term “peasant.” Once we assume that the basic division within the working class internationally is between the waged and wageless, and that to be wageless is not necessarily to be outside of the capitalist wage relation, every mode of labor that exists today must be reexamined to determine the social relation that it reproduces: whether there is surplus labor, if that surplus labor is stolen (appropriated by someone other than the laborer), and if so, by whom—in other words, whether and where capital has transformed precapitalist modes of labor into modes of its own self-expansion. Even the subsistence farming family of Mexico, for example, which produces no material surplus may be working usefully for capital; braceras and braceros provide a cheap and intimidated reserve army of labor, particularly for the farms of California and Texas. Women on that “unproductive” subsistence farm, with our unending work, have produced that army of labor.
     In a Mexican village one family may invest in a television. Other families
around must pay to see it—must find the money to pay to see it, must find the job or grow the crop or make the struggle for the wage without the work, which will yield the money to pay to see it. Or reappropriate another just like it or bigger—that is, make a struggle for the wage without the work in a way that bypasses the money form.
     Once we have seen it, or heard the grating sounds of the inexpensive
model of transistor radio in the village or in the field, that person, that family, that community, has stepped beyond any definition of itself as “peasant.” When the woman from an area of underdevelopment in the heart of Europe, such as a village in Spain, sees a Hollywood film, the plot is secondary to the technology of the North American kitchen (which, nevertheless, is still the North American woman’s place). So we are ready to demand in Mexico, Tanzania, India, and Spain all of the wealth that exists but of which we have been deprived. For on the media they tell us about or even show us all the products of technology that third world peoples are denied. They have sent the media to give one message, but we have absorbed quite another. For we have come to the media with a mind crammed with the refusal of the bitterness of our experience. That media presents a picture, however distorted, of a whole world that peasants of Lenin’s day or of Zapata’s never knew existed. It pictures a range of goods and therefore a range of possibilities that nobody of

Lenin’s day or of Zapata’s knew, since they didn’t exist anywhere. Our experiences as exploited women, urban or rural, third world or metropolitan, are unique in each case. Our needs and our desires are increasingly international and universal: to be free, to be free of the labor that has worn us down over centuries, to be free of domination and dependence on men. We repudiate the assumption that we who are not socialized, collectivized, unionized, are the “backward ones.” The backward technology with which they have burdened us is no measure of our own aspirations. And that is our dilemma.
fSiG THi vOpMT In the metropolis when we demand a wage from the state, we are told that we can get a wage in the offices or factories, which are waiting to suck up what little of our lives the washing machine has left free. Millions of us are driven there daily by an inflation that is transforming bringing home a wage—and therefore doing a double shift—into another household duty, another chore, another obligation of the wife. In Mexico, with a 40 percent rate of unemployment or underemployment, to propose that women who want a wage take a second job in factories, offices, and so on (if they don’t already have one on the land) is even more laughable. None of us wants that second job—not those who have it and the pittance of a wage that may go with it or those who desperately need a wage despite the sixteen-hour day of the full-time housewife. More work will never sweeten our bitterness. Yet third world women (in fact all women) are told there is no other solution but to accept this “development,” to accept, that is, more rationalized exploitation, if they are lucky enough to get it in that sea of wagelessness. There is only one development today in the world, and that is capitalist development, even greater exploitation than we have suffered up to now. That is the price we have traditionally paid for the wage. We will still bear, train, and care for the new generation while we are “benefiting” from the assembly line of their development. Also, because so many of us are wageless, they will get the very few they hire cut-rate. Passively to accept that development is to accept a development of slavery, the opposite of its abolition.
     For us in the metropolis to demand a wage from the State for the work
we are doing in the home is our only real choice, so that we can massively refuse that job and the second, waged, job we do. As capital’s crisis deepens it is not clear what place metropolitan women will have in its plans. One thing, however, is already clear. Though we are surrounded by development, they have begun to plead poverty and austerity and are expecting women to be the prime shock absorbers. When we demand wages for housework in whatever form—child care that we control; free birth control and abortion
                                         S S  OM p O S i T iO    H i     H y | 93
that do not sicken, kill, or sterilize us; the socialization of our work on our terms to liberate time for ourselves; and most important, money we can call our own—they now say here what they have always said in the third world to every demand by women: “The till is empty.”
    Our great advantage in the metropolis is that the wealth stolen from all
of us is where we are, on the spot, to demand back. For those in the third world, it is infinitely more difficult to demand the return of the wealth that our combined labor has created. For most of us the dilemma is that this wealth is not where we are. This poses enormous problems of organization and mobilization of power. Yet we have no choice. The State of every third world country that has tried to impose development in the form of “aid” and/or investment has ultimately had to defend that development with arms against the working class. When it is proposed that the road to the new society passes through our increased productivity, the Chilean firing squads are there to block the exits to our own road.
    Since in the past we have lost when we didn’t ask enough, we cannot do
worse by demanding everything. And though the wealth is not on the spot in the third world, the agents of its continued expropriation are always close at hand. The State is only partially made up of the government and Rockefeller Foundations; these are the executors outside the factory of the multinational corporations. Together they plan our exploitation, its quality and intensity, as part of an international plan that encompasses every country, females and males, children and adults, the working-class employed and unemployed, the waged and unwaged of that class, the urbanized and the ruralized of that class. It is against them, and the (usually U.S.) arms that enforce their plan and their will, that such demands for wages will ultimately have to be made by all of us women. For though the dilemma of the third world is that the wealth of our combined labor is in the metropolis, the third world can draw on the wealth of our combined struggle to get it back.
    To raise our voices internationally to demand our wage and an end to the
work we do, which has brought no wage in the home and very little wage (if any) out of it, to demand that we develop and that technology be the servant of our development, the opposite of our being at the service of a developing technology the benefits of which we are then denied, is to completely revolutionize the terms of struggle. It is to articulate the internationalization of our struggle and to raise our power at every moment of the international capitalist circuit.
    In 1971, we said: “Women of the third world have not yet spoken of
the effects of colonial rule and industrialization on them and on the traditional family. When they do, the horrors we now associate with capitalism and imperialism will gain new dimensions. We need a woman’s history of

imperialism, and of the division of labor between the industrial and agricultural worlds.”
    That history has begun to emerge, as a weapon in the developing struggle.
    Power to the sisters and therefore to the class internationally.

3.4 Hierarchy of Wages and Incomes
         C C
O f course, the existence of a hierarchy of command, of wages, and of
      incomes is today “justified” by a host of arguments. Before discussing
them on their own, it must be noted that these arguments very clearly are ideological in character: they are made in order to justify, with an only apparent logic, a reality to which they are only remotely related, and they are formulated on the basis of presuppositions that themselves are never brought to light. Let us also note that these arguments are suffering the effects of what also has been happening for decades to society’s official ideology as a whole.
                                        S S  OM p O S i T iO    H i     H y | 95
This ideology is decomposing before our very eyes; it no longer can present a coherent face to the world, it no longer dares to invoke values no one now accepts, and it is unable to invent other ones.
    The central point of today’s official ideology concerning hierarchy is its
justification of wage and income hierarchy on the basis of the command hierarchy, which in its turn is defended as resting on a hierarchy or scale of “knowledge” or of “qualifications” or of “talents” or of “responsibilities” or of a “shortage” in specialized skills. It will be noticed immediately that these scales neither coincide nor correspond with each other either in logic or in reality: there may be (and there is) a dearth of garbage collectors and a glut of professors; great scientists have no “responsibility,” whereas some laboring people possessing very little “knowledge” have daily responsibility for the life and death of hundreds or thousands of persons. Second, every attempt to make a “synthesis” of these different criteria, to “weight” them, is necessarily and inevitably arbitrary. Finally, just as arbitrary and without a shadow of possible justification is the move from such a scale, supposedly established, to actual wage differentials: why is one more year of studies, or one more diploma, worth one hundred dollars more a month, and not ten dollars or one thousand dollars?
    It is said that the command and wage hierarchy is justified by and founded
on a hierarchy or scale of knowledge. In a business firm (or in society) today, however, those who have the most “knowledge” are not those who are in command or who obtain the highest salaries. True, the upper echelons of the hierarchy are recruited especially among those who have “diplomas.” However, beyond the fact that it would be ridiculous to identify knowledge with diplomas, it is not those with “the most knowledge” that ascend the command and wage ladder, but rather those most adept at competing in the struggles that unfold within the business firm’s managerial bureaucracy. An industrial firm is practically never directed by the most “learned” of its engineers; that person is usually confined to a research bureau. And on the societal level, we know that scientists, great or not, have no power and are paid only a small fraction of what the head of an average business firm is paid. Neither in the firm nor in society do power and high incomes go today to those who “have the greatest knowledge”; power and money are in the hands of a bureaucracy, within which promotion has nothing to do with “knowledge,” or “technical abilities,” but is determined rather by the ability to survive the struggles between cliques and clans (an ability of no economic and social value, save for those who possess it) and by one’s connections with big capital (in Western countries) or with the ruling political party (in Eastern countries).
    What has just been said goes to show as well what ought to be made of
the argument used to justify hierarchy on the basis of differences in people’s

## 96 | H pT 3

“abilities.” When one considers the wage and power differences that really matter—not those between a semiskilled worker and a tool maker, but those between manual workers on the one hand and top management on the other—it is clear that what is “rewarded” is not the ability to do a job well, but the ability to bet on the right horse.
     Arguments justifying hierarchy on the basis of responsibilities carry no
more weight than the others we have examined. A railway-crossing guard or an air-traffic controller has in his hands the lives of several hundred people a day, yet he is paid many times less than a tenth of the salary of the CEO of the national railway line or of Air France, who has no one’s life in his hands.
     The argument according to which wage hierarchy is explained and justified by the relative scarcity of different skills or types of work hardly merits
serious discussion. Such scarcity, when it does exist, can drive to a higher level than before the pay of a category of workers for a shorter or longer period of time, but an increase of this kind in the pay rate will never extend beyond certain narrow limits. Whatever the relative “scarcity” of semiskilled workers and the relative “glut” of lawyers, the latter group will always be paid much more than the former.
     All this concerns what we have called the ideology of justification for hierarchy. There also exists an apparently more “respectable” discourse, that of
academic or Marxist economic science. We cannot here undertake to refute it in detailed fashion. Let us say summarily that, for the academic economist, the wage is supposed to correspond to the “marginal product of work”—that is to say, to what the hour of work of one additional worker “adds” to the product (or, what boils down to the same thing, to what would be subtracted from the product if one worker were to be removed from production). Without entering into the theoretical discussion of this conception in general—its untenability can easily be proved—its absurdity can immediately be shown in the case of interest to us here, that of the differentiation of pay for different skills from the moment there is a division of labor and an interdependence of different jobs, which is the case generally in modern industry. If, in a coalfired locomotive, the train’s engineer is eliminated, one does not “reduce a little” of the product (transportation), one eliminates it completely; and the same thing is true if one eliminates the fireman. The “product” of this indivisible team of engineer and fireman obeys a law of all or nothing, and there is no “marginal product” of the one that can be separated from that of the other. The same thing goes on the shop floor, and ultimately for the modern factory as a whole, where jobs are closely interdependent.
     For Marxist economics, on the other hand, wages are to be determined by
the “law of labor value”; that is to say, they would in fact be equivalent to the cost of producing and reproducing this commodity that is, under capitalism,
                                         S S  OM p O S i T iO    H i     H y | 97
labor power. Consequently, differences in wages between unskilled labor and skilled labor would have to correspond to the differences in training costs of these two categories (the main part of which is represented by the maintenance of future workers during their “unproductive” years of apprenticeship). It can easily be calculated that, on this basis, differences in pay could hardly exceed a 1:2 ratio (between labor absolutely devoid of all skill and that requiring ten or fifteen years of preparatory training). Now, in real life such differences greatly exceed that level, both in Western countries and in Eastern ones (where wage hierarchy is practically as overt as it is in the West).
     We must emphasize, moreover, that, even if academic or Marxist theory
offered an explanation of wage differentiations, they would in any case be unable to furnish a justification for them. For, in both cases, the existence of different skills is accepted, left undiscussed as a given beyond debate, whereas in fact it is only the result of the overall economic and social system and of its continued reproduction. If skilled labor is “worth” more, it would be, for example, in the Marxist view, because the family of this laborer has spent more for his training (and, theoretically, has to “recoup the costs”—which in practice signifies that the skilled worker will be able in his turn to finance the training of his children, etc.). Why, however, has this family been able to spend more—something that other families were not able to do? Because it was already privileged from the standpoint of income. All that these “explanations” say, therefore, strictly speaking, is that if a hierarchical differentiation exists at the outset, it will perpetuate itself by means of this mechanism.
     In modern society, however, the hierarchical (or, what boils down to
nearly the same thing, bureaucratic) system has become practically universal. As soon as there is any collective activity, it is organized according to the hierarchical principle, and the hierarchy of command and power coincides more and more with the hierarchy of wages and incomes. The result is that people almost never succeed in imagining that things could be otherwise, or that they themselves could be something definite except in terms of the place they occupy in the hierarchical pyramid.
     Yet, we must also see how this hierarchy is recruited. A son of a rich person
will be a rich person, a son of a manager [cadre] will have all the chances in the world to become a manager. Thus, in large part the strata occupying the higher levels of the hierarchical pyramid perpetuate themselves by heredity. And that does not occur by chance. A social system always tends to reproduce itself. If some social strata have privileges, the members thereof will do everything they can—and their privileges signify precisely that they are capable of doing so to a large extent—to transmit these privileges to their descendants. To the extent that, in such a system, these strata have need of “new men”— because the managerial apparatuses are expanding and proliferating—they

## 98 | H pT 3

select, among the offspring of “lower” strata, those deemed most “apt” in order to co-opt them within their own strata. To this extent, it may appear that the “work” and the “abilities” of those who have been coopted have played a role in their career, and that their “merits” are being rewarded. Once again, however, “abilities” and “merits” here signify essentially the ability to adapt oneself to the reigning system, the better to serve it. From a self-managed society’s point of view, such abilities have no meaning.
     Certainly, some people may think that, even in a self-managed society,
the most courageous, the most tenacious, the most hardworking, the most “competent” individuals should have the right to a particular “reward,” and that this reward ought to be monetary. And this nourishes the illusion that there might be a justifiable hierarchy of wages.
     This illusion does not resist examination. No more than in the presentday system does one see on what basis differences in pay could be founded
logically and justified with figures to back them up. Why should this bit of competence be worth for its possessor four times as much income as that granted to another, and not twice or twelvefold? What sense is there in saying that the competency of a good surgeon is worth exactly as much as—or more, or less, than—that of a good engineer? And why is it not worth exactly as much as that of a good train engineer or a good teacher?
     Once removed from a few very narrow domains, and stripped of general
signification, there are no objective criteria for measuring and comparing the competencies, knowledge, and know-how of different individuals. And if society itself covers the cost for an individual to acquire such know-how—as is practically the case already today—it is unclear why the individual who has already benefited once from the privilege this acquisition constitutes in itself should benefit from it a second time under the form of a higher income. The same thing goes, moreover, for “merit” and “intelligence.” There are certainly individuals who are born more gifted than others as regards certain activities, or who become so. These differences are in general small, and the development of such differences especially depends on one’s family, social, and educational setting. But in any case, to the extent that someone has a “gift,” the exercise of this “gift” is in itself a source of pleasure when it is not hindered. And as for the rare individuals who are exceptionally gifted, what really matters is not monetary “reward” but creating what they are irresistibly driven to create. If Einstein had been interested in money, he would not have become Einstein— and it is likely that he would have made a rather mediocre boss or financier.

3.5 A Brief Rant against Work
       With Particular Attention to the Relation of Work to White
       Supremacy, Sexism, and Miserabilism
       P R
       e imaginary is that which tends to become real.
       —ndré Breton, Earthlight
Daily life, a product of our own constant invention, exists riveted to a grid of time and superimposed on a dartboard labeled Desire. While bending backward over a bottomless abyss seething with consumer products, torrents of the dead past and credit debt dragging us ever downward, a luminous mirage of advertising offers its poisonous cup. Dart in hand, one pauses, perhaps to consider that obscure presence, the moment, and one’s choices (now usually called “options,” thanks to the all-pervasive penetration of market lingo). The “future” is a bought and sold commodity, but somehow it seems never to arrive. The consumer wanders lost and despondent in The Present—always The Present. From time to time a new Present arrives, but without any significant change. Frame after frame, like a sixteen-millimeter film, life clicks by. The Present Moment exists perpetually, speeded up; an illusion of movement is created, but real life remains elusive.
     This eternal present, the stuff of which daily life is made, and to which
we find ourselves bound, raises the question: how can we transform it? That is the problem facing us all: how to break the pattern of work—of week-toweek slavery, that habit of habits, that addiction of addictions—and how to detach ourselves from the grip of Self-Defeating Illusions for Sale, Inc. (a.k.a. the corporate consumer state). Especially ingrained is that pattern of working for someone else: making someone else’s “goods,” producing the wealth that someone else enjoys, thinking someone else’s thoughts (sometimes actually believing them one’s own), and even dreaming someone else’s dreams—in short, living someone else’s life, for one’s own life, and one’s own dream of life, have long since been lost in the shuffle. Such depersonalization and alienation from our deepest desires is implanted during childhood via school, church, movies, and TV and soon reaches the point where an individual’s desire is not only a net of contradictions but also a commodity like all the others. “True life” always seems to be just a bit beyond what a weekly

## 10 0 | H pT 3

paycheck and credit card can afford and is thus indefinitely postponed. And each postponement contributes to the reproduction of a social system that practically everyone who is not a multimillionaire or a masochist has come to loathe.
    Freedom becomes possible only when the individual says, as Fenton Johnson put it in a 1914 poem:
       I am tired of work
       I am tired of building up somebody else’s civilization.
     The systematic suppression of a person’s real desires—and that is largely
what work consists of—is exacerbated by capitalism’s incessant manipulation of artificial desires, “as advertised.” This gives daily life the character of a mass neurosis, with increasingly frequent psychotic episodes. To relieve the all-embracing boredom of daily life, society offers an endless array of distractions and stupefactions, most of them “available at a store near you.” The trouble is, these distractions and stupefactions, legal or illegal, soon become part of the boredom, for they satisfy no authentic desire.
     When the news reports horrible crimes committed by children or teenagers trying to be satanists, or superheroes, or terrorists, or just “bad guys,” we
can be sure that these kids lived lives of intolerable dullness, that they were so isolated from their own desires and from the larger society that they didn’t even know how or where to look for something different, or how to rebel in such a way that it might actually make a difference. Instead, they picked up some trashy notions from Bible school, Hollywood, and TV that promised a few minutes of meaningless excitement followed by lots of publicity—also meaningless. Each time something like this happens we hear cries to monitor films more closely, and to ban violence on TV. Rarely, however, does anyone criticize the Bible or the Christian churches, despite the fact that Christianity—by far the bloodiest of the world’s major religions—is far more to be blamed.
     Similarly, one rarely hears criticism of war or the armed forces—a gang
of professional killers whose influence on children cannot be anything other than baleful. And even less often does one encounter criticism of another intrinsically violent institution: the nuclear family; indeed, at this late date in human history, this relic of patriarchy is still held up as some sort of ideal. Replacing the extended family, the nuclear family as we know it today is an invention of the nineteenth century. Constructed by white bourgeois Europeans to meet the needs of expanding industrialization, it reflects capitalism’s model of the chain of command. Christianity continues the sanction of male supremacy as a time-honored tradition dating back to a mandate of God,
                                       S S  OM p O S i T iO    H i     H y | 101
no less, and reinforces the deadly superego politics that defines so much of Western civilization, particularly its “made in the USA” version, now rapidly overpowering the entire planet in the name of globalization.
     All too rare are signs of the emancipatory “poetic politics” called for by
James Baldwin in the 1960s, and recently renewed by David Roediger in his critique of the emptiness and brutality of so-called white culture. A poetic politics—a politics based on the Pleasure Principle, as surrealists have always demanded—would seek to create a nonrepressive civilization; its program would naturally focus on freedom, equality, direct action, and improvisation. Capital’s war of each against all will grow worse, because each is increasingly at war with his or her own self. Self-hatred leads directly to hatred of the Other, which in turn perpetuates state violence and all forms of economic, racial, and gender oppression: in other words, superego politics.
     As Anna Freud said, “What else is the superego than identification
with the aggressor?” The world today is confronted by greater, more earthshaking, more life-threatening problems than ever before: wars all over, massive pollution, global warming, the return of slavery, white supremacy, oppression of women, ecological disaster, neocolonialism, state terrorism, the prison industry, genocide, cancer, AIDS, the traffic death toll, xenophobia, pesticides, genetic engineering—the list goes on and on.
     Ceaselessly bombarded by news reports and sound bites of one catastrophe after another, most people have no idea what to do and lapse into
paralysis. On the ideological front, this widespread passivity, itself a major social problem, is maintained by what André Breton called miserabilism, the cynical rationalization of misery, suffering, and corruption: the dominant ideology of power in our time. Every hour, moreover, countless billions are spent on propaganda, advertising, and other mystifications to sustain the delusion that the crisis-strewn society we live in today is the best and only one possible.
     It is important to grasp that work is at the center of these problems. It
is work that keeps the whole miserabilist system going. Without work, the death-dealing juggernaut that proclaims itself the free market would grind to a halt. (“Free market” means freedom for capital, and unfreedom for those who work.)
     With very rare exceptions, jobs today are devoid of real meaning. The
huge majority provide junk or so-called services that people don’t need and that are destroying the planet we live on. In other words, most work today has nothing to do with fulfilling human needs and desires; it is simply work to support the capitalist system. The widely broadcast trade-off between jobs and environment shows how deadly the free market is. The city offers people jobs tearing down their own homes, causing rents to skyrocket; the

## 102 | H pT 3

countryside offers them jobs building roads, dams, malls, or airports that displace the local population and destroy what little remains of the natural world. Building new prisons creates new jobs locking up and brutalizing other (unemployed) workers, while factories open up new opportunities for workers to poison themselves, their children, and their community for generations to come.
     In a world too busy to live, work itself has become toxic, a form of “digging your own grave.” Certain sectors of the population experience work differently from others. For many upper- and middle-class women, work outside
the home is often experienced as a kind of liberation; it brings a feeling of independence, financial as well as sexual, and ultimately stimulates a wider awareness and new desires. Most working-class women, however—black and white—find work an added burden, because child care, housework, and other family chores are always waiting for them when they arrive home from the job. For them, work suppresses rather than stimulates awareness.
     Work is a curse, but in the pixilated social order we live in, having no
work can be even worse. In a society of inconceivable wealth and abundance, a large part of the populace lives way below the poverty line. Capital flight has destroyed the lives of millions of working people and created a new generation of ghost towns. Mass layoffs bring about a situation in which all of one’s time is taken up with the struggle for bare survival. Joblessness easily becomes homelessness and hopelessness, and the so-called surplus labor force becomes a real problem for law and order. And what is capitalism’s solution? New privatized prisons.
     Immigrant workers, especially so-called illegal aliens—Mexicans, Chinese, and others—often find themselves in sweatshop conditions: working
the longest hours doing the hardest work for the lowest pay. Work plays an all-consuming role in their lives, because just to pay for food and rent is an uphill battle. Those who have worked a lifetime, or twenty years, or even ten years, tend to defend the necessity and value—even the “moral” value!—of work. For many, having worked a long time seems to validate it. It places work in a realm beyond questioning—makes it seem part of the natural order of things, when in truth it should be thought of as unnatural, a collective crime against humankind and the Earth.
     Once upon a time people defined themselves by their occupations or jobs.
This is less and less the case today as the nature of jobs changes; relatively few today think of themselves as having an occupation. In my own career I have been a microbiologist, a fats-and-oils chemist, a die cutter in a picture-frame factory, an editor of medical books, a proofreader for Playboy and the Law Bulletin, an insurance clerk, a bill payer for radiologists, an export/import clerk for a cookie company, a bookstore worker, a quality-control supervi-

sor for a pharmaceutical supplier, a motion-picture film printer, a jelly-bean inspector—and lots more. I have always been part of the working class, but I have never seen any point in defining myself by any of these jobs.
    We are increasingly forced to define ourselves according to what we consume. A large part of the population proudly display brand names on their
clothes and cars. Land of the free (free advertising, that is)! However, we have the potentiality of defining ourselves through our dreams, our desires—our creative imaginations. Here again we are increasingly forced to make this choice, out of necessity. For as the job market shrinks, as the managers of miserabilism manage to make the existing misery even more miserable, many people will have nothing left except their dreams and imagination.
    Here we are between the emergency exit of a closing bank and the ambulance entrance of an aging nuclear reactor waiting for the economic recovery of dreams, and that’s what’s happening—that is how Jayne Cortez
describes “a current event news release.” For too many, however, the leisure to dream comes too late. Retirees and workers who are suddenly laid off and unable to find other jobs are frequently tormented by anxiety, self-doubt, and depression.
    The psychopathology of the so-called work ethic, which has long since
become a work obsession—that is, a recognizable illness—needs more critical study. Most therapists, of course, accept work as normal. As Paul Garon argued in “Love of Work and the Fear of Play,” such apologetics for misery are only to be expected of those whose aim is to help patients “adjust” to a sick society. Open criticism of work, reduction of working hours, and defense of the right to be lazy are in any case not encouraged—either in school, or in the press (including the trade union press), or on TV talk shows, or in more intellectual forums. The demand is for “more jobs!”
    Marx himself, of course, was radically opposed to such system-perpetuating boosterism. As early as 1845 he wrote, “‘Work’ is essentially the
unfree, inhuman, unsocial activity, determined by private property and creating private property. The abolition of private property becomes a reality only when it is understood as the abolition of ‘work.’”
    The question is: Why have so many people allowed themselves to become, in effect, the manufacturers of their own misery? Why do so many
work so long and so hard to create so much profit for so few? Why do so many people work when it’s demonstrably bad for them, their communities, and the whole Earth? Christianity and its churches are an important factor here, for it was the Christian contempt for the human body and for life on Earth that made wage slavery possible. Moreover, by preaching submission and goodwill to the workers but always siding with the ruling elite, Christianity provided a model of hypocritical righteousness that capitalism, itself the

## 10 4 | H pT 3

most sanctimonious of frauds, has always found well suited to its exploitative needs.
     Christianity remains a pernicious and reactionary force, but the secularization of society has pushed it onto the sidelines. The main ideological props
of wage slavery today are male supremacy and white supremacy, the deadliest enemies of human freedom. They are often allied with Christianity, and their influence is far more pervasive. Indeed, these degraded, exclusionary notions permeate every value and institution of this society and are preponderant elements in that garbage dump of repressive ideologies known as miserabilism. In essence, the myth of the happy worker is the myth of the white male. I have referred to male supremacy in connection with the nuclear family, but the oppression of women is a woeful reality not only in the family but also in the workplace, in the classroom, in social and political life, in the sciences, in the arts, and in the street. More than 150 years after the first women’s rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York, women in the United States are still denied full equality and routinely subjected to every sort of discrimination and abuse. Long hours, low pay, and poor conditions are still the “reward” of the great majority of female wage earners.
     Even more fatal in its everyday consequences is the ridiculous belief in
whiteness—that is, in the arbitrary privileges shared by those who identify themselves with the exclusive club that calls itself the “white race.” Although no such thing as a white race exists (biologically and ethnologically, the notion is entirely groundless), the delusion of white supremacy inevitably leads to massive harm and horror, as the history of the United States, Nazi Germany, and apartheid South Africa shows only too well. Basically a means of repressing and terrorizing people of color, the mystique of whiteness is also reflected in the monotonous pseudopolitics, bureaucratic heartlessness, and lack of imagination characteristic of a depressingly large portion of the U.S. population. These are the ideologies that obstruct open discussion of work and especially of abolishing work. They are closely related: white supremacists, female as well as male, are also male supremacists, and both glorify work for work’s sake as well as violence for violence’s sake. They all regard work as manly, or even a strictly masculine prerogative, and racists have long suffered from the delusion that African Americans, Latinos, and Asians are “lazy.”
     Whiteness, as David Roediger points out in his Towards the Abolition of
Whiteness, “is used to make whites settle for hopelessness in politics and misery in everyday life.” I would suggest that male supremacy exerts a comparably debilitating influence. Historically, these two supremacist dogmas have immeasurably damaged the movement to abolish the wage system and have done more to set it back than any other factor. Sexism and whiteness deflected the revolutionary cause from its universal aim, fragmented its emancipatory

vision, and above all corrupted its entire sense of purpose. The struggle for workers’ self-emancipation was blocked because the self was divided.
    The emphasis on liberation, cultural diversity, a radical break with the
system of domination, and the critique of technology, daily life, sexuality, language, and our relation with nature and other species have shifted the paradigm of social transformation from a much too self-limiting focus on labor. And in doing so, they have broadened the horizons of everyone who seriously desires and seeks revolutionary change. Far from dividing or destroying any genuine radicalism, these currents are giving radicalism a fresh start. However confused some of them of may be, they are the bold voices of something new and audacious. And to paraphrase the pioneering African American feminist Anna Julia Cooper, the world needs to hear these voices.
    The endless mass of junk that late capitalism imposes on us, obnoxious
and worthless as it is, nonetheless reveals a remarkable human ingenuity and highly developed coordination and cooperation, an immense amount of individual and collective effort. The irony is that all this ingenuity and toil has gone into making our society a hell, when with much less trouble and infinitely more pleasure we could easily have created a paradise instead. Society today has the capacity through technology to reduce work to a tiny fraction of what it is, while continuing to meet all human needs. It is obvious that if people really want paradise on Earth, they can have it—practically overnight. Of course, they will have to overcome the immense and multinational “false consciousness” industry, which works very hard to make sure that very few working people know what they really want. Our struggle calls for labor organizers of a new kind. To bring about the meltdown of miserabilism we need awakeners of latent desires, fomenters of marvelous humor, stimulators of ardent dreams, and provokers of the deepest possible yearning for a life of poetic adventure.
    We also need to expand and refine our methods of inquiry, criticism,
and making discoveries. Dialectics—“the power of negative thinking,” as Herbert Marcuse called it  —needs to be complemented by the science of analogy, which Charles Fourier regarded as the most effective means of dissipating our political prejudices as well as our moral ones. According to Nora Mitrani, one of surrealism’s most brilliant theorists, analogy is the vital element that makes poetry a scandalously revolutionary “Science of Relationships.” Inasmuch as social transformation and human emancipation are fundamentally about overturning old constraining relationships and developing new nonexploitive relationships, this poetic science should be explored by everyone who is active in the struggle for freedom. Humankind has truly arrived at a major historic crossroads. Either we collectively find our way out of this hall of mirrors, overcome our alienation and atomization, and create

## 10 6 | H pT 3

a nonrepressive society in which each and every individual can be true to himself or herself, or we continue pell-mell on the ignominious business-asusual course of greedy self-deception, making throwaway commodities of ourselves, making life more and more miserable for everyone, and ultimately making the Earth itself unlivable.

4.3 Harlem Negroes Protest Jim Crow Discrimination
          C.L.R. J
“S hame has come to our city and sorrow to the large number of our fellow
          citizens, decent, law-abiding citizens, who live in the Harlem section.”
                                   R C   L  z  N  N d F    N    C R   q  | 117
     Thus the first citizen of New York describes the demonstration in Harlem of
the Negro people which has resulted in half a dozen deaths, scores of wounded, and hundreds of arrests.
     So that, according to Mayor LaGuardia, when the Negro people demonstrate,
shame comes to the citizens. Shame did come to LaGuardia himself when he insulted the Negro people by signing the contract for the Metropolitan Insurance Company housing project which expressly stipulated the exclusion of Negroes.
     Shame does not come to the decent, law-abiding citizens in the White House
in Washington and the decent, law-abiding citizens in Congress who have insulted the Negro people by segregating them in the federal government, by segregating them in the Army, in the Navy, in the Air Force, and in women’s auxiliaries.
     Shame does not come to Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy
Knox when the men they have inducted into the Army and Navy are shot down by military police and Southern civilians, are Jim Crowed and ill-treated on their way to the camps, are segregated in the camps themselves, persecuted, maltreated, and lynched without any protection from the government.
     We have not seen shame in the industrialists and men of business who in the
very City of New York will not employ Negroes, and only when they are compelled to and have no other means of evasion, grudgingly give them work in industry, that same industry which is supposed to be doing all that is possible to win the great “war for democracy.”

     When you design an event/campaign/et cetera based on the work of queer
Black women, don’t invite them to participate in shaping it but ask them to provide materials and ideas for next steps for said event; that is racism in practice. It’s also heteropatriarchal. Straight men, unintentionally or intentionally, have taken the work of queer Black women and erased our contributions. Perhaps if we were the charismatic Black men many are rallying around these days, it would have been a different story, but being queer Black women in this society (and apparently within these movements) tends to equal invisibility and nonrelevancy.

         —Erich Fromm, To Have or To Be?
         To eucate the masses politically oes not mean, cannot mean, making
         a political speech. What it means is to try, relentlessly an passionately,

         amous man who will take the responsibility or eerything, but that the

One egregious example was on ull isplay in North Carolina, where Republican Party members who control the Boar o Goernors ecimate higher eucation in that state by oting to cut orty-six egree programs. One member eene such cuts with the comment: “We’re capitalists, an we hae to look at what the eman is, an we hae to respon to the eman.” This is more than an example o crue economic instrumentalism, it is also a recipe or instituting an acaemic culture o thoughtlessness an a kin o stupiity receptie to what Hannah Arent once calle totalitarianism. In Wisconsin, Goernor Scott Walker has eliminate tenure at Wisconsin’s public uniersities an eiscerate any estige o share goernance. He also cut $200 million rom the state higher eucation buget, which is not surprising gien his hatre o public eucation.

Yet criminalizing the homeless or crimes such as alling asleep in public “oes nothing to break the cycle o poerty or preent homelessness in the uture.” I mass incarceration is one inex o an emerging punishing state, another register is when goernment bugets or prison construction eclipse uns or higher eucation. Inee, the transormation o the social state into the corporate-controlle punishing state is mae startlingly clear when young people, to paraphrase W.E.B.

Gingrich mimics a neoliberal ieology that separates economic actions rom social costs.

The masters o inance capital were not hel accountable or their crimes, an many o them receie huge bonuses pai or by American taxpayers.

     Politics is an imminently eucatie task, an it is only through such recognition that initial steps can be taken to challenge the powerul ieological
an aectie spaces through which market unamentalism prouces the esires, ientities, an alues that bin people to its orms o preatory go- ernance.

in which many Americans now in themseles. In oing so, I want to a- ress what I hae attempte to map as a crisis o memory, agency, an eucation an reclaim what I call a peagogy o eucate hope that is central to any iable notion o change that I am suggesting.
    First, there is a nee or what can be calle a reial o the raical imagination an the eense o the public goo, especially higher eucation, in
orer to reclaim its egalitarian an emocratic impulses. This call woul be part o a larger project “to reinent emocracy in the wake o the eience that, at the national leel, there is no emocracy—i by ‘emocracy’ we mean eectie popular participation in the crucial ecisions aecting the community.” One step in this irection woul be or young people, intellectuals, scholars, an others to go on the oensie against a conseratie-le campaign “to en higher eucation’s emocratizing inluence on the nation.” Higher eucation shoul be harnesse neither to the emans o the warare state nor to the instrumental nees o corporations. Clearly, in any emocratic society, eucation shoul be iewe as a right, not an entitlement.
    Politically, this suggests eining higher eucation as a emocratic public
sphere an rejecting the notion that the culture o eucation is synonymous with the culture o business. Peagogically, this points to moes o teaching an learning capable o proucing an inorme public, enacting an sustaining a culture o questioning, an enabling a critical ormatie culture that aances at least in the schools what Kristen Case calls “moments o classroom grace.” Peagogies o classroom grace shoul proie the conitions or stuents an others to relect critically on commonsense unerstanings o the worl, an begin to question, howeer troubling, their sense o agency, their relationship to others, an their relationships to the larger worl. This can be linke to broaer peagogical imperaties that ask why we hae wars, massie inequality, a sureillance state, the commoiication o eerything, an the collapse o the public into the priate. This is not merely a methoical consieration but also a moral an political practice because it presupposes the creation o critically engage stuents who can imagine a uture in which justice, equality, reeom, an emocracy matter. In this instance, the classroom shoul be a space o grace—a place to think critically, ask troubling questions, an take risks, een though that may mean transgressing establishe norms an bureaucratic proceures.
    Secon, young people an progressies nee to eelop a comprehensie eucational program that woul inclue a range o peagogical initiaties rom eeloping a national online news channel to creating alternatie

peagogical task woul enable a sustaine critique o the transormation o a market economy into a market society along with a clear analysis o the amage it has cause both at home an abroa. What is crucial to recognize here is that it is not enough to teach stuents to be able to interrogate an critically screen culture an other orms o aural, ieo, an isual orms o representations. They must also learn how to be cultural proucers. This suggests eeloping alternatie public spheres such as online journals, teleision shows, newspapers, zines, an any other platorm in which alternatie positions can be eelope. In aition, such tasks can be one by mobilizing the technological resources an platorms they alreay hae. It also means working with one oot in existing cultural apparatuses in orer to promote alternatie ieas an iews that woul challenge the aectie an ieological spaces prouce by the inancial elite who control the commaning institutions o public peagogy in North America.
     Thir, acaemics, artists, community actiists, young people, an parents must engage in an ongoing struggle or the right o stuents to be gien
a ormiable an critical eucation not ominate by corporate alues an or young people to hae a say in the shaping o their eucation an what it means to expan an eepen the practice o reeom an emocracy. Young people hae been let out o the iscourse o emocracy. They are the new isposables who lack jobs, a ecent eucation, hope, an any semblance o a uture better than the one their parents inherite. Facing what Richar Sennett calls the “spectre o uselessness,” they are a reminer o how inance capital has abanone any iable ision o the uture, incluing one that woul support uture generations. This is a moe o politics an capital that eats its own chilren an throws their ate to the agaries o the market. The ecology o inance capital only beliees in short-term inestments because they proie quick returns. Uner such circumstances, young people who nee long-term inestments are consiere a liability. I any society is in part juge by how it iews an treats its chilren, the Unite States by all accounts is truly ailing in a colossal way.
     Fourth, casino capitalism is so wiesprea that progressies nee to e-
elop a comprehensie ision o politics that “oes not rely on single issues.” It is only through an unerstaning o the wier relations an connections o power that young people an others can oercome uninorme practice, isolate struggles, an moes o singular politics that become insular an sel-sabotaging. In short, moing beyon this single-issue orientation means eeloping moes o analyses that connect the ots historically an relationally. It also means eeloping a more comprehensie ision o politics an change. The key here is the notion o translation; that is, the nee to translate priate troubles into broaer public issues an unerstan how systemic

## 152 | C pE 5

moes o analyses can be helpul in connecting a range o issues so as to be able to buil a unite ront in the call or a raical emocracy.
    This is a particularly important goal gien that the ragmentation o the
Let has been partly responsible or its inability to eelop a wie political an ieological umbrella to aress a range o problems: extreme poerty; the assault on the enironment; the emergence o the permanent warare state; the rollback o oting rights; the assault on public serants, women’s rights, an social proisions; an other issues that eroe the possibilities or a raical emocracy. The ominating mechanisms o casino capitalism in both their symbolic an material registers reach eeply into eery aspect o American society. Any successul moement or the eense o public goos an emocracy itsel will hae to struggle against this new moe o authoritarianism rather than isolating an attacking speciic elements o its antiemocratic ethos.
    One important eelopment is that black youth, among other concerne
young Americans, are currently making real stries in moing beyon sporaic protests, short-lie emonstrations, an noniolent street actions in the hopes o builing sustaine political moements. Groups such as Black Lies Matter, Black Youth Project, We Charge Genocie, Dream Deeners, an others represent a new an growing political orce that is not only connecting police iolence to larger structures o militarism throughout society but also reclaiming public memory by articulating a irect link “between the establishment o proessional police systems in the Unite States [an] the patrolling systems that maintaine the business o human bonage in chattel slaery.”
    Fith, another serious challenge acing aocates o a new truly emocratic social orer is the task o eeloping a iscourse o both critique an
possibility or what I hae calle a iscourse o eucate hope. Critique is important an is crucial to break the hol o commonsense assumptions that legitimate a wie range o injustices. The language o critique is also crucial or making isible the workings o unequal power an the necessity o holing authority accountable. But critique is not enough, an without a iscourse o hope, it can lea to a paralyzing espair or, een worse, a crippling cynicism. Hope speaks to imagining a lie beyon capitalism an combines a realistic sense o limits with a loty ision o emaning the impossible. As Ernst Bloch once insiste, reason, justice, an change cannot blossom without hope because eucate hope taps into our eepest experiences an longing or a lie o ignity with others, a lie in which it becomes possible to imagine a uture that oes not mimic the present. I am reerring not to a romanticize an empty notion o hope but to a notion o inorme hope

that aces the concrete obstacles an realities o omination but continues the ongoing task o “holing the present open an thus uninishe.”
     The iscourse o possibility not only looks or prouctie solutions; it also
is crucial in eening public spheres in which ciic alues, public scholarship, an social engagement allow or a more imaginatie grasp o a uture that takes seriously the emans o justice, equity, an ciic courage. Democracy shoul encourage, een require, a way o thinking critically about eucation, one that connects equity to excellence, learning to ethics, an agency to the imperaties o social responsibility an the public goo. Casino capitalism is a toxin that has create a preatory class o unethical zombies— who are proucing ea zones o the imagination that een Orwell coul not hae enisione—all the while waging a ierce ight against the possibilities o a emocratic uture. The time has come to eelop a political language in which ciic alues, social responsibility, an the institutions that support them become central to inigorating an ortiying a new era o ciic imagination, a renewe sense o social agency, an an impassione international social moement with a ision, organization, an set o strategies to challenge the neoliberal nightmare enguling the planet. These may be ark times, as Hannah Arent once warne, but they on’t hae to be, an that raises serious questions about what eucators, artists, youth, intellectuals, an others are going to o within the current historical climate to make sure that they o not succumb to the authoritarian orces circling American society, waiting or the resistance to stop an or the lights to go out. History is open, an as Howar Zinn once insiste, hope is the willingness “to hol out, een in times o pessimism, the possibility o surprise.”

5.2 Chapman Democracy Activist Offers a Radical
    Critique of Capitalism
          Interview with Peter McLaren
          J W
P eter McLaren is the coirector o Chapman Uniersity’s Paulo Freire Democratic Project an the uniersity’s international ambassaor or global ethics an social justice. He also happens to be one o the worl’s oremost thinkers on critical peagogy. Critical peagogy is a cross-section between philosophy an eucation that works to equip stuents to ientiy oppression in the worl an eal with it in a constructie manner. McLaren has written an eite nearly ity books in his iel.
    Once an elementary an mile school teacher in Canaa, McLaren
taught at a comortable school in a comortable neighborhoo until one ay he ha a troubling thought: social class is one o the biggest preictors o success, an it was entirely likely that those stuents coul succee not because o their teachers—but, perhaps, een in spite o them. McLaren ecie to go somewhere where he coul hae a more prooun eect—the inner city.
    While others may hae been content with helping at least one o their
stuents, McLaren set higher stanars—he wante to make a ierence or eeryone. He oun a bon with his stuents that his colleagues in’t seem to hae. At one point, he cleare eerything out o his classroom an ille it with rums instea. Rather than teaching the course material, he rumme an connecte with his stuents. Test scores actually went up.
    This was the beginning o McLaren’s path o social justice. Toay, he
encourages critical analysis, especially o capitalism. Inspire by his mentor Paulo Freire, one o the athers o critical peagogy, McLaren stries to equip stuents with the means to make sense o their experiences an look critically at the worl, possibly opening the oor to a better system.

## C    C  l pE dg  g y | 157

    McLaren’s latest book, Pedagogy of Insurrection, was publishe in 2015. In
this book, McLaren raws on his backgroun as a eout Catholic, looking at the teachings o Jesus as they relate to capitalism. In what he expects to be a controersial moe, he argues that Jesus was eectiely preaching communism, an that his message o loe might open the way to a better ethical approach to social justice in moern times.
    We sat own with McLaren to gain some insight on his theoretical work.
Q. Just for starters, how exactly would you describe critical pedagogy? . I think that most people mistake critical peagogy with critical thinking. It’s part o it, but you can’t reuce critical peagogy to critical thinking.
     Critical peagogy has an ethical ounation. You can’t moe rom act to
alue; there’s no logical sequence that will take you rom a critique o capitalism to say that capitalism, thereore, is a ba thing. That requires an ethical jugment. For me, critical peagogy is a philosophy o praxis. Praxis is an interesting term—it’s the ialectical relationship between theory an practice.
Q. What are some of the key ideas you discuss in your books and talks? . Praxis relates to changing the worl. For me, in changing the worl, I name what the problem is. For me, that problem is capitalism—the prouction o alue. Now, alue an wealth are ery ierent. Value is monetize wealth.
    In my work in Latin America an with poor communities all aroun the
worl, I’e come to the realization that critical peagogy requires an ethical commitment. That ethical commitment is to eliminate unnecessary, neeless suering. That’s a moral posture that one takes. Liberation theology calls this a preerential option or the poor. I go arther than that; I say it’s not a preerential option but an obligation.
    Critical peagogy is mobilize towar ining a more humane alternatie to capitalism. Some critics will say that capitalism isn’t perect, but it’s
the best system we hae so we can just try to make it better. It’s the nature o capitalism itsel—the alienation o human labor, the exploitation o human labor through proit making—that makes it impossible to reorm.
    Now, I’m not suggesting that we gie any creibility to Soiet communism or Eastern Bloc police states; they were horrible regimes that misunerstoo, manipulate, an misuse the writings o Marx. So where o we look?
Well, we can look at the Spanish Ciil War, the Paris Commune an we can look at inigenous communities throughout Latin America like the Zapatistas. My emphasis is on encouraging teachers to be public intellectuals—to assume that role, not o being a clerk o the empire. Not to be a unctionary

## 158 | C pE 5

o the school boar but to become transormatie, critical, reolutionary thinkers who take a public stan on the issue o social justice. This notion o proessors an teachers assuming a political neutrality is a alsehoo because i you on’t speak out, that’s take a political position itsel.
Q. Critical pedagogy is meant to instill change, but from where does that change come? . I take a ialectical approach. It’s not simply reolution or reorm; it’s both. Dialectics is about meiation; meiation is not about juxtaposition. It’s not “either or”; it’s “both an.”
    There’s an abstract utopia an a concrete utopia. Abstract utopias are
when someboy has some iea in their min o what a perect worl woul look like, an it’s sometimes ery isconnecte rom what’s actually happening on the groun at the time. Concrete utopias are relate to the problems people are acing in the here an now. You o what you can within the system an hae a larger, broaer ision o where you want to go. Change begins with a critical consciousness but also with a moral an ethical commitment. Join a church group, a community group, a group connecte with public libraries, the uniersity or a high school. Get inole; make a commitment to people an change.
    Critical consciousness isn’t a preconition; it’s an outcome o that engagement. Otherwise, you coul always say you’re not reay. There’s always
another book or philosopher to rea, an it elays you rom taking action. Begin with the action, an use the theory to reine your thoughts about that engagement.
Q. In your latest book, you look critically at capitalism through an interesting lens—the teachings of Jesus. How do you connect these two? . In examining the gospels an statements by Jesus, it became ery clear to me that, while Jesus was not against absolute wealth, he was against relatie wealth or what we call “ierentiating wealth.” That is to say, you cannot be rich while someone else is poor. It became ery clear through his sayings, or what hae been attribute to him, it’s irreutable that a rich person cannot get into heaen. The kingom o Go is really a kingom in which ierentiating wealth oes not exist.
    We coul make an argument that Jesus was teaching communism. Not
the communism that came as a specter, the totalitarian ictatorships we saw with Stalin—I woul not want to een them an woul neer call those regimes “communist.” I mean the notion o sharing resources. The early Christian communities came together to share what they ha. “It’s

## C    C  l pE dg  g y | 159

easier or a camel to pass through the eye o a neele than or a rich man to get into the kingom o Go.” Those statements are not about greey people; they’re statements about society. Toay, how we organize our means o prouction oeretermines the opportunities that some people hae oer others.
    Capitalism structurally instantiates inequality. Jesus equate loe with
the struggle or equality. Loe an justice are the two main messages o Jesus. I you rea the scriptures, Jesus preache a socialist gospel. To see socialism among right-wing eangelical Christians as a kin o eil, it’s absolutely absur. That’s largely a position I think stems out o ignorance about what socialism is an what communism was in the writings o Marx.
    I’m trying to begin a ebate because I eel that ebate is ery important.
I’m beginning to inorm critical peagogy’s ethics o social justice by rawing on the teachings o Jesus.
Q. Historically, many thinkers with dreams of changing the world become disillusioned as they grow older. You’re now approaching your seventies, and your passion is burning brighter than ever. What keeps you going? . I think it’s a certain sense o being blesse. My lie’s been an uphill struggle. Being on this path isn’t easy. I on’t know i you’e rea on the Internet about the “Dirty Thirty,” but I was hit by the Right in 2006. I was labele by a right-wing group with a lot o money behin it as one o the most angerous proessors at UCLA. This group was oering stuents $100 to secretly auiotape my classes an $50 or notes. The only group that stoo up an eene me at the time was the Chaistas in Venezuela. Taking the social justice route can make you a target or right-wing critics who eel you’re against the unamental principles o the country.
     It’s always been a struggle, but I’e elt I’e been blesse in my lie with
the opportunity to meet people rom all oer the worl. I’e oun a loe an a sense o soliarity, a sense o reciprocal relationship base on trust an a share commitment to make the worl a better place. The groups I’e met an the suering I’e seen hae humble me because it makes my suering an personal struggles pale in comparison. I’e met some pretty courageous people that hae inspire me, that hae a commitment an energy that ar excees my own. Meeting my wie, Angie, has been a blessing, an so has haing an opportunity to be at an institution like Chapman, working with stuents an being in a position to learn.
     I’m not optimistic about the uture, but I’m hopeul. I on’t mean hope
in the acile sense; I mean hope as a struggle—as a orm o taking on yoursel the buren o history an knowing that buren is being share by others.

5.3 Neoliberal Globalization and Resistance
    in Education
           e Challenge of Revolutionary Critical Pedagogy
           C Sd
I n this chapter, I escribe the eects o neoliberal globalization on eucation an the response o reolutionary critical peagogy. In my analysis, the terms globalization an neoliberalism are interconnecte an consiere as piotal in a course o commoiication o eucation—namely, the suborination o eucation to the rules o the capitalist market.
     In my iew, the term globalization is nothing more than an ieological
construction that is an attempt to gie a neutral escription o a unamental eature o capitalism that has alreay been escribe by E. Manel in his Late Capitalism—that is, the internationalization o capital an o the exploitatie relations uner the capitalism o multinationals.
     Globalization is accompanie by neoliberal policy, in eect creating
conitions o class war, aiming to increase the proitability o capital at the expense o the oppresse classes ismantling labor relations, halting an re- ersing the gains o the working class worlwie.
     Neoliberal policy is accompanie by an unpreceente ieological oensie at the leel o theory. Typical o this is the use o seemingly neutral terms
that inicate eep reactionary meanings. The aim is the imposition o the ieological hegemony o bourgeois policy an the theoretical isarmament o the exploite classes but most importantly is the eelopment o a consensus system inclusie o the agents o social resistance.
     I beliee it is extremely important to highlight an thoroughly analyze
the neoliberal policy enorcement mechanism in eucation in national eucational systems. This role has been unertaken by the Organisation or Economic Co-operation an Deelopment (OECD) through the Programme or International Stuent Assessment (PISA). An important part o this ar-

## C    C  l pE dg  g y | 161

ticle iscusses how PISA homogenizes the eucation systems o the OECD country members.
     I consier it important that in aition to the analysis, we shoul also
outline an alternatie proposal, not only in terms o an oerall alternatie economic policy to neoliberalism but particularly at the leel o eucation. Toay, the only coherent proposal against the eects o globalization on eucation comes rom the proponents o reolutionary critical peagogy.
     In this chapter, I outline the prospects o resistance that the anticapitalist/
socialist teachers’ moement inspire by the theoretical accomplishments o reolutionary critical eucation.
NElbEl plCy N EduCN The main objectie o neoliberal policy in eucation is the transormation o eucation to another serices-proiing sector, ultimately a source or increasing the proitability o capital.
     The attempte restructuring o labor relations, o the health an eucation sectors that we witness worlwie, aims to estroy the pillars o the
welare state as expresse by the right to work, eucation, an health an to replace it with a state that is nothing more than a regulator or the proitability o capital at the expense o the weaker social classes.
     Against the neoliberal an neoconseratie restructuring o eucation,
we must propose a ierent policy, to set up a ramework o positions aiming to reerse the neoliberal armageon in eucation. In this irection the answer to the question o the role o eucation uner capitalism has always been o paramount importance.
     The theoretical legacy o classical Marxism guies our position that society shapes eucation in accorance to the nees o the social classes that hol
power. From the stanpoint o the ruling class, the main role o eucation is to reprouce the ominant ieology. Here is part o the iew o eucation as ieological apparatus o the state (ISA). The reprouction o the ominant ieology inoles the istortion o reality, preenting the eelopment o critical knowlege by stuents an the critical unerstaning o the reality o the natural an social worls aroun them.
     But another reprouction process takes place simultaneously. The “eucation inustry” is a signiicant state apparatus in the reprouction an
replication o the capitalist social orm necessary or the continuation o “surplus alue” extraction an economic inequality, so a process o repro- uction o the existing exploitatie social relations through the enhancement o the contraiction between manual an intellectual labor takes place.

## 16 2 | C pE 5

    Nowaays neoliberalism has entere a new stage. The eucational policy
o neoliberalism aims to proletarianize intellectual labor by creating conitions by which eucation will no longer be a springboar or social aancement but a passport or the creation o an army o lexible employees. This is achiee through the ollowing:

       1. the social ealuation o the teaching proession
       2. the interention in the curriculum such that skills come into the
          oregroun an scientiic knowlege (unerstaning by the methos o science) is seconary
In accorance with the argument eelope here, G. Rikowski has suggeste that the capitalist state nees to control the social prouction o labor power or two reasons:

       1. to try to ensure that the social prouction o labor power—equipping stuents with skills an competences—occurs
       2. to try to ensure that moes o peagogy that are antithetical to
          labor power prouction do not and cannot exist. The capitalist state
          will not tolerate any orms o peagogy that attempt to educate
          students regarding their real predicament—to create an awareness
          of themselves as future labor powers and to underpin this awareness
          with critical insight that seeks to undermine the smooth running of
          the social production of labor power
This policy, espite neoliberal maniestations or “reeom o choice,” entails a strict control o the curriculum or teacher eucation, o schooling, an o eucational research.
    My longtime rien an comrae Dae Hill has argue that neoliberal
policy in eucation compresses an represses critical space in eucation, seeking to neutralize an estroy potential pockets o resistance to global corporate expansion an neoliberal capital questioning the role o the school in maintaining an eepening social stratiication, which is what neoliberalism pursues.
Knowledge Society Reaing the arious oicial ocuments o the Worl Bank, the OECD, an the European Union (EU), we see that they start with the premise that we lie in a “knowlege society.” This premise is in act the preamble to their eucation policy proposals.

## C    C  l pE dg  g y | 16 3

    What actually is the “knowlege society”? In essence it is the integration
o knowlege in the prouction process as a irect prouctie orce, as a key actor in the proitability o capital. This new prouction ormat aims to recoer the permanent an structural crisis o the capitalist system, which tries to oercome the crisis through continuous technological reolutions, using knowlege as a irect prouctie orce.
    As mentione beore, the key eature o late capitalism is the proletarianization o intellectual labor. This means that the intellectual worker, such
as a teacher, in the new context, enters the same leel o exploitation as the manual worker. The egree o exploitation o intellectual-mental labor is at the same leel with manual labor. In this phase o capitalism, the egree o exploitation o eucational work is the same as the egree o exploitation o the worker in the actory. This is an essential eature o neoliberal capitalism an the way it is manieste in eucation.
Skills, Not Knowledge The irst thing someone can see in the plans an programs or the “new school” o neoliberalism is the question o eelopment o stuents’ skills. The school curriculum shoul eelop skills such as critical thinking, problem soling, an ecision making. This separation between knowlege an skills an the primacy o skills ersus knowlege was characteristic o the eucational reorm implemente by Margaret Thatcher in Englan in 1979. The irst thing Thatcher i when her goernment esigne the new curricula was to publish an eucational maniesto title “Skills, Not Knowlege.” This slogan constitutes the heart o the neoliberal attack on eucation, an the transormation o the curriculum is centere precisely at this point: the egraation o knowlege an the orientation towar skills in iew o eucating an ajustable lexible worker who will not hae a permanent job an be prepare to change his or her job ie to ten times uring his or her working lie. I so, it oes not make sense to hae concrete, soli knowlege, but the worker shoul eelop speciic skills, so as to be aaptable to changing working enironment uring his or her lie. This package is also associate with lielong learning (LLL). Lielong learning means that eucation nees to gie knowlege that constitutes not the ientity o the knowing subject but speciic skills instea, planning a lexible worker, springy to the working status an lexible in aapting to new working conitions through retraining.
    At the same time, the aim is to inuse in the school curriculum an uni-
ersity eucation terms that may seem neutral but hae a serious ieological loa, to which, unortunately, we hae not gien the importance they esere. That is, there are seemingly neutral terms in eucational policy ocuments

     The OECD policy ollows two main axes: homogenization o eucational

In essence, the mobility in the labor market that shapes globalize capitalism requires homogenize qualiications an skills or the workers o all countries. The aim is to stanarize the eucation systems o OECD countries. To achiee this objectie, PISA ollows the same metho an proceure in all countries employing the same criteria without taking into account the national speciicities o eucational systems an the cultural speciicities o each country.

These proceures o not stimulate iscussion on improing eucational systems in each country, since the interests o national eucational policies are monopolize by the nee to improe their image in the OECD list.
     PISA exerts great inluence on public opinion. Wheneer the results o
the program are announce, goernments aopt an apologetic tone, newspapers in material to ill multiple columns, an teachers are puzzle an seek explanations or what is happening to their country’s eucational system.
     A typical example o the inluence o the PISA is the U.S. case. The program No Chil Let Behin echoe the irst results o PISA. Among other
things, primary an seconary schools were put uner a permanent ealuation process to ecie on their inancing. “The orces that etermine the latest eucational policies o the action ‘No Chil Let Behin’ is neoliberal economic policies that push schools to perorm like multinationals.”
     Fortunately, PISA has raise serious criticism an objections about its
nature an its reliability, also among nonraical eucators, or a number o reasons:

    - The topics chosen o not ealuate the crucial aspects o school an
      eucation but the speciic aspects o neoliberal eucational policy
      that it seeks to impose on the countries inole.
    - PISA is conucte by priate companies seeking a share in the
      growing market o tests an sureys.
    - The interpretation o the PISA results are within a neoliberal conception o eucation an thus are necessarily partisan.

The logic o the OECD strategy supports competition combine with a system o common neoliberal stanars or eucational systems o the participating countries in the interest o the global capitalist market.
    The OECD eucation policy makers an the goernment oicials o
ierent countries show a great interest in the results o PISA an the comparatie inicators publishe because they beliee that there is a irect correlation between the eucational achieements o a country an its economic eelopment.

      Een nonraical eucation theorists beliee that PISA ocuses on uni-

      The ranking lists o the countries in the arious iels are easily rea-

     O course, critiques o oerominant teacher-centere peagogy are not

Een where the curriculum is ery tightly controlle, een where it is ery rigily prescribe, there are, as Gramsci taught us, always little spaces or us to iniltrate, to use, to colonize.

     Marxist eucators, inee critical eucators in general, can, with stu-

     In some countries, irtually all chilren go to the same type o school. But
chilren ten to go to schools where their own class preominates. An this can be a problem.

O course we cannot change the law at a stroke, but we can lea a moement so that at some stage—in two years, ten years, twenty years—the ownership an goernance o schools can be change, mae emocratic, secular, an egalitarian, instea o, as in some countries, being owne an goerne by a religious state, transnational corporations, religious organizations themseles, or-proit priate companies, companies that are theoretically not-or-proit but rewar hansomely their executies an their riens, or rich businessmen or women.
     Marxist eucators (an others, o course) beliee that schools, colleges,

Explicit in this is the assertion that eucation is a public goo an a public right that shoul not be istorte an corrupte by priate ownership—there shoul be no priate schools, colleges, or uniersities.
     A question relate to who shoul own an control schools is that o how

     What eines Marxists is first our belie that reorms are not sustainable

the capitalist economic system with its capitalist economic relations o pro- uction an its capitalist social relations o prouction—the ownership by capitalists o the wealth an the power in society. Reolutions can be iolent (ruling classes o not oten gie up their power peaceully), or they might be through the ballot box or a combination o the two. The ballot box alone cannot bring about reolution because state institutions in capitalism are not emocratic. A Congress or parliament or presient or prime minister has limite power oer these institutions. An electe socialist goernment woul not be able to bring about much change that went against the interests o the capitalist class because the military, juiciary, police, an corporate hierarchy are not emocratic. They use state iolence to stop it. This is the critique, or example, mae by the Greek reolutionary Marxist coalition Antarsya o the raical Let Syriza coalition, which can be characterize as let social emocratic, which is, by current projections (summer 2014), likely to be electe into goernment. But or reolutionary Marxists, a socialist reolution is necessary, so that there comes into power (not just into government) an egalitarian, socialist economic, political, an eucation system.
    The second ierence between Marxist an non-Marxist raicals is that
in orer to replace capitalism, Marxists hae to organize. Thus a Marxist’s uty is to be an actiist, within the limits o his or her ability an competing emans, an to recognize that political organization, program eelopment, an political interention are necessary. Reolutions o not all o trees, like apples. They hae to be ought or an eene.
    The third point is the salience of class as compare with other orms o
structural oppression an iscrimination an inequality. Marxists, Marxist eminists, Marxist antiracists, an Marxist queer theorists stan together with social moements an ciil rights campaigners in opposing racism, sexism, homophobia, an other orms o iscrimination.

    Furthermore, Marxists unerstan that only the organize working class
(black-white, male-emale, straight-LGBT, Dalit an all other castes) can organize to replace the capitalist system. These are the points o ierence between Marxists an other raical liberals an letists.

    But irst, I wish to acknowlege that to propose eucational theories, we
must always recognize the restrictions place on us uring that process. As Stephen Toulmin puts it, “Until the basic empirical or experimental acts are establishe, we are not in a position to eelop theoretical explanations.

    Here I present a program or maniesto or eucation, or iscussion.

    1. Cut class sizes to a maximum of twenty students in both primary and secondary schools. In Englan, or example, many classes in primary (elementary)
schools hae more than thirty pupils—some o the largest in the rich worl— much larger than in priate schools, or example. Accoring to OECD research, Englan is twenty-thir out o thirty eelope countries in terms o large class size. Other countries such as Finlan hae a maximum class size o twenty. Finlan is wiely seen as proiing an extremely high quality o eucation. In countries with a lower GDP, o course, class sizes o ity to a hunre are not uncommon.

    2. Abolish league tables and most externally set assessment tasks. Some external testing is necessary, but the types o regular tests o actual knowlege
typical o the Unite States an Englan (terme “high-stakes testing”) oten restrict teaching to “teaching to the test,” relegates nonactual learning to the sielines, an results in unue stress.

    3. Restore local democratic control of state schools that have been handed over
to private corporations, charities, and individuals to run, and establish local democratic control of such schools. In Englan an Wales such schools are known as academies; in the as the Unite States they are calle charter schools. In a- ition, Englan has state-une free schools run by speciic groups, oten sectional groups o parents.

Also, such prepriatizing pet projects o goernments shoul not be more aantageously une than the rest o the state schools. The ae inestment that goernments put in to prime their aore experiments shoul be kept an enhance, but it shoul be istribute between all schools. Our schools an the chilren in them are not or sale! Schools shoul not, through uneen uning or ierent types o school (e.g., acaemies), be set up or success at the expense o others being set up (an unerune) or relatie ailure.

   4. Form a fully comprehensive secondary school system (known in India as a
common school) so that each school has a broa mix o social class, abilities, an attainment leels.

    5. Get private profiteering out of our schools. Eucation serices that hae
been priatize an hie o an ha their contracts gien to priate proiteers shoul be brought back into public control. These inclue Englan’s Oice or Stanars in Eucation, Chilren’s Serices an Skills (Oste), the boy that runs stuent loans, school meals, cleaning, an caretaking. This is so that proper pay an conitions can be restore to workers whose jobs hae been contracte out, an so that school an uniersity workers who work uner contract can eel that they are part o the school, college, or uni- ersity community. Stuents an school workers who are protesting urther priatization shoul be supporte.

    6. Integrate existing private schools into the state education system so that
the beneits o the priate school system are share among all stuents. All schools shoul be place uner emocratic, locally electe, local council control. Priate schools shoul be prohibite. Religious groups o any religion shoul not be allowe to control an run schools. Say no to big business/ priate capital running our schools an chilren.

     7. “Faith schools” and organized religion should be removed from schools. I
Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hinus, Zoroastrians, Buhists, or members o any religion wish to teach religion, they shoul o it on their own time, at their own places o worship (Saturay/Sunay schools), or in their own supplementary or complementary schools.

   9. Make available free, nutritious, balanced school meals for every child to

     12. Free up curricula that are overprescriptive so there can be more creati-
ity an cross-subject/isciplinary work.

    13. Revise inspectorial and surveillance systems such as (in England) Ofsted. The results o school inspection systems such as Oste in Englan are
to penalize een the best schools (outstaning in eery aspect other than in SAT attainments) in the poorest areas an to strike ear into teachers. Howeer, some external superision an inspection is necessary in extreme cases—or example, to make sure there are no “ghost schools”—that is, to make sure that schools actually exist—an to keep some oersight o school perormance across a range o criteria, a range wier than attainment in tests.

    14. Encourage critical thinking across the curriculum. Teach chilren not
what to think, but how to think. Teach about Marxist analysis an the classexploitatie nature o capitalism. Such critical thinking shoul inclue how to think critically about the meia an politicians an also about Marxist analysis. Critical analysis shoul be sel-critical.

     15. Teach in schools ecological literacy and a readiness to act for environmental justice as well as economic and social justice. Encourage chilren to reach
or the stars an to work or a society that lets that happen—a airer society with more equal chances, pay packets, an power—an teach them about enironmental an sustainability issues.

   16. Ensure that schools are antiracist, antisexist, and antihomophobic—
making sure schools encourage equality an welcome ierent home an group cultures. As part o this, antibullying practices in eery school must be

    17. Implement an honest sex education curriculum in schools that teaches
chilren not just when to say no but also when to say yes. This program shoul ocus on posities, pleasure, an personal worth, not on stigmatizing sex an sexuality.

    18. Ensure proper recognition of all school workers and no compulsory redundancies. For teachers, secretarial an support sta, teaching assistants, oo
serice assistants, an caretaking sta, there shoul be regular emocratic workplace orums in eery school. Regaring jobs, there shoul be no compulsory reunancies—any restructuring shoul be conitional on agreement with the trae unions.

    19. Set up of school councils that include students to encourage emocratic
unerstaning, citizenship, social responsibility, an a welcoming an aluing o stuent oice.

    20. Broaden teacher education and training to counter the negatie eects
o the technicization an etheorizing o teacher training (which was the result in Englan o the 1992/1993 Conseratie reorganization o what was then calle teacher education—subsequently retitle teacher training).

   21. Establish a fully funded, publicly owned, and democratic education system from preschool to university. Eucation is a right, not a commoity to
be bought an sol. So there shoul be no ees, as in Scaninaia, Cuba, Venezuela, an Boliia, where eucation up to PhD leel is ree. Say no to uniersity or urther eucation/ocational training ees. An bring in a liing grant or stuents rom less well-o backgrouns.

T he distance between those who possess the most and those who possess
     a small (i ever-increasing) amount has not shrunk; but the intermediate
levels have multiplied and so to speak brought the two extremes, rulers and ruled, closer to the same mediocrity. To be rich nowadays means to possess a large number o impoverished objects.
    Consumer goods tend to lose all use-value. Their nature is to be consumable at all costs, as witness the recent American ad or the “nothing
box”—an object with no conceivable utility. And as General [Dwight David] Eisenhower explained in all candor, the present economic system can be rescued only by turning human beings into consumers, conlating them with the largest possible number o consumable values—which is to say nonvalues, empty, ictitious, abstract values. Ater being “the most precious kind o capital,” in [Jose] Stalin’s happy phrase, human beings must now become the most highly prized o consumer goods. Stereotyped images—movie star, poor person, communist, murderer-out-o-love, law-abiding citizen, rebel, bourgeois—are about to replace humanity with a punch-card system o categories arranged in accordance with an irreutable robotic logic. Already the idea o “teenager” tends to identiy buyers and what they buy, reducing their real variety to a still varied but circumscribed range o commodities (records,
                        C A P A     C u  u r  A  D C u  u r A  PrDuC   | 187
guitars, Levi’s, etc.). You are no longer as old as you eel or as old as you look but as “old” as what you buy. The time o production, o “time is money,” is giving way to the time o consumption (in both the igurative and the material senses o the word), a time measured in terms o products bought, worn out, and thrown away—the time o that premature old age which is the eternal youth o trees and stones.
     The theory o pauperization is strikingly conirmed today—not, as Marx
expected, in terms o goods necessary or survival, since these, ar rom becoming scarce, have become more and more abundant, but rather in terms o survival itsel, which is ever the enemy o real lie. Modern comorts seemed at irst to promise everyone a lie richer even than the dolce vita o the eudal aristocracy. But in act they turned out to be mere oshoots o capitalist productivity, oshoots doomed to premature old age as soon as the distribution system transormed them into nothing but objects o passive consumption. Working to survive, surviving by consuming and or the sake o consuming: the hellish cycle is complete. According to the logic o the-economyrules, survival is both necessary and suicient. This is the basic reality o the bourgeois era. But it is also true that a historical period based on such an antihuman reality must needs be a period o transition, an intermediate stage between the lie genuinely lived, i less than transparently, by the eudal masters and the lie that will be constructed rationally and passionately by masters without slaves.
     In an economy driven by the production requirements o ree-trade capitalism, wealth alone coners power and honor. As master o the means o
production and o labor power, wealth ensures by extension, thanks to the development o productive orces and o consumer goods, that its owners enjoy a wealth o choice among the ruits o never-ending progress. But to the extent that this orm o capitalism is transormed into an antithetical orm, namely a state-planned economy, the prestige o the capitalist playing the market with his millions ades away, and with it the caricature o the pot-bellied, cigar-puing merchant o human lesh. Today’s managers draw their power rom their organizing skills—even i computer technology already holds them up to ridicule by providing a model that they can never emulate. They are rich in their own right, certainly, but can they vaunt their wealth by having it signiy the potential choices available to them? Can they build a Xanadu, maintain a harem, or cultivate filles-fleurs? Alas, no—or how could money retain its symbolic orce when it is continually solicited and hampered by the imperatives o consumption? Under the dictatorship o consumption money melts away like snow in the sunshine, its signiicance passing to objects with more representational value—more tangible objects better adapted to the welare state and its spectacle. The unction o money

## 18 8 | Ch APr 6

has surely already been sidelined by the market in consumer goods, which, duly wrapped in ideology, have become the true signs o power. Beore long, money’s only remaining justiication will be the quantity o objects and useless gadgets it enables one to acquire and wear out at an ever-accelerating pace; only the quantity and the pace matter, or mass distribution and standardization automatically wipe out quality and rarity. The ability to consume aster and aster, to change your car, your drink, your house, your TV, or your girlriend ever more requently, is now the only index o how much power you can lay claim to in the social hierarchy. From the preeminence o blood to the power o money, rom the preeminence o money to the power o novelties, Christian and socialist civilization has now attained its highest stage: a civilization o the prosaic and the trivial.
     Purchasing power is a license to purchase power. The old proletariat sold
its labor power in order to subsist; what little leisure time remained proletarians spent as best they could in conversation, arguments, tavern games, country matters, going on the tramp, estivity, and riot. The new proletariat sells its labor power in order to consume. When they are not too busy working themselves to death in hopes o a promotion, workers are invited to buy objects—a car, a suit and tie, some culture—that will signal their social rank. We have reached the point where the ideology o consumption becomes the consumption o ideology.
     The system o commercial exchange has now come to govern all o people’s everyday relations with themselves and with their ellows. Every aspect
o public and private lie is dominated by the quantitative.
     The calculation o a human’s capacity to produce or make others produce, to consume or make others consume, is the perect concrete expression
o the idea so dear to the philosophers (and so revealing as to their unction) o the measure of man. Even the simple pleasure o a drive in the country is widely assessed in terms o miles on the clock, speeds reached and petrol consumed. Given the rate at which economic imperatives gobble up eelings, desires, and needs, and pay cash to corrupt them, people will soon be let with nothing but the memory o having once existed. History, in which we shall live retrospectively, will be our sole consolation or our condition o survival. How can real joy exist in a space-time that is measurable and continually measured? Not so much as a hearty laugh. At best, the dull satisaction o the person-who’s-got-his-money’s-worth, and who exists by that standard. Only objects can be measured, which is why all exchange reiies.
     The great ideologies quickly abandon aith or numbers. What is the
nation? Today it amounts to a ew thousand war veterans. And what is what [Karl] Marx and [Friedrich] Engels used to call “our party”? A ew million voters and a ew thousand bill-posters: a mass party.

     In act ideology’s essence is drawn rom quantity: ideas reproduced again
and again in time (Pavlovian conditioning) and in space (once consumers take up the rerain). Ideology, the news media, and culture—all tend gradually to shed their content and become pure quantity. The less importance a news item has, the more it is repeated, and the more it distracts people rom their real problems. We are a long way rom the Big Lie o which [Joseph] Goebbels said that it was the easiest to swallow. Ideological hyperbole evinces equal conviction to pitch a hundred books, a hundred washing powders, a hundred political ideas, each o which it promotes in turn as ar and away the best. Even in the ideological realm quantity is destroyed by quantity itsel: conditioning is inevitably eroded by its sel-contradictions.
     Could this possibly open an avenue back to power o the qualitative, a
power that can move mountains? Far rom it: sel-contradictory conditioning is prone to produce trauma, inhibition, or a radical reusal to be brainwashed urther. True, ideology can parry this by leaving conditioned individuals choices between lies, by raising spurious questions, alse dilemmas. But such eeble distractions count or precious little in view o the survival sickness to which consumer society exposes its members.
     At any instant boredom can breed an unanswerable rejection o uni-
ormity. Recent events in Stockholm, Amsterdam, and Watts have shown how the merest pretext can precipitate salutary uprisings. What an immense quantity o ot-repeated lies can be swept away by a single burst o revolutionary poetry! From Villa to Lumumba, rom Stockholm to Watts, qualitative agitation—agitation that radicalizes the masses because its source is the radicalism o the masses—eectively pushes back the rontiers o submission and brutishness.
     No one, no matter how alienated, is without (or unaware o) an irreducible core o creativity, a camera obscura sae rom intrusion by lies and
constraints. I ever social organization extends its control to this stronghold o humanity, its dominion will no longer be exercised over anything save robots, or corpses. And, in a sense, that is why consciousness o creative energy increases, paradoxically enough, as a unction o consumer society’s eorts to co-opt it.
     Argus is blind to the danger right in ront o him. Where quantity reigns,
quality has no recognized legal existence; but this is the very thing that saeguards and nourishes it. I have already noted that the dissatisaction bred by the manic pursuit o quantity calls orth a radical desire or the qualitative. The more oppression is justiied in terms o the reedom to consume, the more the malaise arising rom this contradiction exacerbates the thirst or total reedom. The crisis o production-based capitalism pointed up the element o repressed creativity in the energy expended by the worker. The

## 19 0 | Ch APr 6

alienation o creativity through orced labor, thanks to the exploitation o the producers, was denounced once and or all by Marx. Whatever the capitalist system and its successors (even antagonistic ones) have lost on the production ront they try to make up or in the sphere o consumption. The plan is that, as they gradually ree themselves rom their duties as producers, human beings should be trapped by newer obligations as consumers. By opening up the empty lot o leisure time to a creativity liberated at long last by shorter working hours, the well-intentioned apostles o humanism have merely mustered an army it or drilling on the training grounds o the consumer economy. Now that the alienation o the consumer is being laid bare by consumption’s own internal dialectic, one may wonder what kind o prison awaits the highly subversive orces o individual creativity. As I pointed out earlier, the rulers’ last chance here is to turn us all into organizers o our own passivity.
     With touching candor, DeWitt Peters suggests that handing out paints,
brushes, and canvas to everyone who requested them would produce very interesting results. It is true that i this policy were applied in a variety o well-deined and well-policed spheres, such as the theater, the plastic arts, music, writing, etc., and in a general way to any such sphere susceptible o total isolation rom all others, then the system might have a hope o endowing people with the consciousness o the artist, which is to say the consciousness o someone who proesses to exhibit their creativity in the museums and shop windows o culture. The popularity o such a culture would be a clear sign o Power’s success. Fortunately, the chances o people being successully “culturized” in this way are now slight. Do the cyberneticians and their ilk really imagine that people can be talked into “ree experimentation” within bounds laid down by authoritarian decree? Or that prisoners at last aware o their creative capacity might daub their cells with “original graiti” and leave it at that? What would prevent them rom extending their newound penchant or experiment to weapons, desires, dreams, and all manner o means o sel-ulillment? The crowd, ater all, is already ull o agitators. No: the last possible way o co-opting creativity—the organization o artistic passivity—is, happily, doomed to ailure.
     Spontaneity is the mode o being o individual creativity, its original, immaculate orm, neither polluted at the source nor threatened by co-optation.
Whereas creativity is the most equitably distributed thing imaginable, spontaneity seems to be the privileged possession o those whom long resistance to Power has endowed with a consciousness o their own value as individuals. In revolutionary moments this means the majority; at other times, when the revolution must be prepared day by day, it means more people than one might suppose. Wherever the light o creativity continues to shine, spontaneity has a chance.

     “The new artist protests,” wrote [Tristan] Tzara in 1918. “He no longer
paints . . . but creates directly.” Immediacy is certainly the most succinct, but also the most radical demand that must characterize the new artists o today, who are destined to be constructors o situations to be lived directly. I say succinct because it is important ater all not to be misled by the word spontaneity. The spontaneous can never spring rom internalized constraints, even subconscious ones; nor can it abide alienating abstraction or spectacular co-optation: clearly it is a conquest, not a given. The reconstruction o the individual presupposes the reconstruction o the unconscious (consider the construction o dreams).
     What spontaneous creativity has lacked up to now is the clear consciousness o its own poetry. Common sense has always treated spontaneity as a
primary state, an initial stage in need o theoretical adjustment, o transposition into abstract terms. This view isolates spontaneity, treats it as a thing-initsel—and thus recognizes it only in the travestied orms which it acquires within the spectacle (e.g., action painting). In point o act spontaneous creativity carries the seeds o its eective development within itsel. It is possessed o its own poetry.
     I have already said that creativity, though equitably distributed to all,
inds direct, spontaneous expression only on speciic occasions. These are prerevolutionary moments, the source o the poetry that changes lie and transorms the world.
     Those who make a proession o creating, and those whose proession
prevents them rom creating, both artists and workers, are being pushed into the same nihilism by the process o proletarianization. This process, which is accompanied by resistance to it—resistance, that is, to co-opted orms o creativity—occurs amid such a plethora o cultural goods—records, ilms, paperback books—that once these commodities have been reed rom the laws o consumption they will pass immediately into the service o true creativity. The sabotage o the mechanisms o economic and cultural consumption is epitomized by young people who steal the books in which they expect to ind conirmation o their radicalism.
     What is poetry? It is the organization o creative spontaneity, the deployment o the qualitative in accordance with its coherent inner logic. Poetry is
what the Greeks call poiein, or “making,” but making restored to the purity o its original impulse—restored, in a word, to the totality.
     Without the qualitative, no poetry is possible. The void let by poetry is
illed by poetry’s opposites: inormation, transitional programs, specialization, reormism—all the motley guises o the ragmentary. But the presence o the qualitative does not o itsel ensure the progression o poetry. The richest complex o signs and possibilities may well lapse into conusion, all apart

or lack o consistency, or crumble by reason o crossed purposes. The yardstick o eectiveness must always remain supreme. Poetry is thus also radical theory completely integrated into action, the mortar binding tactics and revolutionary strategy, and the high point o the great game o everyday lie.
     What is poetry? In 1895, during an ill-advised and seemingly doomed
French rail strike, a militant o the National Railwaymen’s Union stood up and suggested an ingenious and cheap way o advancing the strikers’ cause: “It takes two pennyworth o a particular substance used in the right way to immobilize a locomotive.” It was not very long beore the government and the bosses caved in. Poetry in this case was clearly the act that brought a new reality into being, that reversed the perspective. The materia prima is within everyone’s reach. Poets are those who know how to use it to best eect. Furthermore, two pennyworth o some chemical is as nothing compared with the abundance o peerless ready energy aorded by everyday lie itsel: the energy o the will to live, the power o desire unleashed, the passion o love, the love o passion, the orce o ear and anxiety, the rising tide o hate, and the repercussions o wild destructiveness. Who knows what poetic upheavals may conidently be expected to stem rom such universally experienced eelings as those associated with death, old age, and sickness? This still marginal consciousness will surely be the starting point o the long revolution o everyday lie, the only true poetry made by all and not by one alone.
     “What is poetry?” ask the aesthetes. So, or their beneit, let us state
the obvious: rarely does poetry today involve poems. Most works o art are betrayals o poetry. How could it be otherwise, when poetry and power cannot be reconciled? At best the artist’s creativity builds a prison or itsel, cloistering itsel, awaiting its moment, within an oeuvre that has not yet said its last word; but, however high its author’s hopes, that last word—supposed to herald perect communication—can never be pronounced so long as the revolt o creativity has not yet brought art to its ulillment.
     The Arican work o art—poem, music, sculpture, or mask—is not considered complete until it has become creative speech, an active word: it must
function. This holds true well beyond Arican art. There is no art in the world which does not seek to function; and to unction—later co-optation notwithstanding—in accordance with the will that generated it, the will to live continually in the euphoria o the moment o creation. Why is it that the greatest works never seem to be inished? The answer is that great art cries out in every possible way or ulillment, or the right to enter the world o lived experience. The degeneration o present-day art is a bow perectly readied or such an arrow.
     Nothing can save past culture rom the cult o the past except those
pictures, writings, musical or built architecture, and so on, whose qualitative
                          C A P A     C u  u r  A  D C u  u r A  PrDuC   | 193
dimension reaches us independently o their orms (contaminated by the decay now aecting all artistic orms).
     As we know, consumer society reduces art to a range o consumable products. This vulgarizing tendency accelerates degeneration but by the same
token improves the prospects o supersession. That communication so urgently sought by the artist is jammed and banned even in the simplest relationships o everyday lie. So true is this that the search or new orms o communication, ar rom being the preserve o painters and poets, is now part o a collective eort. This is the end o the old specialization o art. There are no more artists because everyone is an artist. The work o art o the uture will be the construction o a passionate lie.
     Poetry is always somewhere. I it leaves the realm o the arts, it is all the
easier to see that it belongs irst and oremost in action, in a way o living and in the search or a way o living. Everywhere repressed, this poetry springs up everywhere. Brutally put down, it is reborn in violence. It consecrates riots, embraces rebellions, and animates all great revolutionary carnivals until the bureaucrats place it under house arrest in their hagiographical culture.
     Lived poetry has eectively shown throughout history, even in partial
revolts, even in crime—which [Ernest] Coeurderoy so aptly dubbed the “revolt o one”—that it is the protector par excellence o everything irreducible in mankind, meaning creative spontaneity. The will to unite the individual and the social, not on the basis o illusory community but on that o subjectivity, is what makes the new poetry into a weapon that everyone must learn to handle by themselves. Poetic experience is now at a premium. The organization o spontaneity will be the work o spontaneity itsel.

according to its operational lines and according to its own speed. But in order to ulill this transormation, the body-mind must pass through an inernal mutation, that we see developing in the history o the world. To understand and to analyze this process, neither the conceptual instruments o political economy nor the instruments o technological analysis are su- icient. The process o production becomes semiotic and the ormation o the digital nervous system co-involves and enervates the mind, the social psyche, desires and hopes, ears and imaginings. Thereore i we want to analyze these productive transormations, we must concern ourselves with semiotic production, with linguistic and cognitive mutations. And mutation passes through the range o pathologies.
     Neoliberal culture has injected into the social brain a constant stimulus
toward competition, and the technical system o the digital network has rendered possible an intensiication o inormatic stimuli, transmitted rom the social brain to individual brains. This acceleration o stimuli is a pathogenic actor that has wide-ranging eects in society. Economic competition and digital intensiication o inormatic stimuli, combined together, induce a state o permanent electrocution that lows into a widespread pathology which maniests itsel either in the panic syndrome or in attention disorders.
     Panic is an ever more widespread syndrome. Until a ew years ago,
psychiatrists hardly recognized this symptom that belonged rather to the romantic literary imagination, and could approach the eeling o being overwhelmed by the ininite richness o the orms o nature by unlimited cosmic power. Today, instead, panic is ever more requently denounced as a painul and worrying symptom, the physical sensation o no longer succeeding in governing one’s own body, an acceleration o the heart rate, a shortness o breath that can lead to ainting and paralysis. Even i to my knowledge exhaustive research does not exist in this area, the hypothesis can be proposed that the mediatization o communication and the consequent rareaction o physical contact can provoke pathologies in the aective and emotional sphere. For the irst time in human history, there is a generation that has learnt more words and heard more stories rom the televisual machine than rom its mother. Attention disturbances are more and more widespread. Millions o North American and European children are treated or a disturbance that maniests itsel as the incapacity to maintain concentrated attention on an object or more than a ew seconds. The constant excitation o the mind on the part o neurostimulant luxes probably leads to a pathological saturation. I we want to understand the contemporary economy we must concern ourselves with the psychopathology o relations. And i we want to understand contemporary psychochemistry we must take into account the act that the mind is invested by semiotic luxes that ollow an extra-semiotic

principle: the principle o economic competition, the principle o maximum development. From the time when capitalism connected to the brain, the latter incorporated a pathological agent, a psychotic meme that will accelerate pulsations even to tremors, even to collapse.
     In the 1990s, Prozac culture was intermingled with the new economy.
Hundreds o thousands o operators, directors, and managers o the occidental economy took innumerable decisions in a state o chemical euphoria and psychopharmacological lightheadedness. But in the long term the organism collapsed, unable to support indeinitely the chemical euphoria that had sustained competitive enthusiasm and productivist anaticism. Collective attention was supersaturated and this was provoking a collapse o a social and economic kind. As happens in a manic depressive organism, as happens with a patient aected by bipolar disorder, ater the inancial euphoria o the 1990s, there ollowed a depression. It is thereore a case o clinical depression that strikes motivation, initiative, sel-esteem, desire, and sex appeal at the roots. To understand the crisis o the new economy it is necessary to begin rom the psychic experience o the virtual class; it is necessary to relect on the psychic and emotional state o the millions o cognitive workers who animated the scene o business, culture, and the imaginary during the decade o the 1990s. The individual psychic depression o a single cognitive worker is not a consequence o the economic crisis but its cause. It would be simple to consider depression as a consequence o a bad business cycle. Ater having worked or so many years happily and proitably, the value o shares has plummeted and our brainworker is overcome by an ugly depression. It does not happen in this way. Depression descends on the cognitive worker because his or her own emotional, physical, intellectual system cannot indeinitely support the hyperactivity provoked by the market and by pharmaceuticals. As a consequence, things are set to go badly in the market. What is the market? The market is the place in which signs and nascent meanings, desires and projections meet. I we want to speak o demand and supply, we must reason in terms o luxes o desire and semiotic attractors that ormerly had appeal and today have lost it.
     In the Net economy, lexibility has evolved into a orm o ractalization
o work. Fractalization means the modular and recombinant ragmentation o the time o activity. The worker no longer exists as a person. He or she is only an interchangeable producer o microragments o recombinant semiosis that enter into the continuous lux o the Net. Capital no longer pays or the availability o a worker to be exploited or a long period o time; it no longer pays a salary that covers the entire range o economic needs o a person who works. The worker (a machine endowed with a brain that can be used or ragments o time) becomes paid or his or her occasional, temporary services.

## 19 6 | Ch APr 6

Work time is ragmented and cellularized. Cells o time are or sale on the Net and businesses can buy as much as they want without being obligated in any way in the social protection o the worker.
     The intense and prolonged investment o mental and libidinal energies in
the labor process has created the conditions or a psychic collapse that is trans- erred into the economic ield with the recession and the all in demand and into the political ield in the orm o military aggressivity. The use o the word collapse is not as a metaphor but as a clinical description o what is happening in the occidental mind. The word collapse expresses a real and exact pathological phenomenon that invests the psychosocial organism. That which we have seen in the period ollowing the irst signs o economic decline, in the irst months o the new century, is a psychopathic phenomenon o overexcitation, trembling, panic, and inally o a depressive all. The phenomena o economic depression have always contained elements o the crisis o the psychosocial equilibrium, but when at last the process o production has involved the brain in a massive way, psychopathology has become the crucial aspect o economic cycles.
     The available attention time or the workers involved in the inormatic
cycle is constantly being reduced: they are involved in a growing number o mental tasks that occupy every ragment o their attention time. For them there is no longer the time to dedicate to love, to tenderness, to aection. They take Viagra because they don’t have time or sexual preliminaries. They take cocaine to be continuously alert and reactive. They take Prozac to cancel out the awareness o the senselessness that unexpectedly empties their lie o any interest. Cellularization has brought about a type o permanent occupation o living time. The eect is a mutation o social relations in a psychopathic direction. The signs are evident: millions o packets o psychopharmaceuticals sold, an epidemic o attention disturbances spreading among children and adolescents, the becoming normal o the diusion o drugs like Ritalin in schools, and what seems to be the spreading o an epidemic o panic in the abric o everyday lie.

     The evolution o the ino-sphere’s activation o always more complex networks o inormation distribution has produced a leap in the power, speed,
and the very ormat o the ino-sphere. There is no corresponding leap in the power and ormat o reception.
     The universe o receivers, human brains o real people made o lesh,
ragile and sensual organs, is not ormatted according to the same standard as the system o digital transmitters. The unctional paradigm o the universe o transmitters does not correspond to the unctional paradigm o the universe o receivers. This asymmetry is maniested by various pathological eects: permanent electrocution, panic, overexcitation, hypermobility, attention disturbances, dyslexia, inormation overload, and saturation o reception circuits.
     At the origin o this saturation, there is a real and proper deormity o
ormats. The ormat o the universe o transmitters has evolved, multiplying its powers, while the ormat o the universe o receivers has not been able to evolve in as rapid a manner, or the simple reason that it is based on an organic support (the human brain-body) that has evolutionary times completely dierent rom the evolutionary times o machines.
     That which is being determined could be deined as a paradigmatic discrepancy, a schism between the paradigm that models the universe o transmitters and the paradigm that models the universe o receivers. In a situation
like this, communication becomes an asymmetrical disturbed process. We could speak in this regard o a discrepancy between cyberspace in unlimited and constant expansion and cybertime. Cyberspace is a network that includes mechanical and organic components whose processing power can be accelerated without limits, while cybertime is an essentially lived reality, linked to an organic support (the human body and brain) whose processing time cannot be accelerated beyond relatively rigid natural limits.
     Since the time when, in 1977, he wrote the book Speed and Politics, Paul
Virilio has maintained that speed is the decisive actor in modern history. It is thanks to speed, Virilio claims, that wars are won, both military and commercial ones. In many o his writings, Virilio shows that the speed o movements, o transportation, o motorization has allowed armies to win wars in the course o the last century. Since then, it has been possible to substitute objects, goods, and people or signs. By virtual, electronically transerable phantasms, the barriers o speed have been broken and the most impressive process o acceleration that human history has ever known has erupted. In a certain sense we can say that space no longer exists, given that inormation can cross it instantly and events can be transerred in real time rom one place to another on the planet, becoming virtually shared events. But what are the consequences o this acceleration on the human mind, on the human

## 19 8 | Ch APr 6

body? To understand it we must make reerence to the capacity o conscious processing, to the capacity or aective assimilation o signs and events on the part o the conscious and sensitive organism.
     The acceleration o inormation exchange has produced and is producing an eect o a pathological type on the individual human mind and even
more on the collective mind. Individuals are not in a position to consciously process the immense and always growing mass o inormation that enters their computers, their cell phones, their television screens, their electronic diaries, and their heads. However, it seems indispensable to ollow, recognize, evaluate, process all this inormation i you want to be eicient, competitive, victorious. The practice o multitasking, the opening o a window o hypertextual attention, the passage rom one context to another or the complex evaluation o processes, tends to deorm the sequential modality o mental processing. According to Christian Marazzi, who has concerned himsel in various books with the relations between economics, language, and aectivity, the latest generation o economic operators is aected by a real and proper orm o dyslexia, incapable o reading a page rom the beginning to the end according to sequential procedures, incapable o maintaining concentrated attention on the same object or a long time. And dyslexia spreads to cognitive and social behaviors, leading to rendering the pursuit o linear strategies nearly impossible.
     Some, like [Thomas H.] Davenport and [John C.] Beck, speak o an attention economy. But when a cognitive aculty enters into and becomes part
o economic discourse, this means that it has become a scarce resource. The necessary time or paying attention to the luxes o inormation to which we are exposed and which must be evaluated in order to be able to make decisions is lacking. The consequence is in ront o our eyes: political and economic decisions no longer respond to a long-term strategic rationality and simply ollow immediate interests. On the other hand, we are always less available or giving our attention to others gratuitously. We no longer have the attention time or love, tenderness, nature, pleasure, and compassion. Our attention is ever more besieged and thereore we assign it only to our careers, to competition, and to economic decisions. And in any case our temporality cannot ollow the insane speed o the hypercomplex digital machine. Human beings tend to become the ruthless executors o decisions taken without attention.
     The universe o transmitters, or cyberspace, now proceeds at a superhuman velocity and becomes untranslatable or the universe o receivers, or
cybertime, that cannot go aster than what is allowed by the physical material rom which our brain is made, the slowness o our body, the need or caresses and aection. Thus opens a pathological gap and mental illness spreads as
                        C A P A     C u  u r  A  D C u  u r A  PrDuC   | 199
testiied by the statistics and above all our everyday experience. And just as pathology spreads, so too do drugs. The lourishing industry o psychopharmaceuticals beats records every year; the number o packets o Ritalin, Prozac, Zolot, and other psychotropics sold in the pharmacies continually increases, while dissociation, suering, desperation, terror, the desire not to exist, to not have to ight continuously, to disappear grows alongside the will to kill and to kill onesel.
     When, toward the end o the 1970s, an acceleration o the productive and
communicative rhythms in occidental metropolitan centers was imposed, a gigantic epidemic o drug addiction made its appearance. The world was leaving its human epoch to enter the era o machinic post-human acceleration: many sensitive organisms o the human variety began to snort cocaine, a substance that permits the acceleration o the existential rhythm leading to transorming onesel into a machine. Many other sensitive organisms o the human kind injected heroin in their veins, a substance that deactivates the relation with the speed o the surrounding atmosphere. The epidemic o powders during the 1970s and the 1980s produced an existential and cultural devastation with which we still haven’t come to terms. Then illegal drugs were replaced by those legal substances which the pharmaceutical industry in a white coat made available or its victims, and this was the epoch o antidepressants, o euphorics, and o mood regulators.
     Today psychopathy reveals itsel ever more clearly as a social epidemic
and, more precisely, a socio-communicational one. I you want to survive you have to be competitive, and i you want to be competitive you must be connected, receive, and process continuously an immense and growing mass o data. This provokes a constant attentive stress, a reduction o the time available or aectivity. These two tendencies, inseparably linked, provoke an eect o devastation on the individual psyche: depression, panic, anxiety, the sense o solitude and existential misery. But these individual symptoms cannot be indeinitely isolated, as psychopathology has done up until now and as economic power wishes to do. It is not possible to say: “You are exhausted, go and take a vacation at Club Med, take a pill, make a cure, get the hell away rom it all, recover in the psychiatric hospital, kill yoursel.” It is no longer possible, or the simple reason that it is no longer a matter o a small minority o crazies or a marginal amount o depressives. It concerns a growing mass o existential misery that is tending always more to explode in the center o the social system. Besides, it is necessary to consider a decisive act: at the time when capital needed to suck in physical energy rom its exploited and rom its slaves, psychopathology could be relatively marginalized. Your psychic suering didn’t matter much to capital when you only had to insert screws and handle a lathe. You could be as sad as a solitary ly in a bottle, but your

## 200 | Ch APr 6

productivity was hardly aected because your muscles could still unction. Today capital needs mental energies, psychic energies. And these are exactly the capacities that are ucking up. It’s because o this that psychopathology is exploding in the center o the social scene. The economic crisis depends or the most part on a circulation o sadness, depression, panic, and demotivation. The crisis o the new economy was provoked in a large part by a crisis o motivations, by a all o the artiicial euphoria o the 1990s. This has led to eects o disinvestment and in part even to a reduction o consumption. In general, unhappiness unctions as a stimulus to consume: buying is a suspension o anxiety, an antidote to loneliness, but only up to a certain point. Beyond this certain point, suering becomes a demotivating actor or purchasing. There is thereore an elaboration o conlicting strategies. The masters o the world certainly do not want humanity to be able to be happy, because a happy humanity would not let itsel be caught up in productivity, in the discipline over work or in hypermarkets. However, they try out useul techniques to make unhappiness moderate and tolerable, or postponing or preventing a suicidal explosion, or inducing consumption.
     What strategies will the collective organism ollow in order to escape
this abric o unhappiness? Is a strategy o deceleration, o the reduction o complexity possible and able to be hypothesized? I don’t believe so. In human society, potentialities cannot be deinitively canceled out, even when they are revealed to be lethal or the individual and probably even or the species. These potentials become regulated and kept under control or as long as possible, but in the end are inevitably used as happened (and will happen again) with the atomic bomb. A strategy o the upgrading o the human organism is possible—o the mechanical adjustment o the human body and brain to a hyperast ino-sphere. This is the strategy that is used to deine the posthuman. Finally a strategy o subtraction is possible, o distancing rom the vortex, but this is a type o strategy that only small communities can ollow, constituting spheres o existential, economic, and inormatic autonomy with respect to the economic world.

is global panic. I we want to understand what panic means we have to talk about the attention economy and about “digital labor.” This is where the source o contemporary panic lies: in the organization o time in the digital sphere, in the relationship between cyberspace and cybertime.
     What is panic? We are told that psychiatrists have recently discovered and
named a new kind o disorder—they call it Panic Syndrome. It seems that it’s something quite recent in the psychological sel-perception o human beings. But what does panic mean?
     Once, panic used to be a nice word, and this is the sense in which the
Swiss-American psychoanalyst James Hillman remembers it in his book on Pan. Pan used to be the god o nature, the god o totality. In Greek mythology, Pan was the symbol o the relationship between man and nature.
     Nature is the overwhelming low o reality, things, and inormation that
we are surrounded by. Modern culture is based on the idea o human domination, o the domestication o nature. So the original panic eeling, which was something good or the ancient world, is becoming increasingly terriying and destructive. Today, panic has become a orm o psychopathology. We can speak o panic when we see a conscious organism (individual or social) being overwhelmed by the speed o processes he/she is involved in, and has no time to process the inormation input. In these cases the organism, all o a sudden, is no more able to process the sheer amount o inormation coming into its cognitive ield or even that which is being generated by the organism itsel.
     Technological transormations have displaced the ocus rom the sphere
o the production o material goods toward the sphere o semiotic goods: the ino-sphere. With this, semio-capital becomes the general orm o the economy. The accelerated creation o surplus value depends on the acceleration o the ino-sphere. The digitalization o the ino-sphere opens the road to this kind o acceleration. Signs are produced and circulated at a growing speed but the human terminal o the system (the embodied mind) is put under growing pressure, and inally it cracks. I think that the current economic crisis has something to do with this imbalance in the ield o semio-production and in the ield o semio-demand. This imbalance in the relationship between the supply o semiotic goods and the socially available time o attention is the core o the economic crisis as well as the core o the intellectual and the political crises that we are living through now.
     We can describe this situation in terms o the relationship between
cyberspace and cybertime. Cyberspace is the ininite productivity o collective intelligence in a networked dimension. The potency o the general intellect is enormously enhanced when a huge number o points enter into

## 2 02 | Ch APr 6

connections with each other thanks to the telematic network. Consequently, ino-production is able to create an ininite supply o mental and intellectual goods. But while cyberspace is conceptually ininite, cybertime is not ininite at all. I call cybertime the ability o the conscious organism to actually process (cyberspatial) inormation. This ability cannot be indeinitely expanded, because it has limits that are physical, emotional, aective. The contradiction between ininite expansion o cyberspace and limited capability o processing o cybertime is the origin o contemporary chaos.
    [Gilles] Deleuze and [Félix] Guattari talk about chaos in What Is Philosophy? They say that chaos occurs when the world goes too ast or your brain.
This is chaos.
    We could recall that Karl Marx had once expressed the concept o an
overproduction crisis. You have an overproduction crisis when machinery and the labor o workers produce an amount o goods that the market cannot absorb. During the history o the industrial system, the overproduction crisis was recurrent, and capitalism was pushed to destroy goods, destroy productive capacity, and also destroy human lives, in order to overcome this kind o economic crisis.
    What is going to happen now? Should we see a relationship between this
big imbalance and the war that is raging and obscuring the horizon o the world? Let’s go back to the concept o panic.
    Semio-capital is in a crisis o overproduction, but the orm o this crisis is
not only economic but also psychopathic. Semio-capital, in act, is not about the production o material goods but about the production o psychic stimulation. The mental environment is saturated by signs that create a sort o continuous excitation, a permanent electrocution, which leads the individual mind as well as the collective mind to a state o collapse.
    The problem o panic is generally connected with the management o
time. But we can also see a spatial side to panic. During the past centuries, the building o the modern urban environment used to be dependent on the rationalist plan o the political city. The economic dictatorship o the last ew decades has accelerated urban expansion. The interaction between cyberspatial sprawl and urban physical environment has destroyed the rationalist organization o space.
    In the intersection o inormation and urban space we see the prolieration o a chaotic sprawl ollowing no rule, no plan, dictated by the sole logic
o economic interest. Urban panic is caused by the perception o this sprawl and this prolieration o metropolitan experience; the prolieration o spatial lines o light. The metropolis is a surace o complexity in the territorial domain. The social organism is unable to process the overwhelmingly complex

experience o metropolitan chaos. The prolieration o lines o communication has created a new kind o chaotic perception.
    In their book The Attention Economy, Davenport and Beck say that the
central problem o the cognitive worker, and generally o people who are living in hypersaturated inormational environments, is this: we have no more time or attention, we are no more able to understand and process inormation input because our time is saturated by a low o hyperinormation. We don’t have time or attention in the workplace. We are orced to process ar too large amounts o inormation and our body-mind is completely taken by this. And urther, we have no time or aection, or communication, or erotic relationships. We have no more time or that spatial kind o attention that means attention to the body—to our body, to the body o the other. So, more and more, we eel that we have run out o time; that we must accelerate. And we eel simultaneously that acceleration leads to a loss o lie, o pleasure and o understanding.
CmP The concept o competition has replaced that o competence.
     Competence is the intellectual skill that enabled the bourgeoisie to carry
out its planning, administrative, and organizational unction, and justiied its right to property.
     Ever since the technologies o intelligence made it possible to standardize the processes o planning, coordination, and administration that once
coalesced with the role o ownership, intellectual unctions have turned into the unctions o subordinate labor.
     The competent bourgeoisie was replaced by a class that turned competition
into the only rule and competence. However, when speaking o competition, is it not obvious that the most competitive is the one who can eliminate the adversaries? And when it comes to eliminating adversaries things get serious.
     As property came to coincide with a dusty cloud o ractions o investment rather than with the person, competition replaced competence. Many
competences are still necessary to production, but they are now detached rom the role o the enterprise. Any intellectual competence that is not related to speculation is made precarious, devalued, and low waged.
     Crime is no longer a marginal unction o the capitalist system but the
decisive winning actor or deregulated competition. Torture, homicide, child exploitation, the drive to prostitution, and the production o instruments o mass destruction have become irreplaceable techniques o economic competition. Crime is best suited to the principle o competition.

The Futurists do not just represent the point where, as Stewart Home explores, utopian currents based around the integration o all aspects o lie, which were viewed primarily as religious during medieval times, moved over to be considered part o the artistic sphere. The Futurists are perhaps the clearest indication that interesting aesthetics do not necessarily correspond to progressive politics, as their intense ascination with war, speed, patriotism, and eventual movement toward ascism display. There are countless more examples less dramatic but all the more complex, ranging rom surrealism’s turbulent relation to the institutional communist movement (and eventual severing and usage by U.S. state propaganda eorts and ronts) to debates about the role o street art in gentriication.
     One recurring challenge or political art is to circumvent the assumption,
implicitly contained within a didactic composition, that the work’s arguments can take place in an already existing public sphere—the common ground and rame o reerence—that preexists the particular expression. Unaware o this challenge, much political artwork strives to create interesting and compelling arguments, lourishes o speech, in hopes that the message will reach the listener with little intererence. In order or political speech to cause aective resonance, conditions need to exist or the constituted audience to be able to identiy with those who are expressing them, to possess a capacity to aect and be aected. This process o aective composition so oten begins rom minor moments and interactions: yet through them spaces o commonality, where new relations and interactions are possible, emerge. [Gilles] Deleuze and [Félix] Guattari’s observation that “the people are missing” is not a lament but a realization that the task o politics is precisely the composition o common space through processes o intensive engagement not bound by the closure o already understood identities and positions. This is precisely the point explored by Randy Martin in his work on the role
                        C A P A     C u  u r  A  D C u  u r A  PrDuC   | 2 05
o theater in the producing and orming o publics, acting as a means or the production o socialist ensembles: “publics must continue to be generated i a revolutionary project is to maintain its resonance.” For Martin autonomy is not something granted but rather a critical presence existing through and despite networks o governance. The continual generation o new publics, o new orms o the resonance o ideas and relations, is the process o aective composition, whether through the orming o publics through theater or any other o the possible means.
     But what is meant by aective composition? At the risk o launching yet
another trendy neologism, the concept o aective composition is ormed by the bringing together o notions o aect with the autonomist notion o class composition. The concept o aect was developed in a submerged history o philosophy, stretching rom Spinoza to Deleuze and Guattari (and having been developed urther by igures such as Antonio Negri and Genevieve Lloyd), to indicate an increase in capacity to aect or to be aected by the world. For Deleuze and Guattari, artistic creation is the domain o aective resonance, where imagination shits through the interacting bodies. Composition is used here, borrowing rom the autonomist Marxist notion o class composition, indicating the autonomous and collective capacities to change the world created through social resistance. As orms o collective capacity and sel-organization are increased, composed by the circulation o struggles and ideas, the workings o the state and capitalism attempt to ind ways to disperse them or to integrate these social energies into their own workings. Thus there are ormed cycles o the composition, decomposition, and recomposition o struggles. A key insight o autonomist thought was the argument that the nature o struggles and the orms o social cooperation created within in them determine the direction o capitalist development, rather than the autonomous sel-directed power o capital. Considering aective composition through orms o street art and perormance is to look at the ways that the capacities they create contribute to the development o aective capacities and orms o sel-organization. It is the ways in which street arts can take place in what the Inernal Noise Brigade mission statement describes as “acilit[ating] the sel-actualization o the mob.” This sel-actualization is not something which ever reaches a inal or inished point, but continually doubles over and immanently above itsel, turning cycles o struggles into spirals o movement composition.
     The aective composition o relations and intensities in aesthetic politics
is a pressing question because o ways that the possibilities or the existence o public and common space have changed over recent years. The increasingly drastic commercialization o public space, corporate domination o media outlets, and predominance o earmongering in all areas o lie has created a

## 206 | Ch APr 6

condition where there are immense lows o inormation and data available or discussion but precious little public sphere in which this data can resonate. Paolo Virno argues that where orms o collective intelligence do not ind expression in a public sphere where common aairs can be attended to, it produces terriying eects and prolierations o unchecked and groundless hierarchies. These are areas o “publicness without a public sphere.” There are lows o inormation and images constantly surrounding and immersing us that allow or new possibilities or communication and the ormation o subjectivities, but which can also be quite overwhelming and go in directions that are not necessarily liberatory. Chat rooms and blogs meld seamlessly with the commercial landscapes o gentriied cities and the twenty-ourhour-a-day low o “news” that may excite the libido or intone the constant reminder o “be araid” but do not constitute a common place o collective engagement. More than anything they tend to proactively prevent the emergence o shared space in ways that have not been overcoded by the workings o state or capital.
     One cannot assume that there is an already existing public sphere, an existing arrangements o bodies, ready to receive inormation conveyed through
an artistic composition. Relying on the expected aesthetics o propaganda means circumscribing possible patterns o resonance more limited than might be wished. Political art derives its politics not just by its content but also by the ways in which it is designed to work with or against the predetermined orms o circulation o ideas, images, and relations. In other words, to appreciate that orms o street art do not derive their subversiveness simply rom the act that they occur on the street (which can also include a whole range o viral marketing and quotidian orms o spectacular recuperation), but rather rom unolding the relations that avoid the overcoding operations o the art institution and commodity production. It is this ocus on patterns o circulation and relations as a politico-aesthetic activity, what George Katsiaicas describes as “engaging aesthetic rationality in the process o political transormation, o turning politics into art, everyday lie into an aesthetically governed domain,” that comprises the process o aective composition.
     One approach to understanding relationships and the construction o
community in an artistic ramework recently has been Nicolas Bourriaud’s notion o “relational aesthetics,” which he developed during the mid-1990s coming out o his curatorial work. Relational aesthetics, which Bourriaud rames as part o a materialist tradition, is argued to represent a theory not o art but o orm—namely, one where “intersubjectivity does not only represent the social setting or the reception o art . . . but also becomes the quintessence o artistic practice.” Collective understandings, experiences, and interactions then are not something that is added on the work aterward
                        C A P A     C u  u r  A  D C u  u r A  PrDuC   | 2 07
but rather compose the starting point and substance o the work itsel. While any artwork can be thought o as a relational object through the kinds o interactions it animates (otentimes a gentle stare with a determined air o trying to appear clever), the dierence here is that these relations are the core o the work itsel. Bourriaud argues that today the designation o art seems to be little more than a “semantic letover” which should be replaced by a deinition like “art is an activity consisting in producing relationships with the world with the help o signs, orms, actions, and objects.”
     From this Bourriaud tries to recast the critical unction o aesthetic intervention, arguing that rather than being based on orming imaginary and
utopian realities, artistic intervention is aimed at orming living models o action and being within the existing world. The artistic composition exists then as “a social interstice within these experiments and these new ‘lie possibilities’ appear as possible.” A piece’s aura no longer lies in another projected world, or in the orm itsel, but rather in the temporary collectives and communities that coalesce or the purposes o producing the exhibition or the space itsel (although or Bourriaud clearly this is all about the exhibition rather than any diuse process o creation going beyond the gallery walls). For Bourriaud the subversive and critical unction o artistic creation is the invention o individual and collective vanishing lines, lines o light, in the creation o temporary nomadic constructions.
     At irst this seems reasonable enough, and relatively close to what I’m
describing as the process o aective composition, the movement rom artistic creation based around objects to the creation o relations and modulations o aect. But slowly the situation becomes more problematic. For instance, there’s no necessary dichotomy between orming imaginary and utopian realities and micropractices o intervention. Utopian dreams and models, rather than being stated and ixed models to impose, have oten acted as inspirations or inding micropolitical modes o intervention, which is to say that they have oten been connected rather than mutually exclusive. Likewise one can build an overall vision drawing rom and extending micropractices. But what might at irst appear to be a relatively minor dierence not worth quibbling about that much becomes more pronounced, especially when Bourriaud makes the argument that today “social utopias and revolutionary hopes have given way to everyday micro-utopias and imitative strategies, [and] any stance that is directly ‘critical’ o society is utile.” Rather than there being just a distinction between imaginary and utopian projects, here it is argued that these projects insoar as they are directly critical o the social world (the state, capitalism, war, exploitation) are utile. In other words, dear artist, give up any hopes o having anything to say about social conditions on any large scale and make yoursel content with micro-interventions and practices.

## 208 | Ch APr 6

This sounds quite similar to approaches ascribed to politics and thought coming in the wake o 1968 and poststructuralism and so-called identity politics. In other words, a shit in politics, rom grand to minor, in a way that micropractices and interventions are divorced rom large questions and social structures.
     This does not mean that all practices and questions have to be directly
oriented to addressing large-scale social and historical projects, as might be argued by the looming clichéd image o the overly zealous Trotskyite who insists that everything must be about directly contesting capitalism rom the perspective o the working class or it is “objectively reactionary.” There are many ways to congeal and conjoin minor articulations inormed by and relating to large social questions that are undamentally concerned with an overall social critique, without having that critique determine and overly con- ine these practices.
     But let us return or a second to a particular kind o moment o the breaking down o barriers through aective composition, namely through orming
an aective space through and around the perormance o radical marching bands. A moment where the passivity o the crowd perhaps is broken and the nature o the space is transormed. Bodies milling about, held awkwardly at a distance, a space maintained and looks a little chilly. Not rom malice or mistrust but rom not knowing. But in that instant borders all. The irst hit o the drum is the irst crack in the wall o the objectiying, separating gaze, the space created by the passive stare o an audience toward a perormance, an exhibition: a spectacle. As the melody pulses through the crowd we revel in the timbre o the horns. Arms, words, memory, and noise tenuously connect through time and desire. Ideas, memories, histories, cultures, and stories are crossbred. Rage blends with joy; dislocation is replaced by emerging, momentary worlds.
     It is in this sense that radical marching bands are o the most interest: in
the ways they undercut the usual space (and sometimes relations) o perormance and create mobile and aective spaces in the streets where it becomes possible or other orms o relations to emerge. Projects such as the Hungry March Band, the Inernal Noise Brigade, and Rhythms o Resistance, closely connected with the late 1990s upswing in streets protests and parties such as Reclaim the Streets, brought carnivalesque energies and excitement into the all too oten ritualistic and stale mode o political protest. One could argue, perhaps paradoxically, that while in the upswing o organizing and summit protests that occurred in the post-’99 realization there already were existing movements against the more egregious excesses o the state and capitalism; there was somewhat o a shit away rom diuse orms o cultural politics to more spectacular media-riendly orms such as mass mobilizations and

lockdowns. Radical marching bands and other orms o tactical rivolity were important in keeping open space or the emergence o intensive and aective relations within such spaces, relations which hopeully would ind their ways out on to all o the abric o daily lie.
     Hakim Bey describes how marching bands were invented by Turkish
Janissaries, members o the Ottoman Imperial Guard, who belonged to a heterodox Bektashi Sui order. The marching band, developed or use in military campaigns, unctioned as a orm o psychological warare through music that induced sheer terror in their opponents. Their eect on European armies, who had never experienced anything like that previously, must have been complete ear, most likely resulting in increased morale among the Turkish troops. Marching bands were adopted by European states or use in military campaigns and increasingly in symbolic and ceremonial unctions as orms o ampliied communications technologies became developed. Forms o marching band music moved with the migration o Roma people rom the Ottoman Empire to the southern United States, who brought along with them brass instruments that had a proound eect on the development o music in the area.
     Not surprisingly, then, the repertoire o many marching bands is also a
veritable melting pot o styles, cultures, and background, bringing together anything rom jazz and big band tunes to klezmer, Moroccan music and Indian wedding tunes to calypso, salsa, reggae, and Sun Ra. There are also large degrees o inspiration rom projects that have merged together the energy o punk rock and street perormance, such as Crash Worship and ¡TchKung! (who had members that went on to orm marching bands). There are large degrees o crossover and mixing between political marching bands and other orms o street and perormance art and theater (such as Vermont’s Bread & Puppet Theater, which provided a key source o inspiration or many marching bands) as well as underground circus and vaudeville (such as the Bindlesti Family Cirkus and Circus Contraption).
     One o the best examples I can think o or how a marching band altered
the composition o a situation occurred at the Foo Festival in Providence, Rhode Island, in July 2006. The event, organized by people rom AS220, a local arts space, illed the greater part o a city block while literally thousands o people milled about attending various talks and workshops, casually munching on ood, browsing through the wares o booksellers, and watching bands and musicians perorm on a stage located near one end o the estival. At several points during the day the What Cheer? Brigade, a local marching band, would materialize replete with propulsive drumming and piercing horns, resplendent in motley attire that one would be hard pressed to call uniorms. Their appearance changed the nature o the situation because as

## 210 | Ch APr 6

they would enter the space people would begin to dance and rolic around with them as they moved through the space, rather than staying ixed on the stage as a ocal point, one that clearly marked the dierence between those who were perorming and observing. This increase in the generalized level o conviviality aected not only those directly involved in the dancing but seemed to move beyond itsel as those around it somehow ound new reasons to converse and interact with people they hadn’t spoken with beore.
    The marching band may most commonly be experienced as an appendage to the state orm, as a space deined by tightly scripted and controlled
lines and the military insignia. They are encountered at the military or civic parade, or perhaps as a motivational soundtrack to a sports competition. And it is perhaps this association that makes their playul détournement and reappropriation to serve other ends all the more delicious. March music might usually typically have resonance with the workings o the war machine, but as Deleuze and Guattari would remind us, this war machine can never totally be integrated into the workings o governance: there is always something that escapes. It is a process that exceeds that subject and existing communicative structures yet paradoxically one that creates a space where the possibility o transversal commonality exists. And the war machine, understood as a space o exteriority to the state, can also be understood as a trans- ormation machine, as the nomadic lows and machinations that constitute spaces o possibility.
    Stencil art and graiti as well as street perormances play an important
role in breaking down the orms o relations created by artistic activity as separated or removed rom daily lie because they can be inscribed within the lows o people’s everyday lives, in the streets, and in subways. But this does not inherently mean that such activities contain the possibility or reorienting people’s expectations or will result in certain responses. And indeed, it is possible that what was once an innovative creative activity can become standardized and expected in such ways that the aectivity it initially generated is longer as intensive or eective in its workings. And i Banksy, or someone as marketable as him, should come to your town, it can drive up the real estate values as well. Even the most apparently subversive imagery can be reincorporated and recuperated back into the workings o the spectacle.
    This constituent and aective space or creating new relations is not one
that can be created and continue to exist without intererence or diiculty. Temporary autonomous zones are temporary or a reason—namely, the realization that attempts to create such spaces will inevitably ace repression and recuperation. Thus, it is oten not tactically sensible to create a space and maintain it (investing time, energies, and cost) against all odds. These moments and spaces are described quite well by the Leeds May Day Group
                        C A P A     C u  u r  A  D C u  u r A  PrDuC   | 211
as “moments o excess.” One can see how with phenomena as diverse as the rise o punk and social centers to culture jamming and Critical Mass, through dierent mixes o co-optation and legal action, a space that once vibrant and ull o possibilities comes to be a bit lackluster. But the compositional capacities o these ruptures are not unlimited, or they too through repetition become ritualized and all back into solidiied patterns o circulation. The question becomes one o keeping open the aective capacities o the created space: to ind ways to avoid the traps o spectacular recuperation and the solidiication o constituent moments and possibilities into ixed and constituted orms that have lost their vitality.
     It’s in this way that the concept o the art strike, as originally proposed
by Gustav Metzger, and then urther developed by Stewart Home and the Praxis Group in 1990–1993, becomes useul or the composition o struggles. At a juncture where capitalism is increasingly reliant on the production o new images, relations, and aects or its continued existence, [it] struggles to ind ways to intervene in these somewhat more ephemeral realms. This is why Home argues that the importance o the art strike lies less in its easibility or its concrete success, but rather in the possibility it opens up or extending and intensiying class war: “By extending and redeining traditional conceptions o the strike, the organization o the art strike intends to both increase its value both as a weapon o struggle and a means o disseminating proletarian propaganda.” The withdrawal o artistic labor needs to be collective in a signiicant way to have any eect, or to only have one artist striking against the institutional machinery (as with Metzger’s irst strike), or a handul (as with the Praxis Group), while quite conceptually interesting, has little in the way o eects. The withdrawal o artistic labor can only be aided by disruption o artistic production and communication by inducing o conusion and distortion o communication guerillas in the mystiications o the post-Fordist world. As the autonome a..r.i.k.a. gruppe argues, “When inormation becomes a commodity and Cultural Capital a most important asset, the distortion and devaluation o both is a direct attack against the capitalist system. To say it in a swanky way: This is Class War.” This is much the tactic explored in the discussion o the IWW Starbucks campaign: insoar as the production and ambiences is central to Starbucks, monkey wrenching their image production process can be understood as industrial action. Or, as Patrick Reinsborough describes it, “direct action at the point o assumption.”
     This would mean to work with a sense o aesthetic politics and interventions that are not necessarily or totally based on the elements contained
within the work itsel, but on understanding the possibilities created or aective relations, spaces, and interactions and their intensiication and

## 212 | Ch APr 6

deepening by the process o artistic creation. And to continually modiy the composition o these situations, subtracting them rom circulation and visibility, and turning toward disruption, conusion and illegibility, in the ace o recuperation. This is to understand artistic creation as what George Kubler describes as the shaping o time: art as a succession o works and productions distributed through time that embody the development o orms o collective time and relations. That is, a process that is not necessarily predicated on the creation o meaning, but as an intervention or opening into a system o relations, connecting innovations that are passed along and mutated through the modulation o the relations in which they exist, on a terrain and topology o time “where relationships rather than magnitudes are the subject o study.” It is in these chains o relations that radical innovations in work, orm, idea, and practice are passed along, mutated, and linked in a succession o works embodying orms o collective time and relations.

I see the dark-skinned bodies falling in the street as their ancestors fell before the whip and steel, the last blood pooling, the last breath spitting. I see the immigrant street vendor flashing his wallet to the cops, shot so many times there are bullet holes in the soles of his feet. I see the deaf woodcarver and his pocketknife, crossing the street in front of a cop who yells, then fires. I see the drug raid, the wrong door kicked in, the minister’s heart seizing up. I see the man hawking a fistful of cigarettes, the cop’s chokehold that makes his wheezing lungs stop wheezing forever. I am in the crowd, at the window, kneeling beside the body left on the asphalt for hours, covered in a sheet.
I see the suicides: the conga player handcuffed for drumming on the subway, hanged in the jail cell with his hands cuffed behind him; the suspect leaking blood from his chest in the back seat of the squad car; the 300-pound boy said to stampede barehanded into the bullets drilling his forehead.

Espada: baptizing Taíno or Congolese, name they stuttered in the barking language of priests and overseers, slave’s finger pressed to the blade with the pulsing revelation that a Spaniard’s throat could seep blood like a fingertip, sabers for the uprising smuggled in the hay, slave of the upraised saber beheaded even as the servants and fieldhands murmured he is not dead, he rides a white horse at night, his sword is a torch, the master cannot sleep, there is a dagger under the pillow.

Espada: cousin to the machete, peasant cutlass splitting the cane like a peasant’s backbone, cousin to the kitchen knife skinning a plátano. Swords at rest, the machetero or cook studied their blisters as if planets to glimpse the hands of their father the horseman, map the hands of their mother the serf.
Espada: sword in Puerto Rico, family name of bricklayers who swore their trowels fell as leaves from iron trees; teachers who wrote poems in galloping calligraphy; saintcarvers who whittled a slave’s gaze and a conqueror’s beard; shoemaker spitting tuberculosis, madwoman dangling a lantern to listen for the cough; gambler in a straw hat inhabited by mathematical angels; preacher who first heard the savior’s voice bleeding through the plaster of the jailhouse; dreadlocked sculptor stunned by visions of birds, sprouting wings from his forehead, earthen wings in the fire.
So the face dreaming on a sarcophagus, the slave of the saber riding a white horse by night breathe my name, tell me to taste my name: Espada.

7.4 Factotum

Iarrived in New rleans in the rain at 5 o’clock in the morning. I sat around in the bus station for a while but the people depressed me so I took my suitcase and went out in the rain and began walking. I didn’t know where the rooming houses were, where the poor section was.
“I was so ashamed. To think, my own son in prison. . . . It’s bad enough you don’t want to serve your country in time of War . . .” “The shrink said I was unfit. . . . Do you have a cigarette?” “Now you’ve been jailed. A thing like this could kill your mother.” We passed some cheap bars on lower Broadway. “Let’s go in and catch a drink.” “What? You mean you’d dare drink right after getting out of jail for intoxication?” “That’s when you need a drink the most. . . . I need a piece of ass too.” “What?” “I said, I need a piece of ass too.” He nearly ran a red light. We drove in silence. “By the way,” he said finally, “I guess you know that the jail fine will be added to your room, board and laundry bill?”
Two old guys were waiting for me. I met them down inside the subway where the cars were parked. I was given an armful of cardboard posters and a small metal instrument that looked like a can opener. We all climbed in one of the parked cars.
    We worked our way down to the end of the car. The two old men climbed
off the back, began to walk toward the next subway car parked about fifty feet up the track. We were forty feet above the ground with nothing but railroad ties to walk on. I saw it wouldn’t be any trouble at all for a body to slip through and fall to the ground below.
The hours at the dog biscuit factory were from 4:30 .. to 1 .. I was given a dirty white apron and heavy canvas gloves. The gloves were burned and had holes in them. I could see my fingers peeking through. I was given instructions by a toothless elf with a film over his left eye; the film was

white-and-green with spidery blue lines. He had been on the job nineteen years. I advanced to my post. A whistle blew and the machinery leaped into action. Dog biscuits began to move. The dough was stamped into shape and then placed on heavy metal screens with iron edges. I grabbed a screen, placed it in the oven behind me. I turned. There was the next screen. There was no way to slow them down. The only time they stopped was when something snagged the machinery. It didn’t happen often. When it did, the Elf got it going quickly.
     n such jobs men become tired. They experience a weariness beyond
fatigue. They say mad, brilliant things. ut of my head, I cussed and talked and cracked jokes and sang. Hell boils with laughter. Even the Elf laughed at me. I worked for several weeks. I came in drunk each night. It didn’t matter; I had the job nobody wanted. After an hour at the oven I was sober. My hands were blistered and burned. Each day I sat aching in my room pricking my blisters with pins I first sterilized with matches.
I found a job as a shipping clerk in a ladies’ dresswear shop. Even during World War II when there was supposed to be a manpower shortage there were four or five applicants for each job. (At least for the menial jobs.) We waited with our application forms filled out. Born? Single? Married? Draft status? Last job? Last jobs? Why did you leave? I had filled out so many job forms that long ago I had memorized the right answers. . . . A bald man with strange tufts of hair over each ear interviewed me.
The problem, as it was in those days during the war, was overtime. Those in control always preferred to overwork a few men continually, instead of hiring more people so everyone might work less. You gave the boss eight hours, and he always asked for more. He never sent you home after six hours, for example. You might have time to think.
After losing several typewriters to pawnbrokers I simply gave up the idea of owning one. I printed out my stories by hand and sent them out that way.
    I sent most of them to Clay Gladmore, whose New York mag Frontfire I
admired. They only paid $25 a story but Gladmore had discovered William Saroyan and many others, had been Sherwood Anderson’s buddy. Gladmore returned many of my things with personal rejections. True, most of them weren’t very long but they did seem kind and they were encouraging. The larger magazines used printed rejection slips. Even Gladmore’s printed slips seemed to have some warmth to them: “We regret, alas, that this is a rejection slip but . . .”

    vertime became automatic. I drank more and more in my off hours.
The eight hour day was gone forever. In the morning when you walked in you might as well settle for at least eleven hours. This included Saturdays, which used to be half-days, but which had turned into full days. The war was on but the ladies were buying the hell out of dresses . . .
That scene in the office stayed with me. Those cigars, the fine clothes. I thought of good steaks, long rides up winding driveways that led to beautiful homes. Ease. Trips to Europe. Fine women. Were they that much more clever than I? The only difference was money, and the desire to accumulate it. I’d do it too! I’d save my pennies. I’d get an idea, I’d spring a loan. I’d hire and fire. I’d keep whiskey in my desk drawer. I’d have a wife with size 40 breasts and an ass that would make the paperboy on the corner come in his pants when he saw it wobble. I’d cheat on her and she’d know it and keep silent in order to live in my house with my wealth. I’d fire men just to see the look of dismay on their faces. I’d fire women who didn’t deserve to be fired. That was all a man needed: hope. It was lack of hope that discouraged a man. I remembered my New rleans days, living on two five-cent candy bars a day for weeks at a time in order to have leisure to write. But starvation, unfortunately, didn’t improve art. It only hindered it. A man’s soul was rooted in his stomach. A man could write much better after eating a porterhouse steak and drinking a pint of whiskey than he could ever write after eating a nickel candy bar. The myth of the starving artist was a hoax. nce you realized that everything was a hoax you got wise and began to bleed and burn your fellow man. I’d build an empire upon the broken bodies and lives of helpless men, women, and children—I’d shove it to them all the way. I’ d show them!
The thought of sitting in front of a man behind a desk and telling him that I wanted a job, that I was qualified for a job, was too much for me. Frankly, I was horrified by life, at what a man had to do simply in order to eat, sleep, and keep himself clothed. So I stayed in bed and drank.
The arguments were always the same. I understood it too well now—that great lovers were always men of leisure. I fucked better as a bum than as a puncher of timeclocks.
“Sit down, Chinaski.” n the center of the desk was a check, face down. I slid the check face down along the glass top of the desk and without looking at it I slipped it in my wallet. “You knew we were going to let you go?” “Bosses are never hard to fathom.” “Chinaski, you haven’t been pulling your

weight for a month and you know it.” “A guy busts his damned ass and you don’t appreciate it.” “You haven’t been busting your ass, Chinaski.” I stared down at my shoes for some time. I didn’t know what to say. Then I looked at him. “I’ve given you my time. It’s all I’ve got to give—it’s all any man has. And for a pitiful buck and a quarter an hour.” “Remember you begged for this job. You said your job was your second home.” “. . . my time so that you can live in your big house on the hill and have all the things that go with it. If anybody has lost anything on this deal, on this arrangement . . . I’ve been the loser. Do you understand?” “All right, Chinaski.” “All right?” “Yes. Just go.” . . . “Mantz, I want my unemployment insurance. I don’t want any trouble about that. You guys are always trying to cheat a working man out of his rights. So don’t give me any trouble or I’ll be back to see you.” “You’ll get your insurance. Now get the hell out of here!” I got the hell out of there.
I had my winnings and the bookie money and I just sat around and Jan liked that. After two weeks I was on unemployment and we relaxed and fucked and toured the bars and every week I’d go down to the California State Department of Employment and stand in line and get my nice little check.
The Florida State Department of Employment was a pleasant place. It wasn’t as crowded as the Los Angeles office which was always full. It was my turn for a little good luck, not much, but a little. It was true that I didn’t have much ambition, but there ought to be a place for people without ambition, I mean a better place than the one usually reserved. How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 6:30 .. by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, shit, piss, brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?
     The clerk ran his fingers through his little card file. He pulled one out.
“Ah, here’s a job for you.” “Yes?” He looked up. “Sanitation Worker.” “What?” “Garbage man.” “I don’t want it.” I shuddered at the thought of all that garbage, the morning hangovers, blacks laughing at me, the impossible weight of the cans, and me pukeing my guts into the orange rinds, coffee grounds, wet cigarette ashes, banana peels and the used tampax. “What’s the matter? Not good enough for you? It’s 40 hours. And security. A lifetime of security.” “You take that job and I’ll take yours.” Silence. “I’m trained for this job.” “Are you? I spent two years in college. Is that a prerequisite to pick up garbage?”
I found a job through the newspaper. I was hired by a clothing store but it wasn’t in Miami it was in Miami Beach, and I had to take my hangover across the water each morning. The bus ran along a very narrow strip of cement

## L A G AG E , L   E  A   E , A   A  | 223

that stood up out of the water with no guard-rail, no nothing; that’s all there was to it. The bus driver leaned back and we roared along over this narrow cement strip surrounded by water and all the people in the bus, the twentyfive or forty or fifty-two people trusted him, but I never did. Sometimes it was a new driver, and I thought, how do they select these sons of bitches? There’s deep water on both sides of us and with one error of judgement he’ll kill us all. It was ridiculous. Suppose he had an argument with his wife that morning? r cancer? r visions of God? Bad teeth? Anything. He could do it. Dump us all. I knew that if I was driving that I would consider the possibility or desirability of drowning everybody. And sometimes, after just such considerations, possibility turns into reality. For each Joan of Arc there is a Hitler perched at the other end of the teeter-totter. The old story of good and evil. But none of the bus drivers ever dumped us. They were thinking instead of car payments, baseball scores, haircuts, vacations, enemas, family visits. There wasn’t a real man in the whole shitload. I always got to work sick but safe.
     It was a completely self-sufficient, self-contained clothing store, factory
and retail business combined. The showroom, the finished product and the salesmen were all downstairs, and the factory was up above. The factory was a maze of catwalks and runways that even the rats couldn’t crawl, long narrow lofts with men and women sitting and working under thirty watt bulbs, squinting, treading pedals, threading needles, never looking up or speaking, bent and quiet, doing it. At one time one of my jobs in New York City had been to take bolts of fabric up to lofts like this. I would roll my hand truck in the busy street, pushing it through traffic, then into an alley behind some grimy building. There would be a dark elevator and I’d have to pull on ropes with stained round wooden spools attached. ne rope meant up, another rope signaled down. There was no light and as the elevator climbed slowly I’d watch in the dark for white numbers written on the bare walls—3, 7, 9, scrawled in chalk by some forgotten hand. I’d reach my floor, tug on another rope with my fingers and using all my strength slowly slide open the heavy old metal door, revealing row upon row of old Jewish ladies at their machines, laboring over piecework; the number one seamstress at the #1 machine, bent on maintaining her place; the number two girl at the #2 machine, ready to replace her should she falter. They never looked up or in any way acknowledged my presence as I entered.
     The packing lists were never wrong probably because the guy at the other
end was too frightened for his job to be careless. Usually he is on the seventh of thirty-six payments for his new car, his wife is taking a ceramics class on Monday night, the interest on his mortgage is eating him alive, and each one of his five kids drinks a quart of milk a day.

I got hired immediately at a fluorescent light fixture company. It was up on Alameda Street, to the north, in a cluster of warehouses. I was the shipping clerk.
Feldman was trying to collect his insurance and go bankrupt at the same time. The next morning a dignified looking man came down from the Bank of America. He told us not to build any more racks. “Just stack that shit on the floor,” was the way he put it. His name was Jennings, Curtis Jennings. Feldman owed the Bank of America a lot of money and the Bank of America wanted its money back before the business went under. . . .
    Within three days Jennings fired a man who worked in the front office
and replaced three men on the assembly line with three young Mexican girls willing to work for half the pay. He fired the janitor and, along with doing the shipping, had me driving the company truck on local deliveries.
I was in some kind of storage loft. That room had the highest ceiling I had ever seen. The ladder stood thirty-six feet high. I had always had a fear of heights. I took a new light tube and slowly mounted the ladder. I had to remind myself again, try not to think. I climbed upwards. The fluorescent tubes were about five feet long. They broke easily and were hard to handle. When I reached the top of the ladder I peered down. That was a big mistake. A dizzy spell swept over me. I was a coward. I was up against a big window on one of the upper floors. I imagined myself falling off the ladder and out through the window, down through space until I hit the street. I watched the tiny automobiles cross back and forth down in the street below me, their headlights bright in the night. Then, very slowly, I reached up and removed a burnt out fluorescent light. I replaced it with a new light. Then I climbed down, feeling more relief with each step downward. When I reached the ground I promised myself that I’d never get on that ladder again.
The brake parts man took me up a narrow stairway. George Henley was his name: George showed me my workroom, very small, dark, just one lightbulb and one tiny window that looked out over an alley. “Now,” he said, “you see these cartons. You put the brake shoes into the cartons. Like this.” Mr. Henley showed me. “We have three types of cartons, each printed differently. ne carton is for our ‘Super Durable Brake Shoe.’ The other is for our ‘Super Brake Shoe.’ And the third is for our ‘Standard Brake Shoe.’ The brake shoes are stacked right here.” “But they all look alike to me. How can I tell them apart?” “You don’t. They’re all the same. Just divide them into thirds. . . .”
I had visited the American Cancer Society earlier, as I had understood it to be free. I had lumps all over my body, dizzy spells, I was spitting blood, and

## L A G AG E , L   E  A   E , A   A  | 2 25

I had gone there only to be given an appointment for three weeks later. Now like every American boy I had always been told: catch cancer early. Then you go down to catch it early and they make you wait three weeks for an appointment. That’s the difference between what we’re told and actuality. After three weeks I went back and they told me they could give me certain tests free, but that I could pass these tests and wouldn’t really be sure that I didn’t have cancer. However, if I gave them $25 and passed that test, I could be fairly sure I didn’t have cancer. To be absolutely sure, after I had taken the $25 test, I would have to take the $75 test, and if I passed that one too, I could relax. It would mean my trouble was alcoholism or nerves or the clap. They talk real good and clear, those kittens in the white coats at the American Cancer Society, and I said, in other words, $100. Umm hum, they said, and I walked out and went on a three day toot and all the lumps vanished along with the dizzy spells and the blood spitting.
Now in those days the L.A. River was a fake—there was no water, just a wide, flat, dry cement runway. The bums lived down there by the hundreds in little cement alcoves under the bridges and overpasses. Some of them even had potted plants in front of their places. All they needed to live like kings was canned heat (Sterno) and what they picked out of the nearby garbage dump. They were tan and relaxed and most of them looked a hell of a lot healthier than the average Los Angeles business man. Those guys down there had no problems with women, income tax, landlords, burial expenses, dentists, time payments, car repairs, or with climbing into a voting booth and pulling the curtain closed.
I thought it was very nice that there were so many job openings, yet it worried me too—we’d probably be pitted against one another in some way. Survival of the fittest. There were always men looking for jobs in America. There were always all these usable bodies.
National Bakery Goods was located nearby. They gave me a white smock and a locker. They made cookies, biscuits, cupcakes and so forth. Because I had claimed two years of college on my application, I got the job as Coconut Man. The Coconut Man stood up on a perch, scooped his shovel into the shredded coconut barrel and dumped the white flakes into a machine.

7.5 Interview with Robert Greenwald
          J A
Q. Which filmmakers or thinkers have influenced your work? A. Coppola, Truffaut, Errol Morris.
Q. What inspires you? A. The chance to be part of this thing called democracy, particularly participatory democracy—the participation of people, outside the confines of the voting booth—in shaping their world for the better and in creating moments where transformational change is possible.
Q. What led you to film and activist documentaries? A. I started in theater, then moved to film/TV when I moved to Los Angeles. After achieving some success, I started thinking about what I wanted next, and I realized it was to be part of something far beyond entertainment, something transformational. The work I was proudest of having made told stories that needed to be told, gave ordinary people—viewers—a new way of looking at things and possibly gave them some new sense of their own power to make change. This was work like The Burning Bed and Steal This Movie, that told real-life stories. So when the opportunity came for me to work on a documentary, I grabbed at it. And I fell in love, instantly and deeply.
Q. How do your films address such matters as government corruption, plutonomy, equality, and so on? A. I look at all the issues we work on through the lens of personal stories. I try to tell stories that show why government corruption matters—even if you are not personally hurt by it, for example. I believe strongly that the personal aspect is the key first step—the barrier to be breached if we are to move forward in changing public policy. First you reach the audience’s heart, and then it is possible to connect with their intellect—the brain, because they are listening. Then—because you are telling the truth in a way that they are now ready to fully understand—you’ve got them. Usually, once they know the truth, they are angry—or at least motivated.
Q. What is your conception of social justice? A. Social justice is not equity of outcome but equity of opportunity. It is a system in which everyone has the same chances, regardless of who they are, where they live, how they got to this country, the color of their skin, and all

## L A G AG E , L   E  A   E , A   A  | 2 27

those other identity factors that should not determine what is possible for a child in America but fundamentally still do.
Q. How do you conceive the role of art and filmmaking in the social justice movement? A. In the long tradition of art and social justice from music to murals, through the years, art can inspire and inform. Film has a unique and critical role given the power of images and given the incredible distribution opportunities today.
Q. Are justice and fairness compatible with neoliberalism? A. I prefer to keep my focus on what can be done and not be limited by any ideology or construct. I believe, fundamentally, that things can be better and that as humans we have a moral obligation to work toward that end.
Q. Does your work envision a move toward European-style socialist democracy? Regulated capitalism? Direct forms of democracy/community decision making? A. ur work is not about creating a government structure. It is about giving people the information they need, in a way they can absorb, to understand how the structures we do have really work, like our Walmart film, or our film about war profiteering or the Koch brothers. We hope it puts a narrative structure—a hero, a villain, a quest—around some fundamental lessons in how capitalism works. From there, people can take that information and use it as a scaffolding on which to hang their own actions. The idea is to push people toward a moment of transformational change but not to dictate what the moment looks like.
Q. What kind of actions should people take? A. We never choose for people. What we do is provide a menu of actions/ groups that we have on our website. They run the gamut from social action movement building to electoral action and everything in between. We build a ladder of engagement that people can choose to climb at whatever speed they wish, or can choose to linger on near the bottom. Everyone brings different skills and passions and time and resources to the fights we are having, and all of them are valuable.
Q. How does the mass/corporate media shape the democratic process and civic engagement? A. The mass media reinforces the basic values of the existing system. ur job is to go to the darkness, to go where the questions are not being asked,

## 228 | C ApE 7

to go where the issues are not being debated, and to raise those, loudly and clearly.
Q. Is social justice possible through the formal political process and institutions? A. Through our films and campaigns we give people a range of options, so that they can make the decision . . . formal political process or on-the-ground activism, traditional institution or renegade. . . .
Q. Are there more effective means of change outside of formal political structures? If so, provide examples. A. We offer the range of opportunities, and I do not see it as our role to choose. And therefore we include a variety of ways for social change in our work and our partners. Formal political structures may work. Civic disobediences or civil resistance may work. The important thing is that proverbial tipping point, the moment at which the unacceptable in theory becomes truly unacceptable in practice. We want to help people reach that point—enough people to matter.
Q. How does your work prompt change? How is film a medium for social justice in general? A. Films support social change by providing both factual information and a story that makes that information meaningful, palatable, relatable. It is the spoonful of sugar that helps hard lessons go down, get absorbed, and eventually spark emotion that in turn sparks activism.
Q. How does film surpass other media such as blogs, literature, academic books, and so on? What are the limitations of film? A. Film is visual and therefore visceral. This is a big plus. thers can be more intellectually rigorous, but our work can point people toward those platforms, get them to open the books, read the blogs, and continue to learn. Film can be the spark.
Q. What challenges do you face in your work? A. Funding. Reaching an audience in a world where hundreds of millions of dollars are routinely spent reaching an audience.
Q. What is your experience with financing and distribution channels? Do you engage in crowdsourcing, direct sales, and so on? What are the advantages and disadvantages of these methods for activists? A. We were crowdsourcing before it had a name. In fact, we were the first to use it to fund-raise a film. It is liberating not to have to rely on gatekeepers

either for funding or for distribution. It is also an insane amount of work and effort to figure out distribution in a world where it is changing every minute. For example, how does Snapchat work to advance social messages? What is a platform that is going to actually attract thoughtful interaction, and what is, basically, a toy? It is a daily adventure. And to raise funds in a highly competitive universe gets more and more challenging.
Q. What is your view of technology? Is it a means of greater social control or a potential tool of empowerment and liberation? A. Technology itself is neutral. How you use it is what matters. We are able to do the work we do because of technology—because of the ability to film and edit but also because of the ability to share that work in a way that was inconceivable when I started in film.
Q. Which of your works are you most proud of and why? A. I am always most proud of my latest. In this case, Making a Killing: Guns, Greed, and the NRA.
Q. What are your most significant accomplishments as an activist? A. Changing the way people feel and think about the Iraq war, Fox, Walmart, the Koch brothers, the Afghanistan war, whistleblowers, drones, and soon the NRA. . . . The first step is changing the thinking through the heart, and then comes action and the transformation.
Q. What is your advice to young people who want social change? How can people get involved with your organization? A. If you want social change, make it happen. No one can do it for you. Take risks. There are so many different ways. To get involved with Brave New Films, go to our website, look around, and figure out how you want to be involved. Volunteer, or screen one of our films at school or church, or take one of our films to a local newspaper, or use a film to show to elected officials. Tweet it, talk about it, share it on social media and at cocktail parties. Learn things. Know things. Then use that knowledge to hold people accountable.

    ocial ecoloy is based on he convicion ha nearly all of our presen ecoS loical problems oriinae in deep-seaed social problems. I follows, from
his view, ha hese ecoloical problems canno be undersood, le alone solved, wihou a careful undersandin of our exisin sociey and he irraionaliies ha dominae i. To make his poin more concree: economic, ehnic, culural, and ender conflics, amon many ohers, lie a he core of he mos serious ecoloical dislocaions we face oday—apar, o be sure, from hose ha are produced by naural caasrophes. . . . The massive oil spills ha have occurred over he pas wo decades, he exensive deforesa- ion of ropical fores and manificen ancien rees in emperae areas, and vas hydroelecric projecs ha flood places where people live, o cie only a few problems, are soberin reminders ha he real baleround on which he ecoloical fuure of he plane will be decided is clearly a social one, par- icularly beween corporae power and he lon-rane ineress of humaniy as a whole. . . .
     Indeed, o separae ecoloical problems from social problems—or even
o play down or ive only oken reconiion o heir crucial relaionship— would be o rossly misconsrue he sources of he rowin environmenal crisis. In effec, he way human beins deal wih each oher as social beins is crucial o addressin he ecoloical crisis. Unless we clearly reconize his, we will fail o see ha he hierarchical menaliy and class relaionships ha so horouhly permeae sociey are wha has iven rise o he very idea of dominain he naural world.

     Unless we realize ha he presen marke sociey, srucured around he
brually compeiive imperaive of “row or die,” is a horouhly impersonal, self-operain mechanism, we will falsely end o blame oher phenomena— such as echnoloy or populaion rowh—for rowin environmenal dislocaions. We will inore heir root causes, such as rade for profi, indusrial expansion for is own sake, and he idenificaion of proress wih corporae self-ineres. In shor, we will end o focus on he symptoms of a rim social paholoy raher han on he paholoy iself, and our effors will be direced oward limied oals whose aainmen is more cosmeic han curaive. . . .
     A a ime when a blind social mechanism—he marke—is urnin soil

We mus face he fac ha economic rowh, ender oppressions, and ehnic dominaion—no o speak of corporae, sae, and bureaucraic incursions on human well-bein—are much more capable of shapin he fuure of he naural world han are privaisic forms of spiriual self-redempion. These forms of dominaion mus be confroned by collec- ive acion and by major social movemens ha challene he social sources of he ecoloical crisis, no simply by personalisic forms of consumpion and invesmen ha ofen o under he oxymoronic rubric of “reen capialism.” The presen hihly co-opaive sociey is only oo eaer o find new means of commercial arandizemen and o add ecoloical verbiae o is adverisin and cusomer relaions effors. . . .
     Social ecoloy calls on us o see ha he naural world and he social are
inerlinked by evoluion ino one naure ha consiss of wo differeniaions: firs or bioic naure, and second or social naure. Social naure and bioic naure share an evoluionary poenial for reaer subjeciviy and flexibiliy. Second naure is he way in which human beins, as flexible, hihly inelli- en primaes, inhabi and aler he naural world. Tha is o say, people creae an environmen ha is mos suiable for heir mode of exisence. In his respec, second naure is no differen from he environmen ha every animal, dependin on is abiliies, parially creaes as well as primarily adaps o—he biophysical circumsances or ecocommuniy in which i mus live. . . .
     Human beins, emerin from an oranic evoluionary process, iniiae,
by he sheer force of heir bioloical and survival needs, a social evoluionary developmen ha clearly involves heir oranic evoluionary process.

sible for hem o enae no only in social life bu in social developmen. . . . The exen o which hey conribue o bioic evoluion or abor i and he damae hey inflic on he plane as a whole lie a he very hear of he modern ecoloical crisis. . . .
    How, hen, did he social emere from he bioloical? . . . The lineae or
blood ie in early prehisory obviously formed he oranic basis of he family. Indeed, i joined oeher roups of families ino bands, clans, and ribes, hrouh eiher inermarriae or ficive forms of descen, hereby formin he readies social horizon of our ancesors. . . .
    Hierarchy in is earlies forms was probably no marked by he harsh
qualiies i has acquired over hisory. Elders, a he very beinnins of eron- ocracy, were no only respeced for heir wisdom bu ofen beloved of he youn, wih affecion ha was ofen reciprocaed in kind. We can probably accoun for he increasin harshness of laer eronocracies by supposin ha he elderly, burdened by heir failin physical powers and dependen on heir communiy’s oodwill, were more vulnerable o abandonmen in periods of maerial wan han any oher par of he populaion. . . .
    Iniially, he emerence of paricenriciy may have been a useful adjunc
o a life deeply rooed in he primordial naural world; prelierae and early aboriinal socieies were essenially small domesic communiies in which he auhenic cener of maerial life was he home, no he “men’s house” so widely presen in laer, more elaborae ribal socieies. . . . The auhoriy and preroaive of he male are he produc of a lon, ofen subly neoiaed developmen in which he male fraerniy edes ou he female sororiy by virue of he former’s rowin “civil” responsibiliies. Increasin populaion, maraudin bands of ousiders whose miraions may be induced by drouh or oher unfavorable condiions, and vendeas of one kind or anoher, o cie common causes of hosiliy or war, creae a new “civil” sphere side by side wih woman’s domesic sphere, and he former radually encroaches on he laer. Wih he appearance of cale-drawn plow ariculure, he male, who is he “maser of he beass,” beins o invade he horiculural sphere of woman, whose primacy as he food culivaor and food aherer ives her culural preeminence in he communiy’s inernal life, slowly diluin her preeminence. Warrior socieies and chiefdoms carry he momenum of male dominance o he level of a new maerial and culural dispensaion. Male dominance becomes exremely acive and ulimaely yields a world in which male elies dominae no only women bu also, in he form of classes, oher men.
    The causes of he emerence of hierarchy are ransparen enouh: he
infirmiies of ae, increasin populaion numbers, naural disasers, echnoloical chanes ha privileed aciviies of hunin and animal husbandry

## 2 36 | Ch pe 8

over horiculural responsibiliies, he rowh of civil sociey, and he spread of warfare. All served o enhance he male’s sandin a he expense of he female’s.
    I mus be emphasized ha hierarchical dominaion, however coercive i
may be, is no he same hin as class exploiaion. . . . The respec accorded o many chiefs is earned, no by hoardin surpluses as a source of power bu by disposin of hem as evidence of enerosiy. By conras, classes end o operae alon differen lines. In class socieies power is usually ained by he acquisiion of wealh, no by is disposal; rulership is uaraneed by ourih physical coercion, no simply by persuasion; and he sae is he ulimae uaranor of auhoriy. . . .
    Of primary imporance amon early cusoms was he principle of he irreducible minimum (o use Paul Radin’s expression), he shared noion ha
all members of he same communiy are eniled o he means of life, irrespecive of he amoun of work hey perform. To deny anyone food, sheler, and he basic means of life because of heir infirmiies or even heir frivolous behavior would have been seen as a heinous denial of he very rih o live. Nor were he basic resources needed o susain he communiy ever permi- ed o be privaely owned; overridin individualisic conrol was he broader principle of usufruc—he noion ha he means of life ha were no bein used by one roup could be used, as needed, by anoher. Thus unused land, orchards, and even ools and weapons, if lef idle, were ofen a he disposi- ion of anyone in he communiy who needed hem. Lasly, cusom fosered he pracice of muual aid, he raher sensible cooperaive sharin of hins and labor, so ha an individual or family in sraiened circumsances could expec o be helped by ohers. Taken as a whole, hese cusoms became so sedimened ino oranic sociey ha hey persised lon afer hierarchy became oppressive and class sociey became predominan. . . .
    Wih he rise of hierarchy and dominaion, . . . he seeds were planed
for he belief ha firs naure exiss no only as a world ha is increasinly disinuishable from he communiy bu as one ha is hierarchically oranized and can be dominaed by human beins. . . . The idea of dominain naure has a hisory ha is almos as old as ha of hierarchy iself. Already in he Gilamesh epic of Mesopoamia, a drama whose wrien form daes back some four housand years, he hero defies he deiies and cus down heir sacred rees in his ques for immoraliy. The Odyssey is a vas raveloue of he Greek warrior, more canny han heroic, who in his wanderins essenially subdues he naure deiies ha he Hellenic world had inheried form is less well-known precursors (ironically, he dark pre-Olympian world ha has been revived by purveyors of eco-mysicism and spiriualism).

    However roublin he ills produced by second naure, he cusoms of
he irreducible minimum, usufruc, and muual aid canno be inored in any accoun of anhropoloy and hisory. These cusoms persised well ino hisorical imes and surfaced someimes explosively in massive popular uprisins, from revols in ancien Sumer o he presen ime. Many of hose revols demanded he recovery of carin and communisic values, a imes when hese were comin under he onslauh of eliis and class oppression. Indeed, despie he armies ha roamed he landscape of warrin areas, he ax aherers who plundered ordinary villae peoples, and he daily abuses ha overseers infliced on peasans and workers, communiy life sill persised and reained many of he cherished values of a more ealiarian pas. Neiher ancien despos nor feudal lords could fully oblierae hem in peasan villaes and in he owns wih independen craf associaions. . . .
    Jus as hierarchies and class srucures had acquired momenum and permeaed much of sociey, so oo he marke bean o acquire a life of is own
and exended is reach beyond a few limied reions ino he dephs of vas coninens. Where exchane had once been primarily a means o provide for essenial needs, limied by uilds or by moral and reliious resricions, lon- disance rade subvered hose limis. No only did rade place a hih premium on echniques for increasin producion; i also became he proenior of new needs, many of hem wholly arificial, and ave a remendous impeus o consumpion and he rowh of capial. Firs in norhern Ialy and he European lowlands, and laer—and mos decisively—in Enland durin he seveneenh and eiheenh cenuries, he producion of oods exclusively for sale and profi (he producion of he capialisic commodiy) rapidly swep aside all culural and social barriers o marke rowh.

prevails here, is he need of an enerprise o row in order o avoid perishin a he hands of is savae rivals. Imporan as even reed may be as a moiva- in force, sheer survival requires ha he enrepreneur mus expand his or her producive apparaus in order o remain ahead of ohers. Each capialis, in shor, mus ry o devour his or her rivals—or else be devoured by hem. The key o his law of life—o survival—is expansion, and he ques for ever- reaer profis, o be invesed, in urn, in sill furher expansion. Indeed, he noion of proress, once rearded as faih in he evoluion of reaer human cooperaion and care, is now idenified wih ever reaer compeiion and reckless economic rowh. . . .
    However ecoloically well-meanin an enrepreneur may be, he harsh
fac is ha his or her very survival in he markeplace precludes he developmen of a meaninful ecoloical orienaion. The adopion of ecoloically sound pracices places a morally concerned enrepreneur a a srikin and indeed faal disadvanae in a compeiive relaionship wih a rival—who, operain wihou ecoloical uidelines and moral consrains, produces cheap commodiies a lower coss and reaps hiher profis for furher capial expansion. The markeplace has is own law of survival: only he mos unscrupulous can rise o he op of ha compeiive srule.
    Indeed, o he exen ha environmenal movemens and ideoloies
merely moralize abou he wickedness of our ani-ecoloical sociey and call for chanes in personal lifesyles and aiudes, hey obscure he need for concered social acion and end o deflec he srule for far-reachin social chane. Meanwhile, corporaions are skillfully manipulain his popular desire for personal ecoloically sound pracices by culivain ecoloical miraes. . . . The poin social ecoloy emphasizes is no ha moral or spiriual persuasion and renewal are meaninless or unnecessary; hey are necessary and can be educaional.
    Bu modern capialism is srucurally amoral and hence impervious o

     Social ecoloy is an appeal for moral reeneraion bu, and above all, for
social reconsrucion alon ecoloical lines. I seeks o redress he ecoloical abuses ha he prevailin sociey has infliced on he naural world by oin o he srucural as well as he subjecive sources of noions like he domina- ion of firs naure.

     I advances an ehics of complemenariy in which human beins play a

     Social ecoloy, in effec, reconizes ha—like i or no—he fuure of life
on his plane pivos on he fuure of sociey. I conends ha evoluion, boh in firs naure and in second, is no ye complee.

I am very mindful ha Ahenian poliics, even in is mos democraic periods, was marred by he exisence of slavery and pariarchy, and by he exclusion of he sraner from public life. In his respec, o be sure, i differed very lile from mos of he oher ancien Medierranean civilizaions—and cerainly ancien Asian ones—of he ime.

Eiher direcly or indirecly, he Ahenian democracy inspired laer, more all-encompassin direc democracies, such as many medieval European owns, he lile-known Parisian secions (or neihborhood assemblies) of 1793 ha propelled he French Revoluion in a hihly radical direcion, and more indirecly, New Enland own meeins and oher, more recen aemps a civic self-overnance.
    Any self-manaed communiy, however, ha ries o live in isolaion and

This insiuional process could be iniiaed in he neihborhoods of ian ciies as well as in neworks of small owns. . . .

economic crisis canno be resolved wihou an equally radical ransformaion of capialis producive forces. This means ha soluions o he ecoloical crisis presuppose soluions o he economic crisis and vice versa. Anoher a priori of red reen poliics is ha boh ses of soluions presuppose an ecoloical socialism.
     The problem is ha socialism in heory and pracice has been declared
“dead on arrival.” In heory, pos-Marxis heoriss of radical democracy are complein wha hey hink is he final auopsy of socialism. In pracice, in he Norh, socialism has been banalized ino a species of welfare capialism. In Easern Europe, he momen for democraic socialism seems o have been missed over weny years ao and socialism is bein overhrown. In he Souh, mos socialis counries are inroducin marke incenives, reformin heir ax srucures, and akin oher measures ha hey hope will enable hem o find heir niches in he world marke. Everywhere marke economy and liberal democraic ideas on he rih, and radical democraic ideas on he Lef, seem o be defeain socialism and socialis ideas.
     Meanwhile, a powerful new force in world poliics has appeared, an ecoloy or reen movemen ha pus he earh firs and akes he preservaion of
he ecoloical ineriy of he plane as he primary issue.
     The simulaneous rise of he free marke and he reens oeher wih
he decline of socialism suess ha capialism has an ally in is war aains socialism. This urns ou o be he case. Many or mos reens dismiss socialism as irrelevan. Some or many reens aack i as danerous. Especially are hey quick o condemn hose whom hey accuse of ryin o appropriae ecoloy for Marxism. The famous reen sloan, “neiher lef nor rih, bu ou fron,” speaks for iself.
     Bu mos reens are no friends of capialism, eiher, as he reen sloan
makes clear. The quesion hen arises, who or wha are he reens allied wih? The crude answer is, he small farmers and independen business—i.e., hose who used o be called he “peasanry” and “pey boureoisie”; “liveable ci- ies” visionaries and planners; “small is beauiful” echnocras; and arisans, cooperaives, and ohers enaed in ecoloically friendly producion. In he Souh, reens ypically suppor decenralized producion oranized wihin villae communal poliics; in he Norh, reens are idenified wih municipal and local poliics of all ypes.
     By way of conras, mainsream environmenaliss mih be called
“ficiious reens.” These environmenaliss suppor environmenal reula- ions consisen wih profiabiliy and he expansion of lobal capialism, such as resource conservaion for lon-run profiabiliy and profi-oriened reulaion or aboliion of polluion. They are ypically allied wih naional and inernaional ineress. In he Unied Saes, hey are environmenal re-

formers, lobbyiss, lawyers, and ohers associaed wih he famous Group of Ten.
    As for ecoloy, everywhere i is a leas ined wih populism, a poliics
of resenmen aains no only bi corporaions and he naional sae and cenral plannin bu also aains environmenalism.
    Ecoloy (in he presen usae) is hus associaed wih localism, which
has always been opposed o he cenralizin powers of capialism. If we pu wo and wo oeher, we can conclude ha ecoloy and localism in all of heir rich varieies have combined o oppose boh capialism and socialism. Localism uses he medium or vehicle of ecoloy and vice versa. They are boh he conen and conex of one anoher. Decenralism is an expression of a cerain ype of social relaionship, a cerain social relaion of producion hisorically associaed wih small-scale enerprise. Ecoloy is an expression of a cerain ype of relaionship beween human beins and naure—a relaionship which sresses he ineriy of local and reional eco-sysems. Toeher ecoloy and localism consiue he mos visible poliical and economic cri- ique of capialism (and sae socialism) oday.
    Besides he fac ha boh ecoloy and localism oppose capial and he na-
ional sae, here are wo main reasons why hey appear o be naural allies. Firs, ecoloy sresses he sie specificiy of he inerchane beween human maerial aciviy and naure, and hence opposes boh he absrac valuaion of naure made by capial and he idea of cenral plannin of producion, and cenralis approaches o lobal issues enerally. The conceps of sie specificiy of ecoloy, local subsisence or semi-auarkic economy, communal self-help principles, and direc forms of democracy all seem o be hihly conruen.
    Second, he socialis concep of he “masses” has been deconsruced and
replaced by a new “poliics of ideniy” in which culural facors are iven he place of honor. The idea of he specificiy of culural ideniies seems o meld easily wih he sie specificiy of ecoloy in he conex of a concep of social labor defined in narrow, eoraphic erms. The mos dramaic examples oday are he srules of indienous peoples o keep boh heir culures and subsisence-ype economies inac. In his case, he srule o save local culures and local eco-sysems urns ou o be wo differen sides of he same fih.
    For heir par, mos of he radiional Lef, as well as he unions, remain
focused on enhanced produciviy, rowh, and inernaional compeiiveness—i.e., jobs and waes, or more wae labor—no o abolish exploiaion bu o be exploied less. This par of he Lef does no wan o be cauh any more defendin any policies which can be idenified wih “economic auseriy” or policies which labor leaders and ohers hink would endaner

pas economic ains won by he workin class (alhouh union and worker srules for healhy and safe condiions inside and ouside of he workplace obviously connec in posiive ways wih broader ecoloical srules). Mos of hose who oppose more rowh and developmen are mainsream environmenaliss from he urban middle classes who have he consumer oods ha hey wan and also have he ime and knowlede o oppose ecoloically danerous policies and pracices. I would appear, herefore, ha any effor o find a place for he workin class in his equaion—i.e., any aemp o marry socialism and ecoloy—is doomed from he sar.
     Bu jus because somehin has never happened does no mean ha i
canno happen.
     Or, o pu he poin differenly, here are ood reasons o believe ha
world capialism iself has creaed he condiions for an ecoloical socialis movemen. These reasons can be colleced under wo eneral headins. The firs perains o he causes and effecs of he world economic and ecoloical crisis from he mid-1970s o he presen. The second perains o he naure of he key ecoloical issues, mos of which are naional and inernaional, as well as local, issues.
     Firs, he vialiy of Wesern capialism since World War II has been
based on he massive exernalizaion of social and ecoloical coss of produc- ion. Since he slowdown of world economic rowh in he mid-1970s, he concerns of boh socialism and ecoloy have become more pressin han ever before in hisory. The accumulaion of lobal capial hrouh he modern crisis has produced even more devasain effecs no only on wealh and income disribuion, norms of social jusice, and reamen of minori- ies bu also on he environmen. An “acceleraed imbalance of (humanized) naure” is a phrase ha nealy sums his up. Socially, he crisis has led o more wrenchin povery and violence, risin misery in all pars of he world, especially he Souh, and, environmenally, oxificaion of whole reions, he producion of drouh, he hinnin of he ozone layer, he reenhouse effec, and he wiherin away of rain foress and wildlife. The issues of economic and social jusice and ecoloical jusice have surfaced as in no oher period in hisory. I is increasinly clear ha hey are, in fac, wo sides of he same hisorical process.
     Given he relaively slow rae of rowh of worldwide marke demand
since he mid-1970s, capialis enerprises have been less able o defend or resore profis by expandin heir markes and sellin more commodiies in boomin markes. Insead, lobal capialism has aemped o rescue iself from is deepenin crisis by cuin coss, by raisin he rae of exploiaion of labor, and by deplein and exhausin resources. This “economic resrucurin” is a wo-sided process.

## e C o o G y | 245

     Cos cuin has led bi and small capials alike o exernalize more social
and environmenal coss, or o pay less aenion o he lobal environmen, polluion, depleion of resources, worker healh and safey, and produc safey (meanwhile, increasin efficiency in enery and raw maerial use in he fac- ories). The modern ecoloical crisis is aravaed and deepened as a resul of he way ha capialism has reoranized iself o e hrouh is laes economic crisis.
     In addiion, new and deeper inequaliies in he disribuion of wealh and
income are he resul of a worldwide increase in he rae of exploiaion of labor. In he Unied Saes durin he 1980s, for example, propery income increased hree imes as fas as wae and salary income. Hiher raes of exploiaion have also depended on he abiliy o abuse undocumened workers and se back labor unions, social democraic paries, and srules for social jusice enerally, especially in he Souh. I is no acciden ha in hose pars of he world where ecoloical deradaion is reaes—Cenral America, for example—here is reaer povery and heihened class srules. The feminizaion of povery is also a par of his rend of ecoloical desrucion. I is he workin class, oppressed minoriies, women, and he rural and urban poor worldwide who suffer mos from boh economic and ecoloical exploia- ion. The burden of ecoloical desrucion falls disproporionaely on hese roups.
     Crisis-ridden and crisis-dependen capialism has forced he radiional
issues of socialism and he relaively new issues (“new” in erms of public awareness) of ecoloy o he op of he poliical aenda. Capialism iself urns ou o be a kind of marriae broker beween socialism and ecoloy, or, o be more cauious, if here is no ye a prospec for marriae, here are a leas openins for an enaemen.
     Second, he vas majoriy of economic and social and ecoloical problems
worldwide canno be adequaely addressed a he local level. I is rue ha he deradaion of local ecoloical sysems ofen do have local soluions in erms of prevenion and delinkin (alhouh less so in erms of social ransforma- ion). Hence i comes as no surprise o find sron connecions beween he revival of municipal and villae poliics and local ecoloical desrucion.

jus for he presen eneraion bu especially for fuure eneraions. The availabiliy of oher naural resources, such as waer, is mainly a reional issue, bu in many pars of he lobe i is a naional or inernaional issue. The same is rue of he desrucion of foress. Or ake he problem of soil depleion, which seems o be local or sie specific. Insofar as here are problems of soil quaniy and qualiy, or waer quaniy or qualiy, in he bi food-exporin counries, such as he Unied Saes, he food-imporin counries are also effeced.

Norh Sea polluion, acid rain, ozone depleion, and lobal warmin are obvious examples.
    Furhermore, if we broaden he concep of ecoloy o include urban environmens, or wha [Karl] Marx called “eneral, communal condiions of

    If we broaden he concep of ecoloy even more o include he relaionship beween human healh and well-bein and environmenal facors (or

     If we assume ha ecoloy and socialism presuppose one anoher, he loical quesion is why haven’ hey oen oeher before now? Why is Marxism especially rearded as unfriendly o ecoloy and vice versa? To pu he
quesion anoher way, where did socialism o wron, ecoloically speakin?
     Hisorical maerialism is flawed in wo bi ways. Marx ended o absrac
his discussions of social labor—i.e., he divisions of labor, from boh culure and naure. A rich concep of social labor which includes boh sociey’s cul- ure and naure’s economy canno be found in Marx or radiional hisorical maerialism.
     The firs flaw is ha he radiional concepion of he producive forces
inores or plays down he fac ha hese forces are social in naure, and include he mode of cooperaion, which is deeply inscribed by paricular culural norms and values.
     The second flaw is ha he radiional concepion of he producive
forces also plays down or inores he fac ha hese forces are naural as well as social in characer.
     I is worh recallin ha [Friedrich] Enels himself called Marxism he
“maerialis concepion of hisory,” where “hisory” is he noun and “maerialis” is he modifier. Marxiss know he expression “in maerial life social relaions beween people are produced and reproduced” by hear, and much less well he expression “in social life he maerial relaions beween people and naure are produced and reproduced.” Marxiss are very familiar wih he “labor process” in which human beins are acive aens, and much less familiar wih he “waiin process” or “endin process” characerisic of a- riculure, foresry, and oher naure-based aciviies in which human beins are more passive parners and, more enerally, where boh paries are “acive” in complex, ineracive ways.
     Marx consanly hammered away on he heme ha he maerial aciviy
of human beins is wo-sided—i.e., a social relaionship as well as a maerial relaionship—in oher words, ha capialis producion produced and reproduced a specific mode of cooperaion and exploiaion and a paricular class srucure as well as he maerial basis of sociey. Bu in his deermina- ion o show ha maerial life is also social life, Marx ended o nelec he opposie and equally imporan fac ha social life is also maerial life. To pu he same poin differenly, in he formulaion “maerial life deermines consciousness,” Marx sressed ha since maerial life is socially oranized, he social relaionships of producion deermine consciousness. He played

down he equally rue fac ha since maerial life is also he inerchane be- ween human beins and naure, hese maerial or naural relaionships also deermine consciousness. These poins have been made in weak and sron ways by a number of people, alhouh hey have never been ineraed and developed ino a revised version of he maerialis concepion of hisory.
     I has also been suesed why Marx played up hisory (albei o he exclusion of culure) and played down naure. The reason is ha he problem
facin Marx in his ime was o show ha capialis propery relaionships were hisorical, no naural. Bu so inen was Marx o criicize hose who nauralized and hence reified capialis producion relaionships, compei- ion, he world marke, ec., ha he foro or downplayed he fac ha he developmen of human-made forms of “second naure” does no make naure any less naural. This was he price he paid for inverin [Ludwi] Feuerbach’s passive maerialism and [G.W.F.] Heel’s acive idealism ino his own brand of acive maerialism. As Kae Soper has wrien, “he fac is ha in is zeal o escape he chare of bioloical reducionism, Marxism has ended o fall prey o an aniehical form of reducionism, which in aruin he dominance of social over naural facors lierally spiris he bioloical ou of exisence aloeher.” Soper hen calls for a “social bioloy.” We can equally call for a “social chemisry,” “social hydroloy,” and so on, ha is, a “social ecoloy,” which for socialiss means “socialis ecoloy.”
     The reens are forcin he reds o pay close aenion o he maerial
inerchanes beween people and naure and o he eneral issue of bioloical exploiaion, includin he bioloical exploiaion of labor, and also o adop an ecoloical sensibiliy. Some reds have been ryin o each he reens o pay closer aenion o capialis producion relaionships, compeiion, he world marke, ec.—o sensiize he reens o he exploiaion of labor and he hemes of economic crisis and social labor. And feminiss have been eachin boh reens and reds o pay aenion o he sphere of reproducion and women’s labor.
     To sublae socialism and ecoloy does no mean in he firs insance
definin a new caeory which conains elemens of boh socialism and ecoloy bu which is in fac neiher. Wha needs o be sublaed poliically is localism (or decenralism) and cenralism—i.e., self-deerminaion and he overall plannin, coordinaion, and conrol of producion. To circle back o he main heme, localism per se won’ work poliically and cenralism has self-desruced. To abolish he sae will no work; o rely on he liberal democraic sae in which “democracy” has merely a procedural or formal meanin will no work, eiher. The only poliical form ha mih work, ha mih be eminenly suied o boh ecoloical problems of sie specificiy and

lobal issues, is a democraic sae—a sae in which he adminisraion of he division of social labor is democraically oranized.
     Finally, he only ecological form ha mih work is a sublaion of wo
kinds of ecoloy, he “social bioloy” of he coasal plain, he plaeau, he local hydroloical cycle, ec., and he enery economics, he reional and inernaional “social climaoloy,” ec., of he lobe—ha is, in eneral, he sublaion of naure’s economy defined in local, reional, and inernaional erms. To pu he conclusion somewha differenly, we need “socialism” at least o make he social relaions of producion ransparen, o end he rule of he marke and commodiy feishism, and o end he exploiaion of human beins by oher human beins; we need “ecoloy” at least o make he social producive forces ransparen, o end he deradaion and desrucion of he earh.

     I is no small irony ha he milians of Empire sand exposed for he incomprehension of he rajecory of moderniy by one of heir opposie number, Oswald Spenler. As naionalis and reacionary ha Spenler was, The
Decline of the West is he rea maserwork of world hisory, and his rasp of Wesern civilizaion’s inner loic is uncanny in is prescience.
     Especially relevan here are Spenler’s judmens, so many decades ao,
concernin echnoloical developmen and is social, culural, and environmenal impacs. He saw ha he dynamic, promehean (“Fausian”) naure of lobal civilizaion becomes fully realized as self-desrucive mass sociey and equally calamious modern echnoloy. The subjuaion of naure leads inelucably o is desrucion, and o he desrucion of civilizaion. “An arificial world is permeain and poisonin he naural. The Civilizaion iself has become a machine ha does, or ries o do everyhin in mechanical erms.” Civilized man is a “pey creaor aains Naure.” “This revoluionary in he world of life . . . has become he slave of his creaure. The Cul- ure, he areae of arificial, personal, self-made life-forms, develops ino a close-barred cae.”
     Whereas Marx viewed indusrial civilizaion as boh reason incarnae
and a permanen achievemen, Spenler saw i as ulimaely incompaible wih is physical environmen, and herefore suicidally ransiory. “Hiher Man is a raedy. Wih his raves he leaves behind he earh a balefield and a waseland. He has drawn plan and animal, he sea and mounain ino his decline. He has pained he face of he world wih blood, deformed and muilaed i.” Spenler undersood ha “he hisory of his echnics is fas drawin o is ineviable close.”
     Theodor Adorno seemed o concur wih elemens of Spenler’s hinkin:
“Wha can oppose he decline of he wes is no a resurreced culure bu he uopia ha is silenly conained in he imae of is decline.” Adorno and Max Horkheimer’s Dialectic of Enlightenment  has a criique of civilizaion a is core, wih is focal imae of Odysseus forcibly repressin he Sirens’ son of eros. Dialectic’s cenral hesis is ha “he hisory of civilizaion is . . . he hisory of renunciaion.” As Albrech Wellmer summed i up, “Dialectic of Enlightenment is he heory of an irredeemably darkened moderniy.” This perspecive, now coninually aumened by confirmin daa, ends o render irrelevan boh sources of heory and he loic of proress. If here is no escape from a condiion we can undersand all oo well, wha more is here o say?
     Herber Marcuse ried o lay ou an escape roue in Eros and Civilization by aempin o uncouple civilizaion from moderniy. To preserve
he “ains” of moderniy, he soluion is a “non-repressive” civilizaion. Marcuse would dispense wih “surplus repression,” implyin ha repression iself

is indispensable. Since moderniy depends on producion, iself a repressive insiuion, redefinin work as free play can salvae boh moderniy and civilizaion. I find his an implausible, even desperae defense of civilizaion. Marcuse fails o refue Freud’s view ha civilizaion canno be reformed.
     Simund Freud arued in Civilization and Its Discontents ha nonrepressive civilizaion is impossible, because he foundaion of civilizaion
is a forcible ban on insincual freedom and eros. To inroduce work and culure, he ban mus be permanenly imposed. Since his repression and is consan mainenance are essenial o civilizaion, universal civilizaion brins universal neurosis. Émile Durkheim had already noed ha as humankind “advances” wih civilizaion and he division of labor, “he eneral happiness of sociey is decreasin.”
     As a ood boureois, Freud jusified civilizaion on he rounds ha work
and culure are necessary and ha civilizaion enables humans o survive on a hosile plane. “The principal ask of civilizaion, is acual raison d’ere, is o defend us aains naure.” And furher, “Bu how unraeful, how shor- sihed afer all o srive for he aboliion of civilizaion! Wha would hen remain would be a sae of naure, and ha would be far harder o bear.”
     Possibly civilizaion’s mos fundamenal ideoloical underpinnin is
Thomas Hobbes’s characerizaion of he precivilized sae of naure as “nasy, bruish, and shor.” Freud subscribed o his view, of course, as did Adorno and Horkheimer.
     Since he mid-1960s here has been a paradim shif in how anhropolo-
iss undersand prehisory, wih profound implicaions for heory. Based on a solid body of archaeoloical and ehnoraphic research, mainsream anhropoloy has abandoned he Hobbesian hypohesis. Life before or ou- side civilizaion is now defined more specifically as social exisence prior o domesicaion of animals and plans. Mounin evidence demonsraes ha before he Neolihic shif from a forain or aherer-huner mode of exis- ence o an ariculural lifeway, mos people had ample free ime, considerable ender auonomy or equaliy, an ehos of ealiarianism and sharin, and no oranized violence.
     A (misleadinly named) “Man he Huner” conference a he Universiy
of Chicao in 1966 launched he reversal of he Hobbesian view, which for cenuries had provided ready jusificaion for all he repressive insiuions of a complex, imperializin Wesern culure. Supporin evidence for he new paradim has come forh from archaeoloiss and anhropoloiss such as Marshall Sahlins, Richard B.

GRoup ConfLICt nd tRuCtuR ChnG Having now aembled the element of a theory of cla conflict, it i or tak, in conclion, to ecify how trctre change are broght abot by cla conflict and nder which ecific condition articlar mode of trctre change mt be exected.
     [There are] at leat three mode of trctre change, each of which reqire ome comment. A firt mode of change, in thi ene, conit in the
total (or near-total) exchange of the eronnel of oition of domination in an aociation. Thi i clearly the mot dden tye of trctre change. Generally eaking, total exchange of rling eronnel might alo be decribed a revoltionary change. It i at thi oint that the ociology of revoltion tie in with the theory of gro conflict.
     Far more freqently we enconter in hitory, and eecially in modern
hitory, a econd mode of trctre change, namely, the artial exchange of the eronnel of oition of domination. Sch artial exchange ignifie evoltionary rather than revoltionary change.
     Bt robably more imortant than either of thee i a third mode of
trctre change by cla conflict that doe not involve any exchange of er- onnel. It i oible for trctre change in direction intended by bjected gro to be inagrated withot any member of thee bjected gro enetrating into dominant oition. Thi eemingly accidental coneqence of the roce of ocial conflict occr in democratic and totalitarian contrie alike. Strange a it may initially aear that trctre change hold ever occr withot an exchange of rling eronnel, there are neverthele nmero illtration in the hitory of tate, enterrie, chrche, and other a- ociation. To be re, thi third mode of trctre change mark the lowet tye of evoltion and reqire articlar kill on the art of the rler to avoid ch reion of ooing interet a thereby to rovoke revolt; it can neverthele enable a dominant cla to maintain the legitimacy of it athority over long eriod of time.
     Poibly, thee three mode of trctre change indicate the end oint and
center of a cale that meare the ddenne of change. Partial exchange of

## 268 | Ch ptR 9

eronnel i evidently a broad category that cover the whole field between total exchange and comlete tability. However, while it may be aid that trctre change i more dden in the extent to which more eronnel i exchanged, thi doe not necearily mean that it i alo more radical. Sddenne and radicalne of trctre change are two dimenion of thi henomenon that can vary indeendently, mch a the intenity and violence of cla conflict can vary indeendently. There are examle of relatively dden change that are accomanied by bt light modification of vale and intittion, and there are examle of extremely radical, althogh comaratively low, evoltion.
    The relation between the radicalne-ddenne dimenion of trctre
change and the intenity-violence dimenion of cla conflict i more than merely logical. It may be arged that the ddenne of change varie directly with the violence of conflict. The more violent cla conflict are, the more dden are the change wroght by it likely to be. In thi ene, effective conflict reglation erve to redce the ddenne of change. Well-reglated conflict i likely to lead to very gradal change, often near the third mode ditingihed above. Conflict reglation may, in fact, contitte a machinery for forcing on dominant gro recognition of the interet of bjected gro, which are then incororated in olicy. The examle of a wage claim ettled by conciliation i a cae in oint. Uncontrolled conflict, on the other hand, alway threaten the incmbent of oition of domination in their very oeion of athority; it aim at a total exchange of leading eronnel and, in thi ene, at dden change.
    At leat in theory, there i alo a cale of the radicalne of trctre
change. However, an oerational formlation of ch a cale offer artic- lar difficltie. In general, the radicalne of trctre change i evidently a fnction of what in articlar hitorical itation rereent the tat qo. In eighteenth-centry Eroe, the eacefl tilization of nclear energy wold certainly have made for extremely radical change, both technical and ocial. In twentieth-centry Eroe, the ame roce, althogh till involving ome change, ha no really radical coneqence bt imly tie in with contining trend of rationalization, atomation, etc. Similarly—and more immediately to the oint here—change relting from conflict within the aociation of the Catholic chrch are, in mot contrie of today, far le radical than they were at earlier time. Th, the radicalne of trctre change i not merely a coneqence of the intenity of cla conflict. Within certain limit, however, thi relation doe obtain. The more trongly eole are involved in given conflict, the more far-reaching are their demand likely to be, and the more radical will be the change relting from thi conflict, irreective of the ddenne of ch change. Radicalne and ddenne of change, like intenity and violence of conflict, may coincide, bt more

often they diverge; and in any cae their divergence reent more intereting roblem of ocial analyi than their coincidence.
    In general, however, and withot loing ight of additional intervening
variable, we can rooe that different mode of trctre change co-vary with different mode of cla conflict. The more intene cla conflict i, the more radical are the change likely to be that it bring abot; the more violent cla conflict i, the more dden are trctre change relting from it likely to be. Strctre change i the final element of the theory of gro conflict nder dicion. Like all other element of thi theory, it rereent bt a egment of more inclive henomena of conflict and change. Poibly, the tyology of change introdced in the receding age i alicable alo to the coneqence of kind of conflict other than that between clae.

The firt tock market in Holland and Britain were baed mainly in trading hare of the Eat and Wet India comanie, which were both military and trading ventre.

    It i the ecret candal of caitalim that at no oint ha it been organized
rimarily arond free labor. The conqet of the America began with ma enlavement and then gradally ettled into vario form of debt eonage, African lavery, and “indentred ervice”—that i, the e of contract labor, worker who had received cah in advance and were th bond for five-, even-, or ten-year term to ay it back.

For the caitalit, thi mean the freedom of the marketlace. For mot worker, it mean free labor.

And the dominant image in the hitory of caitalim i the Englih workingman toiling in the factorie of the ind- trial revoltion, and thi image can be traced forward to Silicon Valley, with a traight line in between. All thoe million of lave and erf and coolie and debt eon diaear, or if we mt eak of them, we write them off a tem- orary bm along the road.

     When one look at the actal hitory of wage labor, even in contrie
like England, that ictre begin to melt away. In mot of medieval northern Eroe, wage labor had been mainly a lifetyle henomenon. From roghly the age of twelve or forteen to roghly twenty-eight or thirty, everyone wa exected to be emloyed a a ervant in omeone ele’ hoehold—ally on a yearly contract bai, for which they received room, board, rofeional training, and ally a wage of ome ort—ntil they accmlated enogh reorce to marry and et  a hoehold of their own. The firt thing that “roletarianization” came to mean wa that million of yong men and women acro Eroe fond themelve effectively tck in a kind of ermanent adolecence. Arentice and jorneymen cold never become “mater” and, th, never actally grow .

     Men like [Adam] Smith and [Jeremy] Bentham were idealit; even to-
ian. To ndertand the hitory of caitalim, however, we have to begin by realizing that the ictre we have in or head, of worker who dtiflly nch the clock at 8:00 .. and receive reglar remneration every Friday, on the bai of a temorary contract that either arty i free to break off at any time, began a a toian viion, wa only gradally t into effect even

in England and North America, and ha never, at any oint, been the main way of organizing rodction for the market, ever, anywhere.
     Thi i actally why Smith’ work i o imortant. He created the viion
of an imaginary world almot entirely free of debt and credit, and therefore, free of gilt and in; a world where men and women were free to imly calclate their interet in fll knowledge that everything had been rearranged by God to enre that it will erve the greater good. Sch imaginary con- trct are of core what cientit refer to a “model,” and there’ nothing intrinically wrong with them. Actally I think a fair cae can be made that we cannot think withot them. The roblem with ch model—at leat, it alway eem to haen when we model omething called “the market”—i that, once created, we have a tendency to treat them a objective realitie, or even fall down before them and tart worhiing them a god. “We mt obey the dictate of the market!”
     Marx, who knew qite a bit abot the hman tendency to fall down and
worhi or own creation, wrote Das Kapital in an attemt to demontrate that, even if we do tart from the economit’ toian viion, o long a we alo allow ome eole to control rodctive caital, and, again, leave other with nothing to ell bt their brain and bodie, the relt will be in many way barely ditingihable from lavery, and the whole ytem will eventally detroy itelf. What everyone eem to forget i the “a if” natre of hi analy- i. Marx wa well aware that there were far more bootblack, rotitte, btler, oldier, eddler, chimneywee, flower girl, treet mician, convict, nannie, and cabdriver in the London of hi day than there were factory worker. He wa never ggeting that that’ what the world wa actally like.
     In all thi, the advent of the free-floating dollar mark not a break with
the alliance of warrior and financier on which caitalim itelf wa originally fonded bt it ltimate aotheoi. Neither ha the retrn to virtal money led to a great retrn to relation of honor and trt: qite the contrary. By 1971, the change had only jt begn. The American Exre card, the firt general-roe credit card, had been invented a mere thirteen year before, and the modern national credit-card ytem had only really come into being with the advent of Via and MaterCard in 1968.

    Bt there i an even more radical and inrmontable reaon for which
the olitical meage of modernity cannot be tranlated into the langage of the latet generation, the video-electronic generation, born at the end of the 1970, and the connective generation born in the firt year of the 1990. Intergenerational tranmiion ha become imoible becae of a roblem of cognitive format and not only becae of a roblem of content. The mind of the generation that wa formed within the technical condition of video-electronic, and then that which i being formed internally to the connective condition of the net, fnction in a manner that i increaingly incomatible with the alhabetic, critical, hitorical mind—that i to ay, the mind of modern hmanity, the one that believed in the olitical oibility of chooing between alternative.
    I have alway fond the concet of generation ect. In the at ind-
trial era, the concet of ocial cla defined rocee of identification and conflict mch better. Social clae do not coincide comletely with generation, becae the formation line of ocial cla concione a throgh rocee of rodction and ditribtion of income, rather than throgh generational memberhi. In the indtrial era, generational cceion had a marginal imortance and cold neither determine effect of radical differentiation nor inflence olitically ignificant form of concione and identification. A long a olitical bjectivity wa formed internally to the ocial diviion of labor, generational bjectivity wa only a ociobiological concet, nitable for defining the hitorical characteritic of bjective concione.
    Bt the otindtrial tranformation ha confed the term of the roblem. n an objective level, ocial and economic tratification have certainly
not been leened, bt thi no longer eem in a oition to rodce deciive effect of identification on the level of concione. The fragmentation and increaing recarione of rodctive rocee ha rendered ocial identity extremely fragile, at the ame time a identity i made ever more imaginary and concione vectoral. In otmodern rocee of identification, what we are i le imortant than what we cold be, and today the formation of bjectivity ae throgh a differential branding of a generational tye that i mch more ignificant than it wa in the at.
    With the concet of generation we are making reference to a hman
togetherne that hare a temorally defined technological, cognitive, and imaginary formative environment. In the at era of modernity thi formative environment changed lowly over time, while rodctive and economic relation and the relationhi between ocial clae changed in a mch more

    At thi oint we no longer identify the concet of generation with im-
ly a biological henomenon bt rather with a technological and cognitive henomenon, the tran-bjective elf-contittion of a common horizon of concio and exeriential oibility. The tranformation of the technocognitive environment redefine the oibilitie and limit of individation.
    Becae of thi, I believe that it i neceary to identify the new form of
ocial concione beginning from generational belonging. And for thi rea- on I eak of two deciive cceive hift in a mtation that ha led to the draining of hmanitic categorie and of the erective on which modern olitic wa baed.

It i a cae of the aage that Marhall McLhan eak of in hi fndamental 1964 tdy, Understanding Media.
    McLhan look at the tranition from the alhabetic here to the

Whn th futuR bGn What haened in Italy in 1977 i difficlt to ndertand in the framework of modern olitical concet. At the time, Italy wa in a deely conflictal eriod, and a trong movement of tdent and yong roletarian had rfaced, challenging economic and tate ower.
     The year 1977 i generally recorded a a year of violence. Indeed it wa
the year that the Red Brigade tarted their crazy, bloody camaign, and the riot that exloded in the treet of Rome, Bologna, and many other town at the time were not at all eacefl meeting and friendly romenade. Bt violence wa not an ie when the movement broke ot. It became an ie when the olice reacted violently to the demontration, when the government ordered their rereion and the olice hot dead tdent in Bologna and in Rome, and elewhere.
     There wa a rage in the air. Thi wa not only becae 15 ercent of the
olation, eecially yong eole, wa nemloyed. There wa a kind of exitential rage, a wave of inbordination that wa not confined to Italy.
     Rather than foc on the violent ide of 1977, I refer to concentrate
on the heterogeneo face of the cltral roce that emerged when baby boomer all over the world were hit by the remonition that the modern horizon wa drawing to it dioltion.
     I want to talk abot the general landcae of the 1970, and it i here that
I want to itate the Italian riing. 1977 i not an Italian year: it i the year when Steve Wozniak and Steven Job created the trademark of Ale and, what i more, created the tool for reading information technology; when Alain Minc and Simon Nora wrote L’ informatisation de la societé, a text that theorize the coming dioltion of nation-tate a a relt of the olitical effect of emerging telematic.
     In that year Yri Androov, ecretary of the KGB, wrote a letter to Leonid Brezhnev, arging that the Soviet Union wa in danger of diaearance
if the ga with the United State in the field of informatic wa not bridged. It wa the year when Jean Françoi Lyotard wrote the book La condition postmoderne. The year when Charlie Chalin died; the man with the bowler hat and the cane aed away. Thi wa the year of the end of the twentieth centry: the trning oint of modernity.
     What i ecial abot the Italian itation i not the moke of the riot
and Molotov cocktail. In that exerience yo can ee both face of the changing time: the hay toian ide of creativity and the deair and hoelene, and terror.

time it aw the firt revolt of the cognitariat, the intellectal worker, and of Techniche Wienchaft Intelligenz.
     In the cltre rodced dring that year, we can ee the remonition of a
new cltral roce and a new ocial landcae. In a rhetorical way, I cold call it the firt rebellion of the new time that we are living now. Bt I cannot be re of thi, I do not know if the time we are living now will be again a time of inrrection. Maybe ye, maybe not.
     In a certain ene it cold be aid that we are witneing the realization of a

     In the very chronology of that year we can ee the hay hae, which
began in 1976 rather than in 1977. Bt in the month after the violent ri- ing in Rome and Bologna, March 1977, one can alo ee a changing erce- tion, the feeling of terror. In that tranition there i omething that totally ecae the olitical framework.

     If one look at the ocial itation in Italy in 1975–1976 there wa 15 ercent nemloyment, motly among yong eole. Since 1969 the factorie of
the northern citie had been ebllient. In Mirafiori, Alfa Romeo, Petrolchimico, the mot imortant tronghold of the working cla, yong militant organized radical atonomo trggle, often criticizing the nionit agenda and the olitical agenda of the Italian Commnit Party (PCI). The occation of Fiat Mirafioni in 1973 wa robably the mot imreive action againt caitalit rle in thoe year. The majority of the worker in the bigget factory in Italy decided to occy the lace dring a long confrontation with the owner. Fiat wa the center of economic ower, and that trggle became the ymbol of reitance of eole againt caitalit rle.
     The yong eole who had been hired in Fiat dring the revio year were
motly migrant coming from the Soth; Fiat hired yong men from Calabria, Sicilia, and from Nale. For thoe yong eole it wa difficlt to exchange the nny coat of othern Italy, the lazine, the enone of life in the Mediterranean village, with the moky, foggy, trefl life of the indtrial city.
     The occation wa a cce. The nion and the manager were forced
to negotiate on the occier’ term. After the trggle of March 1973, when

the atonomo organization of the worker decided on the occation of the factory, the director of Fiat blocked the trnover of the labor force. No more hiring.
    That year, Syria and Egyt attacked Irael on the day of Yom Kir. The
effect of the following war were reented all over the world. il rice went crazy. The Wetern economy wa hit terribly leading to receion and crii with nemloyment riing everywhere. The Italian government declared that a eriod of aterity wa neceary and that eole had to make acrifice for the ake of the economy, alarie mt tay down, and worker mt work harder.
    Following thi, ome eole in a demontration in the treet of Bologna
lanched the cry:
       Loro dicono aterity, noi diciamo dioltezza frenatezza feta.
       They say “austerity,” we answer: “ dissolution, licence, feast.”
       Un’onda di leggerezza i diffonde.
       A wave of lightness and irresponsibility.
       We do not want to ay acrifice to the God Economy. We do not

       If the economy is sick, may it crack.
    I haened to be in Trin in 1973. In that year, all over Eroe the
car manfactring factorie were wahed by a wave of ocial conflict. In Fiat Torino, el of Relheim, Volkwagen and Renalt of Billancort, a maive heaval of yong car-making worker toed the aembly line and hed modern indtrial caitalim toward it end. In the Mirafiori factory dring the day of the occation, I aw eole digied a indiani metropolitani for the firt time: yong worker, long-haired with a red carf arond their neck, laying drm in the factory ho.
    A qare filled with thoand of car reared for teting—the horn

    Thi new generation of worker did not have o mch to do with the old

     Ftrim, Srrealim, and Dadaim tried to reinvent the roce of olitical organization. Umberto Eco wrote a aer abot thi bject, with the title

Thank to the technology of the ma media, langage i becoming the main ite of ocial confrontation. Poetry (the langage that create hared world) had entered the here of ocial change.
     Thi wa the tarting oint of the creation of emio-caitalim, the new

     Here one can ee the condition of the exloion: 15 ercent nemloyment, motly yong eole, ocial conflict reading everywhere, and a

     Bt I am alo intereted in exlaining the ocial and cltral backgrond.
The general framework of the ocial tranformation wa the relationhi between yong worker refing work in the factorie, and tdent, reearcher, and intellectal laborer. “erai e tdenti niti nella lotta” wa not an emty logan, it wa a good ictre of the itation marked by the emergence of a movement of ma intellectality a a ocial actor.
     Han Jürgen Krahl, one of the leader of the tdent movement in Germany, wa the athor of a text very imortant to thoe time: Thesen Über
Technisch Wissenschaft Intelligenz. In it Krahl aid that the roblem of olitical organization wa no longer diconnected from the ocial machinery (like in the Leninit age) bt wa rooted in the elf-organization of intellectal labor. Cognitive labor wa hifting toward the center of the ocial cene.
     If we are able to connect the refal of work and techno-cientific intelligence we may dicover that intellectal labor i not labor bt freedom. The
alication of technology to atomation create the condition for a redction of working time. The relationhi between tdent and worker i baed not on ideology bt on the ndertanding of a common grond in the field of knowledge, technology, and freedom from labor.

     In the cltre of that generation of rebel who read [Martin] Heidegger

The roblem of technic i t on the table by the movement of the refal of work.

The end of ftre that the cltre of that year intited wa thi clore of the horizon of oibilitie. Thi i why the arable of 1977 i going from toian rebellion to the clear-eyed deair of imending dytoian develoment.
     The movement of 1977 roclaimed that “democracy i dying,” and it wa
acced of being antidemocratic. We were only remarking on a trend: the olitic of rereentation i working falely. Democracy i becoming more an emty rital, devoid of the ability to deliver tre alternative and tre choice.

            Had closed the work till starved they would obey
            They fought for home and right to live where they had toiled so long
            But ere the sun had set some were laid low

10.1 From Globalization to Resistance
        S L
W hat should be the principles of our common resistance to globalization?
          I am going to suggest certain principles, but I am concerned that
the moment I do so, we will become lost in a discussion of labels. So let me

## 29 4 | C h  p    10

begin in a different way by holding up as a model or mantra the activity of the resistance movement in the third society subject to NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement]—and, of course, more grievously subject to it than either the United States or Canada—namely, Mexico.
     The Zapatista movement in Chiapas seems to me extraordinary in at least
the following ways:
     Without participating in electoral politics, the Zapatistas have ended seventy-one years of uninterrupted government by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. How have they done this? One critical component is a vast
effort at popular education. Mayan peasants, who had never before left their native villages, traveled all over Mexico meeting with popular organizations such as the rebelling students at the national university.
     Of course, the Zapatistas are not nonviolent in any traditional sense. But
neither are they a traditional Latin American guerrilla movement. Without giving up either their arms or the principle of armed struggle, they have carried on for the last five years an essentially nonviolent resistance. For example, the Mexican government has sought to build roads into the Lacondón jungle that is the Zapatista stronghold. The government claimed that this was to help farmers get their produce to market. The real reason, obviously, was to be able to move soldiers and military gear into the area. At the western edge of the jungle is a village named Amadór. During the summer and fall of 1999, the soldiers seeking to build the road were met each day by a cordón (a picket line) of women from Amadór. Since many of the soldiers were indigenous, the women appealed to them to recognize their true interests and to put down their weapons. To prevent this dialogue the government played music through loudspeakers. I lost track of this encounter for about a year. Then I noticed that after Vicente Fox became president, he announced the abandonment of a number of military bases in Chiapas. The first base to be abandoned was at Amadór.
     I shall attempt to generalize from Zapatista reality by proposing the following principles:

       1. In resisting globalization, workers should rely on their own self-activity
          expressed through organizations at the base that they themselves create
          and control.
       2. We should seek to win over or neutralize the armed forces.
       3. We need to build more than organizations, more even than a movement: we need to build a community of struggle.

    In offering these words as guiding principles, I once again emphasize that
they are only words, and plead with you not to fetishize these words and not
                                 N  W MoD       of C o    C     C  oN | 295
to engage in what the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, following [Karl] Marx, called the “misplaced concreteness” of mistaking words for things.
    Finally, by way of introduction, of course, I understand that these principles will only take on life as the contradictions of capitalism provide opportunities for social transformation. Just since the first of the year, world
overcapacity in the production of steel and automobiles has resulted in two steel company bankruptcies in Youngstown, and last Tuesday’s announcement by Daimler Chrysler that it will halt promised renovation of its Windsor truck assembly plant and lay off an entire shift on July 1. The issue is not whether there will be economic instability. There will be. The issue is whether we, the movement for change, will be ready to do something with it.
f-C First, then, self-activity. The closest equivalent in a language other than English I have thus far found is the Russian word samodeyatelnost, used by [Leon] Trotsky in his youthful critique of Leninist centralism, and by Alexandra Kollontai, who used the term in the early years of the Bolshevik Revolution on behalf of the emerging women’s movement and the Workers’ Opposition. The closest synonym in English to “self-activity” is, perhaps, “participatory democracy.” But there are others: government from below, self-organization. Again, it is not the words but the thing that matters.
     I champion the idea of self-activity in contrast to the practice of national,
bureaucratic, top-down trade unions. National trade unions, as they exist in the United States and Canada; as they existed in Great Britain, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe in the early twentieth century; as they have existed anywhere in the capitalist world and will exist anywhere in the globalized economy, are inherently opposed to the practice of self-activity by rank-andfile workers. This is true regardless of what persons may hold the top offices in those unions. The first principle of a resistance movement against globalization must be not to concentrate energy on campaigns for national union office, any more than we make campaigns for national political office our first priority. Of course, it makes a difference who wins these campaigns. That doesn’t mean we should spend our time working in them. Like the Zapatistas, we should influence national electoral campaigns by our nonelectoral self-activity at the base.
     Why is it that national trade unions will never be able to play a leading
role in our movement to get rid of capitalism and substitute something better for it? Because national trade unions are irrevocably linked to capitalism. They will inevitably find ways to make their peace with profit-making corporations. They will always stop short of fundamental social transformation.

They are and will remain Social Democratic, meaning, their historical project is reform, not revolution; their nature is to try to make capitalism livable. This is a necessary project, but as Rosa Luxemburg said, it is a labor of Sisyphus: it could go on forever and never really change the system.
     So what is the difference between the path of our labor movement Founding Fathers, like John L. Lewis and Walter Reuther, and the path that many
of us are trying to walk today?
     Those in the tradition of the Founding Fathers are preoccupied with taking power in national unions. Local union office is seen as a stepping-stone.
The rhetoric is of “taking back our union,” when, in reality, no national union—not the Miners, not the Auto Workers, not the Steelworkers, not the Teamsters—has ever been controlled by its rank and file.
     The other path takes its inspiration from the astonishing re-creation from
below throughout the past century of ad hoc central labor bodies: the local workers’ councils known as “soviets” in Russia in 1905 and 1917; the Italian factory committees of the early 1920s; solidarity unions in Toledo, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and elsewhere in the States in the early 1930s; and similar formations in Hungary in 1956, Poland in 1980–1981, and France in 1968 and 1995.
     These were all horizontal gatherings of all kinds of workers in a given locality, who then form regional and national networks with counterpart bodies
elsewhere. Unlike national trade unions, local unions can provide continuity between the moments when such ad hoc bodies come out of the ground like mushrooms and indeed—to vary the metaphor—have the potential to be important building blocks and organizing centers for more spontaneous formations.
     This is what workers do when they are truly emancipating themselves. It
is the participatory democracy of the 1960s alive and well in the movement of the new century.
fNzNg Wh h oop Much more briefly, let me touch on the other two principles proposed.
    Seeking to win over the armed forces responds to the question “What do
we do about the fact that the other side will always have more weapons?” and offers the simple answer: we seek to win over or neutralize the soldiers. This goes for police officers, including the Fraternal Order of Police in Philadelphia; for prison guards; for self-appointed deputies like members of the Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi; and for members of each nation’s armed forces. We don’t call them “pigs” or “fascists.” We try to understand them as human beings.

This practice has three ideological variations. The first is pacifism, broadly defined. At the Pentagon demonstration in October 1967, a man who had named himself “Superjoel” relates:
I was between Abbie [Hoffman] and Dr. Spock. We’re walking up on the grounds of the Pentagon. And on top of this pile of trash there’s this bunch of flowers, daisies, right. I grabbed them. I saw these soldiers and they’re all standing there, and they were my age. So I just took the flowers and one by one, boom, boom, boom, put ’em in the gun barrels.
The crowd began to call out to the troops, “Join us!” More than three years later, on May 3, 1970, a student at Kent State University named Allison Krause—one of the four students killed the next day—put a flower in the gun barrel of a National Guardsman, saying: “Flowers are better than bullets.” These events signified a change in the attitude of the antiwar movement toward the GIs, whose refusal to fight would ultimately bring the war to an end.
     A second strain of ideology that calls for fraternization with the armed
forces derives from Vatican II and liberation theology. Its most celebrated exemplar was Archbishop Oscar Romero. On March 23, 1980, Romero delivered a homily in which he addressed the Salvadoran armed forces and stated:
Brothers, you are from the same people; you kill your brother peasants. . . . No soldier is obliged to obey an order that is contrary to the will of God. Now it is time for you to recover your consciences so that you first obey conscience rather than a sinful order. . . . In the name of God, then, in the name of this suffering people, whose cries rise to the heavens, every day more tumultuously, I ask you, I beg you, I order you in the name of God; stop the repression.
The next day Romero paid for these words with his life.
    The third ideological tradition that calls for doing everything possible to
win over the armed forces is Marxism. Trotsky, after the triumph of the Red Army that he commanded, discussed this theme in his History of the Russian Revolution as it applied both to the revolution of February 1917, which overthrew the tsar, and to the Bolshevik Revolution the next fall.
    Trotsky sketched the February events along lines that later scholarship has
only confirmed. On February 23, International Women’s Day, “the February revolution was begun from below, overcoming the resistance of its own revolutionary organizations, the initiative being undertaken of their own accord

by the most oppressed and downtrodden part of the proletariat—the women textile workers, among them no doubt many soldiers’ wives.” Detachments of soldiers were called in to assist the police, but there were no encounters.
    The next day, February 24, the number of demonstrators doubled. As the
crowd moved toward the center of Petrograd, injured soldiers in some of the war hospitals waved whatever was at hand in support. At length the crowd stood face to face with mounted troops, the Cossacks. The Cossacks charged repeatedly. The crowd parted to let them through. “The Cossacks promise not to shoot” passed from mouth to mouth.
    It was very much in the streets of Petrograd as it would be eighty-two
years later in the road at Amadór.
       When women and soldiers faced each other on the turbulent streets,
       old women at the head of the demonstration stepped toward the
       mounted soldiers, pleading: “We have our husbands, fathers, and
       brothers at the front. But here we have hunger, hard times, injustice, shame. The government mocks us instead of helping us. You
       also have your mothers, wives, sisters, and children. All we want is
       bread and to end the war.” According to Trotsky, the women went
       “up to the cordons more boldly than men, [took] hold of the rifles,
       beseech[ed], almost command[ed]: ‘Put down your bayonets—join
       us.’” Again and again the Cossacks refused to ride down the demonstrating women.
    And what about Serbia? There one saw last fall what can fairly be called a
nonviolent revolution. A political movement won an election. When the incumbent regime initially refused to recognize the election results, an outraged populace poured into the streets. On the evening of Friday, September 29, the coal miners of the Kolubara region, who produce the coal required for half of Serbia’s output of electricity, declared an indefinite general strike. The general in charge of the armed forces, and police from the Interior Ministry, showed up on Tuesday, October 3, and Wednesday, October 4. The miners adopted a dual strategy. On the one hand, they removed vital parts from the mine machinery and challenged the soldiers to mine coal with bayonets. On the other hand, they summoned twenty thousand supporters from nearby communities. The police held their ground but made no arrests. The next day, Thursday, October 5, hundreds of thousands of people in Belgrade—forty miles away—seized the parliament and the state TV station, and the police in Kolubara melted away. The Kolubara strike was coordinated not by a “trade union” but by a “workers’ committee.” All over Serbia following [Vojislav] Kostunica’s accession to power, local committees of workers displaced hated

factory managers. I realize that a cynic might say that this was a transition from socialism to capitalism, not the other way around. But surely, Serbia also shows us that fundamental social transition, revolution, remains possible in the twenty-first century and that neutralizing the armed forces by mass nonviolent direct action can be a critical component of the process.
BDNg  CoMMN of gg Finally, and still with desperate brevity, I invite you to look at the most difficult problem of all: building a community of struggle.
     During the past fifty years, my wife and I have been associated with a
commune in the hills of Georgia where we expected to spend the rest of our lives; with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS); with the work community of a legal services office where I was employed for eighteen years; and with three large local unions led by persons who were, if not radicals, at least militant reformers. Every one of these entities went out of existence or continued, after internal struggle, as a two-dimensional caricature of its former self. And in every case the reason for the disintegration or decay of the community of struggle was that the human beings who made it up could not resolve their problems with each other, could not remain, as we used to say in the South, a band of brothers and sisters standing in a circle of love. It wasn’t COINTELPRO, the FBI, or Ronald Reagan that did us in. We did it to ourselves.
     In the case of the commune, the issue was whether we had all to believe in the same religious creed in order to resolve deep personal problems.
SNCC and SDS fractured, I believe, under the combined pressure of (1) the emergence of black power, (2) the frustrations of trying to end the war in Vietnam, and (3) the advent of Marxist grouplets confident that they had all the answers and we did not. With all three local unions, it was a matter of personalities in each reform slate splitting over issues connected with the next election.
     I wish I could believe that these were problems confined to the United
States. I fear they are not. Look at the Russian Revolution. Look at the Cultural Revolution in China. Look at Polish Solidarity. Even in Canada, it may be that you have occasionally experienced what I am trying to describe: the apparently limitless capacity of the Left for self-destruction and fratricide. A resistance movement against globalization, it would seem, must have some response to these intractable evils.
     My own response is still very much in process, but let me share it, such as
it is. I think there is a difficulty with the concept of “organizing.” No doubt most of us would piously reject the idea of a Leninist vanguard party. But the

## 300 | C h  p    10

concept of “organizing” that most of us might applaud also tends to be vanguardist. The organizer says—does he or she not?—“I know what you ought to think, or at a minimum, what organization you should join and pay dues to.” There is an inequality from the outset between organizer and organizee. Moreover, given that inequality, as well as the inequality between the organizer and the supervisor to whom he or she reports, there is less listening and consensual problem-solving than there should be, resentments are not expressed and fester, and individual careerism comes to the fore at the first opportunity.
     In Latin America—for example, once again, in the work of Archbishop
Romero—there is the different concept of “accompaniment.” I do not organize you. I accompany you, or more precisely, we accompany each other. Implicit in this notion of “accompañando” is the assumption that neither of us has a complete map of where our path will lead. In the words of Antonio Machado: “Caminante, no hay camino. Se hace camino al andar.” (Seeker, there is no road. We make the road by walking.)
     Accompaniment has been, in the experience of myself and my wife, a
discovery and a guide to practice. Alice first formulated it as a draft counselor in the 1960s. When draft counselor meets counselee, she came to say, there are two experts in the room. One may be an expert on the law and administrative regulations. The other is an expert on what he wants to do with his life. Similarly as lawyers, in our activity with workers and prisoners, we have come to prize above all else the experience of jointly solving problems with our clients. They know the facts, the custom of the workplace or the penal facility, the experience of past success and failure. We too bring something to the table. I do not wish to be indecently immodest, but I will share that I treasure beyond any honorary degree actual or imagined the nicknames that Ohio prisoners have given the two of us: “Mama Bear” and “Scrapper.”
     I have begun to wonder whether the concept of “accompaniment,” in addition to clarifying the desirable relationship of individuals in the movement
for social change to one another, also has application to the desirable relationship of groups. A great deal of energy has gone into defining the proper relationship in the movement for social change of workers and students; blacks and whites; men and women; straights and gays; gringos, ladinos and indígenas; and no doubt, English speakers and French speakers. An older wave of radicalism struggled with the supposed leading role of the proletariat. More recently other kinds of division have preoccupied us. My question is what would it do to this discussion were we to say that we are all accompanying one another on the road to a better society?
     I came to this notion in an interesting way. Marty Glaberman, an honored friend and colleague, kept telling me that the fullest expression of spontaneous workers’ councils was the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and that
                                 N  W MoD       of C o   C     C  oN | 3 01
the best book describing them was Hungary ’56 by Andy Anderson. Finally he sent me the book. I read it. And what to my wondering eyes did appear but the following:
     At the 20th Congress of the Russian Communist Party in February
1956, Khrushchev denounced the misdeeds of Stalin. In April 1956, Hungarian students formed the Petofi Circle, named for a patriotic poet of the nineteenth century. “Soon, the meetings of the Petofi Circle were attracting thousands of people.” The issue was freedom to speak and write the truth. As of September 1956, protest was still in the hands of intellectuals. The demonstrations that became a revolution in October were organized by the Petofi Circle and other student groups. Workers joined in, magnificently, with far-reaching demands. But students came first.
     This information set something free inside myself. For twenty-five years I
have been conscientiously pursuing the project of accompanying the working class. But in my former incarnation, in the 1960s, it was students who sat in at a Woolworth lunch counter to kick off the civil rights movement of the following decade, and it was students who first went out into the streets against the war. Workers opposed the war just as strongly as did middle-class constituencies. Working-class soldiers, black and white, ultimately refused to fight and ended it. But as in Hungary in 1956, so in the 1960s—not only in the United States but also, for example, in France in 1968—students came first.
     Having begun to see examples of this sequencing, I started to find it
everywhere. In Russia throughout the year 1904, protest was voiced at a doctors’ congress, at a conference of teachers, at a series of banquets organized by liberals. At Father [Georgy] Gapon’s meetings with workers the demand was voiced: “Workers must join the campaign against the autocracy.” The decision to present a petition to the tsar, which led to “Bloody Sunday” in January 1905 and thus to the beginning of the 1905 revolution, was made in Gapon’s apartment on November 28, 1904, “the evening after a bloody assault by soldiers on student demonstrators.” Only in the fall of 1905, almost a year after rolling general strikes began to spread across Russia, was the so-called soviet formed in St. Petersburg. And where did it meet? According to its chairman, Trotsky, in the universities. “The doors of the universities,” he writes, had “remained wide open. ‘The people’ filled the corridors, lecture rooms and halls. Workers went directly from the factory to the university.” The first meeting of the soviet was held on the evening of October 13, 1905, at the Technological Institute. The second meeting the next night had to be moved to the physics auditorium of the same institution. Trotsky says that on that evening “the higher educational establishments were overflowing with people.”
     Why do students so often come first? One can speculate. To whatever
extent [Antonio] Gramsci is right about the hegemony of bourgeois ideas,

## 3 02 | C h  p    10

students and other intellectuals break through it: they give workers the space to think and experience for themselves. Similarly the defiance of students may help workers to overcome whatever deference they may be feeling toward supposed social superiors.
     I want to conclude by affirming my hope for the rebirth of the movement
for social change in the United States. George W. Bush may do for us what we have been unable to do for ourselves since the collapse of SDS and SNCC at the end of the 1960s. He may organize a new movement. Protest against the death penalty, against George W. Bush as executioner extraordinaire, and against the institutionalized racism of the United States penal system will be a leading edge of the new movement. Old issues, such as the right to vote and gender equality, will reintroduce themselves in the context of resistance to the doctrinaire neoliberalism and lack of compassion of the Bush administration. Students, workers, women, and prisoners will all be involved.
     It will be a vast, ragged coalition full of crosscurrents and internal contradictions. Unions like the Steelworkers and the Teamsters may be in the
streets on occasion, as in Seattle (in 1999), because they wish to protect the livelihoods of their members from imported steel and Mexican truck drivers. Appearances notwithstanding, this is not international class solidarity and does not express concern for what happens to workers in other countries. Yet for countless individuals who were in the streets with one another, the jubilant shared experience of “turtles and Teamsters together at last” was real, and expressed the spirit of accompaniment I have been trying to describe.
     Hopefully, then, as social transformation once again comes onto the
agenda in the United States, new networks of solidarity will spring into being between our movement and (for example) the struggles of Local 3903 at York University and Local 598 in Falconbridge; between our movement and your resistance to a private prison at Penetanguishene; between our movement and the work of Marion Traub-Werner and others to protect Nike workers at the Kukdong garment factory in Mexico; between our movement and current efforts to reinvest in your health care system; between our movement and the Father’s Day Coalition at the Hamilton Air Show; between our movement and the folks from all over the world who will gather on the Plains of Abraham in April and, for Desert Scorn, in November in Qatar.

10.2 Platform for a Provisional Opposition
          G D
A revolutionary action within culture must aim to enlarge life, not merely
      to express or explain it. It must attack misery on every front. Revolution
is not limited to determining the level of industrial production or even to determining who is to be the master of such production. It must abolish not only the exploitation of humanity but also the passions, compensations, and habits that that exploitation has engendered. We have to define new desires in relation to present possibilities. In the thick of the battle between the present society and the forces that are going to destroy it, we have to find the first elements of a more advanced construction of the environment and new conditions of behavior—both as experiences in themselves and as material for propaganda. Everything else belongs to the past, and serves it.
     We now have to undertake an organized collective work aimed at a unitary use of all the means of revolutionizing everyday life. That is, we must
first of all recognize the interdependence of these means in the perspective of increased freedom and an increased control of nature. We need to construct new ambiences that will be both the products and the instruments of new forms of behavior. To do this, we must from the beginning make practical use of the everyday processes and cultural forms that now exist, while refusing to acknowledge any inherent value they may claim to have. The very criterion of formal invention or innovation has lost its sense within the traditional framework of the arts—insufficient, fragmentary forms whose partial renovations are inevitably outdated and therefore impossible.
     We should not simply refuse modern culture; we must seize it in order to
negate it. No one can claim to be a revolutionary intellectual who does not recognize the cultural revolution we are now facing. An intellectual creator cannot be revolutionary by merely supporting some party line, not even if he does so with original methods, but only by working alongside the parties

## 304 | C h  p    10

toward the necessary transformation of all the cultural superstructures. What ultimately determines whether or not someone is a bourgeois intellectual is neither his social origin nor his knowledge of a culture (such knowledge may be the basis for a critique of that culture or for some creative work within it), but his role in the production of the historically bourgeois forms of culture. Authors of revolutionary political opinions who find themselves praised by bourgeois literary critics should ask themselves what they’ve done wrong.
     The union of several experimental tendencies for a revolutionary front in
culture, begun at the congress held at Alba, Italy, at the end of 1956, presupposes that we not neglect three important factors.
     First of all, we must insist on a complete accord among the persons and
groups that participate in this united action; and this accord must not be facilitated by allowing certain of its consequences to be dissimulated. Jokers or careerists who are stupid enough to think they can advance their careers in this way must be rebuffed.
     Next, we must recall that while any genuinely experimental attitude is
usable, that word has very often been misused in the attempt to justify artistic actions within an already-existing structure. The only valid experimental proceeding is based on the accurate critique of existing conditions and the deliberate supersession of them. It must be understood once and for all that something that is only a personal expression within a framework created by others cannot be termed a creation. Creation is not the arrangement of objects and forms; it is the invention of new laws on such arrangement.
     Finally, we have to eliminate the sectarianism among us that opposes
unity of action with possible allies for specific goals and prevents our infiltration of parallel organizations. From 1952 to 1955 the Lettrist International, after some necessary purges, continually moved toward a sort of absolutist rigor leading to an equally absolute isolation and ineffectuality, and ultimately to a certain immobility, a degeneration of the spirit of critique and discovery. We must definitively supersede this sectarian conduct in favor of real actions. This should be the sole criterion on which we join with or separate from comrades. Naturally this does not mean that we should renounce breaks, as everyone urges us to do. On the contrary, we think that it is necessary to go still further in breaking with habits and persons.
     We should collectively define our program and realize it in a disciplined
manner, using any means, even artistic ones.

action in order to combat the emotional influence of advanced capitalist methods of propaganda. On every occasion, by every hyperpolitical means, we must publicize desirable alternatives to the spectacle of the capitalist way of life, so as to destroy the bourgeois idea of happiness. At the same time, taking into account the existence, within the various ruling classes, of elements that have always tended (out of boredom and thirst for novelty) toward things that lead to the disappearance of their societies, we should incite the persons who control some of the vast resources that we lack to provide us with the means to carry out our experiments, out of the same motives of potential profit as they do with scientific research.
     We must everywhere present a revolutionary alternative to the ruling culture; coordinate all the researches that are currently taking place but that lack
a comprehensive perspective; and incite, through critiques and propaganda, the most advanced artists and intellectuals of all countries to contact us in view of a collective action.
     We should declare ourselves ready to renew discussion, on the basis of
this program, with those who, having taken part in an earlier phase of our action, are still capable of rejoining with us.
     We must put forward the slogans of unitary urbanism, experimental behavior, hyperpolitical propaganda, and the construction of ambiences. The
passions have been sufficiently interpreted; the point now is to discover new ones.

    The same society of alienation, totalitarian control, and passive spectacular consumption reigns everywhere, despite the diversity of its ideological
and juridical disguises. The coherence of this society cannot be understood without an all-encompassing critique, illuminated by the inverse project of a liberated creativity, the project of everyone’s control of all levels of their own history.
    To revive and bring into the present this inseparable, mutually illuminating project and critique entails appropriating all the radicalism borne by the
workers movement, by modern poetry and art, and by the thought of the period of the supersession of philosophy, from [Georg] Hegel to [Friedrich] Nietzsche. To do this, it is first of all necessary to recognize, without holding on to any consoling illusions, the full extent of the defeat of the entire

## 306 | C h  p    10

revolutionary project in the first third of this century and its official replacement, in every region of the world and in every domain of life, by delusive shams and petty reforms that camouflage and preserve the old order.
     Such a resumption of radicality naturally also requires a considerable
deepening of all the old attempts at liberation. Seeing how those attempts failed because of isolation, or were converted into total frauds, enables one to get a better grasp of the coherence of the world that needs to be changed. In the light of this rediscovered coherence, many of the partial explorations of the recent past can be salvaged and brought to their true fulfillment. Insight into this reversible coherence of the world—its present reality in relation to its potential reality—enables one to see the fallaciousness of half-measures and to recognize the presence of such half-measures each time the operating pattern of the dominant society—with its categories of hierarchization and specialization and its corresponding habits and tastes—reconstitutes itself within the forces of negation.
     Moreover, the material development of the world has accelerated. It constantly accumulates more potential powers, but the specialists of the management of society, because of their role as guardians of passivity, are forced to
ignore the potential use of those powers. This same development produces widespread dissatisfaction and objective mortal dangers that these specialized rulers are incapable of permanently controlling.
     We will limit ourselves to mentioning a few examples of acts that have
our total approval. On January 16 of this year [1957] some revolutionary students in Caracas made an armed attack on an exhibition of French art and carried off five paintings, which they then offered to return in exchange for the release of political prisoners. The forces of order recaptured the paintings after a gun battle with Winston Bermudes, Luis Monselve, and Gladys Troconis. A few days later some other comrades threw two bombs at the police van that was transporting the recovered paintings, which unfortunately did not succeed in destroying it. This is clearly an exemplary way to treat the art of the past, to bring it back into play in life and to reestablish priorities. Since the death of [Paul] Gauguin (“I have tried to establish the right to dare everything”) and of [Vincent] Van Gogh, their work, coopted by their enemies, has probably never received from the cultural world an homage so true to their spirit as the act of these Venezuelans. During the Dresden insurrection of 1849 [Mikhail] Bakunin proposed, unsuccessfully, that the insurgents take the paintings out of the museums and put them on a barricade at the entrance to the city, to see if this might inhibit the attacking troops from continuing their fire. We can thus see how this skirmish in Caracas links up with one of the highest moments of the revolutionary upsurge of the last century and even goes further.

     No less justified, in our opinion, are the actions of those Danish comrades who over the last few weeks have resorted to incendiary bombs against
the travel agencies that organize tours to Spain, or who have carried out pirate radio broadcasts warning of the dangers of nuclear arms. In the context of the comfortable and boring “socialized” capitalism of the Scandinavian countries, it is most encouraging to see the emergence of people whose violence exposes some aspects of the other violence that lies at the foundation of this “humanized” social order—its monopoly of information, for example, or the organized alienation of its tourism and other leisure activities—along with the horrible flip side that is implicitly accepted whenever one accepts this comfortable boredom: not only is this peace not life, but it is a peace built on the threat of atomic death; not only is organized tourism a miserable spectacle that conceals the real countries through which one travels, but the reality of the country thus transformed into a neutral spectacle is Franco’s police.
     Finally, the action of the English comrades [the Spies for Peace], who
last April divulged the location and plans of the “Regional Seat of Government #6” bomb shelter, has the immense merit of revealing the degree already attained by state power in its organization of the terrain and establishment of a totalitarian functioning of authority. This totalitarian organization is not designed simply to prepare for a possible war. It is, rather, the universally maintained threat of a nuclear war that now, in both the East and the West, serves to keep the masses submissive, to organize shelters for state power, and to reinforce the psychological and material defenses of the ruling class’s power. The modern urbanism on the surface serves the same function. In April 1962, in issue 7 of our French-language journal Internationale Situationniste, we made the following comments regarding the massive construction of individual shelters in the United States during the previous year:
    Here, as in every racket, “protection” is only a pretext. The real purpose of the shelters is to test—and thereby reinforce—people’s submissiveness, and to manipulate this submissiveness to the advantage
    of the ruling society. The shelters, as a creation of a new consumable
    commodity in the society of abundance, prove more than any previous commodity that people can be made to work to satisfy highly
    artificial needs, needs that most certainly remain needs without ever
    having been desires. The new habitat that is now taking shape with
    the large housing developments is not really distinct from the architecture of the shelters; it merely represents a less advanced level of that
    architecture. The concentration-camp organization of the surface
    of the earth is the normal state of the present society in formation;
    its condensed subterranean version merely represents that society’s

## 308 | C h  p    10

      pathological excess. This subterranean sickness reveals the real nature
      of the “health” at the surface.
     The English comrades have just made a decisive contribution to the study
of this sickness and thus also to the study of “normal” society. This study is itself inseparable from a struggle that has not been afraid to defy the old national taboos of “treason” by breaking the secrecy that is vital in so many regards for the smooth functioning of power in modern society, behind the thick screen of its glut of “information.” The sabotage in England was later extended, despite the efforts of the police and numerous arrests: secret military headquarters in the country were invaded by surprise (some officials present being photographed against their will), and forty telephone lines of British security centers were systematically blocked by the continuous dialing of ultrasecret numbers that had been publicized.
     In order to salute and extend this first attack against the ruling organization of social space, we have organized this “Destruction of RSG-6”
demonstration in Denmark. In so doing, we are striving not only for an internationalist extension of this struggle but also for its extension on the “artistic” front of this same general struggle.

10.3 The Temporary Autonomous Zone

T he sea-rovers and corsairs of the eighteenth century created an “information network” that spanned the globe: primitive and devoted primarily to grim business, the net nevertheless functioned admirably. Scattered throughout the net were islands, remote hideouts where ships could be watered and provisioned, and booty traded for luxuries and necessities. Some of these islands supported “intentional communities,” whole mini-societies living consciously outside the law and determined to keep it up, even if only for a short but merry life.
     I believe that by extrapolating from past and future stories about “islands
in the net” we may collect evidence to suggest that a certain kind of “free enclave” is not only possible in our time but also existent. All my research and

WNg fo h ooN How is it that “the world turned upside-down” always manages to right itself? Why does reaction always follow revolution, like seasons in Hell?
     Uprising, or the Latin form insurrection, are words used by historians to
label failed revolutions—movements that do not match the expected curve, the consensus-approved trajectory: revolution, reaction, betrayal, the founding of a stronger and even more oppressive state—the turning of the wheel, the return of history again and again to its highest form: jackboot on the face of humanity forever.
     By failing to follow this curve, the up-rising suggests the possibility of a
movement outside and beyond the Hegelian spiral of that “progress” that is secretly nothing more than a vicious circle. Surgo—rise up, surge. Insurgo— rise up, raise oneself up. A bootstrap operation. A good-bye to that wretched parody of the karmic round, historical revolutionary futility. The slogan “Revolution!” has mutated from tocsin to toxin, a malign pseudo-Gnostic fate-trap, a nightmare where no matter how we struggle, we never escape that evil aeon, that incubus the state, one state after another, every “heaven” ruled by yet one more evil angel.
     If history is “time,” as it claims to be, then the uprising is a moment that
springs up and out of time, violates the “law” of history. If the state is history, as it claims to be, then the insurrection is the forbidden moment, an unforgivable denial of the dialectic—shimmying up the pole and out of the smokehole, a shaman’s maneuver carried out at an “impossible angle” to the universe. History says the revolution attains “permanence,” or at least duration, while the uprising is “temporary.” In this sense an uprising is like a “peak experience” as opposed to the standard of “ordinary” consciousness and experience. Like festivals, uprisings cannot happen every day—otherwise they would not be “nonordinary.” But such moments of intensity give shape and meaning to the entirety of a life. The shaman returns—you can’t stay up on the roof forever—but things have changed, shifts and integrations have occurred—a difference is made.
     You will argue that this is a counsel of despair. What of the anarchist
dream, the stateless state, the commune, the autonomous zone with duration, a free society, a free culture? Are we to abandon that hope in return for some existentialist acte gratuit? The point is not to change consciousness but to change the world.
     I accept this as a fair criticism. I’d make two rejoinders nevertheless: First,
revolution has never yet resulted in achieving this dream. The vision comes

## 310 | C h  p    10

to life in the moment of uprising—but as soon as “the revolution” triumphs and the state returns, the dream and the ideal are already betrayed. I have not given up hope or even expectation of change—but I distrust the word revolution. Second, even if we replace the revolutionary approach with a concept of insurrection blossoming spontaneously into anarchist culture, our own particular historical situation is not propitious for such a vast undertaking. Absolutely nothing but a futile martyrdom could possibly result now from a head-on collision with the terminal state, the megacorporate information state, the empire of spectacle and simulation. Its guns are all pointed at us, while our meager weaponry finds nothing to aim at but a hysteresis, a rigid vacuity, a spook capable of smothering every spark in an ectoplasm of information, a society of capitulation ruled by the image of the cop and the absorbent eye of the TV screen.
     In short, we’re not touting the TAZ as an exclusive end in itself, replacing all other forms of organization, tactics, and goals. We recommend it because it can provide the quality of enhancement associated with the uprising
without necessarily leading to violence and martyrdom. The TAZ is like an uprising that does not engage directly with the state, a guerilla operation that liberates an area (of land, of time, of imagination) and then dissolves itself to re-form elsewhere/elsewhen, before the state can crush it.
     The concept of the TAZ arises first out of a critique of revolution, and an
appreciation of the insurrection. The former labels the latter a failure; but for us uprising represents a far more interesting possibility, from the standard of a psychology of liberation, than all the “successful” revolutions of bourgeoisie, communists, fascists, etc.
     The second generating force behind the TAZ springs from the historical
development I call the closure of the map. The last bit of Earth unclaimed by any nation-state was eaten up in 1899. Ours is the first century without terra incognita, without a frontier. Nationality is the highest principle of world governance—not one speck of rock in the South Seas can be left open, not one remote valley, not even the moon and planets. This is the apotheosis of “territorial gangsterism.” Not one square inch of Earth goes unpoliced or untaxed—in theory.
     The “map” is a political abstract grid, a gigantic con enforced by the
carrot/stick conditioning of the “expert” state, until for most of us the map becomes the territory—no longer “Turtle Island” but “the United States.” And yet because the map is an abstraction, it cannot cover Earth with 1:1 accuracy. Within the fractal complexities of actual geography the map can see only dimensional grids. Hidden enfolded immensities escape the measuring rod. The map is not accurate; the map cannot be accurate.

    So—revolution is closed, but insurgency is open. For the time being we
concentrate our force on temporary “power surges,” avoiding all entanglements with “permanent solutions.”
    The closures of revolution and of the map, however, are only the negative sources of the TAZ; much remains to be said of its positive inspirations.
Reaction alone cannot provide the energy needed to “manifest” a TAZ.
    An uprising must be for something as well.
    The TAZ as a conscious radical tactic will emerge under certain conditions:

   1. Psychological liberation. That is, we must realize (make real) the
      moments and spaces in which freedom is not only possible but
      actual. We must know in what ways we are genuinely oppressed,
      and also in what ways we are self-repressed or ensnared in a fantasy in which ideas oppress us. Work, for example, is a far more
      actual source of misery for most of us than legislative politics.
      Alienation is far more dangerous for us than toothless outdated
      dying ideologies. Mental addiction to “ideals”—which in fact turn
      out to be mere projections of our resentment and sensations of
      victimization—will never further our project. The TAZ is not a
      harbinger of some pie-in-the-sky social utopia to which we must
      sacrifice our lives that our children’s children may breathe a bit of
      free air. The TAZ must be the scene of our present autonomy, but
      it can exist only on the condition that we already know ourselves
      as free beings.
   2. The counter-Net must expand. At present it reflects more abstraction than actuality. Zines and BBSs exchange information, which
      is part of the necessary groundwork of the TAZ, but very little of
      this information relates to concrete goods and services necessary
      for the autonomous life. We do not live in cyberspace; to dream
      that we do is to fall into cybergnosis, the false transcendence of
      the body. The TAZ is a physical place, and we are either in it or
      not. All the senses must be involved. The Web is like a new sense
      in some ways, but it must be added to the others—the others must
      not be subtracted from it, as in some horrible parody of the mystic
      trance. Without the Web, the full realization of the TAZ complex
      would be impossible. But the Web is not the end in itself. It’s a
      weapon.
   3. The apparatus of control—the state—must (or so we must assume) continue to deliquesce and petrify simultaneously, must

## 312 | C h  p    10

          progress on its present course in which hysterical rigidity comes
          more and more to mask a vacuity, an abyss of power. As power
          disappears, our will to power must be disappearance.
     We’ve already dealt with the question of whether the TAZ can be viewed
“merely” as a work of art. But you will also demand to know whether it is more than a poor rat-hole in the Babylon of information, or rather a maze of tunnels, more and more connected but devoted only to the economic dead end of piratical parasitism? I’ll answer that I’d rather be a rat in the wall than a rat in the cage—but I’ll also insist that the TAZ transcends these categories.
     A world in which the TAZ succeeded in putting down roots might resemble the world envisioned by “P.M.” in his fantasy novel bolo’ bolo. Perhaps the TAZ is a “proto-bolo.” But inasmuch as the TAZ exists now, it
stands for much more than the mundanity of negativity or countercultural dropout-ism. We’ve mentioned the festal aspect of the moment that is uncontrolled and that adheres in spontaneous self-ordering, however brief. It is “epiphanic”—a peak experience on the social as well as individual scale.

10.5 Horizontalism and Territory
             From Argentina and Occupy to Nuit Debout and Beyond
             M S
H orizontal social relationships and the creation of new territory, through
     the use of geographic space, are the most generalized and innovative of
the experiences of the Occupy movement. What we have been witnessing across the United States since September 17 is new in a myriad of ways, yet also, as everything, has local and global antecedents. In this essay I describe these two innovations and ground them in the more recent past, specifically in the global south in Argentina. I do this so as to examine commonalities and differences but also to remind us that these ways of organizing have multiple and diverse precedents, and ones from which we can hopefully learn.
hozoNDD Horizontalidad, horizontality, and horizontalism are words that encapsulate the ideas on which many of the social relationships and political interactions in the new global movements are grounded—from Spain to Greece and now most recently here in the U.S. Occupy movement.
     Horizontalidad is a social relationship that implies, as its name suggests, a
flat plane on which to communicate. Horizontalidad necessarily implies the use of direct democracy and the striving for consensus, processes in which attempts are made so that everyone is heard and new relationships are created. Horizontalidad is a new way of relating, based in affective politics and against all the implications of “isms.” It is a dynamic social relationship. It is not an ideology or political program that must be met so as to create a new society or new idea. It is a break with these sorts of vertical ways of organizing and relating, and a break that is an opening.
     To participate in any of the assemblies taking place throughout the
United States, and in many places around the globe, means to stand or sit in a circle, with a handful of facilitators, and speak and listen in turn, usually with general guidelines and principles of unity, and then together attempt to reach consensus—meaning to reach a general agreement that all can feel satisfied with, but that is not necessarily perfect, on whatever issue is raised, all the while doing so through the process of active listening. If one were to ask a participant about this process, which I have done countless times, she would most likely explain the need to listen to one another, perhaps she might use the language of democracy—something like direct, real, or participatory deN  W MoD       of C o    C     C  oN | 315
mocracy—or maybe she would say that we do not have a society in which people can really participate, so that is what we are trying to do here, in this space and with this assembly. Often in these conversations, some version of horizontalism will arise. So similar is this current experience in the United States to what took place in Argentina, beginning in December 2001, where I then lived and compiled an oral history, that it is not only remarkable; it requires reflection and historical grounding.
    The word horizontalidad was first heard in the days after the December
2001 popular rebellion in Argentina. No one recalls where it came from or who first might have said it. It was a new word and emerged from a new practice. The practice was that of people coming together, looking to one another, without anyone in charge or with power over another, beginning to find ways to solve their problems together, and by doing this together, they were creating a new relationship. Both the decision-making process and the ways in which they wanted to relate in the future were horizontal. What this meant was, and still is, to be discovered in its practice, or as the Zapatistas in Chiapas say, in the walk, and always questioning as we walk.
    The rebellion in Argentina came in response to a growing economic
crisis that had already left hundreds of thousands without work and many thousands hungry. The state provided no possible way out—and in fact offered quite the opposite. In the days before the popular rebellion, in early December 2001, the government froze all personal bank accounts, fearing a run on the banks. In response, first one person, and then another, and then hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands came out into the street, banging pots and pans, cacerolando. They were not led by any party and were not following any slogans; they merely sang, “Que se vayan todos! Que no quede ni uno solo!” (They all must go! Not even one should remain!). Within two weeks four governments had resigned, the Minister of the Economy being the first to flee.
    In the days of the popular rebellion people who had been out in the
streets cacerolando describe finding themselves, finding each other, looking around at one another, introducing themselves, wondering what was next, and beginning to ask questions together.
    One of the most significant things about the social movements that
emerged in Argentina after December 19 and 20 is how generalized the experience of horizontalidad was and is: from the middle class organized into neighborhood assemblies to the unemployed in neighborhoods, and with workers taking back their workplaces. Horizontalidad and a rejection of hierarchy and political parties was the norm for thousands of assemblies taking place on street corners, in workplaces, and throughout the unemployed

## 316 | C h  p    10

neighborhoods. And now, ten years later, as people come together to organize, the assumption is that it will be horizontal, from the hundreds of assemblies currently occurring up and down the Andes fighting against international mining companies, to the thousands of Bachilleratos, alternative high school diploma programs organized by former assembly participants and housed in recuperated workplaces.
     Horizontalidad is a living word, reflecting an ever-changing experience.
Months after the popular rebellion, many movement participants began to speak of their relationships as horizontal as a way of describing the new forms of decision making. Years after the rebellion, those continuing to build new movements speak of horizontalidad as a goal as well as a tool. All social relationships are still deeply affected by capitalism and hierarchy and thus by the sort of power dynamics they promote in all collective and creative spaces, especially how people relate to one another in terms of economic resources, gender, race, access to information, and experience. As a result, until these fundamental social dynamics are overcome, the goal of horizontalidad cannot be achieved. Time has taught that, in the face of this, simply desiring a relationship does not make it so. But the process of horizontalidad is a tool for the achievement of this goal. Thus horizontalidad is desired and is a goal, but it is also the means, the tool, for achieving this end.
     Occupy participants in the United States—as well as around the globe,
from Spain and Greece to London and Berlin—organize with directly democratic assemblies, and many even use the specific language of horizontal, horizontalism, and horizontalidad. They are using horizontal forms so as to create the most open and participatory spaces possible, while now, many months into the occupations, participants are speaking of the challenges to the process as well, similarly reflecting that horizontalidad is not a thing but rather a process and, as with the Argentines, both a tool and a goal.
     In the months since the Occupy movement began in the United States
there has been a tremendous interest in what occurred in Argentina. Countless people come up to me or write to me to share that what they read about Argentina is exactly what they are feeling, and the forms of organization are remarkably similar. They then usually ask me how that is possible. Similarly in Greece, a few months into the occupation of Syntagma Square, the group SKYA (the assembly for the circulation of struggles) asked to translate horizontalism into Greek. It has since been translated, and in November I traveled to Athens and met with various assemblies who were beginning to use the book as a political and popular education tool. Again, as in the United States, movement participants shared how the experiences, especially of horizontalism, were so similar to the ways in which they were organizing.

o ND pC Not only do people in the current global movements organize in ways that are horizontal, but they are also doing so in open and public spaces. Part of the politics, as described by people all over the world, is the need to come together and to do so without hierarchy and in open spaces, not only where all can look at one another but where a space in society is opened up and changed, whether that be a park or an occupied plaza. This opening of space is not limited to cities and large towns either. I have spoken to dozens of people involved in the movement in the United States from small towns and villages, who meet on a street corner or in a local plaza, perhaps with only a few dozen people but still in public space. In one such instance it is a village of only three hundred people. The importance is being visible to others and using and changing space. It is part of the politics of intervening in a larger conversation but on our own terms.
     The importance of location to the Occupy movement—consistently sited
in public spaces so as to gather participants face to face—cannot be underestimated or seen as something coincidental: it is at the heart of the politics of the movement. Participants at each site of occupation choose to gather together and decide their own agenda. Occupiers are not protesting the state or city governments and asking them to resolve the problems of society: the politics of the movement necessarily imply that the state cannot fix the problems of society. Of course, this is not to say that things cannot be made better or that there are not countless things the Occupiers want changed, such as access to housing, education, food, and so on, but the crux of the politics is that the point of reference is not above (it is not the state) but across (looking to one another and in horizontal ways). And from that vantage point tactics and strategies are decided.
     Sometimes, as with Occupy Wall Street, a place was chosen based on
politics. In the case of OWS, many assemblies occurred before the actual occupation to decide what might be the best possible locations (of which there was a list of eight potentials). Settling on Zuccotti Park was indeed a political choice, both being in the Wall Street area and also being a privatized park. But the point was, again, not to make a demand. One of the first decisions of the assembly in OWS was to rename the park Liberty Plaza, claiming it as a collective space and not, for example, asking that it be made public or demanding more public space in New York. Again, we see the gaze of Occupiers focused not on demands of the “other” but on and among themselves.
     In Argentina the use of space and concept of territory was also central.
This was true for the neighborhood assembly movement, the unemployed movements, and the recuperated workplaces. People spoke of a new place

## 318 | C h  p    10

where they were meeting, one without the forms of institutional powers that previously existed. As one assembly participant described:
      I understand horizontalidad in terms of the metaphor of territories,
      and a way of practicing politics through the construction of territory,
      it is grounded there, and direct democracy has to do with this. It is
      like it needs to occupy a space.
    The recuperated workplace movement, now numbering close to three
hundred workplaces, organized under the slogan of “Occupy, Resist, Produce,” are almost all run horizontally and without bosses or hierarchy and are necessarily located in specific geographic spaces. Within this space of the workplace, workers speak of the construction of new territories—and by this they are referring to not only the fact that they have occupied a space but the ways in which they are running the workplaces together and in solidarity with people from the community and other workplaces. The new territory is created in how they run the workplace, not just in the fact of taking it over.
    The unemployed workers movements first began as protests demanding
an unemployment subsidy from the state, but shortly thereafter, in the midst of the protests, they began to create something different together. Their protest took the form of a blockade: not having a place of work, they took to bridges or major intersections, with the intention of shutting down that major artery. At the same time, while blockading, they were creating horizontal assemblies to decide what to do and developing an entire infrastructure of food, health care, media, and child care, together opening up a new space on the other side, yet as a part of the blockade. Many began to refer to this space as new, free “teritorio” (territory). Raúl Zibechi’s book Territorios en resistencia: Cartografía de las periferias urbanas latinoamericanos, published in 2009, deals precisely with this issue. He speaks to the importance of territory as places that are rapidly becoming sites not only of struggle but of organization. As Zibechi describes elsewhere:
      The real divergence from previous time periods is the creation of
      territories: the long process of conformation of a social sector that
      can only be built while constructing spaces to house the differences.
      Viewed from the popular sectors, from the bottom of our societies,
      these territories are the product of the roots of different social relations. Life is spread out in its social, cultural, economic, and political
      totality through initiatives of production, health, education, celebration, and power in these physical spaces.

MgNC BK ND NoW M The various sites of the Occupy movement have all created the same two features, and ones that must be explored in depth and taken seriously: horizontal spaces and new territories in which to create new social relationships.
     “Marx says that revolutions are the locomotive of world history. But perhaps it is quite otherwise. Perhaps revolutions are an attempt by the passengers on the train—namely, the human race—to activate the emergency
brake.” Walter Benjamin’s words perfectly illuminate what has been going on around the globe throughout 2011—and in many places before this as well, such as with the Zapatistas in Chiapas, Mexico, and in Argentina. The movements are about shouting, “No!,” “Ya basta!,” “Que se vayan todos!,” about the collective refusal to remain passive in an untenable situation. And so we pull the emergency brake, and in that moment freeze time and begin to open up and create something totally new. It is still not totally clear what is, and that is a part of it. There is a desire to stop time and open something new, creating new relationships and more free spaces. What this looks like is being discovered, as a part of the process, as it is created, which is also how it is being created, horizontally and in geographic space.

Assemblies are held every evening at 6 .., with people of a wide diversity of ages and social classes taking part. The plaza begins to fill around 5 .. with circles of people standing and sitting, talking under cardboard signs to identify the theme of their discussion, including groups on economics, education, facilitation, feminism, housing, and ecology.
    Then, around 5:30 .. high school students march in together, chanting
and singing behind sheets painted with their school names. By assembly time there are always medical, legal, media, library, and kitchen areas. And, somehow, as with every occupation I have witnessed, there is a meditation circle a

BMMNg Wh DMoCC Paris is alive with democracy. Real democracy. Overflowing the streets and squares. People speaking and hearing one another in assembly after assembly. Growing in number, geography, and diversity. The movement that first began with high school students rebelling against the police killing of a student, and then mass resistance to a potential rollback of long-held labor protections, spread to people speaking in squares, trying to occupy them at night, being repressed, and coming back the next day, and the next, and the next.
    This is not a protest. People here are creating something different. They
are not making one demand—they are speaking to one another insisting on “real democracy,” meaning face-to-face discussions about their own lives and things that matter most to them. And when and if they do come up with demands, it will have been out of these sorts of discussions—decided horizontally and together. There are now dozens of squares holding assemblies nightly in France alone. Many more dozens of similarly organized movements are springing up in other parts of Europe and Canada as I write.
    Topics of discussion vary, though the most substantive conversations happen in the various commissions and in the neighborhoods where more assemblies are springing up. These discussions are then brought back as reports
to the general assembly. After only two weeks the assembly decided that consensus, while appealing in so many ways, was not working and moved to a combined form of voting with consensus. The movement is learning through practice and together with people from other movements, like Occupy Wall Street and the 15-M movement, who are also there in the squares to support and share experiences.
    So many things are consistent in Paris with the other movements for real
democracy, from the importance of the face-to-face discussions, the exclusion of political parties, the striving for horizontal relations, the breaking down of hierarchy, and the care of and for one another as much as possible—even if only in those hours of togetherness.
    And of course the contagion of the hand signals to make one’s feelings
known in a mass crowd, such as the twinkling of fingers in the air for agreement or the crossing of one’s arms in the air to show dissent. The Feminist Commission has added a new sign, reflecting the evolution of the movements, which is two fists meeting above one’s head to call out a sexist remark.

Something different happens when taking place in assemblies with others, listening to what strangers have to say, and taking care of one another.
     The fact that every occupation insists on having food for those in need,
basic medical and legal support, as well as space to just be quiet, to meditate, or to help with conflict resolution or mediation, reflects the seriousness with which the movements approach the question of relationships in the here and now.
     And of course there is the joy—the music, songs, and dancing that manifest this joy at a newfound togetherness. I joked earlier about the drumming
in every square around the world, but it is a space where people can be free to move and to feel. Drumming can be a release of so many deep sentiments, creating feelings of togetherness and well-being. In Paris people relayed how they are smiling at one another more, while in the United States in 2011 people spoke of all the hugs that would be given in greetings. In Argentina, the language of affect, care, and love similarly predominated.
     It is clear that the Movements of the Squares—or Real Democracy Movements—that began in late 2010 are in no way ending: they are moving,
popping up again and again around the globe as they change form, as they will continue to do. Movements are not linear; they move, have ebbs and flows. The movement in Paris may continue to spread and grow until there is enough popular power to govern from below. Or it may dissipate from the squares, relocating into other spheres of life—perhaps to come back again even larger and more grounded in different neighborhoods, workplaces, and schools. Or some combination of both of these. Or not. The future is yet to be determined.
oM D fo goNg foWD So what does all of this mean for those of us in places where mass assemblies are not yet taking off—or are not taking off again right now?
    I was recently part of the effort to draft “Some Possible Ideas for Going
Forward,” an open call for a discussion on what a people’s agenda might look like. Rather than discussing and responding to what others say they will do— or not do—for us, we ask what we want and how we could make it happen.
    In the document we use the language of a program, not in the sense
of political party platform but as a possible plan for collective action. The

## 32 2 | C h  p    10

intention is to spark conversations—ideally in person, face-to-face—in assemblies. There are many signers to the document, with people from different backgrounds and perspectives. The intention is to generate space for a diversity of positions. Mine is that of direct democracy and the formation of local and regional assemblies.
    Afghan and Sudanese refugees who had been sleeping rough are invited
to install themselves at Place de la République.
    The document is organized thematically, with issues such as gender,
health, education, race, housing, and so on—themes not dissimilar from the commissions established in Paris or the working groups at Occupy and 15-M. Why not organize a conversation with a few people at lunch? At your university? In a plaza or square? We don’t have to start with the expectation that we will launch a Nuit Debout, 15-M, or Occupy Wall Street right away. We just have to start talking to one another about our political agenda, and doing so face-to-face, making careful use of technology.
    Many people are already doing this, of course—but ours is a call to continue these conversations, to deepen them and think together toward a future
where we have a more coordinated concept of what we want and how we might make it happen.
    Imagine if before Occupy or Nuit Debout informal and formal groups as
well as neighborhoods and student groups had already come to loose agreement on a number of things, like, for example, the right to housing and the importance of taking over empty buildings to make it real. Or, using the example of the Solidarity Health Clinics in Greece, people could have decided that we should create free health care in a way that also reimagines the very meaning of health and care. Then, with that base of agreement, the working groups might develop concrete proposals or actions that could take place almost immediately.
    This is the sort of thing that I imagine this document could help
inspire—people coming together to think about what is important to us and how we might make it happen. Even if this does not happen right now, it could lay the groundwork for future possibilities—and gathering hundreds of thousands of people in squares around a country or region is a very real possibility for action on those things on which we agree.
CNg  NW foC I am confident that there will be more occupations of public spaces and more assemblies. Until we live in a real democracy, it is up to us to create such spaces—and we will. But what if next time we had more preparation? More conversations about the things we have in common, the things that are most

important to us? Could we move faster? Move on toward taking over schools and workplaces?
     Here I am imagining the Spanish Revolution of the 1930s and how it was
able to move so fast precisely because people had been organizing and talking together for years about what they wanted and how they might make it a reality. Taking over land and running it in common, even taking over banks, was much less of a debate, as the need for such decisive action already enjoyed a general consensus in the discussions of the prior years. As the Nuit Debout Facebook page writes at the moment I am concluding these reflections [in 2016]:
    We are more than 100,000 people on this page. We are in 150 cities,
    #partoutdebout, in France and dozens of cities around the world. We
    are also #banlieuesdebout, #artistesdebout and many other things! We
    are 100,000 and soon we will be millions—in the process of creating
    a new force that will displace the old world.

     1. My choice to translate horizontalidad into horizontalism in 2005 was perhaps in
error; it is actually an anti-ism, and the use of horizontalism might now have created some confusion. At the time, I made the decision thinking that it would be a play on the word and that translations such as horizontality did not suciently reect a changing relationship.
     2. I traveled to Greece, London, and Berlin in November 2011 and spoke with people
in the various Occupy movements.
