In March  Ptr Kropotkin agrd to giv si lcturs to William Morris’s Socialist Socity in Hammrsmith, London. Lalling th sris “Social Evolution,” h plannd to plor “th grounds” o socialism.1 As it turnd out, h nvr dlivrd th talks, ut th titl and timing, just a yar or h pulishd his rst ssay on mutual aid, hint at th contnt. H l a iggr clu whn h told Morris’s daughtr May that h had n working on th sris during his rcnt tour o Scotland. According to local prss rports, on o th issus on Kropotkin’s mind was th asiility o socialism. Prhaps rashly, givn that on critic had dismissd his socialism as a util, dangrous schm to “rach Arcady through anarchy,” h told an Ardn mting that too many workrs attractd to socialism still livd it impractical.2 Th account o social volution h outlind in Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution was a rspons to this scpticism and it has sinc com his most clratd rutation.
       Th concpt o mutual aid is outlind in ight ssays. Th rst,
“Mutual Aid among Animals,” was pulishd in  in th journal The Nineteenth Century. By , Kropotkin had compltd th othrs. Th rsulting ook was pulishd in , ut Kropotkin continud to dvlop th concpt, notaly in Anarchism: Its Philosophy and Ideal (); The State: Its Historic Role (); and Modern Science and Anarchism (). Som thirty yars ar starting his invstigations, h issud his nal, incomplt statmnt, posthumously pulishd as Ethics, Origin and Development (). Each nw itration rought out a difrnt act o th concpt: th rprssiv charactr o th modrn Europan stat, th impulss driving mplary haviours, th asis o moral action, th principl o justic that morality dscrid, and th structural mchanisms or its acculturation. Th common thrad tying ths strands togthr was Kropotkin’s viw that socialism tappd an innat tndncy to cooprat common to all living things. Socialism was nithr th utopists’ candy mountain nor th salvationists’ pi in th sky. It was a potntial altrnativ. Th thrust o
Kropotkin’s argumnt was that isting disciplinary, ploitativ ordrs had institutionalizd comptition and individual struggl, wrongly pr- snting this haviour as natural. Against this, th thory o mutual aid dmonstratd that thr was nothing invital, prordaind, much lss moral or good aout ths arrangmnts. Natur was plastic and thr- or mallal to orcs capal o uilding convivial, lirtarian social systms.
      Mutual Aid lnds itsl to multipl intrprtations. This is partly
caus Kropotkin thorisd it y intrvning in a longstanding dat aout th social and thical implications o Charls Darwin’s Origin of Species. In doing so, h nthusiastically adoptd Victorian intrdisciplinary convntions, rading across th arts and scincs to marshal vidnc rom zoology, history, art and nwr disciplins, notaly sociology, thnography and anthropology, which wr qually multiactd.3 Ironically, as Kropotkin dcrid spcialisation, th synthtic quality o Mutual Aid has sinc nald tams o scholars in th humanitis and natural and social scincs to ring thir spcial disciplinary prspctivs to ar on it. Sinc th pulication o Danil P. Tods’s pivotal ssay in , Mutual Aid is now commonly situatd in a roadr ody o Russian volutionary thought.4 But th divrsity o th litratur on it and th rang o its concptual rsonancs is vast.5 In th othr part, Kropotkin dvlopd critical Russian volutionary iology to show how his account o Darwinian thory posd th aws in compting li systms. Kropotkin livd th principl o mutual aid scotchd Christian moralising, utilitarianism, Marist matrialism and Nitzschan individualism.6 His naturalistic, “scintic” dnc o anarchism thus lnds itsl to comparison with all ths standpoints, whil also nourishing critics intrstd in uncovring anarchism’s ssntialist rrors.7
Mutual Aid and Evolutionary Theory Kropotkin idntid Thomas Huly, grandathr o th novlist and philosophr Aldous Huly and Darwin’s “ulldog,” as th lading proponnt o th social Darwinist viw that natur was st dscrid as a comptitiv ght or individual advantag. Th viw, popularisd y Hrrt Spncr, was a sociological rndring o Darwin’s account o natural slction, th mchanism plaining th inhritanc o chanc variations fctiv or survival. Rcasting Darwin’s “struggl or istnc” as th “survival o th ttst,” th social Darwinists conatd struggl with comptition and appald to “natur” to stalish th “goodnss” o individualistic, com- ativ social systms, notaly laissz-air liralism.
       Kropotkin’s viw, sinc partially validatd y th lading volutionary iologist Stphn Jay Gould, was that Darwin had himsl opnd th
door to Spncr’s sociological rworking o his thsis y accpting Thomas Malthus’s calculations aout population incrass outstripping ood supplis to uild an assumption o scarcity into his ramwork.8 This narrowd th maning o struggl to “rivalry,” ovrshadowing th rich “mtaphorical” concption Darwin had invokd in th Origin. Undrstood as a mtaphor, “struggl” involvd cological and spcis’ intrdpndnc and it rcognisd that individuals struggld collctivly to ovrcom nvironmntal hardships and protct thir ofspring. Th priority which Darwin accordd to Malthus—wrongly in Kropotkin’s viw—downplayd ths mods o action. Th rsult was to distract attntion rom th advantags that individuals drivd rom coopration. Mutual aid was intndd to corrct this ias y rstoring th missing actor o volution to Darwin’s account. Somtims drawing on osrvations h had mad during his pditions in Siria in th s and ’s, Kropotkin usd th rst two chaptrs o th ook, “Mutual Aid among Animals,” to argu that (i) spcis struggl against “advrs circumstancs o climat, or against vicious nmis,” (ii) that “ral comptition and struggl” within spcis is rar, (iii) that “trmination” only occurs as a rsult o human action, not intrspcis comptition, and (iv) that migrations or nvironmntal changs account or inhritd variations.9
       Soon ar th ook’s pulication, Kropotkin prssd this argumnt.
In a scond st o ssays or The Nineteenth Century, h dtachd Malthus rom Darwin’s work, fctivly lvating th mtaphorical ovr th narrow concption o struggl.10 Stopping short o radicating natural slction rom Darwin’s work altogthr, h argud that th dirct impact o th nvironmnt plaind th inhritanc o acquird charactristics qually wll. In addition, th wight o modrn scinc inclind towards this viw. Whn Kropotkin invstigatd th volution o Darwin’s rsarch, h nally wrot Malthus out. It turnd out that Darwin had also avourd th dirct impact o th nvironmnt ovr natural sction ut had unortunatly n unal ully to rvis his pulishd work or h did. According to Kropotkin, natural slction had n a working hypothsis, not Darwin’s sttld viw. Driving a wdg twn Darwin and his “vulgarisrs” in , Kropotkin rturnd to his main thm. Th Darwinists had “succdd in prsuading mn that th last word o Scinc was a pitilss individual struggl or li.”11 Disintrstd rsarch dmonstratd that this was untru: “[T]h prominnc which is now ginning to  givn to th dirct action o th nvironmnt in th volution o spcis, y liminating th Malthusian ida
aout th ncssity o comptition to th kni twn all th individuals o a givn spcis or volving nw spcis, opns th way or a quit di- rnt comprhnsion o th struggl or li, and o Natur altogthr.”12
     Kropotkin’s dcision to spotlight Huly rathr than Spncr as
Darwin’s chi vulgarisr was curious, oth caus it was Spncr not Huly who was his prrrd liral antagonist and caus Huly’s Darwinism was amiguous.13 In all liklihood, it was th complity o Huly’s position that mad him intrsting to Kropotkin. Huly ttd th social Darwinist mould insoar as h accptd th narrow concption o struggl and, thror, th validity o th imag o natur as an individual ght. Howvr, h rmly rjctd its thical implications. Supposing natur to  charactrisd y pitilss comat, Huly had concludd that human ings rquird suprnatural systms to prvnt thm rom alling into loody anarchy. Whil Kropotkin rgardd Huly’s agnostic turn to th suprnatural as wronghadd, h also spottd an opportunity in Huly’s apparnt quivocation.
     In th  introduction to Mutual Aid h rrrd radrs to his pu-
lishd critiqu o Huly’s position, plaining that a rptition was yond th ook’s scop.14 But this was ar rom his last word. I Kropotkin’s main concrn was thn to rstor th status o coopration to volutionary thory and indicat its social ramications, Mutual Aid clard th way or a mor amitious plan to show that anarchy was in act a sl-rgulating thical systm, not th chaos that th Darwinists and lgions o political philosophrs supposd. Huly’s mdly o scinc, liralism, and thology was th prct launchpad to prsnt this naturalistic account, and it nald him to sprad his critical nt widly. Writing to Bakunin’s ormr comrad Jams Guillaum in , Kropotkin rcommndd mutual aid as th “most athist anti-rligious” argumnt. H plaind that “tracd rom th lowr animals to us,” it “drivs out no-Christianity,” shows that Christianity taught nothing that “ants would not hav ‘practicd in thir nsts’” and that th commandmnt to lov on’s nighour had only “opnd th door to th most raid individualism.”15
     Kropotkin ound a tmplat or anarchist thics in th work o JanMari Guyau, having idntid him in  as an intllctual whos work
challngd prvailing authoritarian logics ramd y “th assumption o govrnmnt, a Had—God or th Gods—and . . . th law or th Stat.”16 Guyau, Kropotkin plaind in Ethics, had argud that “li manists itsl in growth, in multiplication, in sprading” and that thics was “was a taching aout th mans through which Natur’s spcial aim is attaind,—th growth and dvlopmnt o li.” This taching, ncapsulatd in th phras,
“morality without sanction or oligation” was that “th moral lmnt in man nds . . . no corcion, no compulsory oligation, no sanction rom aov; it dvlops in us y virtu o th vry nd o man to liv a ull, intnsiv, productiv li.”17 In othr words, it volvd through th pri- nc and practic o coopration.
      Th upshot o Kropotkin’s critiqu o Huly was that natur pointd
to th “naturalnss” o anarchy. Lik his liral opponnts, Kropotkin appald to th istnc o an volutionary mchanism to promot his prrrd social arrangmnts. Accordingly, Mutual Aid is ppprd with ampls o cooprativ haviours in human and nonhuman spcis. Emphasising th moral valu o coopration, Kropotkin also attriuts “human” virtus to nonhuman haviours: Jackals ar “couragous,” and marmots undrtak “citizns’ dutis.”18 Yt th ralignmnt o natur to anarchy did not amount to a rductiv concption o natur as “good,” nor did Kropotkin prsnt “natur” as a pristin condition. His argumnt is that “natur” is moralisd through social practic and natural and cosmic worlds ar in constant u. His grand plan to produc a “naturalistic concption o th univrs” was linkd to th rormulation or anarchization o all lds o knowldg—“sociology, lgislation, philosophy, thics and gnral scinc”—not to th dvlopmnt o nw knowldg.19 Th truth had alrady n told ut unortunatly isting scinc had n skwd y th authoritarian assumptions that scintists had rought to thir lds. For cnturis, pots, chroniclrs, and historians had “analyzd, dscrid, and glorid” th manouvrings o militarists, thocrats, autocrats.20 Scintists had imid thir accounts o conqust and domination. Eposing “thos aspcts o Natur” that groundd “human Ethics” was a small ut important componnt in Kropotkin’s antiauthoritarian corrctiv.21 It nald him to argu that comptition, and th command structurs justid y th prcivd nd to mitigat its worst fcts, wr unncssary or th njoymnt o social li.22 Th urthr valuation o th “goodnss” o altrnativ social arrangmnts h proposd was a mattr o social thory, not iology. Th ulk o Mutual Aid was gard towards this nd.
Mutual Aid and Social Theory Kropotkin organisd th study o mutual aid in human socitis in our sctions. Just as h ollowd Victorian convntions y humanizing nonhuman haviour, h structurd his social thory y using trms that pr- vaild in Europan civilising narrativs. His opning study o mutual aid “among savags,” was ollowd y an amination o mutual aid “among
ararians.” This ld to an tndd discussion o mutual aid in th mdi- val city-stats and, nally, mutual aid “among ourslvs.”
      Kropotkin’s jarring trminology was mddd in Europan
Enlightnmnt natural historis. Although ightnth cntury usag was idologically compl, y th nintnth cntury convntions had hardnd such that th trminology gav “linguistic authority” to actual and rlativ classications o groups, rgions and nation stats.23 In a study o th liral thinkr John Stuart Mill, Indr Mahwah nots that th catgoris “savag” and “ararian” wr intgral to a thsis o sociocultural dvlopmnt pggd to wst Europan norms and valus.

But Mtchnikof ’s law o thr stags—“mchanical constraint,” “suordination” and “consnsus”—was othrwis mor closly alignd with th altruistic dri o August Comt’s sociology.

       Kropotkin mad no rrnc to Mtchnikof in Mutual Aid, ut thir

Thr is mor than a passing rsmlanc twn Kropotkin’s concpt o scintic mthod and Mtchnikof ’s. Kropotkin’s statmnt in Modern Science and Anarchism, that “man is part o natur . . . as much a phnomnon o natur as is th growth o a owr or th volution o social li amongst th ants and s,” is somtims rad as vidnc o his naivly positivist stanc.30 But in act it chos Mtchnikof ’s critiqu o Comt’s narrowly humanist positivist sociology. Lalling his altrnativ approach “anorganology,” Mtchnikof notd dryly that “w do not want much prspicacity to distinguish an ass rom a owr, or oth rom a ston,” or adding “th mor w nlarg our knowldg o natural li, th lss w com al to  any limit twn vgtal and animal organisms, or twn organisms gnrally and minral odis.”31
       Kropotkin’s spcial contriution to anarchist social thory was to
historicis th sris and analys th progrssiv tnsion o mutual aid in difrnt social sttings. Accordingly, h distinguishs “savag” and “ararian” communitis y thir associativ practics. “Savag” socitis ar closd amily groups. Association is asd on a lood ti. “Bararian” ordrs ar composd o clans with ral or imagind common roots. Hr, association is trritorial, uilt on th villag community. In Mtchnikof ’s trms, oth orms o associations ar “conscious.” Th ky difrnc twn thm is th dgr to which mutual aid tnds rom immdiat amily groups to strangrs. Th mdival city-stat is, thn, a nw stag in th sam sris. It was a union o guild and corporat associations, linkd to a ntwork o similar mutual aid associations. As Kropotkin put it, th city-stat was an “attmpt at organizing . . . a clos union or mutual aid and support, or consumption and production, and or social li togthr . . . giving ull lirty o prssion to th crativ gnius o ach sparat group o individuals in art, cras, scinc, commrc, and political organization.”32
      Adopting discourss o colonialism, Kropotkin turnd dominant
civilization narrativs on thir had. His analysis is conttualisd, not astract. It difrs markdly rom Jan-Jacqus Roussau’s modlling o th nol savag in th stat o natur. Admittdly, Kropotkin prsntd “savag” and “ararian” communitis in a progrssiv sris lading to th mdival city-stat. But i his clration o th city-stat trayd a trouling Eurocntric or wstrn ias,33 his account o history was not linar, as Matthw Adams nots.34 Thr ar advancs and rvrsals in th practic o mutual aid across th difrnt sttings. Th city-stat was rmarkal ut a ailur: it gav ris to th modrn colonising Europan stat. In contrast, th villag community stimulatd th mdival city and prsistd wll ar its collaps. Kropotkin also notd comparal shis in th ida o justic, rom “‘du rward’” to th “highr concption” o “‘no rvng or wrongs’” in ach o ths social ordrs.35 H plicitly rjctd as “unscintic” not only Roussau’s romanticism ut also th anti-Roussauan countr-narrativs that conatd “savag” with “savagry” and “ararian” with “araric.”36 So-calld “ararians . . . knw nothing o th horrid punishmnts introducd at a latr poch y th laic and canonic laws undr Roman and Byzantin inunc.”37 Similarly, whr Kropotkin nds vidnc o improvmnt, th magnitud is unspctacular. Noting th distinction twn domstic and “‘intr-trial’ law” in “savag” soci- tis, Kropotkin charactrisd th progrss “w Europans” hav mad “in radicating that doul concption in thics” as limitd, “not immns.”38 Adding a urthr qualication, h osrvd that incrasing social division and amily rakdown was a concomitant o th unimprssiv and largly aspirational advanc o solidarity within and across nations. In lvating this singular idal, Europans had aild to institutionalis th concpt and had succdd in wrcking othr, maningul social rlationships.
       Kropotkin’s outstanding suvrsion o th prvailing norms is his rprsntation o “savag” and “ararian” socitis as sl-govrning. Ths
modls o community hav thir own ruls, practics, institutions, and dcision-making procsss. Thr ar no prmannt ladrs, “no authority whatvr” to impos social ordr, only prsistnt thrats o domination and ladrship.39 A distinctiv atur o “savag” socity is th undamntal thic, “ach or all.”40 Th lading innovation o “ararian” organization, th villag community, an nduring social orm, transcnds lood tis, stalishs oundaris or privat and pulic li, pands th ralm o prsonal initiativ, and rsists thrats o domination y sparat clans and “minoritis o wizards, prists, and prossional or distinguishd warriors.”41
     Kropotkin’s argumnt that coopration is a suprior principl or
social organising than comptition rsts on th osrvations h maks aout th waknsss o mutual aid associations, notaly th city-stat. Th common thm is on o intrnal division lading to domination and th monopolisation o powr y proprtid, military and rligious lits. “Savag” communitis ar undrmind y “apparanc o a sparat amily amidst th clan.” Kropotkin notd, “a sparat amily mans sparat proprty and accumulation o walth,” ncssarily upstting “th stalishd unity” asd on communalism and communism. Rligious and military divisions ar cratd whn th “powr o witchcra” coms “a powr in th hands o th individual” to  usd “against th tri” and whn “wars and invasions” crat “casts o warriors whos association or clus acquird grat powr.”42 “Bararian” socitis ar pron to similar divisions. Th “walthist amilis, spcially i comining in sacrdotal unctions or military rput with walth” impos thir authority on th rst.43 So, too, th city-stats. Kropotkin plaind thir collaps with rrnc to th ris o prossional classs and th growing powr o corporations, spcially th Church; th sparation o citis rom surrounding countrysid, naling slavry to thriv yond th city walls; rlianc on commrc and industry to th nglct o agricultur, to provid or wll- ing.44 Kropotkin’s mssag is that comptition works st or minoritis and coopration is ttr insoar as it promots individual agrmnt and guards against domination. In Mtchnikof ’s trms, his conclusion is that comptition can only vr prss association as “suordination” whil coopration contains th sds o “consnsus.” Kropotkin splt out th implications in The State: Its Historic Role, inviting radrs to choos twn th options:

Evolution and Revolution Rvolutionary chang was th natural countrpart to Kropotkin’s volutionary social thory. Kropotkin’s proposals, outlind in The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops, wr to dscal and drat. H imagind th commun as th asic social unit with a nw political conomy o nds asd on th aolition o laour divisions, wag systms and intrnational trad supportd y th intgration o agricultur and industry in localitis. Mutual aid was th mans and th ojct o this transormation. Anarchist communism was a modl or “consnsus” which rquird coopration to ring it into ing.
       In th last two chaptrs o Mutual Aid, Kropotkin highlightd ampls o cooprativ practic to dmonstrat that th capacity or chang
ndurd vn in th harshst, most rprssiv nvironmnts.

For Kropotkin, it plaind th motivations o voluntrs in th British Lioat Association, who riskd thir livs at sa to sav othrs rom drowning. Th sam psychology drov Wlsh minrs to ntr collapsd min shas or th sak o llow-workrs urid undr tons o coal.
       Othr ampls o cooprativ practic, y ar th majority, point
to th importanc o th organizational aspcts o coopration. Having dscrid th dismal collaps o th city-stats and its disastrous cons- quncs, Kropotkin argud that thr wr signicant hols in th stat’s armour. Th stat rcisd an incrasingly tight grip on corporations, cooprativ socitis and associations that onc ourishd indpndntly o it, ut this was ar rom complt. Evn in Europ, Kropotkin was plasd to discovr that villag community continud to ist. Europ was “covrd with living survivals . . . and Europan country li is prmatd with customs and haits dating rom th community priod.”47 Mutual aid “customs and haits” animatd h “innr li” o Turkish villags and, likwis, “in th Ara djemmâa and th Agan purra, in th villags o Prsia, India, and Java, in th undividd amily o th Chins, in th ncampmnts o th smi-nomads o Cntral Asia and th nomads o th ar North.”48 In colonisd Arica, too, “notwithstanding all tyranny, opprssion, roris
and raids, trial wars, glutton kings, dciving witchs and prists, slav- huntrs, and th lik” th “nuclus o mutual-aid institutions, haits and customs, growing up in th tri and th villag community, rmains.”49 Colonisd popls did not rquir prparation or sl-govrnmnt. Thy did not nd th chis who had n mpowrd y colonisrs to rul thm or th rising class o local ducatd lits who sought to oust oth to implmnt dirct rul.
      Kropotkin was similarly nthusd y th nw orms o coopration
and mutual aid vstd in a plthora o cultural associations and, spcially, socialist organisations and actions: syndicats, trad unions, striks, political movmnts, nwspaprs. Som o ths wr outgrowths o traditional guilds or, in Russia artisan artels and othrs wr ntirly modrn mani- stations o coopration and solidarity, cratd to rsist domination and ploitation.
      Rvolution ntaild protcting, nurturing and tnding ths multi-
arious mutual aid organisations to acilitat th haitual prssion o th psychology. As a gloal rcis, th projct inscapaly hightnd divrsity. In this rspct, Kropotkin was nithr a traditionalist nor a modrnist. Th cooprativ associations containd within th naturalistic, sl-rgulating, thical anarchy h concptualisd wr compl, distinctiv, and adaptd to thir local nvironmnts. Th practic o mutual aid ound thm togthr, promising, too, to transorm th “Europan” aspiration or intrnational solidarity into a rality. Kropotkin’s mssag was that th only rout to rvolutionary chang was th tnsion o th principl o sl- govrnmnt, not th sprad o idology or adhrnc to party programm.
      In Mutual Aid Kropotkin usd his “anarchizd” volutionary thory
to attack advocats o stat ordr or “suordination.” Whil this includd laissz-air lirals and consrvativs o all strips, h promotd his concpt o rvolution to highlight th shortcomings o currnts within socialist and anarchist movmnts. In th s Mikhail Bakunin had idntid rpulicans and Marists as advocats o political thology, as antagonistic to anarchy as any asolutist or clric. Kropotkin ollowd suit ut idntid Nitzschans and Marists and th lading advocats o comptition and “suordination” lial to drail th socialist caus rom within. Th prolm with Nitzschanism turnd principally on th promotion o concpt o autonomy at odds with th psychology o mutual aid, though it also had an organizational aspct. For Kropotkin, Nitzschans wr individualists who ollowd ourgois norms rathr than anarchist principls o coopration. Not only did thy ail to undrstand th organizational dimnsions o social transormation ut thy
also undrmind th cohsion o th workrs’ associations. In doing so, thy dstroyd grassroots initiativs to considr conomic, political, and moral qustions “prcursory” to rvolutionary transormation.50 Writing to Alandr Brkman in , h rmarkd, “It is th Masss which mak th Rvolutions—not th Individuals.” Osrving that Europan workrs had “aandond” groups ar thy had n “invadd y all sorts o middl class tramps,” h addd, “vn th rally rvolutionary mindd individuals, i thy rmain isolatd, turn towards this Individualist Anarchism o th ourgois which is nothing ut th picuran let it go o th Economists, spicd with a w ‘trric’ phrass o Nihilism.” This was “ood to rightn th Philistins” and st l to “th Nitzsch’ists . . .

     I th Nitzschans’ loy dismissal o organization ndangrd th
sprad o mutual aid, th imposition o a singular modl was at last as dangrous to th prospcts o coopration. This was th thrat that Kropotkin livd cam rom Marism. Writing only a yar ar th pulication o th ook, Kropotkin plaind to Guillaum that th signicanc o Mutual Aid was twoold: it challngd th aulty prmiss o th social Darwinist thsis o comptition and it dmonstratd th tyrannous implications o th Marist thory o history. Th priority Mar attachd to th dvlopmnt o productiv orcs as th prrquisit or socialist transormation implid th tnsion o th comptitiv modl, not its aolition. Kropotkin told Guillaum that “their metaphysics is authoritarian.”52 Howvr laoratly Marists concptualisd th stat, thir thory o socialist transormation was prdicatd on th dstruction o traditional communal and cooprativ associations. Russia was upprmost in Kropotkin’s mind whn h wrot to Guillaum, ut th implications o his analysis wr mor ar-raching. Marism pointd to th aolition o mutual aid socitis, i not or th socialist sizur o powr, thn as soon as programms o collctivisation wr st in motion. Th aolition o villag communs would rduc millions o rural workrs to asolut misry and dstroy thir institutions to oot. A rsurgnt spirit o domination would supprss th psychology o mutual aid. Rvolution on th Marist modls was not th sam as social rvolution organisd “rom th ottom up.”
     Th thory o mutual aid is somtims rprsntd as an ovrly optimistic dpiction o human capaility. At worst, th accusation is that
Kropotkin prsntd an account o human goodnss that rality plods. Mutual aid is not a thsis aout human natur; it is a thory aout th capacity o humans to shap thir nvironmnts and  mouldd y thm. Kropotkin livd to s his worst ars aout socialism ralisd. But not vn
that stack has smothrd th capacity or mutual aid or th willingnss o local associations activly to mrac it.

      In th s, a Huron-Wndat statsman namd Kondiaronk, who

Th rsulting thoris o social volution

     In th lat nintnth and arly twntith cntury, th anarchist critiqu o th liral stat—that th rul o law was ultimatly asd on
aritrary violnc, and ultimatly simply a scularizd vrsion o an allpowrul God that could crat morality caus it stood outsid it—was takn so sriously y dndrs o th stat that right-wing lgal thorists lik Carl Schmitt ultimatly cam up with th intllctual armatur or ascism.

Schmitt’s vry concption o political thology, oundational or almost all contmporary right-wing thought, was an attmpt to answr Bakunin’s God and the State.
     Th challng posd y Kropotkin’s Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution
argualy runs dpr still, as it’s not just aout th natur o govrnmnt ut also th natur o natur—that is, rality—itsl.
     Thoris o social volution, what Turgot rst christnd “progrss,”
might hav gun as a way o dusing th challng o th indignous critiqu, ut thy soon gan to tak a mor virulnt orm, as hardcor lirals lik Hrrt Spncr gan to rprsnt social volution not just as a mattr o incrasing complity, difrntiation, and intgration ut also as a kind o Hosian struggl or survival. Th phras “survival o th ttst” was actually coind in  y Spncr, to dscri human history— and ultimatly, on assums, to justiy Europan gnocid and colonialism. It was only takn up y Darwin som tn yars latr, whn, in The Origin of Species, h usd it as a way o dscriing th orms o natural slction h had idntid in his amous pdition to th Galapagos Islands. At th tim Kropotkin was writing, in th s and ’s, Darwin’s idas had n takn up y markt lirals, most notoriously his “ulldog” Thomas Huly, and th English naturalist Alrd Russl Wallac, to propound what’s on calld a “gladiatorial viw” o natural history. Spcis duk it out lik ors in a ring or ond tradrs on a markt oor, and th strong prvail.
     Kropotkin’s rspons—that coopration is just as dcisiv a actor in
natural slction as comptition—was not ntirly original. H nvr pr- tndd that it was. In act h was not only drawing on th st iological, anthropological, archaological, and historical knowldg availal in his day, including his own plorations o Siria, ut also on an altrnativ
Russian school o volutionary thory, which hld that th English hyprcomptitiv school was asd on, as h put it, “a tissu o asurditis”: mn lik “Ksslr, Svrtsov, Mnzir, Brandt—our grat Russian zoologists, and a h lssr on, Poliakov, and nally mysl, a simpl travlr.”
     Still, w must giv Kropotkin crdit. H was much mor than a simpl
travlr. Such mn had n succssully ignord y English Darwinians in th hyday o mpir and, indd, y almost vryon ls. Kropotkin’s shot across th ows was not. In part, this was no dout caus h pr- sntd his scintic ndings in a largr political contt, in a orm that mad it impossil to dny just how much th rigning vrsion o Darwinian scinc was itsl not just an unconscious rction o takn-or-grantd liral catgoris. (As Mar amously put it, “Th anatomy o Man is th ky to th anatomy o th ap.”) It was an attmpt to catapult th viws o th commrcial classs into univrsality. Darwinism at that tim was still a conscious, militant political intrvntion to rshap common sns—a cntrist insurgncy or, prhaps ttr, a would- cntrist insurgncy, sinc it was aimd at crating a nw cntr. It was not yt common sns; it was an attmpt to crat a nw univrsal common sns. I it was not, ultimatly, compltly succssul, it was in a crtain masur caus o th vry powr o Kropotkin’s countrargumnt.
     It is not dicult to s what mad ths liral intllctuals so unasy.
Considr th amous passag rom th introduction to Mutual Aid, which dsrvs to  quotd in ull:
    It is not lov, and not vn sympathy (undrstood in its propr sns)
    which inducs a hrd o ruminants or o horss to orm a ring in ordr
    to rsist an attack o wolvs; not lov which inducs wolvs to orm a
     pack or hunting; not lov which inducs kittns or lams to play, or
    a dozn o spcis o young irds to spnd thir days togthr in th
    autumn; and it is nithr lov nor prsonal sympathy which inducs
     many thousand allow-dr scattrd ovr a trritory as larg as
    Franc to orm into a scor o sparat hrds, all marching towards a
    givn spot, in ordr to cross thr a rivr. It is a ling innitly widr
    than lov or prsonal sympathy—an instinct that has n slowly
     dvlopd among animals and mn in th cours o an trmly long
     volution, and which has taught animals and mn alik th orc thy
     can orrow rom th practic o mutual aid and support, and th joys
    thy can nd in social li. . . .
        It is not lov and not vn sympathy upon which Socity is
    asd in mankind. It is th conscinc— it only at th stag o an
    instinct—o human solidarity. It is th unconscious rcognition o
    th orc that is orrowd y ach man rom th practic o mutual
    aid; o th clos dpndnc o vry on’s happinss upon th happinss o all; and o th sns o justic, or quity which rings th
    individual to considr th rights o vry othr individual as qual to
    his own. Upon this road and ncssary oundation th still highr
    moral lings ar dvlopd.
     On nd only considr th virulnc o th raction. At last two lds
o study (admittdly, ovrlapping ons) socioiology and volutionary psychology, hav sinc n cratd spcically to rconcil Kropotkin’s points aout coopration twn animals with th assumption that w ar all ultimatly drivn y, as Dawkins was ultimatly to put it, our “slsh gns.” Whn th British iologist J.B.S. Haldan rportdly said that h would  willing to lay down his li to sav “two rothrs, our hal-roth- rs or ight rst cousins,” h was simply parroting th kind o “scintic” calculus that was introducd vrywhr to answr Kropotkin, in th sam way that progrss was invntd to chck Kondiaronk, or th doctrin o th stat o cption, to chck Bakunin. Th phras “slsh gn” was not chosn ortuitously. Kropotkin had rvald havior in th natural world that was actly th opposit o slshnss: th ntir gam o Darwinists now is to nd som rason, any rason, to continu to insist that vn th most playul, loving, whimsical, hroically sl-sacricing, or social havior is rally slsh ar all.
     Th forts o th intllctual right to mt th normity o th challng prsntd y Kropotkin’s thory ar undrstandal. As w hav
alrady pointd out, this is prcisly what thy ar supposd to  doing. This is why thy ar rrrd to as “ractionaris.” Thy don’t rally liv in political crativity as a valu in itsl—in act thy nd it prooundly dangrous. As a rsult, right-wing intllctuals ar mainly thr to ract to idas put orward y th L. But what aout th intllctual L?
     This is whr things gt a it conusing. Whil th right-wing intllctuals sought to nutraliz Kropotkin’s volutionary holism y dvloping
ntir intllctual systms, th Marist L prtndd that his intrvntion had nvr occurrd. On might vn hazard to say that th Marist rspons to Kropotkin’s mphasis on cooprativ dralism was to urthr dvlop th aspcts o Mar’s own thory that pulld most sharply in th othr dirction: that is, its most productivist and progrssivist aspcts. Rich insights rom Mutual Aid wr at st ignord and, at worst, rushd of with a patronizing chuckl. Thr has n such a prsistnt tndncy
in Marist scholarship and l-laning scholarship in gnral to ridicul Kropotkin’s “lioat socialism” and “naiv utopianism” that a rnownd iologist, Stphn Jay Gould, lt complld to insist, in a  ssay, that “Kropotkin was no crackpot.”
      Thr ar two possil planations or this stratgic dismissal. On is
pur sctarianism. As alrady notd, Kropotkin’s intllctual intrvntion was part o a largr political projct. Th lat nintnth cntury and arly twntith saw th oundations o th wlar stat, whos ky institutions wr, indd, largly cratd y mutual aid groups, ntirly indpndntly o th stat, thn gradually co-optd y stats and political partis. Most right and l intllctuals wr prctly alignd on this on: Bismarck ully admittd h cratd Grman social wlar institutions as a “ri” to th working class so thy would not com socialists; socialists insistd that anything rom social insuranc to pulic liraris  run not y th nighorhood and syndical groups that cratd thm ut y top-down vanguardist partis. In this contt oth saw writing of Kropotkin’s thical socialist proposals as tomoolry as a paramount imprativ. It’s also worth rmmring that—partly or this vry rason—in th priod twn  and , anarchist and lirtarian Marist idas wr much mor popular among th working class than th Marism o Lnin and Kautsky. It took th victory o Lnin’s ranch o th Bolshvik party in Russia (at th tim, considrd th right wing o th Bolshviks), and th supprssion o th Sovits, Proltkult, and othr ottom-up initiativs in th Sovit Union itsl, to nally put ths dats to rst.
      Thr’s anothr possil planation, which has mor to do with what
might  calld th “positionality” o oth traditional Marism and contmporary social thory. What is th rol o a radical intllctual? Most intllctuals still do claim to  radicals o som sort or anothr. In thory thy all agr with Mar that it’s not nough to undrstand th world; th point is to chang it. But what dos this actually man in practic?
      In on important paragraph o Mutual Aid, Kropotkin ofrs a suggstion: th rol o a radical scholar is to “rstor th ral proportion twn
conict and union.” This might sound oscur, ut h claris. Radical scholars ar “ound to ntr a minut analysis o th thousands o acts and aint indications accidntally prsrvd in th rlics o th past; to intrprt thm with th aid o contmporary thnology; and ar having hard so much aout what usd to divid mn, to rconstruct ston y ston th institutions which usd to unit thm.”
      This rcommndation should  rad with that o Karl Mar, whos
nrgy wnt into undrstanding th organization and dvlopmnt o
capitalist commodity production. In Capital, th only ral attntion to coopration is an amination o cooprativ activitis as orms and consquncs o actory production, whr workrs “mrly orm a particular mod o istnc o capital.” It would sm that th projcts o th two authors complmnt ach othr vry wll. Kropotkin aimd to undrstand prcisly what an alinatd workr had lost. But to intgrat th two would man to undrstand how vn capitalism is ultimatly oundd on communism (“mutual aid”), vn i it’s a communism it dos not acknowldg; how communism is not an astract, distant idal, impossil to maintain, ut a livd practical rality w all ngag in daily, to difrnt dgrs, and that vn actoris could not oprat without it—vn i much o it oprats on th sly, twn th cracks, or shis, or inormally, or in what’s not said, or ntirly suvrsivly. It’s com ashional latly to say that capitalism has ntrd a nw phas in which it has com parasitical o orms o crativ coopration, largly on th intrnt. This is nonsns. It has always n so.
      This is a worthy intllctual projct, ut or som rason, almost no
on is intrstd in carrying it out. Instad o amining how th rlations o hirarchy and ploitation ar rproducd, rusd, and ntangld with rlations o mutual aid, how rlations o car com continuous with rlations o violnc ut nonthlss hold togthr systms o violnc so that thy don’t ntirly all apart, oth traditional Marism and contmporary social thory hav stuornly dismissd prtty much anything suggstiv o gnrosity, coopration, or altruism as a ourgois illusion. Conict and goistic calculation provd to  mor intrsting than “union.” (Similarly, it is airly common or acadmic lists to writ aout Carl Schmitt or Turgot, whil is almost impossil to nd thos who writ aout Bakunin and Kondiaronk.)

      Admittdly, this kind o intrnalization o th nmy rachd its hyday

Through sharing knowledge, resources, and good company, crafting guilds enable individuals to develop their skills. Individuals are able to expand their craft through collective learning and skill sharing, nding joy in creating together. In the example of quilting guilds, often works produced
     are gifted to people in hospice care, exiting
prisons, or accessing domestic violence shelters.

     As soon as w study animals—not in laoratoris and musums only,
ut in th orst and th prairi, in th stpp and th mountains—w at onc prciv that though thr is an immns amount o warar and

Sociaility is as much a law o natur as mutual struggl. O cours it would  trmly dicult to stimat, howvr roughly, th rlativ numrical importanc o oth ths sris o acts.

I th numrlss acts which can  rought orward to support this viw ar takn into account, w may saly say that mutual aid is as much a law o animal li as mutual struggl, ut that, as a actor o volution, it most proaly has a ar gratr importanc, inasmuch as it avours th dvlopmnt o such haits and charactrs as nsur th maintnanc and urthr dvlopmnt o th spcis, togthr with th gratst amount o wlar and njoymnt o li or th individual, with th last wast o nrgy.
      O th scintic ollowrs o Darwin, th rst, as ar as I know, who

     “As a zoologist o old standing,” h lt ound to protst against th
aus o a trm—th struggl or istnc—orrowd rom zoology, or, at last, against ovrrating its importanc. Zoology, h said, and thos sci- ncs which dal with man, continually insist upon what thy call th pitilss law o struggl or istnc. But thy orgt th istnc o anothr law which may  dscrid as th law o mutual aid, which law, at last or th animals, is ar mor ssntial than th ormr.

     I oviously do not dny th struggl or istnc, ut I maintain that

By sharing the responsibilities and joys involved in raising the very young, caretaking is distributed and burdens lessened. Pregnant people receive
     information and advocacy and have their
physical and emotional needs addressed by birth care workers. New parents receive delivery of essential items such as breast milk or healthy foods. Collectives provide support for caretakers
       and parents through no-cost childcare.

But th answrs to th qustions, “By which arms is this struggl chiy carrid on?” and “Who ar th ttst in th struggl?” will widly difr according to th importanc givn to th two difrnt aspcts o th struggl: th dirct on, or ood and saty among sparat individuals, and th struggl which Darwin dscrid as “mtaphorical”—th struggl, vry on collctiv, against advrs circumstancs. No on will dny that thr is, within ach spcis, a crtain amount o ral comptition or ood—at last, at crtain priods. But th qustion is, whthr comptition is carrid on to th tnt admittd y Darwin, or vn y Wallac; and whthr this comptition has playd, in th volution o th animal kingdom, th part assignd to it.
      Th ida which prmats Darwin’s work is crtainly on o ral comptition going on within ach animal group or ood, saty, and possiility o laving an ofspring. H on spaks o rgions ing stockd with

But whn w look in his work or ral proos o that comptition, w must conss that w do not nd thm sucintly convincing. I w rr to th paragraph ntitld “Struggl or Li most svr twn Individuals and Varitis o th sam Spcis,” w nd in it non o that walth o proos and illustrations which w ar accustomd to nd in whatvr Darwin wrot.

      As to Wallac, who quots th sam acts undr a slightly modid

    In some cass, no dout, thr is actual war twn th two, th

In such cass what is dscrid as comptition may  no comptition at all.

Th trm “struggl or li” is again usd in its mtaphorical sns, and may hav no othr.

As to various spcis o mic (Mus sylvaticus, Arvicola arvalis, and A. agrestis), th sam author givs a long list o thir nmis, ut h rmarks:
“Howvr, th most trril nmis o mic ar not othr animals, ut such suddn changs o wathr as occur almost vry yar.” Altrnations o rost and warm wathr dstroy thm in numrlss quantitis; “on singl suddn chang can rduc thousands o mic to th numr o a w individuals.” On th othr sid, a warm wintr, or a wintr which gradually stps in, mak thm multiply in mnacing proportions, notwithstanding vry nmy; such was th cas in  and .39 Comptition, in th cas o mic, thus appars a quit triing actor whn compard with wathr. Othr acts to th sam fct ar also givn as rgards squirrls.
      As to irds, it is wll known how thy sufr rom suddn changs
o wathr. Lat snowstorms ar as dstructiv o ird-li on th English moors, as thy ar in Siria; and Ch.

Prsistnt wt,” h adds, “is almost as atal to thm.”
       On th othr sid, th contagious disass which continually visit most
animal spcis dstroy thm in such numrs that th losss on cannot  rpaird or many yars, vn with th most rapidly multiplying animals. Thus, som sity yars ago, th sousliks suddnly disappard in th nigh- ourhood o Sarpta, in South-Eastrn Russia, in consqunc o som pidmics; and or yars no sousliks wr sn in that nighourhood. It took many yars or thy cam as numrous as thy ormrly wr.40 Lik acts, all tnding to rduc th importanc givn to comptition, could  producd in numrs.41 O cours, it might  rplid, in Darwin’s words, that nvrthlss ach organic ing “at som priod o its li, during som sason o th yar, during ach gnration or at intrvals, has to struggl or li and to sufr grat dstruction,” and that th ttst surviv during such priods o hard struggl or li. But i th volution o th animal world wr asd clusivly, or vn chiy, upon th survival o th ttst during priods o calamitis; i natural slction wr limitd in its action to priods o cptional drought, or suddn changs o tmpratur, or inundations, rtrogrssion would  th rul in th animal world. Thos who surviv a amin, or a svr pidmic o cholra, or small-po, or diphth- ria, such as w s thm in uncivilizd countris, ar nithr th strongst, nor th halthist, nor th most intllignt. No progrss could  asd on thos survivals—th lss so as all survivors usually com out o th ordal with an impaird halth, lik th Transaikalian horss just mntiond, or th Arctic crws, or th garrison o a ortrss which has n complld to liv or a w months on hal rations, and coms out o its princ with a rokn halth, and susquntly shows a quit anormal mortality. All
that natural slction can do in tims o calamitis is to spar th individuals ndowd with th gratst nduranc or privations o all kinds. So it dos among th Sirian horss and cattl.

      Happily nough, comptition is not th rul ithr in th animal world
or in mankind. It is limitd among animals to cptional priods, and natural slction nds ttr lds or its activity.

Th ants comin in nsts and nations; thy pil up thir stors, thy rar thir cattl—and thus avoid comptition; and natural slction picks out o th ants’ amily th spcis which know st how to avoid comptition, with its unavoidaly dltrious consquncs. Most o our irds slowly mov southwards as th wintr coms, or gathr in numrlss socitis and undrtak long journys—and thus avoid comptition. Many rodnts all aslp whn th tim coms that comptition should st in; whil othr rodnts stor ood or th wintr, and gathr in larg villags or otaining th ncssary protction whn at work. Th rindr, whn th lichns ar dry in th intrior o th continnt, migrat towards th sa. Bufalos cross an immns continnt in ordr to nd plnty o ood. And th avrs, whn thy grow numrous on a rivr, divid into two partis, and go, th old ons down th rivr, and th young ons up th rivr and avoid comptition. And whn animals can nithr all aslp, nor migrat, nor lay in stors, nor thmslvs grow thir ood lik th ants, thy do what th titmous dos, and what Wallac (Darwinism, chap.

     “Don’t compt!—comptition is always injurious to th spcis, and
you hav plnty o rsourcs to avoid it!” That is th tendency o natur, not always ralizd in ull, ut always prsnt. That is th watchword which coms to us rom th ush, th orst, th rivr, th ocan. “Thror

      Far rom ing a primitiv orm o organization, th amily is a

     It is thus sn, vn rom th aov rapid hints, that our knowldg o

So w cannot ut considr thm as ragmnts o th arly post-glacial population o th now civilizd ara.
      Th rst thing which striks us as soon as w gin studying primitiv
olk is th complity o th organization o marriag rlations undr which thy ar living. With most o thm th amily, in th sns w attriut to it, is hardly ound in its grms. But thy ar y no mans loos aggrgations o mn and womn coming in a disordrly mannr togthr in conormity with thir momntary caprics. All o thm ar undr a crtain organization, which has n dscrid y Morgan in its gnral aspcts as th “gntil,” or clan organization.7
      To tll th mattr as riy as possil, thr is littl dout that mankind
has passd at its ginnings through a stag which may  dscrid as that o “communal marriag”; that is, th whol tri had husands and wivs in common with ut littl rgard to consanguinity. But it is also crtain that som rstrictions to that r intrcours wr imposd at a vry arly priod. Intr-marriag was soon prohiitd twn th sons o on mothr and hr sistrs, granddaughtrs, and aunts. Latr on it was prohiitd twn th sons and daughtrs o th sam mothr, and urthr limitations did not ail to ollow. Th ida o a gens, or clan, which modid all pr- sumd dscndants rom on stock (or rathr all thos who gathrd in on group) was volvd, and marriag within th clan was ntirly prohiitd. It still rmaind “communal,” ut th wi or th husand had to  takn rom anothr clan. And whn a gns cam too numrous, and sudividd into svral gnts, ach o thm was dividd into classs (usually our), and marriag was prmittd only twn crtain wll-dnd classs. That is th stag which w nd now among th Kamilaroi-spaking Australians. As to th amily, its rst grms appard amidst th clan organization. A woman who was capturd in war rom som othr clan, and who ormrly would hav longd to th whol gns, could  kpt at a latr priod y th capturr, undr crtain oligations towards th tri. Sh may  takn y him to a sparat hut, ar sh had paid a crtain triut to th clan, and thus constitut within th gns a sparat amily, th apparanc o which vidntly was opning a quit nw phas o civilization.8
      Now, i w tak into considration that this complicatd organization dvlopd among mn who stood at th lowst known dgr o

A savag who is capal o living undr such an organization, and o rly sumitting to ruls which continually clash with his prsonal dsirs, crtainly is not a ast dvoid o thical principls and knowing no rin to its passions. But th act coms still mor striking i w considr th immns antiquity o th clan organization. It is now known that th primitiv Smits, th Grks o Homr, th prhistoric Romans, th Grmans o Tacitus, th arly Clts and th arly Slavonians, all hav had thir own priod o clan organization, closly analogous to that o th Australians, th Rd Indians, th Eskimos, and othr inhaitants o th “savag girdl.”9 So w must admit that ithr th volution o marriag laws wnt on on th sam lins among all human racs, or th rudimnts o th clan ruls wr dvlopd among som common ancstors o th Smits, th Aryans, th Polynsians, tc., or thir difrntiation into sparat racs took plac, and that ths ruls wr maintaind, until now, among racs long ago sparatd rom th common stock. Both altrnativs imply, howvr, an qually striking tnacity o th institution—such a tnacity that no assaults o th individual could rak it down through th scors o thousands o yars that it was in istnc. Th vry prsistnc o th clan organization shows how uttrly als it is to rprsnt primitiv mankind as a disordrly agglomration o individuals, who only oy thir individual passions, and tak advantag o thir prsonal orc and cunningnss against all othr rprsntativs o th spcis.

     Lik acts ar mt with y th scor; so that, whn w s that ths

Th savags, as a rul, do not “multiply without stint,” as som English writrs put it. On th contrary, thy tak all kinds o masurs or diminishing th irthrat.

     Th sam is tru as rgards what suprcial osrvrs dscri as

Th savag so much considrs dath as part o his duties towards his community, that h not only russ to  rscud (as Mofat has told), ut whn a woman who had to  immolatd on hr husand’s grav was rscud y missionaris, and was takn to an island, sh scapd in th night, crossd a road sa-arm, swimming and rjoind hr tri, to di on th grav.37 It has com with thm a mattr o rligion.

      Similar rmarks must  mad as rgards cannialism. Taking into

It is a act that until this day many savags ar complld to dvour corpss in th most advancd stat o putraction, and that in cass o asolut scarcity som o thm hav had to disintr and to d upon human corpss, vn during an pidmic.

Thr is no cption to th rul, not vn or animals; so th huntr’s lood is shd on his rturn to th villag whn h has shd th lood o an animal. That is th savags’ concption o justic—a concption which yt prvails in Wstrn Europ as rgards murdr.

By pooling basic needs and medical aid in local distribution centers, people can provide health care and a base for searching for survivors, cleaning up, and rebuilding in the wake of disasters. Local distribution centers can often function as community meeting spaces, aiding in restoring a sense of agency and safety to local neighborhoods impacted by disaster.

It is dsiccation: a quit rcnt dsiccation, continud still at a spd which w ormrly wr not prpard to admit.1 Against it man was powrlss. Whn th inhaitants o North-Wst Mongolia and East Turkstan saw that watr was aandoning thm, thy had no cours opn to thm ut to mov down th road vallys lading to th lowlands, and to thrust wstwards th inhaitants o th plains.2 Stms ar stms wr thus thrown into Europ, complling othr stms to mov and to rmov or cnturis in succssion, wstwards and astwards, in sarch o nw and mor or lss prmannt aods.

     Many stms had no orc to rsist disintgration: thy rok up and

       It was a natural growth, and an asolut uniormity in its structur

      Th villag community was th chi arm o th ararians in thir

Th mor w study thm th mor w rcogniz th narrow onds which unitd mn in thir villags.

But i th cas was too grav to  sttld in this way, it cam or th olkmot, which was ound “to nd th sntnc,” and pronouncd it in a conditional orm; that is, “such compnsation was du, i th wrong  provd,” and th wrong had to  provd or disclaimd y si or twlv prsons conrming or dnying th act y oath; ordal ing rsortd to in cas o contradiction twn th two sts o jurors. Such procdur, which rmaind in orc or mor than two thousand yars in succssion, spaks volums or itsl; it shows how clos wr th onds twn all mmrs o th community. Morovr, thr was no othr authority to norc th dcisions o th olkmot sids its own moral authority. Th only possil mnac was that th community might dclar th rl an outlaw, ut vn this mnac was rciprocal.

      Th sam wav o mancipation ran, in th twlh cntury, through

     Sl-jurisdiction was th ssntial point, and sl-jurisdiction mant

It had th right o war and pac, o d- ration and allianc with its nighours. It was sovrign in its own afairs, and mid with no othrs.

     Th scrt o this sming anomaly lis in th act that a mdival

Th city was usually dividd into our quartrs, or into v to svn sctions radiating rom a cntr, ach quartr or sction roughly corrsponding to a crtain trad or prossion which prvaild in it, ut nvrthlss containing inhaitants o difrnt social positions and occupations—nols, mrchants, artisans, or vn hal-srs; and ach sction or quartr constitutd a quit indpndnt agglomration. In Vnic, ach island was an indpndnt political community. It had its own organizd trads, its own commrc in salt, its own jurisdiction and administration, its own orum; and th nomination o a dog y th city changd nothing
in th innr indpndnc o th units.42 In Cologn, w s th inhaitants dividd into Geburschaen and Heimschaen (viciniae), i.. nighour guilds, which datd rom th Franconian priod.

     Th mdival city thus appars as a doul dration: o all hous-

     It is asy to undrstand how th sl-jurisdiction o th city could

Th urghrs who possssd a hous in th city at th tim ing, and wr co-ownrs in th town-lands, constitutd vry on a mrchant guild which hld in its hands th city’s trad; and although at th outst vry urghr, rich and poor, could mak part o th mrchant guild, and th trad itsl sms to hav n carrid

     Th cra guild was thn a common sllr o its produc and a common

Wood, lathr or thrad which ar usd y th artisan must  “right”; rad must  akd “in justic,” and so on. Transport this languag into our prsnt li, and it would sm afctd and unnatural; ut it was natural and unafctd thn, caus th mdival artisan did not produc or an unknown uyr, or to throw his goods into an unknown markt.

Th imprialist historians hav spcially supportd this thory, which, howvr, is vry much undrmind now y modrn rsarch. It is crtain that in Italy citis ought ach othr with a stuorn animosity, ut nowhr ls did such contsts attain th sam proportions; and in Italy itsl th city wars, spcially thos o th arlir priod, had thir spcial causs.

     Whn w cast a road glanc on th prsnt constitution o Europan

     In Grmany, in Austria, in Blgium th villag community was also

Th last low to communal ownrship in Middl Europ also dats rom th middl o th ightnth cntury.

     In short, to spak o th natural dath o th villag communitis in

     Howvr, th villag-community institutions so wll rspond to th

Evn in England, notwithstanding all th drastic masurs takn against th old ordr o things, it prvaild as lat as th ginning o th nintnth cntury. Mr. Gomm—on o th vry w English scholars who hav paid attntion to th sujct—shows in his work that many tracs o th communal possssion o th soil ar ound in Scotland, “runrig” tnancy having n maintaind in Forarshir up to , whil in crtain villags o Invrnss th custom was, up to , to plough th land or th whol community, without laving any oundaris, and to allot it ar th ploughing was don.

     As to th Continnt, w nd th communal institutions ully aliv in

I must, thror, limit my illustrations to th most typical instancs. Switzrland is undoutdly on o thm.

In th Vaud, whr all th housholdrs continu to

     It may  takn as a rul that whr th communs hav rtaind a wid

     All ths acts show that a rcklss proscution o prsonal intrsts,
with no rgard to othr popl’s nds, is not th only charactristic o modrn li.

But in th crowdd lans popl know ach othr prctly, and ar continually rought into mutual contact. O cours, ptty quarrls go thir cours, in th lans as lswhr; ut groupings in accordanc with prsonal anitis grow up, and within thir circl mutual aid is practicd to an tnt o which th richr classs hav no ida.

As soon as a mit nds inquisitivly ovr th opning o a drain—“Don’t stop thr,” anothr mit shouts out, “vr sits in th hol!” “Don’t clim ovr that wall, th train will kill you i you tuml down!

How many o th childrn whos play-grounds ar th pavmnts around “modl workrs’ dwllings,” or th quays and ridgs o th canals, would  crushd to dath y th carts or drownd in th muddy watrs, wr it not or that sort o mutual support. And whn a air Jack has mad a slip into th unprotctd ditch at th ack o th milkman’s yard, or a chrry-chkd Lizzi has, ar all, tumld down into th canal, th young rood raiss such cris that all th nighourhood is on th alrt and rushs to th rscu.
     Thn coms in th allianc o th mothrs. “You could not imagin” (a
lady-doctor who livs in a poor nighourhood told m latly) “how much thy hlp ach othr.

But th mothrs o th poorr classs hav not that training. Thy cannot stand th sight o a hungry child; thy must d it, and so thy do.
“Whn th school childrn g rad, thy sldom or rathr nvr mt with a rusal”—a lady-rind, who has workd svral yars in Whitchapl in connction with a workrs’ clu, writs to m. But I may, prhaps, as wll transcri a w mor passags rom hr lttr:
     Nursing nighours, in cass o illnss, without any shad o rmunration, is quit gnral among th workrs. Also, whn a woman
     has littl childrn, and gos out or work, anothr mothr always
     taks car o thm.
        I, in th working classs, thy would not hlp ach othr, thy
     could not ist. I know amilis which continually hlp ach othr—
     with mony, with ood, with ul, or ringing up th littl childrn,
     in cass o illnss, in cass o dath.
        Th “min” and “thin” is much lss sharply osrvd among th
     poor than among th rich. Shos, drss, hats, and so on—what may
      wantd on th spot—ar continually orrowd rom ach othr,
     also all sorts o houshold things.
        Last wintr th mmrs o th Unitd Radical Clu had rought
     togthr som littl mony, and gan ar Christmas to distriut

My rind also mntions various individual cass, o which th ollowing ar typical:
    Anni W. was givn y hr mothr to  oardd y an old prson in

     Whn th old lady did too, th child, who was v yars old, was
     o cours nglctd during hr illnss, and was raggd; ut sh was

        Th othr day, Mrs. M., mothr o si childrn, attndd Mrs.

    know also Mrs. D. (Oval, Hackny Road), who has a swing machin

For vry on who has any ida o th li o th laouring classs it is vidnt that without mutual aid ing practicd among thm on a larg scal thy nvr could pull through all thir dicultis. It is only y chanc that a workr’s amily can liv its litim without having to ac such circumstancs as th crisis dscrid y th rion wavr, Josph Guttridg, in his autoiography.19 And i all do not go to th ground in such cass, thy ow it to mutual hlp. In Guttridg’s cas it was an old nurs, misraly poor hrsl, who turnd up at th momnt whn th amily was slipping towards a nal catastroph, and rought in som rad, coal, and dding, which sh had otaind on crdit. In othr cass, it will  som on ls, or th nighours will tak stps to sav th amily. But without som aid rom othr poor, how many mor would  rought vry yar to irrparal ruin!20
     Mr. Plimsoll, ar h had livd or som tim among th poor, on svn
shillings and sipnc a wk, was complld to rcogniz that th kindly lings h took with him whn h gan this li “changd into harty rspct and admiration” whn h saw how th rlations twn th poor ar prmatd with mutual aid and support, and larnd th simpl ways in which that support is givn. Ar a many yars’ princ, his conclusion was that “whn you com to think o it, such as ths mn wr, so wr th vast majority o th working classs.”21 As to ringing up orphans, vn y th poorst amilis, it is so widly sprad a hait, that it may  dscrid as a gnral rul; thus among th minrs it was ound, ar th two plosions at Warrn Val and at Lund Hill, that “narly on-third o th mn killd, as th rspctiv committs can tstiy, wr thus supporting rlations othr than wi and child.” “Hav you rctd,” Mr. Plimsoll addd, “what this is? Rich mn, vn comortaly to-do mn do this, I don’t dout. But considr th difrnc.” Considr what a sum o on shilling, suscrid y ach workr to hlp a comrad’s widow, or sipnc to hlp a llow-workr to dray th tra pns o a unral, mans or on who arns  shillings a wk and has a wi, and in som cass v or si childrn to support.22 But such suscriptions ar a gnral practic among
th workrs all ovr th world, vn in much mor ordinary cass than a dath in th amily, whil aid in work is th commonst thing in thir livs.
     Nor do th sam practics o mutual aid and support ail among th
richr classs. O cours, whn on thinks o th harshnss which is on shown y th richr mployrs towards thir mploys, on ls inclind to tak th most pssimist viw o human natur.

Was not Nonconormism itsl largly a popular protst against th harsh tratmnt o th poor at th hand o th stalishd Church?
     With such spiritual ladrs, th lings o th richr classs ncssarily cam, as Mr. Pimsoll rmarkd, not so much luntd as “strati-

     Thr is, in act,” Bats wrot, “a grat varity o mammals, irds and

VI.—Adaptations to Avoid Competition Numrous ampls o such adaptations can  ound in th works o all ld-naturalists. On o thm, vry intrsting, may  givn in th hairy armadillo, o which W.H. Hudson says, that “it has struck a lin or itsl, and consquntly thrivs, whil its congnrs ar ast disapparing. Its ood is most varid. It prys on all kinds o inscts, discovring worms and
larva svral inchs nath th surac. It is ond o ggs and dglings; it ds on carrion as radily as a vultur; and, ailing animal ood, it su- sists on vgtal dit—clovr, and vn grains o maiz. Thror, whn othr animals ar starving, th hairy armadillo is always at and vigorous” (Naturalist on the La Plata, ).
      Th adaptivity o th lapwing maks it a spcis o which th rang o
tnsion is vry wid. In England, it “maks itsl at hom on aral land as radily as in wildr aras.” Ch. Dion says in his Birds of Northern Shires (), “Varity o ood is still mor th rul with th irds o pry.” Thus, or instanc, w larn rom th sam author (, ), “that th hn harrir o th British moors ds not only on small irds, ut also on mols and mic, and on rogs, lizards and inscts, whil most o th smallr alcons susist largly on inscts.”
      Th vry suggstiv chaptr which W.H. Hudson givs to th amily
o th South Amrican trcrprs, or woodhwrs, is anothr cllnt illustration o th ways in which larg portions o th animal population avoid comptition, whil at th sam tim thy succd in coming vry numrous in a givn rgion, without ing possssd o any o th wapons usually considrd as ssntial in th struggl or istnc. Th aov amily covrs an immns rang, rom South Mico to Patagonia, and no wr than  spcis, rral to aout  gnra, ar alrady known rom this amily, th most striking atur o which is th grat divrsity o haits o its mmrs. Not only th difrnt gnra and th difrnt spcis possss haits pculiarly thir own, ut vn th sam spcis is on ound to difr in its mannr o li in difrnt localitis. “Som spcis o Xenops and Magarornis, lik woodpckrs, clim vrtically on tr-trunks in sarch o insct pry, ut also, lik tits, plor th smallr twigs and oliag at th trmity o th ranchs; so that th whol tr, rom th root to its topmost oliag, is huntd ovr y thm. Th Sclerurus, although an inhaitant o th darkst orst, and providd with sharply curvd claws, nvr sks its ood on trs, ut clusivly on th ground, among th dcaying alln lavs; ut, strangly nough, whn alarmd, it is to th trunk o th narst tr, to which it clings in a vrtical position, and, rmaining silnt and motionlss, scaps osrvation y mans o its dark protctiv colour.” And so on. In thir nsting haits thy also vary immnsly. Thus, in on singl gnus, thr spcis uild an ovn-shapd clay-nst, a ourth uilds a nst o sticks in th trs, and a h urrows in th sid o a ank, lik a kingshr.
      Now, this trmly larg amily, o which Hudson says that “vry
portion o th South Amrican continnt is occupid y thm; or thr is
rally no climat, and no kind o soil or vgtation, which dos not possss its appropriat spcis, longs”—to us his own words—“to th most dnclss o irds.” Lik th ducks which wr mntiond y Syvrtsof (s in th tt), thy display no powrul ak or claws; “thy ar timid, unrsisting craturs, without strngth or wapons; thir movmnts ar lss quick and vigorous than thos o othr kinds, and thir ight is cdingly l.” But thy possss—oth Hudson and Asara osrv—“th social disposition in an minnt dgr,” although “th social hait is kpt down in thm y th conditions o a li which maks solitud ncssary.” Thy cannot mak thos larg rding associations which w s in th sa- irds, caus thy liv on th tr-inscts, and thy must carully plor sparatly vry tr—which thy do in a most usinss-lik way; ut thy continually call ach othr in th woods, “convrsing with on anothr ovr long distancs”; and thy associat in thos “wandring ands” which ar wll known rom Bats’s pictursqu dscription, whil Hudson was ld to liv “that vrywhr in South Amrica th Dndrocolaptida ar th rst in comining to act in concrt, and that th irds o othr amilis ollow thir march and associat with thm, knowing rom princ that a rich harvst may  rapd.” It hardly nd  addd that Hudson pays thm also a high complimnt concrning thir intllignc. Sociaility and intllignc always go hand in hand.

It appars, indd, rom a passag in Plutarch that Numa lgislatd aout thm. “H dividd th popl,” w ar told, “into trads . . . ordring thm to hav rothrhoods, stivals, and mtings, and indicating th worship thy had to accomplish or th gods, according to th dignity o ach trad.” It is almost crtain, howvr, that it was not th Roman king who invntd, or institutd, th trad-collgs—thy had alrady istd in ancint Grc; in all proaility, h simply sumittd
thm to royal lgislation, just as Philipp l Bl, n cnturis latr, su- mittd th trads o Franc, much to thir dtrimnt, to royal suprvision and lgislation. On o th succssors o Numa, Srvius Tullius, also is said to hav issud som lgislation concrning th collgs.3
     Consquntly, it was quit natural that historians should ask thmslvs whthr th guilds which took such a dvlopmnt in th twlh,
and vn th tnth and th lvnth cnturis, wr not rvivals o th old Roman “collgs”—th mor so as th lattr, as sn rom th aov quotation, quit corrspondd to th mdival guild.4 It is known, indd, that corporations o th Roman typ istd in Southrn Gaul down to th h cntury. Bsids, an inscription ound during som cavations in Paris shows that a corporation o Luttia nautae istd undr Tirius; and in th chart givn to th Paris “watr-mrchants” in , thir rights ar spokn o as isting ab antiquo (sam author, ). Thr would hav n, thror, nothing traordinary, had corporations n maintaind in arly mdival Franc ar th ararian invasions.
     Howvr, vn i as much must  grantd, thr is no rason to maintain that th Dutch corporations, th Norman guilds, th Russian artels, th
Gorgian amkari, and so on, ncssarily hav had also a Roman, or vn a Byzantin origin. O cours, th intrcours twn th Normans and th capital o th East-Roman Empir was vry activ, and th Slavonians (as has n provd y Russian historians, and spcially y Ramaud) took a livly part in that intrcours. So, th Normans and th Russians may hav importd th Roman organization o trad-corporations into thir rspctiv lands. But whn w s that th artel was th vry ssnc o th vryday li o all th Russians, as arly as th tnth cntury, and that this artel, although no sort o lgislation has vr rgulatd its li till modrn tims, has th vry sam aturs as th Roman collg and th Wstrn guild, w ar still mor inclind to considr th astrn guild as having an vn mor ancint origin than th Roman collg. Romans knw wll, indd, that thir sodalitia and collegia wr “what th Grks calld hetairiai” (Martin-Saint-Léon, ), and rom what w know o th history o th East, w may conclud, with littl proaility o ing mistakn, that th grat nations o th East, as wll as Egypt, also hav had th sam guild organization. Th ssntial aturs o this organization rmain th sam whrvr w may nd thm. It is a union o mn carrying on th sam pro- ssion or trad. This union, lik th primitiv clan, has its own gods and its own worship, always containing som mystris, spcic to ach sparat union; it considrs all its mmrs as brothers and sisters—possily (at its ginnings) with all th consquncs which such a rlationship implid
in th gns, or, at last, with crmonis that indicatd or symolizd th clan rlations twn rothr and sistr; and nally, all th oligations o mutual support which istd in th clan, ist in this union; namly, th clusion o th vry possiility o a murdr within th rothrhood, th clan rsponsiility or justic, and th oligation, in cas o a minor disput, o ringing th mattr or th judgs, or rathr th aritrs, o th guild rothrhood. Th guild—on may say—is thus modlld upon th clan.
       Consquntly, th sam rmarks which ar mad in th tt concrning
th origin o th villag community, apply, I am inclind to think, qually to th guild, th artel, and th cra- or nighour-rothrhood. Whn th onds which ormrly connctd mn in thir clans wr loosnd in consqunc o migrations, th apparanc o th patrnal amily, and a growing divrsity o occupations—a nw territorial bond was workd out y mankind in th shap o th villag community; and anothr ond—an occupation bond—was workd out in an imaginary rothrhood—the imaginary clan, which was rprsntd: twn two mn, or a w mn, y th “mitur-o-lood rothrhood” (th Slavonian pobratimstvo), and twn a gratr numr o mn o difrnt origin, i.. originatd rom difrnt clans, inhaiting th sam villag or town (or vn difrnt villags or towns)—th phratry, th hetairiai, th amkari, th artel, th guild.5
       As to th ida and th orm o such an organization, its lmnts wr
alrady indicatd rom th savag priod downwards. W know indd that in th clans o all savags thr ar sparat scrt organizations o warriors, o witchs, o young mn, tc.—cra mystris, in which knowl- dg concrning hunting or warar is transmittd; in a word, “clus,” as Miklukho-Maclay dscrid thm.

Whn I was a young punk living in th middl o nowhr, I was rummaging through uildings I thought wr aandond. I ound a o o old pamphlts, on o which was aout Food Not Boms, a asic modl or starting a soup kitchn using salvagd produc.
     A coupl o rinds and I trid to gt it going to no avail caus w
wr trying to do a million projcts at onc. W movd to anothr town and startd working with a w mor kids. It got a littl mor consistnt ut was mor lik us handing out grocris.
     W thn movd to a largr town that had a prtty wll-stalishd Food

     My rind said, “No, it’s just lik a ig hous with an industrial kitchn
whr thy hlp popl.”
     I said, “But it’s a Catholic spot?” My rind wnt on to plain to m
that th oundr was Catholic ut rad Mutual Aid, and it inspird him to rak of rom th church and uild th Catholic Workrs Hous.
     This thrw m of and I ralizd that I shouldn’t judg popl so ast

     Growing up through th s and ’s, thr was a vry strong mntality o comptition and dog-at-dog, and I couldn’t conttualiz whr it

     Ar a coupl o yars o working with that Food Not Boms and

going on. Not having to  th main organizr o ths forts, I startd ocusing a lot mor on art.
     I had n making art my whol li ut nvr considrd mysl an

Artists working togthr to maintain a physical spac that non o thm could hav don alon—this was th community that told m I was an artist.
     Whn th Grat Rcssion o  hit, I lost my jo and ll into ing

Whn on o us would gt hurt, w would all mak a painting and throw a nt art show caus non o us had halth insuranc.

Words of a Rebel Peter Kropotkin Translated and edited by Iain McKay with a Preface by Elisée Reclus ISBN: –––– . pages
Peter Kropotkin remains one of the best-known anarchist thinkers, and Words of a Rebel was his rst libertarian book. Published in 1885 while he was in a French jail for anarchist activism, this collection of articles from the newspaper Le Revolté sees Kropotkin criticise the failings of capitalism and those who seek to end it by means of its main support, the state. Instead, he urged the creation of a mass movement from below that would expropriate property and destroy the state, replacing their centralised hierarchies with federations of self-governing communities and workplaces.
Kropotkin’s instant classic included discussions themes and ideas he returned to repeatedly during his ve decades in the anarchist movement. Unsurprisingly, Words of a Rebel was soon translated into numerous languages—including Italian, Spanish, Bulgarian, Russian, and Chinese—and reprinted time and time again. But despite its inuence as Kropotkin’s rst anarchist work, it was the last to be completely translated into English.
This is a new translation from the French original by Iain McKay except for a few chapters previously translated by Nicolas Walter. Both anarchist activists and writers, they are well placed to understand the assumptions within and inuences on Kropotkin’s revolutionary journalism. It includes all the original 1885 text along with the preface to the 1904 Italian as well as the preface and afterward to the 1919 Russian editions. In addition, it includes many articles on the labour movement written by Kropotkin for Le Revolté which show how he envisioned getting from criticism to a social revolution. Along with a comprehensive glossary and an introduction by Iain McKay placing this work within the history of anarchism as well as indicating its relevance to radicals and revolutionaries today, this is the denitive edition of an anarchist classic.
“Peter Kropotkin was a giant of socialist history whose tireless scientic, historical, and political scholarship and agitational writing united and fueled the transnational anarchist movement of the turn of the twentieth century. But this aristocrat turned revolutionary didn’t start there. Words of a Rebel sheds light on the young Kropotkin’s political transformation in the wake of the destruction of the First International. By including articles from Le Revolté, this volume traces Kropotkin’s political journey farther as he sewed the early seeds of anarchist communism and set an agenda for anti-authoritarian rebellion for years to come.” —Mark Bray, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook and coeditor of

The Great French Revolution, 1789–1793 Peter Kropotkin with an Introduction by David Berry ISBN: –––– . pages
The Great French Revolution, 1789–1793 is Peter Kropotkin’s most substantial historical work. In it he presents a people’s history of the world-shaking events of the Revolution and shows the key role the working men and women of the towns and countryside played in it. Without the constant pressure of popular organisations and activity, the politicians would never have created a Republic, nor been able to survive the counterrevolutionary forces internally or externally.
Focusing on such mass movements—and especially the peasant majority— rather than on the few great men beloved of bourgeois accounts, this is a groundbreaking account of the period and a seminal work of “history from below.” Later research may have corrected some factual details and opened new avenues of scholarship, but Kropotkin’s text remains an exemplar of anarchist history-writing, challenging both bourgeois republican and Marxist interpretations of the Revolution.
Yet it is more than a history: Kropotkin uses the experience of the French Revolution to aid us in our current struggles and to learn its lessons in order to ensure the success of future revolutions. This book raises issues which have resurfaced time and again, as well as oering solutions based on the self-activity of the masses, the new, decentralised, directly democratic social organisations they forged during the Revolution, and the need to transform a political revolt into a social revolution which seeks to secure the well-being of all by transforming the economy from the start.
“The French Revolution erupted out of the remnants of the old world and set a dynamic precedent for new centuries of resistance. Multifaceted, contradictory, and compelling, the French Revolution cast an enormous shadow that inuenced every radical faction of 19th century politics. Peter Kropotkin was perhaps the preeminent anarchist intellect of his generation, and so his book The Great French Revolution, 1789–1793 provides us with a fascinating exploration into the late 19th century anarchist vision of historical transformation. This saga of popular upheaval from below provides a fascinating mirror image of how Kropotkin and many of his comrades envisioned the coming revolution.” —Mark Bray, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook and co-editor of Anarchist Education and the Modern School: A Francisco Ferrer Reader
“In this classic text, Kropotkin demonstrates how even struggles that falter can lay the groundwork for subsequent upheavals. The French Revolution may have succumbed to reaction, but it also gave birth to ideas that would dene revolutions to come. A must-read for anyone struggling to put insurgency on the agenda once again.” —AK Thompson, author of Black Bloc, White Riot
Anarchism, Anarchist Communism, and The State: Three Essays Peter Kropotkin with an Introduction by Brian Morris and bibliographic notes by Iain McKay ISBN: –––– . pages
Amid the clashes, complexities, and political personalities of world politics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Peter Kropotkin stands out. Born a prince in Tsarist Russia, sent to Siberia to learn his militaristic, aristocratic trade, he instead renounced his titles and took up the “beautiful idea” of anarchism. Across a continent he would become known as a passionate advocate of a world without borders, without kings and bosses.
From a Russian cell to France, to London and Brighton, he used his extraordinary mind to dissect the birth of State power and then present a dierent vision, one in which the human impulse to liberty can be found throughout history, undying even in times of defeat. In the three essays presented here, Kropotkin attempted to distill his many insights into brief but brilliant essays on the state, anarchism, and the ideology for which he became a founding name—anarchist communism.
With a detailed and rich introduction from Brian Morris, and accompanied by bibliographic notes from Iain McKay, this collection contextualises and contemporises three of Kropotkin’s most inuential essays.
“In this collection of essays, Kropotkin excels in his grasp of the state, its dynamics, and the social relations out of which it emerges, dovetailed with his radical vision for libertarian egalitarian social change. Including an informative foreword by Brian Morris on the great anarchist’s colourful life, and Kropotkin’s own extended analysis of the origins of anarchism, the book goes to the core of what makes Kropotkin’s work so stimulating: he is peculiarly capable, through detailed historical accounts and discussions of his own times, of somehow speaking to our own contemporary dilemmas and challenges.” —Anthony Ince, coeditor of Historical Geographies of Anarchism
“This is one of the most excellent introductions to anarchism, putting paid to the usual objections to the system, synonymous as it has become, wrongly, with disorganisation and chaos.”

Kropotkin: The Politics of Community Brian Morris ISBN: –––– . pages
The nineteenth century witnessed the growth of anarchist literature, which advocated a society based on voluntary cooperation without government authority. Although his classical writings on mutual aid and the philosophy of anarchism are still published today, Peter Kropotkin remains a neglected gure. A talented geographer and a revolutionary socialist, Kropotkin was one of the most important theoreticians of the anarchist movement.
In Kropotkin: The Politics of Community, Brian Morris rearms with an attitude of critical sympathy the contemporary relevance of Kropotkin as a political and moral philosopher and as a pioneering social ecologist. Wellresearched and wide-ranging, this volume not only presents an important contribution to the history of anarchism, both as a political tradition and as a social movement, but also oers insightful reections on contemporary debates in political theory and ecological thought. After a short biographical note, the book analyzes in four parts Kropotkin’s writings on anarchist communism, agrarian socialism, and integral education; modern science and evolutionary theory; the French Revolution and the modern state; and possessive individualism, terror, and war.
Standing as a comprehensive and engaging introduction to anarchism, social ecology, and the philosophy of evolutionary holism, Kropotkin is written in a straightforward manner that will appeal to those interested in social anarchism and in alternatives to neoliberal doctrines.
“Peter Kropotkin has been largely ignored as a utopian crackpot, but Brian Morris demonstrates in this wide-ranging and detailed analysis that Kropotkin addressed signicantly and perceptively the major issues of the present day.” —Harold B. Barclay, author of People without Government: An Anthropology of

Wobblies and Zapatistas oers the reader an encounter between two generations and two traditions. Andrej Grubačić is an anarchist from the Balkans. Staughton Lynd is a lifelong pacist, inuenced by Marxism. They meet in dialogue in an eort to bring together the anarchist and Marxist traditions, to discuss the writing of history by those who make it, and to remind us of the idea that “my country is the world.” Encompassing a Left libertarian perspective and an emphatically activist standpoint, these conversations are meant to be read in the clubs and anity groups of the new Movement.
The authors accompany us on a journey through modern revolutions, direct actions, anti-globalist counter summits, Freedom Schools, Zapatista cooperatives, Haymarket and Petrograd, Hanoi and Belgrade, ‘intentional’ communities, wildcat strikes, early Protestant communities, Native American democratic practices, the Workers’ Solidarity Club of Youngstown, occupied factories, self-organized councils and soviets, the lives of forgotten revolutionaries, Quaker meetings, antiwar movements, and prison rebellions. Neglected and forgotten moments of interracial self-activity are brought to light. The book invites the attention of readers who believe that a better world, on the other side of capitalism and state bureaucracy, may indeed be possible.
“There’s no doubt that we’ve lost much of our history. It’s also very clear that those in power in this country like it that way. Here’s a book that shows us why. It demonstrates not only that another world is possible, but that it already exists, has existed, and shows an endless potential to burst through the articial walls and divisions that currently imprison us. An exquisite contribution to the literature of human freedom, and coming not a moment too soon.” —David Graeber, author of Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology and Direct Action: An Ethnography
“I have been in regular contact with Andrej Grubačić for many years, and have been most impressed by his searching intelligence, broad knowledge, lucid judgment, and penetrating commentary on contemporary aairs and their historical roots. He is an original thinker and dedicated activist, who brings deep understanding and outstanding personal qualities to everything he does.”

Libertarian Socialism: Politics in Black and Red Edited by Alex Prichard, Ruth Kinna, Saku Pinta, and David Berry ISBN: –––– . pages
The history of anarchist-Marxist relations is usually told as a history of factionalism and division. These essays, based on original research and written especially for this collection, reveal some of the enduring sores in the revolutionary socialist movement in order to explore the important, too often neglected left-libertarian currents that have thrived in revolutionary socialist movements. By turns, the collection interrogates the theoretical boundaries between Marxism and anarchism and the process of their formation, the overlaps and creative tensions that shaped left-libertarian theory and practice, and the stumbling blocks to movement cooperation. Bringing together specialists working from a range of political perspectives, the book charts a history of radical twentieth-century socialism, and opens new vistas for research in the twenty-rst. Contributors examine the political and social thought of a number of leading socialists—Marx, Morris, Sorel, Gramsci, Guérin, C.L.R. James, Hardt and Negri—and key movements including the Situationist International, Socialisme ou Barbarie and Council Communism. Analysis of activism in the UK, Australasia, and the U.S. serves as the prism to discuss syndicalism, carnival anarchism, and the anarchistic currents in the U.S. civil rights movement.
Contributors include Paul Blackledge, Lewis H. Mates, Renzo Llorente, Carl Levy, Christian Høgsbjerg, Andrew Cornell, Benoît Challand, JeanChristophe Angaut, Toby Boraman, and David Bates.
“Libertarian Socialism: Politics in Black and Red is an invaluable contribution to historical scholarship and libertarian politics. The collection of essays contained in the book has the great virtue of oering both analytical perspectives on ideas, and historical perspectives on movements. The contributions examine classical themes in anarchist politics such as individual liberty, whilst also exploring more neglected thinkers and themes from a libertarian standpoint, such as C.L.R. James and race. There can be little doubt that the volume will be of major interest to historians, theorists, students and activists.” —Darrow Schecter, reader in Italian, School of History, Art History and

Crossroads: I Live Where I Like: A Graphic History Koni Benson. Illustrated byAndré Trantraal, Nathan Trantraal, and Ashley E. Marais, and with a Foreword by Robin D.G. Kelley ISBN: –––– . pages
Drawn by South African political cartoonists the Trantraal brothers and Ashley Marais, Crossroads: I Live Where I Like is a graphic nonction history of women-led movements at the forefront of the struggle for land, housing, water, education, and safety in Cape Town over half a century. Drawing on over sixty life narratives, it tells the story of women who built and defended Crossroads, the only informal settlement that successfully resisted the apartheid bulldozers in Cape Town. The story follows women’s organized resistance from the peak of apartheid in the 1970s to ongoing struggles for decent shelter today. Importantly, this account was workshopped with contemporary housing activists and women’s collectives who chose the most urgent and ongoing themes they felt spoke to and claried challenges against segregation, racism, violence, and patriarchy standing between the legacy of the colonial and apartheid past and a future of freedom still being fought for.
Presenting dramatic visual representations of many personalities and moments in the daily life of this township, the book presents a thoughtful and thorough chronology, using archival newspapers, posters, photography, pamphlets, and newsletters to further illustrate the signicance of the struggles at Crossroads for the rest of the city and beyond. This collaboration has produced a beautiful, captivating, accessible, forgotten, and in many ways uncomfortable history of Cape Town that has yet to be acknowledged.
“Crossroads is, quite simply, beautiful. It is intellectual and appealing and everything one could hope for from this kind of project. It is a meaningful engagement with a deeply troubling and enormously signicant past. Not only does it weave text and images together to their best eect, but this is also one of the most insightful studies of urban history and social movements in any medium.” —Trevor Getz, professor of African history, San Francisco State University; author of Abina and the Important Men: A Graphic History; and series editor of the Oxford University Press’s Uncovering History series
“Through the narratives of women’s struggles told in an honest and compelling way, Crossroads is an essential activist’s handbook. It is a long-awaited and important compilation that is fundamental in understanding how women rose up against oppression and dispossession.” —Nomusa Makhubu, winner of the ABSA L’Atelier Gerard Sekoto Award and the Prix du Studio National des Arts Contemporains, Le Fresnoy

Drawing on rich historical research, she maps the connections between the previous forms of enclosure that occurred with the birth of capitalism and the destruction of the commons and the “new enclosures” at the heart of the present phase of global capitalist accumulation. Considering the commons from a feminist perspective, this collection centers on women and reproductive work as crucial to both our economic survival and the construction of a world free from the hierarchies and divisions capital has planted in the body of the world proletariat. Federici is clear that the commons should not be understood as happy islands in a sea of exploitative relations but rather autonomous spaces from which to challenge the existing capitalist organization of life and labor.
“Silvia Federici’s theoretical capacity to articulate the plurality that fuels the contemporary movement of women in struggle provides a true toolbox for building bridges between dierent features and dierent people.” —Massimo De Angelis, professor of political economy, University of East
## London

“Silvia Federici’s work embodies an energy that urges us to rejuvenate struggles against all types of exploitation and, precisely for that reason, her work produces a common: a common sense of the dissidence that creates a community in struggle.”

Autonomy Is in Our Hearts: Zapatista Autonomous Government through the Lens of the Tsotsil Language Dylan Eldredge Fitzwater with a Foreword by John P. Clark ISBN: –––– . pages
Following the Zapatista uprising on New Year’s Day 1994, the EZLN communities of Chiapas began the slow process of creating a system of autonomous government that would bring their call for freedom, justice, and democracy from word to reality. Autonomy Is in Our Hearts analyzes this long and arduous process on its own terms, using the conceptual language of Tsotsil, a Mayan language indigenous to the highland Zapatista communities of Chiapas.
The words “Freedom,” “Justice,” and “Democracy” emblazoned on the Zapatista ags are only approximations of the aspirations articulated in the six indigenous languages spoken by the Zapatista communities. They are rough translations of concepts such as ichbail ta muk’ or “mutual recognition and respect among equal persons or peoples,” a’mtel or “collective work done for the good of a community” and lekil kuxlejal or “the life that is good for everyone.” Autonomy Is in Our Hearts provides a fresh perspective on the Zapatistas and a deep engagement with the daily realities of Zapatista autonomous government. Simultaneously an exposition of Tsotsil philosophy and a detailed account of Zapatista governance structures, this book is an indispensable commentary on the Zapatista movement of today.
“This is a refreshing book. Written with the humility of the learner, or the absence of the arrogant knower, the Zapatista dictum to ‘command obeying’ becomes to ‘know learning.’” —Marisol de la Cadena, author of Earth Beings: Ecologies of Practice across
## Andean Worlds

“Autonomy Is in Our Hearts is perhaps the most important book you can read on the Zapatista movement in Chiapas today. It stands out from the rest of the Anglophone literature in that it demonstrates, with great sensitivity, how a dialectic between traditional culture and institutions and emerging revolutionary and regenerative forces can play a crucial role in liberatory social transformation. It shows us what we can learn from the indigenous people of Chiapas about a politics of community, care, and mutual aid, and—to use a word that they themselves use so much—about a politics of heart. A great strength of the work is that the author is a very good listener. He allows the people of Chiapas to tell their own story largely in their own words, and with their own distinctive voice.”

The Art of Freedom: A Brief History of the Kurdish Liberation Struggle Havin Guneser with an Introduction by Andrej Grubačić and Interview by Sasha Lilley ISBN: –––– . pages
The Revolution in Rojava captured the imagination of the Left sparking a worldwide interest in the Kurdish Freedom Movement. The Art of Freedom demonstrates that this explosive movement is rmly rooted in several decades of organized struggle.
In 2018, one of the most important spokespersons for the struggle of Kurdish Freedom, Havin Guneser, held three groundbreaking seminars on the historical background and guiding ideology of the movement. Much to the chagrin of career academics, the theoretical foundation of the Kurdish Freedom Movement is far too uid and dynamic to be neatly stued into an ivory-tower ling cabinet. A vital introduction to the Kurdish struggle, The Art of Freedom is the rst English-language book to deliver a distillation of the ideas and sensibilities that gave rise to the most important political event of the twenty-rst century.
The book is broken into three sections: “Critique and Self-Critique: The rise of the Kurdish freedom movement from the rubbles of two world wars” provides an accessible explanation of the origins and theoretical foundation of the movement. “The Rebellion of the Oldest Colony: Jineology—the Science of Women” describes the undercurrents and nuance of the Kurdish women’s movement and how they have managed to create the most vibrant and successful feminist movement in the Middle East. “Democratic Confederalism and Democratic Nation: Defense of Society Against Societycide” deals with the attacks on the fabric of society and new concepts beyond national liberation to counter it. Centering on notions of “a shared homeland” and “a nation made up of nations,” these rousing ideas nd deep international resonation.
Havin Guneser has provided an expansive denition of freedom and democracy and a road map to help usher in a new era of struggle against capitalism, imperialism, and the State.
“Havin Guneser is not just the world’s leading authority on the thought of Abdullah Öcalan; she is a profound, sensitive, and challenging revolutionary thinker with a message the world desperately needs to hear.” —David Graeber author of Debt: The First 5,000 Years and Bullshit Jobs: A
## Theory

“This book is a necessary contribution for the understanding of a revolutionary movement that is very dierent from the euro-centric legacy of European and Western revolutionary traditions. The science of Women, or Jineology, is one of those contributions which both men and women should understand in order to deepen our critique and our anti-capitalist struggle, as well as the concepts of criticism and self-criticism and democratic confederalism.” —Raúl Zibechi, author of Dispersing Powers: Social Movements as Anti-state Forces and The New Brazil: Regional Imperialism and the New Democracy
