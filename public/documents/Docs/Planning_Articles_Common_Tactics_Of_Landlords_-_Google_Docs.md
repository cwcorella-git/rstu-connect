# Common Tactics Of Landlords - Google Docs.pdf

View notes from original meeting: Educational Material Planning 6/20/25

- From “how has your landlord screwed you over” tabling display:
       - Had to move multiple times due to rent increases of hundreds of
          dollars per month
       - Evicting us because of maintenance she neglected in order to avoid
          the building being condemned
       - Being charged for damage that existed before moving in
       - Bed bugs!!! Still there after “treatment” (ongoing 6 months)
       - Evicting us by keeping us month-to-month to leave us with no rights
       - “All of the above”: rent hikes, neglected repairs, junk fees, harassment
- From facebook: Said tenant hadn’t paid rent even though she had record of
    giving the check (demanding cashier’s check)
