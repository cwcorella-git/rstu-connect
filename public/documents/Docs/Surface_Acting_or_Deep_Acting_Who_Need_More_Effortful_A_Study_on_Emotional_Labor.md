However, which strategy consumes more energy? To explore this, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure changes in hemoglobin density while participants performed a task requiring them to make the opposite emotional facial expression of that presented in a picture. We found that (1) neither surface nor deep acting led to a signicant change in hemoglobin concentration in the prefrontal cortex; (2) making negative and positive facial expressions activated the same left front and middle areas of the prefrontal cortex; and (3) making positive facial expressions activated the rear portion of the prefrontal cortex, but making negative facial expressions did not. Based on these ndings and past work, we can infer that deep and surface acting may Edited by: not signicantly differ in terms of the activity in the prefrontal cortex energy consumed.

Surface and Deep Acting Consumption than when engaging in surface acting. To induce use of the dierent strategies, we used emotional facial expressions. Because emotional labor involves the display of positive and negative emotions, we presented participants with positive or negative facial expressions and asked them to make the opposite facial expression. This also enabled us to explore whether there was a dierence in the eort for these strategies between positive and negative emotional expressions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethics Statement All research procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee of Guizhou Normal University, Guiyang, Guizhou province, FIGURE 1 | Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) settings.

For channel 10 and channel 13, the distance of emitter and receptor was over 3 cm, so the measurement results Participants were canceled. The “cross” mark was used to represent the canceled results. Twenty male and 20 female senior undergraduates were recruited from a university in Hunan province, China.

In the deep acting condition, one male and one decided to ax the optodes of the fNIRS primarily on the female participant’s fNIRS data were not correctly obtained, so PFC. Based on that, participants would make facial expression, the data were excluded. The average age of all participants was and refer to a study by Hong et al. (2015). Therefore, we also 21.5 ± 1.4 years. placed some optodes on the pre-motor and supplementary motor cortexes. The details are shown in Figure 1. The optodes of fNIRS Instrument were xed on a full head cap designed with reference to the We used a 24-ber (38-channel) fNIRS system (SHIMADZU International 10-20 system.

However, for the deep acting, we Using the Student’s t-test, we examined participants’ subjective did not monitor whether the participants were experiencing the feelings after completing the experiment, which could be a emotion corresponding to their facial expression (in fact it is very supplement to the results of fNIRS. The results are shown dicult to do). This made it dicult to conrm whether the in Table 4. participants really performed deep acting. For the means of all four questionnaire items, we found In addition to action theory, we might consider the results no signicant dierence between the surface acting and in light of the conservation of resources theory. According to deep acting groups. this theory, surface acting, because it involves the suppression of emotions, consumes more resources than deep acting does (Richards and Gross, 2000), making it a strategy with greater DISCUSSION cognitive investment (Brotheridge and Lee, 2002). However, our results do not appear to support the conservation of resources Energy Consumption of Surface and theory. We suggest three possible reasons for this. First, there might in fact be no signicant dierence in energy consumption Deep Acting The main hypothesis of our study, which was based on action theory, is that surface acting and deep acting consume dierent amounts of psychological resources--particularly, deep acting TABLE 4 | Status of participants after completing the experiment. leads to greater energy consumption. However, the study results appear somewhat contradictory. When we consider only the Comparison between groups n = 20 n = 18 number of activated areas in the brain, deep acting activated Surface acting Deep acting more channels than surface acting did, thus supporting our study hypothesis. However, when looking at the ANOVA results, we M ± SD M ± SD t observed neither signicant dierences in activation between surface and deep acting nor a signicant interaction of the group Q1 1.750 ± 0.910 1.944 ± 0.938 −0.648 and facial expression.

Q4 5.150 ± 0.745 5.056 ± 0.725 0.395 ANOVA results), it is possible that there is no dierence in energy consumption between surface and deep acting in the Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 represent the four items on the questionnaire.

To explore this, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure changes in hemoglobin density while participants performed a task requiring them to make the opposite emotional facial expression of that presented in a picture. We found that (1) neither surface nor deep acting led to a signicant change in hemoglobin concentration in the prefrontal cortex; (2) making negative and positive facial expressions activated the same left front and middle areas of the prefrontal cortex; and (3) making positive facial expressions activated the rear portion of the prefrontal cortex, but making negative facial expressions did not.

Surface and Deep Acting Consumption than when engaging in surface acting. To induce use of the dierent strategies, we used emotional facial expressions. Because emotional labor involves the display of positive and negative emotions, we presented participants with positive or negative facial expressions and asked them to make the opposite facial expression. This also enabled us to explore whether there was a dierence in the eort for these strategies between positive and negative emotional expressions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethics Statement All research procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee of Guizhou Normal University, Guiyang, Guizhou province, FIGURE 1 | Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) settings.

For channel 10 and channel 13, the distance of emitter and receptor was over 3 cm, so the measurement results Participants were canceled. The “cross” mark was used to represent the canceled results. Twenty male and 20 female senior undergraduates were recruited from a university in Hunan province, China.

However, for the deep acting, we Using the Student’s t-test, we examined participants’ subjective did not monitor whether the participants were experiencing the feelings after completing the experiment, which could be a emotion corresponding to their facial expression (in fact it is very supplement to the results of fNIRS. The results are shown dicult to do). This made it dicult to conrm whether the in Table 4. participants really performed deep acting. For the means of all four questionnaire items, we found In addition to action theory, we might consider the results no signicant dierence between the surface acting and in light of the conservation of resources theory. According to deep acting groups. this theory, surface acting, because it involves the suppression of emotions, consumes more resources than deep acting does (Richards and Gross, 2000), making it a strategy with greater DISCUSSION cognitive investment (Brotheridge and Lee, 2002). However, our results do not appear to support the conservation of resources Energy Consumption of Surface and theory. We suggest three possible reasons for this. First, there might in fact be no signicant dierence in energy consumption Deep Acting The main hypothesis of our study, which was based on action theory, is that surface acting and deep acting consume dierent amounts of psychological resources--particularly, deep acting TABLE 4 | Status of participants after completing the experiment. leads to greater energy consumption. However, the study results appear somewhat contradictory. When we consider only the Comparison between groups n = 20 n = 18 number of activated areas in the brain, deep acting activated Surface acting Deep acting more channels than surface acting did, thus supporting our study hypothesis. However, when looking at the ANOVA results, we M ± SD M ± SD t observed neither signicant dierences in activation between surface and deep acting nor a signicant interaction of the group Q1 1.750 ± 0.910 1.944 ± 0.938 −0.648 and facial expression. In other words, these results do not support Q2 1.800 ± 1.005 1.889 ± 1.023 −0.270 Q3 4.100 ± 0.788 4.167 ± 1.043 −0.224 our hypothesis. Thus, when using a more strict criterion (the Q4 5.150 ± 0.745 5.056 ± 0.725 0.395 ANOVA results), it is possible that there is no dierence in energy consumption between surface and deep acting in the Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 represent the four items on the questionnaire.
