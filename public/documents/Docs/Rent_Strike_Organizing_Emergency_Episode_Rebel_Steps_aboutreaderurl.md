Amy and I are currently in New York where everything is locked down. This episode will definitely be a little less polished than our other episodes, but for now we just wanted to get it out as soon as possible. It’s a really unprecedented moment here in New York, and globally. It sort of feels like the world is ending… but there’s also some hope in the moment.

So regardless of what happens next, you can aim to create a building-based tenants union when this is all done that can fight rent increases and evictions. With climate change and an economic depression underway, this won’t be the last crisis we face together. Organizing now can make sure we are more resilient for the future. Why a national or international Rent Strike? Now, let’s talk about what the demands of a widespread, coordinated rent strike will be. For you and your neighbors, the goal of a one month rent strike may be about affording food and surviving. The goal of a more widespread rent strike is achieving political demands. A rent strike can fundamentally change the way we view housing. Housing is a human right. Building strong tenants unions and exercising our power as tenants are steps toward ensuring housing for all in the long term. With all that in mind, we feel that everyone who can participate in a rent strike should participate. Now, you know your own situation and we don’t want you to just not pay rent (we’ll talk about that more later). But, if you’re in a position to organize a rent strike in your building, please jump in! This is a crucial moment. Perhaps the most attainable political goal is changing the laws so that we are guaranteed housing during this crisis and beyond.

In a world where we can’t gather and meet and where everything is upside down, a rent strike is a powerful tactic to try and gain these demands. There are lots of calls for a rent strike. There are calls in Montreal, Austin, San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, LA, and more. We’re not the first and we’re not going to be the last! But we wanted to add our voice because there’s just not a lot of details of how to do this, especially in this very unusual moment. Basically, we’re asking, if we could organize a rent strike in 7 days across the country and across the world, what would be the first step? What is a rent strike So, what is a rent strike actually? You alone skipping rent is _not _a rent strike, and it’s not organizing. You alone not paying your rent is very dangerous. It could lead to eviction and damage to 7 of 23 10/29/25, 11:51 PM ``` -- ## Page 8 ### Complete Page View ![Page 8 Complete](images/page_008_full.png) Rent Strike Organizing (Emergency Episode) | Rebel Steps for it. So out of that we formed Olympia Solidarity network with the goal of being able to address specific tenant and worker grievances. Franz is also a host on Doomer vs. Bloomer, another Channel Zero Network podcast. In addition to doing tenant organizing in the past, Franz is currently working to organize a rent strike in her area right now for April 1. She’s going to walk us through this step by step. Franz: Right now you know when people they laid off their job and a lot of inability to pay rent like there’s a lot of interest in tenant organizing right now. To begin in earnest, talk to the other tenants in the building. A great place to start is leaving letters at people’s doors and putting up posters in the hallways with an email address for people to reach out to you. Usually, you’d go door to door and have in person conversations for this step, but in the current crisis, that’s not recommended. Franz: Right now obviously having to shift the tactical way from you know maybe door knocking the best idea but flyering, continued sending notes over to your neighbor, putting them on their door or their mailbox things like that. As a side note, it’s a great time to find out if anyone in your building is older or immunocompromised. Offer to help them get groceries or other necessities if you can! It’s a great way to support your neighbors-and build support for the strike. If you’ve already started reaching out to your neighbors for mutual aid, you’ve got a head start on this. For examples of letters and flyers, check out rentstrike.noblogs.org.

Since we don’t have a lot of time right now, it may be difficult to figure out who’s on the landlord’s side. But just do your best to figure out what may be going on based their reactions. Franz: The more people in the apartment complex you can talk to and see what their past experiences with the person have been the better. Generally if you knock on someone’s door and you’re asking them if they have any problem with the apartment complex and then they’re just like very firmly saying no and then going on about how great it is, that’s a pretty good sign. Like I’ve had that happen before you kind of just have to go with your gut instinct and keep someone out like an arm’s distance if they don’t seem like they aren’t down with the work that you’re trying to do. When people reach out to you, enlist them in organizing. If you’re listening to this when we drop it, you likely only have a week to organize before April 1 and only 5 weeks before May 1. You need all the help you can get! If your neighbors are nervous about getting involved, send them this podcast or give them one really specific task, like “Contact one neighbor today” or “Research buildings that might be owned by the same company that owns this building.” Franz: While you’re you know talking to your neighbors whether that you know be door knocking or a quarantine note passing back and forth, figuring out like what people’s capacity and interest in getting involved as an organizer is, because, we talk about the spectrum of allies from people that are a hundred percent your ally, your co-organizer. They want to 11 of 23 10/29/25, 11:51 PM ``` -- ## Page 12 ### Complete Page View ![Page 12 Complete](images/page_012_full.png) Rent Strike Organizing (Emergency Episode) | Rebel Steps Signal which is an encrypted messaging app for like internal communication, but most tenants that we talked to are already going to be on that app. The fewer barriers for people getting plugged in and getting involved the better. So figuring out what types of communication platforms people are used to using and comfortable using is super important. So just like a regular texting group or a Facebook group. An app I really like to use Group.Me cause it’s a really easy way to set up texting groups where doesn’t just get all messed up because everyone has a different type of phone and group messages don’t always work well between like iPhone and android and flip phone. Group.Me allows anyone to be joined in this group without necessarily having to have the app downloaded. Next set a date and time for a call. Again, this would usually be in person but because of the health risks, a call is the best option. Franz: Really what’s important is scheduling a meeting and meeting you know either in person or, in our current circumstances, trying set up digital calls whether that be through you know Zoom, Google hangouts. Jitisi is another one that’s less big capitalist tech company. It’s encrypted so that’s one that I like to use. As you organize a time for the call, also set up an agenda and prepare. Make sure you have someone prepared to facilitate the call and someone ready to take notes. Here are some things you’ll want to cover. • Introductions where people can get to know one another. • Are there any immediate needs in the building that we can 13 of 23 10/29/25, 11:51 PM ``` -- ## Page 14 ### Complete Page View ![Page 14 Complete](images/page_014_full.png) Rent Strike Organizing (Emergency Episode) | Rebel Steps important. Make sure that people are leaving with action items. In the notes, make it clear who is responsible for which task and follow up on these as the days go on. Since this is a major project and you just have a week if you’re aiming for April 1 or 5 weeks if you’re aiming for May 1, I’d recommend setting up daily calls and staying in close contact with people you’re organizing with. Franz: I’ve never participated in a campaign that had like such a short turnaround time. You know it’s like trying to get as many people onboard for like an April rent strike and you know a week as possible. And so typically what we do is we’ll do weekly or every other week meetings depending on how urgent the campaign is. In times like this I could see daily check ins being absolutely crucial. And if it’s not daily meetings that maybe not everyone can commit to, just daily communication whatever that looks like through the digital platforms and checking in with people and confirming where they’re at and what the strategy is and what we’re doing and making sure everyone is comfortable moving forward with that. You’re going to need to just repeat these steps until you have most of your building onboard. As you go, you’ll need to strategize. The first part of strategizing is developing your demands. Franz: When in the past Oly Sol [Olympia Solidarity Network] has started a new campaign the very first step is through these meetings with tenants through you know the door knocking and figuring out what people grievances are. Really trying to 15 of 23 10/29/25, 11:51 PM ``` -- ## Page 16 ### Complete Page View ![Page 16 Complete](images/page_016_full.png) Rent Strike Organizing (Emergency Episode) | Rebel Steps owns apartment complexes across the country? Is it a nonprofit that prides itself in providing affordable housing to low income tenants? All of those different scenarios are gonna require different considerations and different tactics. In a typical tenant organizing campaign, next you’d use tactics such as delivering a letter to the landlord or occupying an office, and those just aren’t possible now. Franz: Once you figure out those first two things- what your demands are and who the target is and what specifics considerations you have in pressuring them, it kind of comes to figuring out what the tactics you have available to you and when it makes sense to employ them. The solidarity network model, what we try to focus on is a constant escalation of tactics. So starting with something fairly small and benign and being able to like constantly kind of ramp up the pressure. So our first step is pretty much always, once we’ve consolidated the demands, we write a demand letter. We’ll deliver that demand letter to the landlord usually in a big kind of showy flashy way that demonstrates our like grass-roots people power. That you know it’s going to be particularly hard right now you know when we need to be socially distancing. And so figuring out how to adapt that tactic and all the other tactics that we normally have in our tool belt is something that’s going to be particularly difficult and takes a lot of consideration and thought. But going off of these kind of like established models of tenant organizing and trying to like modify and adjust them to these specific circumstances is something that we can be doing right now. In light of coronavirus, one idea is getting your letter signed by 17 of 23 10/29/25, 11:51 PM ``` -- ## Page 18 ### Complete Page View ![Page 18 Complete](images/page_018_full.png) Rent Strike Organizing (Emergency Episode) | Rebel Steps existing milieus and agitating as many people as possible participate in this. And then you know when April rolls around, ideally we have the necessary threshold to make it safe for people to actually withhold their rent. If that can be achieved and specific apartment complexes or against specific landlords, that’s awesome and amazing and should be absolutely counted as a win but also recognizing that there is a lot of gray area between like an absolute win and an absolute lose and it’s important to use anything that’s less than an absolute win, absolutely celebrate the victories you did have. Publicize your victories. Use it as a means to inspire more people to action and put out there like the methods and tactics you used for other people to replicate and then use that momentum to continue to push for an even bigger rent. Start an even more effective, more all encompassing rent strike next month or push for the other demands I was talking about the other grievances tenants might have in an apartment complex and hopefully sustain this tenant power in the long term. Thinking about how you wrap up the campaign is super important or how you wrap up one stage of a campaign and move on to the next and continuing that momentum and learning from mistakes and learning from areas that you may consider a loss and using wins you catalyze further action into happening. Looking toward further action is key, since April 1 is fast approaching. We need to think long term about building momentum. Franz: The really quick turnaround thing is really difficult for me to wrap my head around. It’s very new even for people that 19 of 23 10/29/25, 11:51 PM ``` -- ## Page 20 ### Complete Page View ![Page 20 Complete](images/page_020_full.png) Rent Strike Organizing (Emergency Episode) | Rebel Steps Trying new things is uncomfortable and difficult. Talking to your neighbors who you’ve only passed in the hall before, will likely be awkward at times. Jay Lucien of IWW, DSA-LSC and Symbiosis Federation in Milwaukee, and Varlam Akrat of Tenants United in Chicago wrote of their own uneasiness when entering tenant organizing for an article in Roar magazine. They wrote, quote “Many of us who started the union had experience in other forms of organizing and had no illusions about how difficult building the union would be. The biggest fear for many of us was that people might get evicted as a result of our mistakes. We have since come to realize that the real harm comes from not getting involved. Our experience has taught us that in cases where tenants fight back, they are significantly more likely to get a better outcome, and crucially, to help avoid future evictions.” end quote With a pandemic in full swing and an economic depression happening, it’s going to at least be uncomfortable anyway and more than uncomfortable for many of us. Now is the time to jump in. Also, I just want to stress that we don’t know what tomorrow is going to look like. We’re not encouraging any reckless behavior. The risks of a rent strike are incredibly high, including risk of eviction. Please take this decision seriously. You know your unique situation best! But the reason we’re putting this out now, is that a mass rent strike creates more safety for all of us. They can’t evict us all. To be completely transparent, for me, my landlord just owns 21 of 23 10/29/25, 11:51 PM ``` -- ## Page 22 ### Complete Page View ![Page 22 Complete](images/page_022_full.png) Rent Strike Organizing (Emergency Episode) | Rebel Steps This episode was written, edited, and produced by Amy and myself.
