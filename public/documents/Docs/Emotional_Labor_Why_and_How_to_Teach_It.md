Enhancing public engagement, promoting justice and equity, working effectively as a member of a team, and leading in a dynamic and unpredictable environment require skills that are very different from those associated with person-to-object transactions. Person-to-person interactions between citizens and the state apply both technical (cognitive) knowledge and higher-order emotion skills. Service exchanges between workers and citizens require workers to sense the proper tone and medium for expressing a thought or feeling, and to determine whether, when, and how to act on that instantaneous analysis. To ignore this combination of analysis, affect, judgment, and communication is to ignore the “social lube” that enables rapport, elicits desired responses, and ensures that interpersonal exchanges are constructive. Cognitive skills also are required in these jobs, but cannot be exercised effectively until they are paired with emotion skills (Guy & Newman, 2004). Among these affective skills, of primary importance is the ability to sense the emotional state of the other person, to adjust one’s own response accordingly, and to react empathically. Failure to acknowledge the duality of emotive and cognitive skills has caused managers, scholars, and students to ignore an essential component of person-to-person interaction. Criticism of the proverbial Master’s of Business Administration (MBA) “bean-counter” is emblematic of what is lacking in MBA preparation. Lest preparation in Master’s of Public Administration (MPA) and Master’s of Public Policy (MPP) degrees incur the same criticism, we should strengthen what currently is a weakness in our programs. Few professions demand more emotion work from their employees than public service. Worker-client and state-agent-citizen interactions are the center of public service work, and emotional labor is the way that much of this work is performed. Emotional labor is relational work that requires human service workers to manage their own emotions, and to elicit behaviors and feelings from clients and citizens. Although emotions and feelings often are dismissed as unprofessional and interfering, they are required if human services are to be delivered effectively (Guy, Newman & Mastracci, 2008). NASPAA defines the MPA degree as “the professional degree for people who want a public service career in management … [that] develop[s] the skills and techniques used by leaders and managers to implement policies, projects, and programs that resolve important societal problems, while addressing 124 Journal of Public Affairs Education ``` -- ## Page 4 ### Complete Page View ![Page 4 Complete](images/page_004_full.png) Emotional Labor: Why and How to Teach It to “acquire voluntary compliance” (Thompson, 2006) from an uncooperative segment of the citizenry. Children and family service agencies investigate abuse and sometimes are forced to remove children from their parents. Nonprofit organizations and county human services agencies work even more closely with the public, and the nonprofit sector addresses some of the most sensitive issues in public service at this level, including substance abuse, mental health services, housing assistance, domestic violence, and suicide hotlines. But most formal training in public administration fails to comprehend the totality of this labor. Instead it focuses on a “truncated remnant” -- the part that only requires cognitive skills. The founding narratives of the field create an incomplete concept of work that endures today in job descriptions, training materials, and performance evaluations (Mastracci, Newman, & Guy, 2006). The historical origins of the concept of work in public administration underscore its inappropriateness to contemporary styles of public service. By way of background, we next provide a description of how a manufacturing-oriented tradition led to this manufacturing-oriented pedagogy. A Manufacturing-Oriented Tradition Frederick Taylor, the Gilbreths, Leonard White, and others of the early 20th century focused on problems of inefficiency by prescribing a remedy in the form of systematic management, and believed that performance was a science resting on well-defined laws and principles. If Frederick Taylor and Taylorism are accepted as part of the intellectual history of public administration and management, and if Max Weber and Weberian notions of bureaucracy are similarly accepted as part of our founding narrative, then so also is “Fordism.” The term Fordism was coined in 1916 to describe the cultural and economic influence of Henry Ford’s production methods in the auto industry. As it relates specifically to the concept of work, it is characterized by • A highly specialized division of labor where workers are trained and assigned to one specific aspect of the production process; • A standardization of products and how they are made; and • The arrangement of workers along assembly lines. Fordism organizes workers according to how the end result is produced, and its approach to labor encompasses Tayloristic efficiency principles and their emphasis on measurable skills. Weber, Taylor, and Ford all were inspired by the efficiency and effectiveness of the pre-World War I, Prussian bureaucracy, and defined work according to what was measurable about a job. 126 Journal of Public Affairs Education ``` -- ## Page 6 ### Complete Page View ![Page 6 Complete](images/page_006_full.png) Emotional Labor: Why and How to Teach It in relating themselves to other people, the objects of their work, the working itself -- carries with it feelings. We feel for those who are our clients -- compassion or disdain…, and so on… As a result, unconscious feelings silently accompany all our relations with people and things at work -- at times distorting, at times supporting our ability to get work done (p.124). As the emerging body of work on emotional labor attests, the expression and management of emotions remain for the most part invisible. The conflict between the universalism of bureaucracies and the particularism of care-giving (Abel & Nelson, 1990) is difficult to reconcile. Third, due to the rise of urbanization and industrialization, a dichotomy emerged between home and work, with each domain evoking different behaviors. Home became a refuge from the dehumanization of the workplace. The practice of nurturing and sustaining while simultaneously performing manual labor -- as had occurred on the family farm -- disappeared from the definition of work. Relational work was defined in a way that was not germane to the task at hand. Instead, work and accompanying job descriptions focused on the tangible production of marketable goods and services. Efforts resulting in positive relationships, a sense of community, and resolution of conflict did not fit easily into quantifiable elements, so they were treated as extraneous, despite the suasion of Mary Parker Follett (Newman & Guy, 1998). Separating the roles of men and women, with men playing the role of primary workers in the public world, and women playing the same role in the private domain of the household, spilled over into the recognition and valuation of skills in the labor market (Baines, Evans, & Neysmith, 1998). Underlying work-ethic norms reflect an economic structure that privileges work if it is done in the marketplace, and renders it invisible if done by women in the home: Having entered the private realm of the home, caregiving becomes invisible. It runs on a different clock than the world of employment. Both these characteristics make it difficult to see it as work when the definition of work is so firmly market- related. It is, after all, work that isn’t seen and isn’t valued except when it isn’t done! (Baines, Evans, & Neysmith, 1998, p.239). A corollary to this is that only observable tasks matter. This approach assures an impersonal, objective, evaluative process that protects against favoritism due to race, age, gender, or any other characteristic that differentiates one worker from another. It also assures that invisibility will continue for all labors that are relational in nature. The fourth institutional force is that of so-called “market value.” This is 128 Journal of Public Affairs Education ``` -- ## Page 8 ### Complete Page View ![Page 8 Complete](images/page_008_full.png) Emotional Labor: Why and How to Teach It and to demonstrate the distinctiveness and value-added nature of public affairs programs (Raffel, Maser, & McFarland, 2007). Will a focus on public service values translate into a curriculum that aligns with the actual work of those who serve the public? What would student competencies for public service look like? As noted, public and nonprofit agencies rely heavily on the effective exercise of emotion work. Public service requires workers who are skilled in relationship-building. Does our pedagogy prepare graduates to be proficient in these emotive skills? Or do our curricula adhere to the norms carried over from the industrial era, despite the fact that public service is, by definition and practice, a “people-service?” As an applied field, how can we teach our students to apply -- in a practical sense -- their acquired skills in the person-to-person transactions that occur at the street level? In sum, do the standards (both current and proposed) privilege cognitive, measurable skills over relational skills -- a manufacturing-orientation over a service-orientation? We now turn to this overarching question. Manufacturing Our Standards The “NASPAA General Information and Standards for Professional Masters Degree Programs” (available online at www.naspaa.org) apply to master’s degree programs designed to provide professional education for leadership in public affairs, public policy, and public administration. The purpose of the curriculum is to prepare students for professional leadership in public service (Standard 4.1). Common curriculum components are intended to enhance the students’ values, knowledge, and skills for acting ethically and effectively in the management of public service organizations; in the application of quantitative and qualitative techniques of analysis; and with an understanding of the public policy and organizational environment (Standard 4.21). Components of “management” include human resources, budgeting and financial processes, information management, technology applications, and policy. Components of “techniques of analysis” include policy and program formulation, implementation and evaluation, decision making, and problem solving. Attention to the context (“environment”) includes political, legal, economic, and social institutions/ processes, as well as the concepts and behavior of organization and management. We have no quarrel with our graduates becoming proficient in management, analytical skills, and policy. These are essential cognitive abilities. Our argument is that these skills are necessary, but they also are insufficient for preparing our students to be effective public servants. Missing from this skills inventory is attention to the “public” and “service” aspects of public service. Stivers (2003) illuminates this in her examination of administration and management: Administration (from the Latin administrare, to minister) connotes a “ministerial act, the performance of public duty, the execution of stewardship on behalf of another or service to another” (p.214). By contrast, management implies “the 130 Journal of Public Affairs Education ``` -- ## Page 10 ### Complete Page View ![Page 10 Complete](images/page_010_full.png) Emotional Labor: Why and How to Teach It Part of the differences is found in the fine print. In an (exciting) departure from the current standards, the following proposed cross-cutting skills from Piskulich & Mandell (2008) “are relevant for all the above mentioned competencies”: • Demonstrate self-knowledge: Awareness of one’s own stylistic preferences for relating to others, communicating with others, making decisions, managing yourself in groups, and the impact that this has on relationships and your ability to influence others… • Evidences sensitivity and responsiveness to beliefs and behaviors associated with differences among people because of their ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, physical characteristics, religion, age, etc. • Demonstrate flexibility: Adapts behavior and work methods to differences (whether they are differences in thought, communication style, perspective, age, interests, fairness or some other variable)… • Negotiate: Discerns the interests and values of others; surfaces assumptions; secures agreement on ground rules and tolerable outcomes; gains cooperation of others to accomplish goals… • Facilitate: …[B]uilds actionable consensus… • Relates to all kinds of people and develops appropriate rapport that leads to constructive and effective relationships… • Work productively in teams: Interacts effectively in a team, demonstrating composure, professionalism and effective working relationships (Piskulich & Mandell, 2008, p.18). This is the language of emotional labor and emotive skills. As we prepare our students to become practitioners in the professions of 21st- century public service, attention to people skills and service-orientation is key. Emotional labor skills are at the heart of service delivery, and are integral to public sector reform. The leap of faith, which assumes that all types of public service work have all the same essentials, has enabled us to ignore a simple truth: Person-to-person interactions require skills that are not used in person-to-object interactions. A shift from “engineering of things to the engineering of people” requires attention to “the human element” (Noble, as cited in Stivers, 2003, p.217). To ground ourselves in “pure” rationality is to run the risk of ignoring “essentially human and humanly measured care for our fellow humans” (Havel, as cited in Stivers, 1993, p.257). As we move away from the “brick and mortar bureaucracy” of government (Giuliani, 2002, p.104), person-to-person transactions in the citizen-state encounter become more pronounced. Relationship, rapport, interaction, compassion, service, connectedness, and soul work comprise the vocabulary of this relational administrative perspective. The insight, anticipation, and tenor of the communication between persons prior to, during, and after the exchange require energy, focus, and sensing. 132 Journal of Public Affairs Education ``` -- ## Page 12 ### Complete Page View ![Page 12 Complete](images/page_012_full.png) Emotional Labor: Why and How to Teach It teaching,” as well as what is learned (Raffel, Maser, & McFarland, 2007, p.1). Similarly, a focus on “interpersonal skills, and cultural competencies” (p.3) are aligned with the importance of emotive skills. “Making a difference” and “changing the world” (p.2) are heady goals, and will require our graduates to be fluent in the art as well as the science of public administration. Now we move to where the devil resides -- in the details. How can this new subject matter fit into the curriculum without having to add a course to the core? How to Teach Content and Style By now you should be asking: How do you teach and measure enthusiasm, empathy, non-verbal skills, caring, responsiveness, and so forth? Where does it fit into the curriculum? Emotion work fits comfortably into courses that focus on interpersonal relations, as well as overview courses that describe the nature of public service work. These include introductory courses such as “The Profession of Public Service,” “Introduction to Public Administration,” “Leadership in Public Service,” and similar subjects. Courses that focus on organizational dynamics include “Organization Development,” “Administrative Theory,” “Human Resource Management,” “Managing People,” “Public Management,” and so forth. Talking the Talk In terms of content, lectures should delineate the nature of emotion work as contrasted with cognitive work; the relationship of and the difference between emotional intelligence and emotional labor; the skill requirements of emotion work as compared to knowledge work; the antecedents to and consequences of its performance -- including the feeling of making a difference through one’s work, and affecting another person’s life, as well as the risk of burnout. Suggested readings and resource material are listed in the Appendix. Following is a sketch of how four main points can be covered. Point 1: Explain emotional labor -- including the relationship of and the contrast between emotional intelligence and the performance of emotion work. While emotional intelligence refers to a person’s innate ability to be aware of personal emotions and to sense the emotive state of another person, emotional labor involves managing the emotional state of the self, as well as that of the other person. Artful affect is a useful term to explain the performance of emotional labor. This term captures the artful sensing of another’s emotional state, while crafting one’s own affective expressions so as to elicit a desired response. Practicing artful affect is both proactive and reactive. Proactive means the worker is required to anticipate the emotional state of the other person, and act to mitigate it. Reactive means the worker is required to respond to whatever emotional state the other person is in at the start of the interaction. 134 Journal of Public Affairs Education ``` -- ## Page 14 ### Complete Page View ![Page 14 Complete](images/page_014_full.png) Emotional Labor: Why and How to Teach It university’s theater department in order to facilitate at least one session with students goes a long way toward internalizing the principles of emotional labor in public service. Moreover, a drama workshop can spur enlightening discussions on the tension between the need to engage in deep acting, and the ethics of doing so. Self-assessment: A range of assessment tools exists to help students discover their own communication styles. None of us communicate or exert emotional labor in the same way. Similar patterns exist, but discovering one’s personal style of communication helps students to better understand how they “do” emotional labor. Available assessment methods can be as simple as self-administered paper and Web-based quizzes, or as complex as off-site, multi-day retreats facilitated by professionals. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is perhaps the most well- known, oft-used, and oft-imitated assessment instrument for a range of career- and psychological-based applications, and it includes styles of communication and interpersonal relations (Myers & Myers, 2009). How to Become a Better Negotiator, by Luecke and Patterson (2008), is published by AMACOM, a division of the American Management Association. It includes a communication assessment tool that has been used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the U.S. Army Military Intelligence School, among other institutions. What’s My Communication Style? (Teambuilders Plus, 2009) is a multi-media training and assessment program intended for use in a facilitated group context. The Forte Institute for Interpersonal Communication offers a series of interactive team- building seminars, executive communication preparation for meetings, coaching to improve communication performance for individuals and groups, and customized off-site retreats facilitated by certified professionals. Class assignment: In conjunction with lectures on emotional labor, an assignment that helps students comprehend how it is exercised and experienced on the job reinforces the subject and aids learning. This can be achieved by asking students to interview a public service worker who regularly has person- to-person contact with citizens. This could include those who staff phone lines or who meet face-to-face with the public, but would exclude e-mail- only interactions, because they do not require emotional spontaneity. Eligible employees include public school teachers, social service workers, crisis line call-takers, police officers, firefighters, intake workers, probation counselors, courtroom staff, university admissions staff, employment training staff, and city hall receptionists, among many others. Interview questions could include the following: (a) Tell me about your work, (b) Tell me about a case/interaction that sticks in your mind where the citizen/client was emotional, (c) How did you handle the situation?, (d) How did you feel about what happened after it was over?, (e) Does this sort of exchange happen often?, (f ) What does it take for you to put something like this behind you and face the next case/incident? In most cases, these questions will trigger sufficient discussion for the interviewer to probe more deeply and, in the process, 136 Journal of Public Affairs Education ``` -- ## Page 16 ### Complete Page View ![Page 16 Complete](images/page_016_full.png) Emotional Labor: Why and How to Teach It Himmelweit, S.
