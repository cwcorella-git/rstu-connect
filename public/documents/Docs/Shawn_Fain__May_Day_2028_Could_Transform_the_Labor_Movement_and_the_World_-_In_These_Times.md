               Transform the Labor Movement—
               and the World
               7–9 minutes
               Members of the United Auto Workers courageously fought
               corporate greed at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis last fall
               during the historic six-week Stand-Up Strike. Because of their
               determination and commitment, we won record contracts with
               the Big Three automakers.
               After decades of falling behind, UAW autoworkers are finally
               moving forward again.
               We made a lot of ambitious demands at the bargaining table.
               One in particular may not have gotten the same attention as
               the reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments or the
               reopening of the Stellantis assembly plant in Belvidere, Ill. —
               but it could also prove transformational: We aligned our
               contracts to expire at midnight on April 30, 2028.
               We are fully preparing to strike on May Day 2028, which is
               critically important for several reasons.
               The first is that, to reshape the economy into one that works for
               the benefit of everyone — not just the wealthy — we need to
               reclaim our country’s history of militant trade unions that

               united workers across race, gender and nationality.
               May Day has its roots right here in the United States — in 1886,
               in the streets of Chicago, where workers were organizing and
               fighting for the 8-hour workday. This demand was met with
               brutal resistance by employers, who used both vicious
               mercenaries and the police to violently suppress mass protests
               led by unions. A bomb exploded in Chicago’s Haymarket
               Square during a clash between workers and police on May 4,
               1886, killing several police officers and others.
               The result was a sham trial, and seven labor leaders were
               sentenced to death.
               The cause of those Haymarket Martyrs became the cause of
               the working class around the world, and May 1 became an
               international holiday commemorating the fight of workers
               everywhere to reclaim their time and the value of their labor.
               Now, about 138 years later, May Day is celebrated as an official
               holiday in countries from Argentina to South Africa to Sweden
               to Hong Kong, just about everywhere — except its country
               of origin.
               That’s not a coincidence. The billionaire class and their political
               lackeys have done everything they can to white out the true
               history of the working class in our country.
               The billionaire class and their political lackeys have done

               class in our country.
               They want us to believe that corporate bosses gave workers
               decent wages, benefits and safer working conditions out of the

               goodness of their hearts. That justice and equality for people of
               color, for immigrants, for women and for queer communities
               were gifts benevolently handed down from above.
               But we know the truth. Every law passed, every union formed
               and contract won — every improvement made at the
               workplace — has been won through the tireless sacrifice of the
               working class.
               But if we are to truly reclaim the power and importance of May
               Day, then it can’t be through empty symbolism. It must be
               through action.
               We wanted to ensure our contracts expired at midnight on April
               30, 2028, not as a symbolic gesture, but as a rallying cry. We’ve
               asked other unions to join us in setting their contract expiration
               dates to May Day 2028 in hopes the labor movement can
               collectively aspire to building the power needed to change
               the world.
               We form unions in our workplaces because we know we have
               far more power together than we do as individuals. What is
               true for workers in one workplace is true for workers across all
               workplaces. When unions organize together across industries
               and countries, our power is exponentially amplified. The fact is:
               without workers, the world stops running.
               If working people are truly going to win on a massive scale —
               truly win healthcare as a human right, win pensions so
               everyone can retire with dignity, win an improved standard of
               living and more time off the clock so we can spend more of our
               time with our family and friends — then unions have to start
               thinking bigger.

               I’ll give you an example.
               Last summer, during the lead-up to the contract expiration at
               the Big Three, I had the opportunity to meet with Teamsters
               General President Sean O’Brien at their headquarters in
               Washington, D.C. During our conversation, he pledged that no
               trucks driven by Teamsters would deliver parts to struck Big
               Three facilities.
               The power of UAW autoworkers withholding our labor during
               the Stand-Up Strike was massive. But with the Teamsters
               supporting our fight, refusing to deliver parts to Big Three
               facilities, we had even more power. It created another
               headache for the Detroit automakers. It created more pressure
               on the Big Three to settle.
               Now, imagine that type of worker solidarity on a much
               bigger scale.
               And because corporate greed doesn’t recognize borders,
               neither should our solidarity. In the UAW, we’ve seen firsthand
               how companies pit workers against one another. Workers in
               Michigan are pitted against workers in Alabama, workers in the
               United States are pitted against workers in Mexico, workers in
               North America are pitted against workers in South America.
               It’s a simple game. Companies shift production — or threaten
               to shift production — to locations where the labor is cheaper,
               the environmental regulations more lax, and the tax cuts and
               subsidies are greater.
               A united working class is the only effective wall against the
               billionaire class’ race to the bottom. For the U.S. labor
               movement, that means grappling with some hard truths. Like

               the undeniable fact that it is impossible to protect American
               jobs while ignoring the plight of everyone else.

               There’s been talk about a “general strike” for as long as I’ve
               been alive. But that’s all it has been: talk.
               If we are serious about building enough collective power to win
               universal healthcare and the right to retire with dignity, then
               we need to spend the next four years getting prepared.
               A general strike isn’t going to happen on a whim. It’s not going
               to happen over social media. A successful general strike is
               going to take time, mass coordination, and a whole lot of work
               by the labor movement.
               As working people, we must come together. We can no longer
               allow corporations, politicians and borders to divide us.
               It’s time we reclaimed May Day for the working class.
               That’s what our May Day contract expiration is all about.
