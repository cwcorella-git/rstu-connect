                - Injuries: 67+ • Fatalities: 2 deputized civilians

                - Fatalities: 2 strikers

                - Arrests: Many

## The Minneapolis general strike of 1934 grew out of a strike
## by Teamsters against most of the trucking companies
                operating in Minneapolis, the major distribution center for the
## Upper Midwest. The strike began on May 16, 1934 in the
                Market District (the modern day Warehouse District). The worst
                single day was Friday, July 20, called "Bloody Friday", when
                police shot at strikers in a downtown truck battle, killing two
## and injuring 67. Ensuing violence lasted periodically
## throughout the summer. The strike was formally ended on
## August 22.

                With a coalition formed by local leaders associated with the
## Trotskyist Communist League of America, a group that later
                founded the Socialist Workers Party (United States), the strike
                paved the way for the organization of over-the-road drivers and
                the growth of the Teamsters labor union. This strike, along with
## the 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike and the 1934 Toledo
                Auto-Lite Strike led by the American Workers Party, were also
                important catalysts for the rise of industrial unionism in the
## 1930s, much of which was organized through the Congress of
## Industrial Organizations.

## The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, under the
                leadership of Daniel Tobin in 1933, was a conservative union
                averse to strikes. While the union's members were often called
                on to support other unions' strikes, since their role in transport
                brought them in contact with workers in many other unionized
                industries, and had developed strong traditions of solidarity in
                some areas, the International Union itself was cautious to the
## point of having resistance to striking whatsoever. The
                provisions of the International Constitution that required a two
                thirds vote of the membership to authorize any strike action
                and that gave the International President the power to withhold
                strike benefits if he believed that a local union had struck
                prematurely, It also divided its members into separate unions
                along craft or industry lines: ice wagon drivers in one local,
                produce drivers in another, milk drivers in a third, and so forth.
                The Teamsters also had a number of general locals; Local 574
## in Minneapolis, which had no more than 75 members in 1934,
## was one of them. A number of members, including several
## Communist Party members who had gone to the newly formed
                Communist League of America (Left Opposition) in the internal
                split following Trotsky's expulsion, became members of Local
## 574 in the early 1930s.

## These members – Ray Dunne, his brothers Miles and Grant,
## Carl Skoglund and later Farrell Dobbs – began by organizing
                coal drivers through a strike in the coldest part of 1933 that
## ignored both the cumbersome approval procedures
## established under the International's Constitution and the
## ineffective mediation procedures offered under the National
                Industrial Recovery Act. The victory gave the union a great deal
4 of 13 9/7/25, 12:04 PM Minneapolis general strike of 1934 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## of credibility among both drivers and their employers. The
                union began organizing drivers wherever they could be found.
                The union also began preparing for the strike in a number of
## ways. It rented a large hall that could be used as a strike
## headquarters, kitchen and infirmary. It organized a women's
                auxiliary to staff the headquarters. Finally, it entered into
                discussions with the sympathetic leaders of organizations of
## farmers and the unemployed to obtain their support for the
## upcoming strike.

## The strike began on May 16, 1934. The strike was remarkably
                effective, shutting down most commercial transport in the city
## with the exception of certain farmers, who were allowed to
                bring their produce into town, but delivering directly to grocers,
                rather than to the market area, which the union had shut down.
                The market was to be the scene of the fiercest fighting during
## the earliest part of the strike. On Saturday, May 19, 1934,
## Minneapolis Police and private guards beat a number of
                strikers trying to prevent strikebreakers from unloading a truck
                in that area and waylaid several strikers who had responded to
                a report that scab drivers were unloading newsprint at the two
## major dailies' (newspapers) loading docks. Police followed
## injured strikers to the strikers headquarters. The strikers
                refused to let the police into the headquarters, leading to more
## violence between police and strikers.

## Fighting intensified the following Monday, May 21, when the
## police, augmented by several hundred newly deputized
## members of the Citizens Alliance, an employer organization,
                attempted to open up the market for trucking. Fighting began
5 of 13 9/7/25, 12:04 PM Minneapolis general strike of 1934 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                when a loaded truck began leaving a loading dock. The battle
## became a general melee when hundreds of pickets armed with
                clubs of all sorts rushed to the area to support the picketers;
                when the police drew their guns as if to shoot, the union sent a
## truck loaded with picketers into the mass of police and
                deputies in order to make it impossible for them to fire without
## shooting each other.

## "National Guardsmen, Called by Olson, Patrol Minneapolis"
## Daily Worker, July 30, 1934

                Other unions, particularly in the building trades, began to strike
## in sympathy with the Teamsters. The American Federation of
                Labor's Central Labor Council in Minneapolis offered financial
## and moral support for the strike, allowing the union to
## coordinate some of its picketing activities from its
## headquarters.

## The fighting resumed on Tuesday, May 22. The picketers took
## the offensive and succeeded in driving both police and
## deputies from the market and the area around the union's
## headquarters. Of the several hundred deputized "special
                police", two (C. Arthur Lyman and Peter Erath) were cornered
                and killed. In the following "general riot" another roughly two
## dozen special police, municipal police, and strikers were
                beaten or wounded.[8][additional citation(s) needed]
                The Central Labor Council, the Building Trades Council and the
6 of 13 9/7/25, 12:04 PM Minneapolis general strike of 1934 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## Teamsters Joint Council approached Mike Johannes, the
                Minneapolis Chief of Police, to propose a truce, under which the
                local would cease picketing for twenty-four hours if the police
## and the employers ceased trying to move trucks. The
## employers, the Teamsters and the building trades signed a
                formal truce agreement. Johannes, however, declared that the
                police would move trucks once the truce expired, leading the
## union to announce that it was resuming picketing.

                At this point city government appealed for Governor Floyd B.
                Olson to mobilize the National Guard, the 34th Infantry Division
                (United States) under Adjutant General Ellard A. Walsh.[9][10]
## Olson did, but stopped short of actually deploying them,
                unwilling to alienate his labor supporters. Olson had already
## been attempting to mediate the dispute, On May 25, the
## employers and the union reached an agreement on a contract
                that provided union recognition, reinstatement for all strikers,
## seniority and a no-discrimination clause. The membership
## approved it overwhelmingly.

## The union thought that it had the employers' agreement to
                include the "inside workers", the warehouse employees as well
## as the drivers and loaders. When the employers reneged on
## that agreement the strike resumed on Tuesday, July 17.
## Governor Olson again mobilized, but did not deploy, the
## National Guard.

                The union's leadership had chosen to use different tactics in
                this strike; it ordered its members to picket without carrying
## any clubs or weapons of any sort. The police, on the other
## hand, armed themselves with riot guns which sprayed

## buckshot over a wide arc.

                On Friday, July 20, a single yellow truck drove to the central
                market escorted by fifty armed policemen. The truck made the
                small delivery successfully, but a vehicle carrying picketers
                wielding clubs cut off the truck. The police opened fire on the
                vehicle with shotguns, then turned their guns on the strikers
                filling the surrounding streets. An eyewitness reported that as
                the pickets moved to aid their fallen comrades, "They flowed
                directly into buckshot fire ... And the cops let them have it as
                they picked up their wounded. Lines of living, solid men fell,
## broke, wavering." He also said he saw one man "stepping on
## his own intestines, bright and bursting in the street, and
                another holding his severed arm in his right hand." By the end
                of hostilities, two strikers (Henry Ness and John Belor) were
## dead and sixty-seven wounded.

## The police violence sparked a show of support from other
## unions and a one-day strike of transport workers. Each side
                stepped back from the confrontation: Chief Johannes and
                Mayor Bainbridge faced calls for their impeachment, while the
                union continued to urge its members not to give the police any
## justification for further attacks, disarming a number of
                picketers who wanted to return fire with fire. The union did not
## make any overt efforts to stop later trucks accompanied by
                convoys of up to forty police cars that tried to deliver goods,
## but sent so many cars with pickets to accompany those
                convoys that the police were never able to shepherd more than
## a few delivery trucks on any given day.

## Martial law and settlement

                [edit]
                A public commission, set up later by the governor, reported:
                Police took direct aim at the pickets and fired to kill. Physical
## safety of the police was at no time endangered. No weapons
## were in possession of the pickets.

                On July 26, after the violence which led to the deaths of two
                protesters, Farmer-Labor governor Olson declared martial law
## and mobilized four thousand National Guardsmen of the 34th
                Infantry. Following this mobilization, there was no further loss
## of life.

## Between July 26 and August 1, the National Guard began
## issuing operating permits to truck drivers, and engaging in
## roving patrols, curfews, and security details. On August 1,
## National Guard troops seized strike headquarters and placed
                arrested union leaders in a stockade at the state fairgrounds in
                Saint Paul. The next day, the headquarters were restored to the
## union and the leaders released from the stockade, as the
                National Guard carried out a token raid on the Citizens Alliance
## headquarters.

## The union appealed to the Central Labor Union for a general
## strike and the governor issued an ultimatum that he would
## stop all trucks by midnight, August 5, if there was no
                settlement. Nevertheless, by August 14, there were thousands
                of trucks operating under military permits. Although the strike
## was gravely weakened by martial law and economic pressure,
## union leaders made it clear that it would continue.

## On August 21, a federal mediator got acceptance of a
## settlement proposal from A. W. Strong, head of the Citizens

## Alliance, incorporating the union's major demands. The
## settlement was ratified, breaking the back of employer
## resistance to unionization in Minneapolis. In March 1935,
                International president Daniel Tobin expelled Local 574 from
                the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). However, in
                August 1936, Tobin was forced to relent and recharter the local
                as 544. The leaders of 544 went on to develop the conference
## bargaining that exists today in the IBT.

                Local 544 remained under socialist leadership until 1941, when
                eighteen leaders of the union and the Socialist Workers Party
                were sentenced to federal prison. They were the first victims of
## the anti-radical Smith Act, a law the United States Supreme
## Court eventually found to be unconstitutional. The members
                sentenced to prison included James P. Cannon, Grace Carlson,
                Jake Cooper, Oscar Coover, Harry DeBoer, Farrell Dobbs, V.R.
## Dunne, Max Geldman, Albert Goldman, Clarence Hamel, Emil
## Hansen, Carlos Hudson, Karl Kuehn, Felix Morrow, Edward
## Palmquist, Alfred Russel, Oscar Schoenfeld, Carl Skoglund.

## The strike changed Minneapolis, which had been an open shop
                citadel under the control of the Citizens Alliance for years
                before 1934. In the aftermath of this strike thousands of other
                workers in other industries organized with the assistance of
## Local 574.

                The strike also gave the Communist League, later renamed the
                Workers Party of America, a strong position in Local 574, and in
## other Teamster locals within the metropolitan area of
## Minneapolis. Trotskyist strength grew to over 100 members.
## This gave leadership to the Trotskyists through the various
                unions they led within the Central Labor Council. As mentioned
10 of 13 9/7/25, 12:04 PM Minneapolis general strike of 1934 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                below, through organizing the first area-wide contract for any
                union outside of rail, the Trotskyists established locals of their
                party wherever there were Teamster locals, from South Dakota
                to Iowa to Colorado. The party was later driven out of that local
## by prosecutions under the Smith Act and a trusteeship
## imposed by Tobin in the early 1940s.

## More importantly, the strike launched the career of Farrell
                Dobbs, who played a significant role in the organization of overthe-road drivers throughout the Midwest. Those efforts led in
                turn to the transformation of the Teamsters from a craft union,
                made up of locals with a parochial focus on their own craft and
## locality, into a truly national union.
