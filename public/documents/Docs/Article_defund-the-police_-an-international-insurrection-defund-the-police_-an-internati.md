## Introduction

The Black Lives Matter movement galvanised protest movements against police and state violence around the globe. A common theme in many protests was the demand to ‘defund the police’. One of the motivations for writing this book is the increasing attention the idea of defunding or divesting from police forces is gaining in mainstream politics and media. We need to seriously consider what is required to fundamentally change the way policing operates. The option of divestment opens up this discussion. Defund the Police is not another book about police reform. It is an engagement in the contemporary debate on the politics and possibilities of police abolition. To date, the majority of popular and academic literature in policing studies, law reform, and criminology has been preoccupied with conventional ideas related to top-down police reform. These reforms include eorts, for example, to recruit diverse and inclusive police ocers, to implement cultural-awareness training, to introduce technical solutions like the use of body cameras, to place limitations on the use of force, and to introduce police-led programmes aimed at cultivating localised or community policing. We have had decades of these types of reforms, and part of the explosion of protest internationally is driven by the profound sense of frustration at the inability of police to reform themselves.1 The protests against police violence and demands to defund the police in the US in 2020 were met with various responses from local, city, and state governments – for example, during

## Defund the Police

the course of 2020 the Mayor of New York promised a $1 billion reduction in the NYPD budget; in Minneapolis the City Council voted to disband the Police Department, and several Minneapolis schools rescinded contracts with the Minneapolis police; the LA city council approved a cut to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) budget of $150 million; Portland, Oregon shifted $4.8 million from the police to community safety initiatives. Many of these budgetary changes were later rescinded. Although the organisational structure and funding of the police in the US is dierent from many other countries – there are more than 17,000 local, state, federal, and specialist law enforcement agencies – the call to defund the police has raised important questions about the nature of policing, including whether police reform is possible, and perhaps more importantly, questions about our social priorities, the values we want to foreground, and the type of communities and society we aspire to create and live in. Despite the promise of funding cuts, in recent years police forces around the globe have seen record budget increases. In the UK the government announced in January 2020 the biggest increase in police funding in over a decade, as part of the commitment to increase police numbers by 20,000 ocers. In New South Wales (NSW), Australia, the state police force was awarded a record $4.4 billion budget for the 2018–2019 nancial year, including the recruitment of 1,500 new police recruits – the most substantial increase in 30 years. In Canada, more than $15 billion was spent on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in the 2017–2018 nancial year, a signicant increase over the previous year, and this ignores the cost of municipal/ city, provincial and other local police services. Meanwhile, some US cities and states – such as Philadelphia and Virginia – have seen a signicant budget growth to their police forces in recent years and in spite of the push towards divestment. In other parts of the US there has been conservative political leverage against reducing local police budgets: in January 2021, Texas Governor Greg Abbott threatened various nancial and other sanctions against any localities and cities in Texas that reduced their budgets for policing. And in New York City, despite the early promise of reduced funding, police budgets are again being increased after the mayoral election in June 2021.

## Time for change

Against this backdrop, social commentators and political activists have decried the decades of failed reform eorts and identied police violence as a public health and social justice issue. Manifestos have been written heralding the ‘end of policing’ and envisaging a ‘world without police’.2 While the appeal to defund the police appears disarmingly simple, it raises vital concerns covering a range of problems. What are the political, economic, and social reasons for divesting from police? And what does this look like in practice? What is the social and historical background to this movement locally and globally? And what does empirical research say about the merits of police reform and police divestment? These are all key questions explored in this book. One focus in the divestment discussion has been to contrast police budgets with investment in social, health, education, housing, and other programmes. Community activist organisations in, for example, New York and Los Angeles have challenged the priorities of city spending. In New York, for every $1 spent on the NYPD, 29 cents are spent on homeless services, 25 cents on the Department of Health, 19 cents on housing preservation and development, 12 cents on youth and community development, and 1 cent on workforce investment. Similar examples have been repeated elsewhere.3 However, simply cutting police budgets does not necessarily signal an end to policing. For example, as the eects of neoliberalism and austerity impacted in England and Wales following the global nancial crisis of 2007–2008, police numbers were cut by approximately 14 per cent over the next decade. However, the cuts to social services budgets were even greater, and police took on an expanded role despite the cuts. Indeed, the police use of force in England and Wales also grew signicantly during this period.4 It is important to acknowledge the point made by the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL).
      Defunding is not just about cutting city budgets
      across the board as an austerity measure in the midst
      of an economic crisis – it is about reinvesting money
      cut from police departments into community-based
      services that meet basic needs and advance safety
      without using methods of policing, surveillance,
      punishment, and coercion. It is also about investing

## Defund the Police

     in cultural life, arts, recreation, and the things that
     make and strengthen community and our dreams for
     our future.5
While the #DefundPolice hashtag emphasises the negative, the movement has always advocated to both divest from police and invest in ‘jobs, education, housing, health care – all the elements that are required for a productive and violence-free life’, according to leading abolitionist Ruth Wilson Gilmore.6 The movement is about presence, not absence. It is about building life-arming institutions; it is about creating the type of society that does not need to rely on force, violence, and mass incarceration.7 Not surprisingly, there has been some focus on the pragmatic approaches and solutions that can provide for community safety and replace the police as a state institution of repression. The M4BL has produced a toolkit for activists which outlines political processes and strategies aimed at defunding the police, as well as a range of policies and programmes that can be developed to replace the police. I return to these approaches during the course of the book. The contemporary movement to defund the police has been closely connected to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in the US since its establishment in 2013 after the acquittal of an armed neighbourhood watch captain for the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager in Florida. The demands of the BLM and Defund the Police movements have remained prominent in US demonstrations against police killings and deaths in custody since 2013, including, for example, in the deaths of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Sandra Brand, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd.8 However, the contemporary demand to defund the police has its roots in the civil rights period and the ongoing struggle since then against police violence, racism, and overpolicing. It has also been prominent among abolitionists for more than two decades, including in the work of Critical Resistance. A second motivation for writing this book is to explore the connection between policing, abolitionism, and the international movement against state repression. The bulk of the literature on defunding the police and abolition is US-based. However, the challenges to policing also has roots in the struggle to decolonise institutional frameworks of repression – among various poor,

marginalised, racialised, and oppressed peoples globally. It is closely connected to the broader abolitionist project which confronts the violence and oppression that are at the heart of how police, prison, and other carceral institutions operate, in both the wealthy liberal democracies of the north and poorer countries of the global south. In both the global north and south, profound class, gender, racial, dis/ablist, and other social divisions and inequalities replicate the targets of police and carceral institutions. Thus, while there is a tendency to see the global north/south divide in geographical terms, it is a relational space ultimately enforced by state institutions of repression. There is an international anticolonial dimension to the demands for defunding the police that links to the longer histories of imperialism, colonisation, slavery, and settler colonialism – from the development of the ‘modern’ police in the early 19th century, to the second half of the 20thcentury transfer of policing models, training, and hardware as a strategy of imperialism to exert inuence and control, to the contemporary role of policing in wielding the direct violence of the colonial state, whether as the Israeli state against Palestinians, or Latin American states against Indigenous peoples, or African states using colonial- style police forces for ruthless internal repression. At one level, strategies to defund the police are local and place- based; however, they also need to simultaneously understand the global intersections of state repression and maintain an internationalist vision. The demand to defund the police is also linked to decarceral strategies. Again, as the M4BL succinctly states, ‘And while
#DefundPolice focuses on law enforcement agencies, we are
also calling for defunding of jails, prisons, detention centers, immigration enforcement, sites of involuntary commitment and incarceration of disabled people. We are also calling for defunding the military-industrial complex’. It is a challenge to the punitive and carceral society which embeds a logic that sees state violence, repression, and forced connement as necessary, morally justied, and of benet for the protection of citizens. It is a logic that suggests the solution to social problems can always be found in more surveillance, more policing, more prisons, and other carceral institutions. Patrisse Cullors, a cofounder of BLM, recognises that ‘we live in

## Defund the Police

a police state, in which the police have become judge, jury and executioner. They’ve become the social worker … the mental health clinician … they’ve become anything and everything that has to do with everyday life’.9 Wherever we look, the targets of all this punitiveness remain depressingly familiar: the poor, the marginalised, racial, ethnic and religious minorities, Indigenous peoples, refugees, immigrants, and people with disabilities who ll the police lock-ups, courtrooms, prisons, and other carceral sites in countries around the world.
The global movement against police violence
This book nds its context within a global movement of protest against repressive and violent policing. When George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis in May 2020 it was a spark which ignited widespread protests in the US and internationally. Floyd’s cry for help, “I can’t breathe”, became a collective expression of suocation and rebellion. As Minneapolis police ocer Derek Chauvin knelt on the neck of a handcued, prostrate George Floyd until he died, for many people a belief in the ecacy of police training on procedural justice, implicit bias, use of force, and other reform initiatives died with him. The nakedness of police brutality was there for the world to see, and the international breadth of the protests sparked by the events in Minneapolis is important to emphasise. However, it is also imperative to understand how these global protests were founded in and strongly reected specic local concerns with police repression. These localised instances of institutionalised state violence are part of an international struggle. Protests against the police and security forces were local in their grievances but global in their targets of racism, inequality, state violence, and the absence of accountability. In that sense, the struggle against violent state repression which the police and security forces embody are intertwined across time and space. They are struggles for a range of specically contextual political, economic, and social freedoms. These are the broader underpinnings of the pragmatic demand to defund the police. During 2020, the global protest movement was impressive. In Africa, protest movements in support of BLM occurred, for example, in Kenya, South Africa, Senegal, Ghana, and Nigeria.

## Time for change

However, the protesters were not there only or even primarily in support of the American BLM movement, they were there to express their opposition and outrage at police brutality within these African nations. In South Africa the number of deaths in police custody and during police operations, as well as complaints of police torture, rape, and assaults have continued to grow.10 In Nairobi, Kenya, protesters drew attention to domestic police violence and extrajudicial killings, while in Lagos, Nigeria, protests against police violence continued throughout 2020, particularly against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) police who were responsible for multiple killings of citizens over recent years. Indeed, in late October 2020, army and police forces opened re on a peaceful demonstration protesting police brutality at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos. At least 12 people were killed and hundreds severely injured. A subsequent judicial inquiry described the event as a ‘massacre’ of ‘unarmed, helpless and defenseless protesters’.11 In addition, violent policing intensied in many African countries during the COVID-19 pandemic where police have enforced curfews in poor neighbourhoods with beatings, tear gas, and shootings – leading to dozens of deaths within the rst few weeks of lockdowns.12 The Nigerian National Human Rights Commission reported more people killed by police than COVID-19 in the rst few months of the lockdown. The police in Kenya ‘shot and beat people at markets or on the way home from work, even before the daily start of the curfew. Police also broke into homes and shops, extorted money from residents or looted food in locations across the country’.13 Emblematic of these killings in various African countries, at the beginning of the Kenyan curfew in March 2020, police shot and killed a 13-year-old boy, Yassin Moyo, while he was standing with his siblings on the third oor balcony of his family’s home. Two months later in Lagos, Nigerian police enforcing the curfew, shot and killed 17-year-old Tina Ezekwe while she waited at a bus shelter.14 Nigerian police were also accused of harassing and extorting health workers as they went about their work responding to the pandemic – the harassment was so extensive it resulted in a ‘sit-at-home’ strike called by the Nigeria Medical Association. The institutionalised corruption and extortion by police and security forces undermined the nationwide lockdown.15

## Defund the Police

In various parts of Asia, including India, Malaysia, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, demonstrators came out in protest after the death of George Floyd. Police violence and racism were dominant themes in these protests. Yet, like African nations, each country had its own history and contemporary experience of police brutality and the use of lethal violence. There was widespread recognition that racism and police violence within the US was not a localised problem, but one which resonated globally. In the Philippines, solidarity with BLM was shown while demonstrating against new restrictive anti-terror laws and the more than 27,000 deaths by police and vigilantes since the government’s war on drugs began in 2016. In Taiwan, a BLM solidarity protest was used to highlight the ongoing discrimination against Indigenous peoples of Taiwan who comprise about 3 per cent of the population. In Malaysia, attention was drawn to the longstanding problem of deaths in custody, including those arising from police violence. Ocial statistics reported 257 deaths in police custody between 2002 and 2016, although independent monitoring claims the gure is much higher. The ethnic Indian population is over-represented among these victims. Police violence and racism were also a focus in Indonesia, in particular, against Papuans who have struggled for the recognition of self-determination in the provinces of West Papua and Papua, which Indonesia annexed in the early 1960s. There are long-standing issues of racism, violence, and the use of imprisonment against Papuan students and activists. Amnesty International recently documented security forces using water cannons and beating peaceful Papuan protesters.16 Hong Kong had ongoing pro-democracy protests which saw violent police responses, including the indiscriminate use of chemical and other crowd control weapons and rearms, resulting in widespread injuries. Ocial inquiries exonerated police, despite thousands of complaints.17 Twelve months before the death of George Floyd, there were demands to disband the Hong Kong police. At later protests in solidarity with the BLM movement, Hong Kong police ocers were lmed mocking the “I can’t breathe” and other calls used by demonstrators. Opposition to political repression in both Hong Kong and Indonesia are key elements that intersect with protests against police violence.

## Time for change

India has a long history of police torturing and killing people in custody, and various human rights organisations including the Indian National Human Rights Commission have commented on the routine nature of police torture.18 As in other countries, lockdowns to counter the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated police brutality against the urban poor, the street vendors, and the tens of thousands of homeless migrant workers who attempted to return to their communities on foot, or by bicycle, rickshaw, bus or lorry – in what the Economic and Political Weekly described as a ‘sort of dogged civil disobedience’ undeterred by police lathis and driven by ‘no wages, no food, no savings, no money for rent, no faith [in] the administration … and great apprehension of disease and death’.19 As one writer put it, these were the ‘unnamed George Floyds of India … whose voices are easily suppressed’.20 In mid 2020, the deaths of a father and son, Jeyeraj and Benicks, in Tamil Nadu sparked a broader debate about police killings in India in the context of the BLM movement. The pair were taken into police custody for breaching COVID-19 restrictions on trading and held overnight. Both were tortured and died 2 days later. As is typical in these cases, initially no police were charged with criminal oences, but those thought to be responsible were transferred elsewhere. After mounting public pressure nationally over the deaths, nine police ocers were subsequently charged with murder and destruction of evidence.21 The death of George Floyd also coincided with protests across Latin America and the Caribbean, stretching from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, to Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. In Cuba a planned protest for late June 2020 against the police shooting of a young Black man was suppressed by the government. There is a long history of the struggle against police brutality, racism, and class oppression in Latin America. The sheer volume of police killings in the region meant there were ongoing protests against police violence in, for example, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil, which were independent of the George Floyd murder in the US. These included protests against the killing of a 14-yearold boy in Rio de Janeiro in May 2020 (where police killed on average ve people a day in 2019), and the police shooting in early June 2020 of a 16-year-old as he rode his motorcycle with a group of friends in Oaxaca State, one of the poorest areas of

## Defund the Police

Mexico. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has long been critical of policing in Mexico, including the incidence of torture, arbitrary arrest and detentions, and forced disappearances. 22 Protests against police violence have continued – in April 2021 women demanded justice for Victoria Salazar. Police were lmed killing Ms Salazar. Her neck was broken by a police ocer jamming her knee into Salazar’s neck. Racism and the targeting of Black and Indigenous people in Latin America has dominated the activism against police violence. In Brazil, for example, police kill nearly six times the number of people compared to the United States, and 75 per cent of the people killed are Black.23 Similar to the Philippines, much of the police violence in Brazil is related to the war on drugs, increased militarisation and indiscriminate state violence against poor and Black communities. Like the situation in South Asia and Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic increased poverty and inequality, impacted on social unrest and intensied police violence. In Columbia, dozens of people were killed in early 2021 as police and security forces red into crowds who protested the social and economic policies of the government. Columbian police are within the command of the Defence Ministry and there has been no appetite by government to curb state violence – to the point where escalating protests are targeting police violence, particularly by the riot police ESMAD, as a key focal point of resistance. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights criticised the Colombian security forces for using excessive, disproportionate, and sometimes lethal force, including the indiscriminate police use of rearms against protestors and bystanders. The use of gender-based and sexual violence against protestors by police has also been highlighted.24 Across the global north, the protest movement was equally extensive. In Canada, the death of George Floyd reignited the focus on Black and Indigenous people killed by police. There are no national statistics on race, ethnicity, and deaths in police ‘encounters’ in Canada, but various sources show that Black and First Nations peoples are especially over-represented. Canadian Broadcasting Commission (CBC) News created a database on people killed by police since 2000 and found that Black people in Toronto made up on average 8.3 per cent of the population,

## Time for change

but represented nearly 37 per cent of the victims. In Winnipeg, Indigenous people represented approximately 10 per cent of the population, but accounted for nearly two thirds of victims.25 The Globe and Mail reported that more than one-third of the people shot and killed by RCMP ocers between 2007 and 2017 were Indigenous.26 Similarly, in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand, there were demonstrations in support of the BLM movement. The protests were used to highlight the deaths in custody of First Nations people in both countries. It was noted in Aotearoa New Zealand that over the past decade, two-thirds of all victims of fatal police shootings have been Māori or Pasika.27 Attention in Australia was drawn to [then] more than 400 First Nations deaths in custody since the landmark report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991 and the fact that not one police or prison ocer has been convicted for any criminal oences relating to these deaths.28 In the UK and Europe, support for the movement also highlighted racism and policing in the context of existing racial and ethnic inequalities. In Paris and other French cities, protesters drew attention to police violence, deaths in custody, and racism against minorities.29 In the UK, protestors emphasised the fact that Black people were more likely to die in police custody than other groups and the subsequent lack of police accountability. British protesters carried placards with the names of those who had died in UK police custody, prison or at the borders.30 In Germany, tens of thousands of protestors marched in cities such as Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg. Like other European protests, these were not simply supporting the movement in the US. Protestors drew attention to police racism and violence within Germany, the lack of police accountability, and in particular, the deaths of refugees and asylum seekers while in police custody.31 In other parts of Europe, it was noted that Roma were brutalised by police but were no nearer ‘their Black Lives Matter moment’ in terms of public outcry.32

Global protests were sparked by the events in the US, but they were also part of ongoing protest movements within many countries.

## Defund the Police

In Africa there had been more than 100 popular uprisings led by young people against corruption, violence, and austerity measures between 2005 and 2015.33 In Australia, First Nations-led protests against Aboriginal deaths in police and prison custody have been a feature of the political landscape for decades. Many of the global protest movements are built on multiple demands from opposition to austerity measures and the ravages of neoliberal capitalism, to demands for racial justice and Indigenous sovereignty. In African nations like South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria, state ocials were held to be hypocritical for comments condemning the death of George Floyd, while consistently ignoring the hundreds of police killings in their own countries over recent years.34 The same hypocrisy was noted by activists in India where egregious killings by police typically attracted far less outrage than a single death in the US.35 Similarly, in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand, First Nations activists drew attention to the apparent lack of popular (non-Indigenous) mobilisation against local Black deaths in custody prior to the events in the US. There were common themes which united these global outpourings of protest against state violence. The sheer scale of the violence by police against poor, marginalised, Indigenous, and racialised communities is almost incomprehensible, while at the same time the lack of any eective accountability for police violence is legend. One common denominator is that police violence and abuse remain largely unpunished. From the US to Australia, from Brazil to India and Nigeria, the story is repeated: police can kill with apparent impunity. Another set of commonalities is that for many countries in the global north and south, the histories of colonialism, slavery, racism, and dispossession are fundamental to understanding both the targets of policing and police violence, as well as the way that police are organised as a state institution of repression. For example, in Brazil, despite appeals to being a racial democracy there is a long history of racism in the country. It was the last among western countries to abolish slavery in 1888 and had been the largest importer of slaves from Africa, with an estimated ten times more slaves arriving in Brazil than North America.36 Racial inequality is entrenched, and as noted previously, the vast majority of people killed by police in Brazil are Black. In many Latin American

countries, Indigenous peoples also feature prominently among the victims of police violence. An important part of the critique of policing emerging from the protests has been the call to decolonise policing institutions. In African nations, police were established as repressive arms of colonial powers to conquer, repress, and dominate the population, and have never been there to protect citizens or respect human rights. The widespread use of police violence during the COVID19 pandemic lockdowns reinforced the view that governments had failed to reform the structures of colonial policing.37 In Australia and Canada, policing and the criminal law have been instrumental in the colonial dispossession and repression of Indigenous peoples – and First Nations people today are more likely than others to be killed by police.38 In Israel, the police are at the vanguard of attacking Palestinians and protecting vigilante groups driving Palestinian people from their homes in neighbourhoods like Sheik Jarrah. Globally, police and security forces are at the forefront of contemporary settler colonialism.39 In India, the basic structure of the criminal law dates from the time of British colonialism. In May 2020, the Indian Home Ministry established the Committee for Reforms in Criminal Law to update the law and remove its colonial foundations: what was to be ostensibly an exercise in decolonising the criminal law. Yet the Committee did not include any women, Dalit (‘untouchable’ or ‘lower’ caste) or Adivasi (tribal and Indigenous) peoples, religious minorities, people from Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual (LGBTQIA+) communities, people with disabilities, nor representatives from the south, east, or northeast of India. In other words, as one activist organisation demanding the disbandment of the committee noted, ‘No committee member belongs to a group that is under-served and over-policed by the criminal justice system’.40 Through various mechanisms any democratic participation in the process of reform was stymied. More recently, in southeast Asia, opposition to the military coup in Myanmar have been met by widespread lethal police violence causing hundreds of deaths; while protesters for democratic reform in Thailand have been met by the use of water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets.41 This is the global landscape in which the

## Defund the Police

plea to defund the police resonates. It stands in stark contrast to the notion of the police as a fundamentally democratic institution – established to serve ‘the public’, to promote community safety, and to enforce the law for the people – a view which continues to dominate narratives about policing. It is obvious from the international record that racism and the targeting of Indigenous, Black, Brown, and minoritised communities is ubiquitous. Further, for many communities globally, challenges to police power are synonymous with an anti-colonialist position against political repression, the failure to ensure community safety, and the state violence inherent to various ‘wars’ on drugs, terror, and insurgency. Thus, the diverse calls to defund the police, or to abolish the police and carceral institutions, are integral to demands for decolonisation, the eradication of racism, and the development of societies that are built on economic, political, and social justice.
A controversial idea?
Perhaps only a few years ago, the idea of defunding the police and abolition might have been unthinkable – let alone that there might be a broad political movement with practical initiatives to achieve the outcome. However, now is an historic moment characterised by rapidly changing parameters of what are considered contentious and acceptable ideas in relation to policing. The concept of abolition in relation to the police was seen as unacceptable and ‘fanciful’ by many policing scholars where the focus has been on various aspects of police reform. The breadth and depth of social movements focused on police violence, Defund the Police, and BLM have challenged the political and intellectual comfort zones of many academics and policy makers working in the area of policing. While liberal reformers might continue with various programmes to reform the police, the abolitionist project challenges the very foundations of the institution of police.42 The challenge has been accepted by many from public health associations to radical social workers who have in common a ‘life-arming’ approach to supporting the ‘health, self-determination and sustainability of all communities’.43 For many people, the thought of defunding the police may seem at best abstract and unrealistic; that we lack alternatives, specic

solutions, or policy recommendations; that it is an unachievable utopian vision of the world.44 Much of this book addresses and responds to these arguments in the various chapters that follow. The goal of defunding the police might be controversial, but it is denitely not new. The institution of policing has been contested since its earliest days. As Chapter 2 demonstrates, there have been debates over the development and role of police dating back to the end of the 18th century in England. Despite mythical origin stories of the democratic foundations of policing, this book focuses on a counter-narrative of police – as military forces of occupation ensuring colonial expansion and control, in maintaining slavery, in safeguarding ruthless economic exploitation in the colonies of Africa, the Americas, and Asia, and their role in the expropriation and genocide of First Nations peoples – the police were fundamental in establishing the foundations of colonial capitalist societies. Police continued in the forefront in subsequent periods of institutionalised violence, racial discrimination, and apartheid. Further, a foundational element of modern police forces was the control of the emerging working class, their radical activists and trade unions in the industrial cities of the global north, and as colonialism developed within the global south. A core argument of the book is established in Chapter 2: a central role of police was not responding to crime, but rather maintaining an unequal and exploitative social, economic, and political order. What we see today are the outcomes of these historical origins, which have been extended and exacerbated through further renements, including ongoing militarisation and ideologies of risk, zero tolerance, evidence-led policing, and so on. Community protection is one of the rationales used in arguing the necessity for police: What would we do without them? Who would protect us? Answers to these questions are provided in various chapters throughout the book. Chapter 3 considers the limited role police play in solving crime and the relatively low rates of the public reporting of crime. It reects on the role of police discretion in reproducing particular social boundaries, using as two examples the use of police discretion to criminalise Black, Brown, and Indigenous young people, while conversely exploring the role of police discretion in not investigating and prosecuting the murders of LGBTQIA+ people. Chapter 4 steps

## Defund the Police

back to consider the role of resistance and oppositional movements to the police from the 1960s through to the current period, especially the role of Black, Indigenous, and people of colour in the US, Australia, and Britain in the struggle against repressive state violence. It concludes with a discussion of the advent of zero tolerance policing and its impact on racial violence. In countering the argument that police provide community protection, the book considers the situations where citizens are killed by police. As documented in Chapter 5, so many of these deaths occur after the most minor oence has been detected or there is no oence at all. I consider what we know about police killings through a number of examples in the global north (particularly, the US, England and Wales, Australia, and Canada) and in the global south (Brazil, Philippines, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) to draw out commonalities and dierences in the experiences of police terror and violence. Chapter 6 addresses the problem of violence against women and argues that police are not the solution to violence. There has been considerable discussion of the violent nature of policing and its failure to properly investigate and respond to gendered and racialised violence. Indeed, many of the political organisers, activists, and intellectuals that have addressed problems of policing and advocated for abolitionism and divesting from police have been Black, Indigenous, and women of colour. The current Defund the Police and abolitionist movements would not exist without them, and some – like Marielle Franko in Brazil – have paid for their activist opposition to police violence, militarism, and racism with their lives. The chapter draws on international and country-specic evidence to illustrate the failure of police to protect women from violence. Chapter 7 begins from the point that policing has played a central role in dening and controlling disability – police and carceral violence are core to the disabling processes of the state. The chapter recognises that disability activists internationally have provided a compelling voice to the arguments for defunding the police, particularly because people with mental ill-health and cognitive impairments have borne such a heavy toll among those injured, maimed, and killed in police encounters – and often in situations where families have requested positive assistance for their loved one.

## Time for change

As shown in Chapter 8, an integral part of the argument for defunding and abolition of police is the consistent failure of police reform – despite decades of inquiries and reform measures in various countries. Minneapolis, for example, was the site of a major US federal initiative over a number of years prior to George Floyd’s murder, designed to improve policing and address distrust between the police and minority and Black communities.45 Yet we still see the same recommendations for better training, coordination, and so forth. The New York Times reviewed more than a dozen evaluations of police responses to protesters after the death of George Floyd. The reports generally blamed poor training, militarisation and lack of preparedness which led to escalations of violence. Yet as the review noted, between 1967 and 1976 there were three federal commissions into protests and riots which reached similar conclusions, while yet another presidential commission after the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and the subsequent protests in 2015 found that police militarisation exacerbated the situation.46 The failure of reform adds weight to the argument for shifting funds from police into community sector development. The organisational structure of policing varies across dierent countries, however the failure of reform and accountability mechanisms in many countries adds a common international resonance to the political call to defund the police. Defund the Police immediately speaks to a consideration of other approaches to providing community safety and support. Not surprisingly there are many dierent avenues for thinking through a revisioning or reimagining of life without the institutional structures of violence, repression, and imprisonment. Chapter 9 draws on both a range of practical examples, as well as these broader notions of what life without police might become. Practical projects include community safety and community defence initiatives, social reinvestment, and Indigenous and other forms of community governance. However, the chapter also identies the need for reimagining new possibilities. The BLM and Defund the Police movements are linked back to the broader arguments for carceral abolitionism and decolonialism. Patrisse Cullors, for example, argues for ‘new visions, new imaginings of public safety’ and draws on the work of long-time abolitionists

## Defund the Police

such as Angela Y. Davis who contends that decarceration and abolitionism are not simply about changing the criminal legal system.47 Davis’s comments on prison also apply to police: the rst step is ‘to let go of the desire to discover one single alternative system of punishment that would occupy the same footprint as the prison system’.48 Eective abolitionist strategies would challenge not simply the institution of the police, but the range of relationships that make up the criminal legal system as we know it, as well as other forms of carcerality that, for example, impact on people with disability. There is also a need to bring together abolitionism with the work of decolonial theorists. For example, Mignolo has called upon us to think through ‘the many and rich possibilities of governance’ that are open to the people outside of the current state which has been forged through the processes of colonialism.49
Defunding the police in the context of the carceral state
Much has been written about the long- term increases in imprisonment internationally, the rise of hyper-incarceration and what has come to be known as the carceral or prison state. Considerable attention has been placed on more punitive penal policies: the more frequent use and longer periods of imprisonment, the increasing use of pre-trial detention, and so on.50 In reecting on the growth in US imprisonment, Jonathan Simon argued that criminalisation and imprisonment are used as a tool of social policy – a process of ‘governing through crime’. Punishment and imprisonment are targeted at those dened as high risk, dangerous, and marginalised, which in practice translates into the targeting of people dened by their race, gender, ableism, class, and their intersections. Furthermore, governing through crime has increased modes of surveillance into a range of state and private institutions including schools, hospitals, workplaces, shopping malls, transport systems, and other public and private spaces. These changes have brought about a transformation in the civil and political order, including scal and administrative structures, which are increasingly structured around ‘the problem of crime’, despite crime rates generally falling in many countries over the past several decades.51

## Time for change

A central and perhaps until recently neglected player in this reorientation is the police. Although other functionaries both within and outside the legal system are involved in this criminal/ risk surveillance (including prosecutors, judges, correctional ocers, social workers, teachers, and health workers), it is the police who are the frontline troops of this governance structure. They are the presence which makes this political process possible. Thinking about these broader considerations enables us to see why the appeal to defund the police embodies such a challenge – this is not just about bloated police budgets and unaccountable state violence, it is a challenge to the deeper social and political priorities which have underscored penal policy. A further barrier to progressive change and a pressing reason for its necessity is identied by Bernard Harcourt and Stuart Schrader. Both argue that the hyper-militarised police forces that have taken to the streets of the US in the wake of the protests after the police killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson and more recently George Floyd in Minneapolis are the outcome of ‘a new model of government inspired by the theory and practice of counterinsurgency warfare’.52 This type of policing is not a brief aberration from the rule of law to respond to exceptional circumstances. Rather, it is indicative of an historical and political transformation based on counterinsurgency strategies. These changes have been occurring for decades, rst with US military operations in Vietnam and then to Iraq and Afghanistan, and domestically since 9/11 and accelerating during the Trump administration. This change, however, is by no means conned to the US. We can see the same tendencies outside the US – from the policing of favelas in Sao Paulo to the policing of protests in London and Sydney. Thus, the call to defund the police implies confronting and opposing a much larger set of historical processes that are serving to cement the police as a type of domestic military force engaged in a constant process of pacication. This book argues that what links the vision of Defund the Police with the broader considerations of abolitionism and decolonialism is the demand for reimagining possibilities beyond contemporary state formations and institutions which have produced systems of violence and oppression. Or as Angela Y. Davis has stated, ‘alternatives that fail to address racism, male dominance,

## Defund the Police

homophobia, class bias and other structures of domination will not, in the nal analysis, lead to decarceration and will not advance the goal of abolition’.53 There is a simplicity to the concept of defund the police. As several commentators have stated, defund the police means defund the police. It is a plain language political demand without limits or conditions. Saima Desai indicated in an editorial note in briarpatch,
     It doesn’t mean buying body cameras or any other
     new technology. It doesn’t mean hiring more cops for
     diversity and inclusion units. It doesn’t mean banning
     choke-holds. It doesn’t mean using tasers instead of
     guns. It doesn’t mean ‘community policing’ that installs
     more cops in poor and racialized communities. … It
     means take the money away from the police. Take the
     guns and tanks and helicopters away from them. Take
     away their role as our catch-all hotline for responding
     to people in crisis. … Give the money to life arming
     Black- and Indigenous-led community projects.54
As Mariame Kaba has argued, attempts at liberal reforms have failed for nearly a century. The police cannot be reformed and more of the same type of reforms will not alter the current situation. Police as an institution needs to be made obsolete. However, it is recognised that not all who support a movement to defund the police are also abolitionists. Again, as Kaba notes, irrespective of whether you are an abolitionist or not, ‘here’s an immediate demand we can all make: cut the number of police in half and cut their budget in half. Fewer police ocers equal fewer opportunities for them to brutalize and kill people’.55 The invitation to defund the police provides a strategic opportunity to build alliances across a range of social groups who understand through their own experience that police do not make us safer.
             A brief history of policing
We live within institutional arrangements which inuence our ways of thinking and responding to the world around us. Those institutions often seem part of the natural order of things – necessary and immovable, dening particular social artefacts as problems and predening the range of possible responses, reforms, and solutions. The institution of policing is no exception, and its historical weight carries us along well-trodden paths. Instrumental arguments by policymakers, politicians, and police administrators reconrm the necessity of the police to control crime and to uphold the law, even as a wealth of evidence throws into question the basic claims of these assertions. Indeed, the problems of police violence, ineectiveness and corruption are as old as the institution of policing itself. And there is a sense of déjà vu every time another ocial inquiry reports on some particularly egregious atrocity that has risen above the normal levels of police violence and mismanagement. The script is time-honoured – it usually begins with the need for upgraded training and improved accountability, followed by more resources, and perhaps something on the requirement for better community engagement and strategies to rally social legitimacy. What is often ignored is the recognition of policing as a sociohistorical process that maintains itself for reasons other than controlling crime. One is reminded of Foucault’s discussion of the failure of the prison in Discipline and Punish. This failure is recognised in the early 1820s and is constantly re-articulated to the present day – including its failure to rehabilitate and to reduce crime. Yet the institution appears resistant to change

## Defund the Police

and continually re-invents itself to the point where, 200 years later, we are talking about the problem of hyper-incarceration. Foucault poses the questions: What does the prison produce? What interests are served by the prison? I want to shift those questions back to the police. What does the history of policing tell us about the control and maintenance of social divisions including class, race, gender, disability, and their intersections; or about the economic exploitation of labour and political control? What does it tell us of the use of power, both at the local level and more broadly through macro socio-historical movements of colonialism and imperialism? And nally, why is an understanding of this history so important to contemporary calls to defund the police?

## The New Police

There is no single history of policing, but there is a myth of origin which tells us a great deal about the need to establish political hegemony, institutional legitimacy, and social consent. The British version emerges as follows: Sir Robert Peel’s London Metropolitan Police were established in 1829 to control crime in the rapidly urbanised city and to maintain social order. The new police were a centrally organised, coordinated, and disciplined force drawing their authority from the people.1 Or so the story goes. There are alternative interpretations, including the role of the new police in controlling an emergent working class across a range of terrains, from industrial disputes and political protest to regulating new notions of public respectability and social order. Opposition to the new police was prominent from a variety of sectors, including those who saw the police as an attack on the ‘traditional liberties’ of the English, and working-class radicals fearful of repression. Indeed, an early call for police abolition was a handbill printed in London in 1830, entitled ‘The New Police’, which exhorted others ‘to join your Brother Londoners in one heart, one hand, for the Abolition of the New Police!’.2 Police forces based on the Peel model were introduced in the US, with Boston in 1838, New York in 1845 and other major cities over the following years. Like the situation in Britain, these new urban police forces were focused on policing the organised labour

movement, particularly strikes, and enforcing new regulatory regimes among the working-class.3 Aside from the Peel police, there were other moves in London towards organised, centrally funded, and prevention focused policing with the establishment of the Thames River Police, with the support of private merchants and manufacturers. As Porter documents, the Thames River Police was important for directly linking the development of policing within the metropolitan centre to the processes of colonialism in the periphery.4 The Thames River Police patrolled the Port of London. They were initially funded by the West India Committee – a lobby group of English plantation owners in the sugar, rum, cotton, and other industries in the Caribbean who sought to guard their slaveryproduced prots. The development of the state police in London owes as much to protecting the economic and political interests of the wealthy plantation owners as it did to Peel’s reforms. Further, the development of policing was never simply divided between the metropolitan centre and the colonial periphery – in this case, London and the Caribbean – they were always deeply intertwined in maintaining the stability and protability of the colonial order. The establishment of institutional policing in Europe followed a somewhat dierent path to Britain. The French and Spanish monarchies had founded military police units to control demobilised soldiers and the military with functions that eventually extended into patrolling highways and rural areas. These military police units evolved into the Gendarmerie Nationale and the Guardia Civil. The development of civil police functions grew from the establishment of the oce of lieutenant général de police in Paris in 1667. From the 1700s the policing function expanded as a ‘form of social control which was formal, institutional, and preventative’,5 and predated the Peel Police. After the French Revolution, the Paris model, along with the gendarmerie, was adopted across the country, and under Napoleon, more widely instituted across Europe. The 19th-century expansion of policing went hand in hand with the rise of state institutions in various areas of social life including education, public health, and social welfare. Police were expected to enforce and maintain a developing notion of social order determined by the state. During the second half of

## Defund the Police

the 19th century and early 20th century, there was a substantial expansion in police and the processes of criminalisation, alongside new regulatory regimes and institutional settings. Developments in the policing of children and families provide insight into these changes. The social construction of juvenile delinquency,6 and the creation of various institutions including juvenile courts, juvenile industrial schools and reformatories, and a raft of civil and criminal legislation, highlighted the changing historical context of policing. Some of the changes were welfare oriented such as restrictions on child labour, the introduction of compulsory schooling, processes for responding to neglected children, and modied court systems. Others were aimed at controlling public behaviour, popular culture, and leisure activities through a broad range of criminal oences and regulatory requirements covering such issues as ‘wandering about’, vagrancy, begging and loitering, gambling, drunkenness, malicious mischief, public bathing, dangerous play, animal sports, and discharging reworks.7 Police powers were expansive – going well beyond the policing of what we might consider substantive criminal oences to include the policing of truancy, homelessness, and poverty, and of status oences such as engaging in immoral or depraved behaviour, or being uncontrollable. These police interventions were also gendered in their application with women and girls policed because of their sexuality, and often receiving prolonged institutionalisation, despite being victims of crimes such as rape and incest.8 The concerns with industrialisation and a rapidly growing urban population were also apparent, and much of the criminalising and regulatory interventions were aimed at workingclass children and families. In colonial settings, there was also a strong dierential in the treatment of Black, First Nations and other racialised families – which is considered in more detail later. The policing of working-class families directs attention to the expanded monitoring responsibilities of police as ‘moral guardians’ and welfare agents. The development of police in regulating families sits alongside other expanded activities, such as the policing of public health/hygiene through Contagious Diseases legislation from the later part of the 19th century, and their role in the policing of mental illness. For instance, in the colony and then State of NSW throughout the 19th and early 20th

## A brief history of policing

centuries, most people incarcerated in ‘lunatic’ asylums were there because of police intervention. Indeed, in 1878 police powers to detain ‘suspected lunatics’ were expanded to include people who were considered neglected, ill-treated, found wandering, or were without means of support.9 The policing of both public health and mental illness continues to raise questions of the expansive role of policing today, as it did in the past. There was also continuing resistance within working- class communities to the encroachment of police into people’s daily lives, with the prevalence of anti-police riots, protests, assaults on ocers, and other forms of day-to-day resistance. Some UK historians have traced the lineage of anti-police activism, protests, and riots from the 19th century to the late 20th century – such as the line drawn from anti-police riots in Liverpool in the 1800s to the Toxteth uprising in Liverpool in 1981,10 while others have considered the various periods of rising and falling police legitimacy.11 Public support was always contingent on police behaviour, and the specic nature of police work. The policing of strikes, labour disputes, and political protest were areas historically where policing was heavily contested,12 but it was also contested in the localised management of public space where the police role was much broader than responding to crime.13

## Policing in colonial settings

If the Thames River Police brought to the fore the connection between the metropolitan centre and the regional sites of colonial exploitation, these interconnections were equally evident in the developments of the colonial model of policing in Ireland – a militaristic system organised around the use of armed force to govern in the interests of colonial power. The Irish model was exported, inuenced, and/or was adapted to the specic conditions in other colonies across the British Empire during the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries in countries as diverse as Egypt, Fiji, Kenya, Canada, Ghana, Nigeria, India, Palestine, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Barbados, and Australia.14 Local political considerations, the nature of resistance, resources, and other factors determined how the colonial mode was adapted and in some colonies including in Australia, South

## Defund the Police

Africa, and Canada, both civil and colonial modes of policing were utilised – dierentiated between cities and the colonial hinterland or frontier.15 Somewhat in contrast to the experience of the British Empire, French colonial policing was not centralised or as relatively standardised across the French empire. There was no equivalent of the British Colonial Police Service,16 nor was any formal colonial police employment scheme deployed throughout the French colonies. However, the police, gendarmes and the military played a key role in maintaining the French Empire, despite the fact that colonial police forces tended to be understaed and underfunded.17 Colonial models of policing were attractive for various reasons: they generally operated with European officers in charge and local people as the lower ranks. However, it was the valorisation of force and violence that was the most obvious attraction. The exercise of colonial power did not involve the consent of the colonised. The racist ideologies underpinning imperialism and the motive of ruthless economic exploitation meant that the idea of political legitimacy and popular consent was largely irrelevant. The aims of policing were to ensure colonial eciency, stability, and protability for European capitalists. As Justice Tankebe states, ‘to speak of colonial policing and “policing by consent” – and for that matter legitimacy – is therefore a contradiction in terms; it is oxymoronic’.18 It was not only the military style uniforms and ranks of the commanding European ocers, but more importantly the use of military weaponry and training aimed at the control of colonised peoples’ resistance that was fundamental to the colonial model of policing – the ability when required to violently quell social and political resistance to colonial rule. Although the idea of bringing the superior European rule of law to inferior races had been used as a justication for colonialism, in fact arbitrariness, violence, and impunity were prevalent. In discussing policing in Ghana, Killingray demonstrates that there were no legal and disciplinary procedures that controlled the police exercise of power or administered any sanctions for police abuses. The police were ‘hated as unaccountable representatives of an alien colonial power imposing a range of new laws and measures of social control which lacked any semblance of popular consent’.19 Frantz Fanon

## A brief history of policing

eloquently conrms that the colonial world was a world cut in two: ‘The dividing line, the frontiers are shown by barracks and police stations. In the colonies it is the policeman and the soldier who are the ocial, instituted go-betweens, the spokesmen of the settler and his rule of oppression.’20 Irrespective of whether repressive police violence within colonial settings represented a strong colonial state exerting power, or the resort to violence was emblematic of inecient policing and a weak colonial state, police violence was a hallmark of colonial control.21 For example, unrestrained use of violence was apparent during both the height of French colonialism and during the period of decolonisation. French colonial police forces ‘were never known to put a strong emphasis on disciplining and educating their personnel’ and the ‘French empire was marked by the permanence of this logic consisting of slaughtering protesting crowds of colonised people’.22 Blanchard outlines the magnitude and frequency of these police killings during the period leading to decolonisation. Rather than working towards a transition of power, the police forces became more violent. In Algeria, for example, police units were involved ‘in the massive use of torture during the war of independence’.23 The dierential use of violence against the colonised also inected policing within the metropole. Although police in Paris had stopped using rearms to disperse protestors from the 1930s, the colonised were treated dierently with police shooting and killing Algerian demonstrators in Paris in the 1950s and early 1960s. It was the ‘racial-political condition of the colonised that determined both the nature and degree of the policing techniques employed’ rather than, for example, whether the protestors were peaceful or not.24 Although police violence was foundational to the colonial project, the police played other important roles. They were often the key representative of the colonial administration in many areas of the colony and were the agents of colonial rule, for example in parts of Sudan, the Gold Coast, and India, as well as in signicant parts of the settler colonies such as the northern frontier in Australia and the Yukon in Canada. Police were the administrative edge of colonial power and were expected to full a range of regulatory and other tasks from veterinary inspections to issuing licences, from delivering mail to determining welfare, as

## Defund the Police

well as reporting on the state of crops, the condition of roads, and so forth.25 Police were also involved in the political surveillance of anti-colonialist and nationalist activism – both within the colonies and the metropolitan centres.26 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, colonial police forces were at the forefront of anthropometric and identication techniques. In French Indochina, for example, thousands of identication records with ngerprints of native and foreign Asian people were collected – and the identication process was imported back into metropolitan France for foreigners and French nationals of colonial origin. In Ghana, a type of criminal proling was developed through the use of detailed descriptions and photography.27 In the USoccupied Philippines, the police utilised new communication technologies, nger printing and transportation methods. Indeed, the American police reformer August Volmer based his ideas on police science from his experiences in the Philippines: ‘Ever since Spanish-American War days, I’ve studied military tactics and used them to good eect in rounding up crooks. After all we’re conducting a war.’28 Thus policing in the colonies acted as ‘veritable laboratories of modernity’.29 From the 19th century the colonial model of policing spread throughout the British Empire through ‘the export of training and military ethos’ as well as the movement of police and advisors who brought with them ideas about policies, procedures, and so forth.30 The inuence of this model remained well into the 20th century, and continued beyond the period of decolonisation – to be found, for instance, in police training manuals in the 1950s.31 In India at the time of Independence in 1947, Congress shelved indenitely the planned overhaul of the British Indian police, and in Malaysia, the post-independence Royal Malaysia Police replicated ‘many of the features, functions and failings of the colonial force’.32 In the former French colonies, continuities in policing models remained. The most ‘striking and symbolic legacy’ were the national gendarmeries where the decolonisation period acted as a ‘second age’ for the spread of the gendarmerie model across the Ivory Coast, Mali, Tunisia, Algeria, Syria, and Lebanon, and where these post-independence police forces have, at various times, played their own part in the repression of civilian populations.33

## A brief history of policing

Colonial models of policing continued to influence the metropolitan centres. For example, the Chief Police Constables of England and Wales were provided with the details of riot control methods used by the Royal Hong Kong Police.34 The United States’ engagement in colonial war also impacted on the development of policing within the US. The occupation of the Philippines and the establishment of the Philippine Constabulary inuenced the development of the Pennsylvania State Police. The Philippine police had been established to control the anticolonialist movement and its adaptation by Pennsylvania was no accident – coal owners and the state had been in signicant conict with the union movement over the previous decade. The new state police were a paramilitary force that showed little interest in controlling crime, and instead operated as strikebreakers.35

## Settler colonialism and policing First Nations

Western liberal democratic states dene their criminal legal systems as neutral, fair, and universal. Equality before the law and equal protection of the law are regarded as the dening features of the rule of law – which police are said to uphold. However, the policing of First Nations peoples within the developing liberal democracies that were and are simultaneously settler colonial states highlights the violence, genocide and racist regimes – that is the illiberalism – that is at the core of these states. There was a substantial ‘gap’ in universality and equality when it came to policing in the emerging White settler states of the US, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The rule of law was suspended and became a rule of exception in relation to the policing of Indigenous peoples.36 Indigenous peoples, even where they were ostensibly equal subjects, often fell outside of the protection of the law. Police involvement in the war against Indigenous people was in some cases genocide. For example, in the Australian context the campaigns undertaken by the Native Police (led by White military ocers) against Indigenous nations in Queensland during the second half of the 19th century were genocidal – they were clearly undertaken with the intention of physically destroying a whole group of people. On the other side of the continent, in July 1895, Western Australian

## Defund the Police

senior state ocials noted that: ‘There can be no doubt from these frequent [police] reports that a war of extermination in eect is being waged against these unfortunate blacks in the Kimberley district.’37 The Native Police and Mounted Police in Australia conducted the work of an occupying military force. Murderous patrols led by police and ‘special constables’ still occurred in northern Australia in the 1920s.38 In Canada, the forerunner of the RCMP was the North West Mounted Police (NWMP) which was required to expand and protect the territorial boundaries of the colony, suppress Indigenous resistance, and criminalise Indigenous social and cultural practices. Former military ocers were employed in the NWMP.39 In various colonial towns in the US, ‘Indian constables’ were appointed to protect settlers from First Nations peoples in the 18th century. Similar to the Mounted Police of Australia and Canada, in the US, the Texas Rangers protected the interests of White colonisers against First Nations, Mexican, and Spanish peoples. As Vitale noted, they acted rst as a type of mercenary force before coming under the authority of the republic and then state of Texas. The Rangers were involved in campaigns of genocide against First Nations people.40 As settler colonialism expanded its control over Indigenous lands, open warfare was replaced by extensive government controls. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, settler colonial governments in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand instituted policies and practices to ‘civilise’ and assimilate Indigenous peoples through the establishment of reservations, forced removal of children and their incarceration in residential schools, the banning of language, cultural and spiritual practices, and the imposition of an alien justice system.41 Although legislation and policy was couched in the language of protection, the model was based on the institutions of the criminal legal system, through the use of police, civil ‘protectors’ or Indian agents exercising a range of administrative, policing, and judicial functions. Policing, criminalisation, and punishment were central to the colonial state’s governance of Indigenous peoples. In Canada, the Indian Act 1876, and subsequent legislation, shaped various educational, social, and economic policies designed to extinguish Indigenous rights and assimilate Indigenous people. The government made and enforced regulations ‘with regard to

## A brief history of policing

the full spectrum of public and private life in communities’.42 The Indian Act was deeply gendered: a woman’s Indian status was tied to her husband. Non-Indigenous concepts of marriage and parenting were to prevail, with penalties imposed for non-compliance. Indigenous movement was restricted, and participation in cultural ceremonies could be declared as criminal behaviour. Department of Indian Aairs (DIA) agents were given the same powers as magistrates. Their jurisdiction was expanded beyond the Indian Act to include certain sexual oences, prostitution, and vagrancy when committed by Indigenous people. DIA agents could lodge a complaint with the police, they could direct that a prosecution be conducted and then sit in judgment of it.43 In Australia, protectors and superintendents (often police or ex- police ocers) extensively regulated Indigenous peoples’ lives: deciding whether children would be removed to an institution, their rations, who they could marry, where they could work and for what salary, access to savings, which areas were prohibited, and where the person would reside.44 Reserve and mission superintendents administered their own policing, judicial and penal regimes outside, and parallel to, existing formal criminal legal systems. In the US, the Bureau of Indian Aairs (BIA) engaged in similar policing and suppression of Indigenous behaviour that might prevent assimilation. Cultural activities such as feasts and dances, as well as various religious practices, were dened as Indian Oenses.45 Colonial regulation had the effect of entrenching and normalising surveillance by police and others exercising police and penal powers over First Nations peoples. Criminalisation, punishment, and carceral institutions (jails, boarding schools, missions, and reservations were all prisons46) became deeply woven into the fabric of the settler colonial state. Racialised discourses validated violent and lethal punishments. As the spectacle of physical and public punishments began to disappear for Europeans in the later part of the 19th century, the same did not hold for Indigenous peoples. For example, legislation which banned public executions in Western Australia in 1871 was amended to allow exceptions for Aboriginal people. Public execution was recast as a form of tutelage to broadcast a ‘lesson’ to tribal groups, as a perverse part of the civilising process. The extended use of

## Defund the Police

physical punishments and restraints (lashings, oggings, chaining) continued for Aboriginal people until well into the 20th century.47 Similarly, in Canada, the penitentiary was seen as unsuitable for Indigenous peoples, who were subject instead to local jails and corporal punishment.48 There is not the space here to document First Nations’ resistance to colonialism and the corresponding violence of the colonial state in the US, Canada, Australia, or Aotearoa New Zealand. However, as noted previously, the colonial response to resistance was often genocidal. The introduction of reservations and missions changed the nature of Indigenous resistance, but it did not stop. The elaborate legal frameworks for assimilation had the potential to criminalise virtually any Indigenous activity and installed extensive systems of state surveillance. Many First Nations peoples see current policing as central to the ongoing task of colonial rule.

## Policing from slavery to Jim Crow

The history of policing African Americans in the US through slavery, the Black Codes, and later Jim Crow is a story of profound violence and repression. Starting from the 1700s southern colonies began to organise slave patrols, beginning with South Carolina in 1704. These were among the rst police forces in the US. Their role was to exercise control over enslaved people, prevent rebellion and escape, and to use physical violence to maintain their domination. In some southern US cities, the slave patrols formed the basis of early professionalised police forces.49 The slave patrols enforced slave laws and were there ‘to enforce a social order based on the theft of Black life and labor’.50 The slave codes had originated in the British colony of Barbados and dened slaves as the property of their owner (hence, chattel slavery). The codes controlled the activities and movements of slaves – whose body belonged to the slaveowner. Under most slave codes the rape of a Black woman was not a crime, and sexual abuse was systemic. Most ‘law enforcement’ occurred on the plantations by slaveowners and was marked by extreme brutality – from castration and mutilation to immolation. The same brutality was to carry over into the ‘right’ of Whites to police, control, and destroy Black bodies through the post-slavery and Jim Crow eras of lynching.

## A brief history of policing

In writing of the way punishment dierentiated between Whites and slaves in the US, Davis has noted that the deprivation of White freedom tended to arm the Whiteness of democratic rights and liberties. White men acquired the privilege to be punished in a way that armed ‘equality and the racialised universality of liberty, [however] the punishment of black slaves was corporal, concrete and particular’.51 There are parallels between the way slaves and Indigenous peoples were treated in terms of the extreme physicality and brutality of punishment and its public nature – punishment which was underpinned by the need to maintain economic exploitation and colonial superiority justied by racist ideologies. After the Civil War, the slave codes were replaced by the Black Codes which continued to control the movement, employment and conduct of freed slaves. Michelle Alexander notes that the codes established both ‘systems of peonage resembling slavery’, while others foreshadowed Jim Crow laws through segregation.52 Black men and women were far more likely to be arrested than Whites for public order oences such as vagrancy, oensive language, drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and prostitutionrelated oences. The laws criminalising vagrancy were used by police to force Black men and women to accept employment or to be subject to convict leasing – where police would receive a kickback from employers.53 The working conditions were often worse than slavery, as the owners and contractors had less need to preserve their labour force. Racism, segregation, and discrimination were embedded in the Jim Crow laws, and during this period the policing of Black Americans continued to be intertwined with the maintenance of White supremacy. Lynching, violence, rape, and vigilantism were either ignored, protected, or engaged in by the police. Sherrilyn Ill’s historical work on lynching shows the role of ordinary people in the open, public murder of Black people. However, the complicity of police was also fundamental. Police determined whether a Black person would face a trial or a lynch mob. Lynchers often deliberately sought the grounds outside the courthouse, and in the early 1900s the lynchings were often referred to as ‘lynch law’. Lynching a Black person in front of the courthouse was both a physical and symbolic location. Police were also instrumental in

## Defund the Police

legitimating racial murders by the failure to prosecute those who were involved. Ill notes that, ‘there is no record of any white person ever having been convicted of murder for lynching a black person – not in the thousands of instances of white-on-black lynchings in thirty-four states’.54 Emblematic of the violence against Blacks and the role of the police was the Tulsa Riot. One of the largest, most extreme acts of racist violence in the US occurred in June 1921 when White rioters destroyed over 1,000 homes and murdered up to 300 Black people in the black neighbourhood of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma. No-one was ever convicted for the criminal acts of murder and the destruction of property. Police in Tulsa were known for their corruption and had participated previously in lynching and violence against the Black population. The Tulsa riot was sparked by another attempted lynching of a young Black man. Members of the White lynch mob were deputised, armed, and participated along with police and the national guard and other White citizens in the burning, looting and destruction of Greenwood. After the riot, some 70 men who were mostly Black were indicted. However, all the charges were ultimately dismissed. Eighty years after the riot, an Oklahoma Commission of Inquiry into the riots was established. It described the Grand Jury at the time as a whitewash which told ‘a laughable story of black culpability for the riot’.55 The Tulsa riot was only one example of many other incidents of collective White violence and massacres carried out against Black communities during the latter part of the 19th and rst half of the 20th centuries. What they had in common was the goal of ensuring White supremacy. What they also had in common, like lynching, was often the complicity of local police and the legal system in facilitating murder and the destruction of property, of being part of the ‘crime problem’ and of bringing social disintegration and disorder to Black communities. Policing and the criminal law were fundamental to maintaining racial oppression in the US from slavery to the end of Jim Crow and beyond.
Imperialism, policing, and counter insurgency
For the imperial powers, policing was fundamental to the direct control of colonial possessions and other mandated territories after

the First World War. However, the prole of policing changed in the post-1945 period of decolonisation – both during the transition period and post-independence. The British police in the Mandate territory of Palestine had developed their military, political, and counterinsurgency capabilities during the period leading up to the 1948 Israeli assertion of independence and British withdrawal from Palestine. According to historian Georgina Sinclair, after 1948 these police took their counterinsurgency expertise to British colonies elsewhere, to confront the dierent forms of political agitation and resistance in the colonies that heralded the process of decolonisation. As political and social tensions increased throughout the British empire, so did the development of police intelligence systems and counterinsurgency units, including expanded ‘Special Branch’ police. Police reverted to semi-military proles with increased police powers. According to Sinclair, policing by the end of the British Empire resembled the tactics associated with a ‘dirty war’, and Harcourt has shown in relation to the French, the British, and later the Americans how the independence movements in North Africa, Malaya, and Indochina were used to develop counterinsurgency tactics.56 We return to the eect of counterinsurgency and police militarisation on domestic policing in the centres of imperialism later in the book. Here, I highlight the developing interconnections of increased ‘global’ policing, and the role of policing in meeting foreign policy objectives within a neo-colonial environment. Policing during the height of Empire was also ‘global’ to the extent that metropolitan centres developed and exercised policing across their colonial possessions, and the developments in the colonies had a ‘feedback eect’ on the imperial centres.57 The US had been inuential in establishing police forces in Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic in the early 20th century as part of a nation-building and modernisation programme. However, these US-trained forces engaged in ‘brutal repression in the service of US-backed regimes … [and] went on to commit horric human rights abuses, including torture, extortion, kidnapping, and mass murder’.58 The latter part of the 20th century saw the expansion of US-based technical and training interventions aimed at police reform across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The US had developed their own counterinsurgency

## Defund the Police

programmes during the 1960s and it became part of the rationale for training police in various countries of the global south as part of the extension of US global imperialism. According to Schrader, between 1962 and 1974, some 52 countries received ‘public safety assistance’ within their home country by way of US resident policing advisors, while nearly 9,000 high-ranking police from 77 countries were sent to the US for training.59 He notes that: ‘Among police at home, the experience of coordinating counterinsurgency overseas bolstered their organizational coherence, their reliance of capital-intensive technical wizardry, and their ideological commitment to conating racial dierence with political opposition. Global counterinsurgency was a statebuilding project, creating new bureaucracies and enlarging security agencies.’ 60 The purpose of international training for the US was straightforward – it was designed to quell social unrest and prevent the expansion of communism during the Cold War through the development of so-called ‘professionalised’ police forces. However, faced with popular opposition the local response often descended into the use of death squads, forced disappearances, and paramilitary vigilantes.61 The US State Department continues to operate a plethora of police training programmes, police experts, and eld oces around the world, and oers assistance in a range of areas including combatting terrorism, border control, and drug enforcement.62 Sometimes the consequences are devasting. In January 2021 Mexican police killed 19 immigrants near the US border and burned their bodies beyond recognition. The majority of those killed were young men from Indigenous communities in Guatemala. Twelve police were subsequently charged with murder and other oences, three of whom were US-trained.63 The tragic outcomes of 20 years of US (and German) training of local police in Afghanistan is also noteworthy. Prior to the US and NATO withdrawal in 2021, the local police were referred to in various internal US documentation as ‘the most hated institution’ in Afghanistan, and a corrupt ‘extractive organization’ extorting money from the population.64 Of equal importance is the simultaneous development within the US of counterinsurgency techniques and the use of military rened hardware and software. Hönke and Müller note that contemporary policing has both a global reach, as well as being

globally made – it is co-constituted in multiple domestic and international sites.65 The genealogy of modern policing deepens this insight.

## The nature of colonial policing

Why is the historical context of colonial policing so important in understanding contemporary policing? The core element of colonial policing was the defence of the colony. The legal order enforced by the police was the law of a colonial state – a legal system which largely excluded colonised peoples (including slaves, Indigenous, and other colonised peoples) from protection, although they were most certainly the subjects of extensive control. The order that the police maintained was by denition an order aimed at protecting the few, while ensuring the ruthless exploitation of the many. Some 30 years ago, when discussing colonial policing, Maureen Cain commented that ‘it is healthy to be reminded that the police are concerned with control of politically, economically, and culturally threatening sections of the populace – sections which sometimes constitute the majority’.66 The analysis of colonial policing is important because colonised peoples never consented to be governed by colonial power, and particularly in the case of settler colonies have never consented. Thus, we see in the colonial setting the nature of police power and violence in its most naked form. The police are central to the maintenance of state power – through the gaze of the colonised we see that power stripped bare of all its niceties, indeed as we do today, for example, with the Israeli settler colonial state’s use of police/ military violence against Palestinians.67 Colonial policing never achieved legitimacy beyond the few who directly benetted from it – as an exercise of power it remained exogenous.68 What then can we say about the dening features of colonial policing? First, colonised peoples were subject to paramilitary policing in a way which was mostly outside the experience of White citizens within metropolitan centres. Police actions in the style of militarylike operations resembled far more a state of war, than the type of policing expected in rural and urban metropolitan communities where there may have been some degree of social consensus. The intensity of war-like police operations was inuenced by the level

## Defund the Police

of resistance; and resistance by colonised peoples was inherent to the colonial relationship. People do not give up everything – their lands, their homes, their families, and their livelihoods – without a ght,69 and at times the intensity of resistance could threaten the viability and prosperity of the colony. Establishing police legitimacy among the colonised was generally not a motivating factor for colonial power; ensuring governance and stability for the extraction of wealth was. Second, policing was contextualised within the legal ambiguity surrounding the position of colonised peoples within the colonies. While on the one hand they were seen as subjects of the colonial state, colonised peoples were aorded little protection by the law – and ‘suspension’ of the rule of law was common. As Justice Tankebe has noted, a distinctive feature of colonial policing was ‘the exercise of wide-ranging discretionary powers without accountability’.70 Further, systems of punishment were racialised and dierentiated in their brutality and violence between the colonised and the coloniser. Relatedly, the suspension of the rule of law and the use of terror and violence by police against colonised peoples was contextualised and legitimated by racialised constructions of the colonised as inferior, lesser human beings. Racist ideologies enabled both genocidal interventions and institutional, systemic, and legalised racial discrimination. Third, police took on the role of managing colonised peoples through administrative tasks which were variously aimed at suppressing, controlling, exploiting, and at times civilising and assimilating colonised peoples. There were extensive regulatory regimes which often sought complete control of the Native and which, when it suited colonial authorities, also eectively criminalised the culture, beliefs and practices of the colonised. In many places, police were the face of colonial power and were expected to full a range of regulatory and other administrative tasks in the interests of a functioning colonial government: some were apparently benign (reporting on the conditions of crops), some were not (removing children from families). In both a symbolic and practical sense, police also embodied the violence of colonial power and the power of White supremacy: from the ruthless suppression of colonial revolts across Asia and Africa to the lynching of Black people in North America.

## A brief history of policing

Fourth, the colonial process and policing in its various forms was gendered and imposed the patriarchal relations of the colonising society. Missionaries and colonial governments challenged the position of colonised women – sometimes expressing a view to ‘save’ them from the barbarism of inferior cultures. In India, for example, the British vigilantly addressed ‘scandalous’ forms of gender violence such as sati and those activities that appeared to indicate the backwardness of Indian culture such as child marriage, purdah, and caste-prostitution. However, as Elizabeth Kolsky indicates, ‘they were less interested in controlling forms of violence against women with which they were more familiar such as rape, murder and domestic violence’, and particularly when committed by European men.71 Women experienced the double jeopardy of being female and colonial subjects. Colonised women were cast as a threat to White society. Their sexuality was commodied via rape and sexual servitude, and police misconduct (including rape and murder) went relatively unpunished. Sexual violence was integral to colonial violence more generally.72 Ritchie argues that colonialism (including slavery) lay the foundations for the violent treatment of Black, Indigenous, and women of colour, and follows a continuum through racial segregation and control, the policing of poverty, and contemporary policing approaches to public order, drugs, immigration, and terrorism.73 There is thus a structured and enduring nature to police violence against racialised women.

## Conclusion

The historical role of police in the 19th and 20th centuries raises important considerations for the Defund the Police movement. It has been tempting to argue that police have taken on an increasing role over recent years as the stop gap response to all types of problems they were never meant to resolve. However, an historical understanding shows that modern policing since its inception in the early 19th century operated well beyond responding to narrow conceptions of crime. It has been highly regulatory, controlling, and violent. Police were an essential part of the ‘great connement’ beginning in the early part of the 19th century – they were a core part of the mechanisms of carceral control – the prisons, the

## Defund the Police

asylums, and various colonial institutions. Therefore, we need to be careful of the tendency to stop asking police to be something they have not always been,74 that is to assume that they have a role which has at some time not involved widespread, often violent intervention into the social, political, and cultural lives of working-class, colonised, and racialised communities since the early days of modern policing. The historical analysis reinforces the view that we have a policing problem that is grounded within particular structural constraints that are not about or have ever been primarily about crime control. The targets of policing have always been those who for whatever reason threaten systems of political control and economic exploitation and the prosperity of the few. Drawing on the French experience, Blanchard has argued that the origins of policing colonised peoples is a key ‘historical operator’ in understanding racialised policing today, from the use of deadly force to the routine racial selectivity underlying stop and searches, identity checks, and so on for young non-White males.75 Furthermore, resistance to these forms of policing are ongoing. In recent decades, for example, in the UK, France, the US, and Australia anti-police uprisings and protests have been mostly associated with police lethal violence and police racism.76 Furthermore, the colonial legacy of policing has continued within former colonies where police use of lethal violence against the population continues unchecked. Policing has always been intertwined between the metropolitan centres of colonialism and the external colonies. Today these multidirectional ows continue in the interests of political elites and global security corporations: the plantation slaveowners and merchants of London or the American South have transformed into strategic policy advisors in government agencies, interest groups such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and a host of corporate entities from big data to military hardware. If we need to be careful in not expecting the police role to be dierent to what it has been for the last two centuries, then the historical analysis also highlights the problem of reform. The absence of police accountability has always been a problem, and if the police act in the interests of the powerful, why would we expect it to be any dierent? The core problem with reform

strategies is not simply that they do not work, it is that they have the capacity to actually strengthen the systems of police control. Finally, reading the genealogy of modern policing, the point that looms large is the asymmetrical nature of police power and violence. It is applied largely to the least powerful in society.
             Don’t police solve crime?
Chapter 2 provided an historical setting to contemporary policing. How do police see their role today? If we take the mission statements of several large police departments, there is consistent repetition of a few themes. For example, the Chicago Police Department, ‘as part of, and empowered by, the community, is committed to protect the lives, property, and rights of all people, to maintain order, and to enforce the law impartially’. Similarly, the Maharashtra Police Service in India sees its basic duty and purpose as ‘to uphold and maintain the law fairly and rmly, to detect and prevent crime, to protect, help and reassure the community, [and enforce] the various laws of the land’, while the London Metropolitan Police’s mission ‘is to keep London safe for everyone’.1 Police dene themselves primarily by their functions, including preventing, detecting, and investigating criminal activities, enforcing the law, maintaining public order, and ensuring community safety. In the spirit of Peel’s ‘New Police’, the mission statements in some form or another see police legitimacy as deriving from an amorphous and undened community. A limitation of seeing police work through what the police say they do is that the variety of situations in which police intervene is much greater than law enforcement, solving crime or even simply maintaining order. As we saw in the Chapter 2, the role of the police has always been expansive, in both colonial settings (for example, removing children from families, undertaking summary justice, banning ceremonies, and undertaking political surveillance) and in the metropole (from controlling the labour movement to apprehending ‘lunatics’, controlling the homeless,

and policing school truancy). An argument we often hear is that the role of police has expanded signicantly, and they are now required to respond to an increasing number of social problems. However, this argument needs to be read within the broader historical context. Part of the reading of this issue is that ‘crime’ and the necessity for a police response is contingent on the power to dene the activities that constitute crime, disorder, and the social activities that necessitate police intervention. For example, in the 1990s and since, the international appeal of the ‘broken windows’ approach to crime and the concomitant rise of zero tolerance policing has seen a focus on the aggressive policing of people who are the contemporary equivalents of the 19th-century vagrants, beggars, undeserving poor, the disreputable, and those living with disability or mental ill-health. A second limitation of dening police by their end goals such as solving crime and ensuring public safety is that it draws attention away from the features that dene how police conduct their work. Two irreducible elements of policing are the legal authority to use (lethal) violence and coercion to resolve situations; and the ability to use discretion, so that it is not law enforcement per se, but the ability to decide which laws to enforce, and how and when to enforce them that is important. The elements of police violence and police use of discretion are explored further as the book progresses. For the moment, I want to pick up on a point made by Stuart Schrader that the messages about police solving crime, preventing violence, and being answerable to the community are part of the sustaining myths of policing. More importantly, these messages are political arguments as well: ‘They are instrumental, a means toward an end. Police attempt to achieve legitimacy through the stories they tell about themselves. Police legitimacy means public compliance. It means power. The core of policing is not safety. It is social control.’2 Thus, it is worth returning to the foundational political arguments for the existence of police and their assumed necessity and legitimacy.

## Danger

Many of the arguments for not defunding the police include in some form that police are indispensable because of their

## Defund the Police

crime- solving abilities, that they are highly trained and are required by the public to respond to dangerous situations. However, in England and Wales, the College of Policing reported that non-crime related incidents account for 83 per cent of all calls to police Command and Control Centres.3 In the US, an analysis of police calls for service show that most calls for service are for non-violent problems. A New York Times investigation into calls for service for ten police departments (including cities such as New Orleans, Baltimore, Phoenix, Cincinnati, and Seattle) found that the percentage of calls relating to serious violent crime was around 1 per cent. The research showed that the amount of time ocers devoted to handling serious violent crime was about 4 per cent, while more than 30 per cent was devoted to responding to non-criminal calls.4 Similarly, Michelle Brown and colleagues analysed 2 years of call data in Knoxville, Tennessee. Some 44 per cent of the calls were property-related, 18 per cent of calls were for responses to motor vehicle accidents, calls relating to ‘interpersonal conict and violence’ were 12 per cent, and ocer-initiated calls relating to activities on patrol, assisting citizens, location checks, etc were 7 per cent of the total. In addition, there was a high number of hang-up calls.5 At least two related issues arise from the research on calls for service: the extent to which police are necessary for eective responses to public requirements for assistance, and second, whether they are appropriate responders. As noted in a paper from the Brookings Institute: ‘Police ocers’ skillset and training are often out of sync with the social interactions that they have. Police ocers are mostly trained in use-of-force tactics and worst-case scenarios to reduce potential threats.’6 Further, Brown and colleagues have argued that the call for service, while foregrounding public demand and need, also evokes and legitimates the expansive power of police. Irrespective of whether the call is crime-related or not, the police are established institutionally to dictate the social responses they determine to be appropriate – for example to matters involving homelessness or disability. Research on calls to police relating to homelessness show that most do not concern criminal behaviour, yet they generate a high volume of arrests for minor oences.7 Analysis of calls for service have been important for progressing the Defund the Police movement and for

abolitionists more generally. It provides a pragmatic opportunity to shrink the criminal legal system by reducing the scope and funding of police. It also requires us to think through other ways of responding to citizens’ demands for assistance which do not reproduce new forms of carcerality, so that it is not just about the absence of police, but also the presence of well-resourced communities that can respond to their own social needs – a point that was acknowledged by activist and revolutionary groups opposing police brutality and lethal violence in the 1960s and early 1970s.8 The argument that the police are the ‘thin blue line’ between the community and violent anarchy also begs the question of how dangerous policing is as an occupation. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data for 2019, police ocers do not rank in the top ten most dangerous occupations as measured by workplace fatalities. Forestry workers, construction workers, iron and steel workers, sales drivers and truck drivers, refuse collectors, agricultural workers, farmers, pilots, and grounds maintenance workers all have more dangerous jobs than police ocers.9 In Australia, workers in the public administration and safety industry (which includes police, emergency services, prison ocers, and other public administration workers) were at the mid-point in terms of the fatality rate of all industries (that is, of the 19 industry categories they ranked number 10 for fatalities).10 Although there are variations between countries, where there is data, we know that around 75 per cent of police deaths in the line of duty are accidental and that the majority of these are related to trac accidents. A minority of police deaths are caused by an oender. For example, Allard and Prenzler found that over the 60-year period from 1948 to 2007, some 80 per cent of Australian police ocer’s line of duty deaths were due to accidents.11 Longer-term improvements in police procedures and technology have resulted in reductions in the rate of police fatalities. Typically, in Australia there are one or two deaths on duty per year.12 In the UK the rate is similar: in 2020, ve ocers died in the line of duty – three were the result of motor vehicle accidents, one from being accidentally struck by a vehicle, and one ocer died in a shooting.13 The US is anomalous to the extent that, taking into account dierent population sizes, there are a large number of police deaths compared to nations such as the UK or Australia, and a

greater proportion of these police deaths arise from shootings. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a total of 93 law enforcement ocers were killed in the line of duty in
2020. Of these, just over half the ocers died in accidents (47)
and the remainder of ocers (46) died because of the actions of oenders. Just on 90 per cent of the ocer deaths caused by oenders involved the use of rearms (41 out of 46). Of those who died in accidents, more than half (26) were killed in motor vehicle crashes and a further 12 were struck by vehicles. Five were killed in rearm-related accidents.14 There is a signicant disparity in the shooting deaths of police in the US compared to other countries in the global north, which is itself partly related to the availability and use of rearms within the broader society. We might also compare the number of police killed by rearms in the US with the number of civilians killed by police in fatal shootings – there were over 1,000 civilian deaths from police shootings in 2020.15 Again, these civilian killings are high compared to other countries in the global north. The Prison Policy Institute compared the rate of police killings per 10 million of the population across ten countries. It found that the rate in the US was 33.5 per 10 million of the population. It was 9.8 in Canada, 8.5 in Australia, 2.3 in the Netherlands, 2 in New Zealand, 1.3 in Germany, 0.5 in England and Wales, 0.2 in Japan, and zero in Iceland and Norway.16 Comparing the number of civilians killed by police to the number of police killed by civilians opens consideration of the epidemiology of gun killings involving police. According to public health research, one in 15 rearm deaths in the US is at the hands of police; among Black Americans it is approximately one in 10.17 While policing may be a relatively safe occupation compared to many others, its negative impact on community safety is clearly problematic. Further, the vast majority of these police killings are dened as ‘lawful’ and thus do not appear in reported crime statistics. Policing is dangerous – not necessarily to the police – but certainly to the community.

## Solving crime

Given the strongly promoted image of police as ‘crime ghters’, it is legitimate to question how eective they are in solving

## Don’t police solve crime?

crime. Most standard books on criminology or policing will tell us unequivocally that police do not do a very good job at solving many types of crime – that their rates for ‘clearing’ crime are quite low. Taken together with low reporting rates, this raises serious questions concerning the competency of police in what are seen to be one of their core roles. For example, according to the Pew Research Centre, in the US less than half of crimes are reported and less than half of those are solved.18 Although there are some denitional variations internationally, police clearance rates for crime are usually based on the calculation of cases that end with an arrest or the identication of a suspect who cannot be apprehended. They are not a measure of convictions. In 2019 in the US, more than 38 per cent of murders were not solved, as were nearly half of aggravated assaults. Two thirds of all reported rapes were not solved, nor were nearly 70 per cent of reported robberies. The clearance rates for burglary and motor vehicle theft are even worse, where approximately 86 per cent of reported oences are not solved.19 The low police clear-up rates for robbery and property oences in the US are common across many countries. For example, in England and Wales less than 10 per cent of robbery and criminal damage result in a person being charged with an oence.20 In NSW, Australia, the clear-up rate for robbery, burglary, and motor vehicle theft is low – almost 70 per cent of robberies and more than 90 per cent of burglaries and motor vehicle thefts are not solved.21 The US clearance figures for murder cited earlier are nationwide. However, in large cities such as Chicago, more than half of reported homicides remain unsolved, and in cities with majority Black populations like Baltimore, the situation is even worse, where two thirds of homicides were not cleared in 2019.22 In countries not aicted by excessive levels of gun violence and murder rates,23 the clearance rate for homicide is much higher. For example, in Australia, the clearance rate was 94 per cent in 2019, and has been consistently above 85 per cent since 1990. In Europe, homicide clearance rates are typically 80 per cent or signicantly higher.24 In these contexts, police are more likely to solve murders because of the high proportion of murder victims killed by someone known to the victim, including family members, current

## Defund the Police

or former intimate partners, or acquaintances and where, among other factors, the number of suspects is relatively limited.25 Not surprisingly, in cases where the oender is known to the victim and there is less use of guns as the murder weapon, the more likely police will successfully solve the crime.26 However, homicides with victims from racialised and marginalised communities (including the homeless, sex workers, people living with disabilities) are more likely to remain unsolved, not investigated, or undetected. Although homicide is something of an exception for the reasons outlined previously, the bottom line is that the majority of many types of crime reported to police are not cleared. The argument that police are indispensable because of their crime solving abilities simply does not t the evidence.

## Reporting and recording crime

The role of the police in solving crime is only one part of the story. Another is the willingness by the community, or more accurately, multiple dierent communities to report crimes to the police in the rst instance. Social divisions based on class, gender, age, race, ethnicity, Indigeneity, disability, sexual orientation, type of work, citizenship status, prior experience with police and legal institutions, and their multiple intersections, all impact on the likelihood of whether a person will report an oence to the police. Crime victim surveys generally measure whether a person has been a victim of crime, whether they have reported the oence to police or others, and the reasons for reporting (or not). Many countries conduct regular surveys, and the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) has conducted various international surveys. There are limitations to these surveys including who is surveyed and who is excluded, how they are surveyed, and what types of crime are included and excluded by the surveys. These limitations are further compounded in international comparative surveys where dierences in cultural, legal, and administrative factors come into play. However, having said that, they do provide a window on the reporting of crime. What stands out in the analysis of this data is that many oences, and in some cases the majority, are not reported to police. For example, in the US only about half

## Don’t police solve crime?

of violent crimes and a third of property crimes are reported by victims to police each year.27 Between the late 1980s and 2005, UNICRI and associated national organisations conducted a number of International Crime Victims Surveys (ICVS). Of the reports generated from this research, one in particular focuses on crime victimisation in 30 countries and 33 large cities, mostly from the global north.28 In general, the reporting levels of crime to police (across a range of oences) is higher in wealthier countries, yet even here in the highest reporting countries of Europe, there is signicant unreported crime ranging between 30–40 per cent in Austria, Belgium, Sweden, and Switzerland. In contrast, in the cities of Sao Paulo, Phnom Penh, Lima, and Maputo, more than 80 per cent of oences are not reported.29 In a survey of 13 African countries,30 slightly more than half the victims of burglary reported the oence to police. However, of those who did report, nearly 70 per cent were not satised with the police response. In relation to robbery oences, only one third of victims reported the oence to police, and of these more than 60 per cent were not satised with the police response; in the cases of assault less than a quarter of victims reported the oence to police, and of these, two thirds were dissatised with the police response. Signicant rates of corruption by police and other government ocials were also identied by victims in some of the African countries which were surveyed. The highest rates were in Uganda, Nigeria, and Mozambique, where one in three people, and Tanzania, where one in ve people, identied being a victim of corruption. Perhaps not surprisingly, the reporting of corruption to police was negligible in these countries, ranging from 1.4 per cent in Uganda to 5.6 per cent in Nigeria. One of the most serious oences which is frequently not reported to police is rape/sexual assault. In the African survey, women were asked about sexual victimisation – which was broadly dened – and very few victims reported these oences (14.5 per cent). The issue of policing and sexual violence is discussed more extensively in Chapter 6. The relatively low reporting of crime to police raises questions of why people decide not to report. Responses to this question depend on the type of crime and where the survey was conducted. However, major reasons are the belief that police could not or

## Defund the Police

would not do anything about the oence, or that the oence was not serious enough. The ICVS study of mostly wealthy countries referred to previously, found that more than 40 per cent of people did not report an oence because they thought police could not or would not do anything. This particular reason for not reporting is often more common in the global south. For example, in Latin America, the lack of police eectiveness is the most common reason for not reporting crime. In general, these types of responses are not surprising when we consider that of the oences reported to police, most will not be solved. To return to the US data, 47 per cent of violent oences and 35 per cent of property crime are reported to police; 46 per cent of the violent crimes and 19 per cent of the property crimes reported to police were cleared. Thus, broadly speaking, for every 100 violent crimes in the community, police solve a little over 20; and for every 100 property crimes, police solve seven.31 In this context, Schrader’s point that the stories police tell about themselves as crime ghters and the ‘thin blue line’ are clearly politically instrumental for maintaining legitimacy in the public sphere, especially in a situation where the factual information on reporting by the community and solving crimes by police tells a quite dierent story. As noted previously, the likelihood of reporting crime to police is mediated by a range of social and political factors. For example, we know in the LGBTQIA+ community, there are lower rates of reporting oences to police than the general population. Research across various countries has indicated numerous reasons for this, including the belief that police are homophobic, that police will not take violence and harassment against LGBTQIA+ people seriously, that they will be subject to abuse when reporting, and that experiences of persecution and discrimination from a range of institutions means that many members of the LGBTQIA+ community will avoid the police.32 Similarly, people living with mental ill- health and disability also face problems reporting oences to police, despite the frequency with which they may be victims of crime, including within institutional settings. For example, analysis drawn from US National Crime Victimization Survey estimated that only 5 per cent of crimes against people with disabilities were reported to the police compared to an average of 44 per cent for the general population.33 In Australia,

## Don’t police solve crime?

various research has shown that prejudice and discrimination mark the interaction between people with disabilities and police, and victims of crime consistently report fearing that police will not protect them, that they will not be believed, or they will be viewed as lacking credibility.34 This question of credibility also raises the concern that even when oences are reported to police, they may not be recorded as crimes – depending on who the police see as credible or worthy victims. More extensively, these police practices become institutionalised corruption, where the manipulation of crime statistics is carried out in the interests of demonstrating police eciency and falling crimes rates. For instance, in the UK in 2014, the government’s Statistics Authority removed its approval of police recorded crime statistics because of recording malpractices and inaccuracies. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary estimated that as many as one in ve oences reported to police were not being recorded – including serious oences such as rape.35
Who do we trust?
The argument which is often advanced is that ecacy of the police is dependent on their relationship with the people in the communities they police – hence the constant reformist measures that seek to improve community/police relationships. Yet this avoids the type of structural relationships of oppression that underpin relationships with police – the history of which was outlined in Chapter 2. The widespread international protests against police during 2020 showed the serious absence of police legitimacy in many countries, particularly among racial and other minoritised groups. As McManus and her colleagues have written regarding the US:
     Since the 1960s, studies have observed consistently
     racial disparities in Americans’ attitudes toward
     police. Black Americans are consistently found to
     report lower levels of condence and trust in and/or
     satisfaction with police. Additionally, research nds
     Black Americans are more likely to perceive the police
     as racially biased, less courteous, and to perceive police

## Defund the Police

     use of force as more of a problem. A national survey
     … [found] only 40% of Black respondents reported
     favorable views of the police, compared to 68% of
     White respondents.36
A recent survey by the Pew Research Centre found that only 9 per cent of Black respondents believed that police treated racial and ethnic groups equally, compared to 42 per cent of Whites. There was also widespread divergence on the view as to whether police were doing a good job protecting people from crime; only 28 per cent of Black Americans believed this to be the case, compared to more than two thirds of White Americans. Besides the dierence between various groups, it is also relevant that the majority of White, Hispanic, and Black respondents believed that the police treated racial and ethnic groups unequally. Similarly, a majority of all groups believed that police were not using the right amount of force, nor doing a good job in holding police ocers accountable for misconduct. A majority also believed that civilians should have the power to sue police ocers who use excessive force.37 Of particular interest is research by the Urban Institute conducted in heavily disadvantaged, high crime communities in six US cities. Residents questioned ‘the intent, eectiveness and equity of the criminal justice system’ in their communities where they experienced an intensive police presence, and high rates of incarceration and community supervision.
     Indeed, police may carry out aggressive strategies that
     target quality-of-life infractions and drug-, gun-, and
     gang-related violence in ways that undermine public
     condence. Perhaps not surprisingly, areas with high
     levels of mistrust tend to be those that are heavily
     policed, where police use tactics such as pretextual
     stops that damage their relationship with the people
     they are charged to protect. The results can be farreaching: a distrust of the criminal justice system,
     an unwillingness to cooperate with the police, and
     a cynical view of the law that can perpetuate crime
     and victimization.38

## Don’t police solve crime?

Two-thirds of the people interviewed in the six communities identied themselves as Black, 12 per cent as White, and 11 per cent as Latinx. The research showed that ‘respondents’ perceptions of police across measures of legitimacy, procedural justice, racial bias, relatability to police, and applied principles of community policing, on average, are extremely negative’.39 Police often acted in ways that were inconsistent with people’s ideas about what is right and wrong. For example, only one in four people believed that police made fair and impartial decisions, or that the police were honest. Less than one in three people believed that police:

- treated people with dignity and respect;
- behaved according to the law;
- were responsive to community concerns, or prioritised
community problems.
Despite these highly negative views of the police, a majority also indicated that they would still report crime to the police and would attend a community meeting with police to discuss neighbourhood crime. One reading of these apparently anomalous results is that people in these highly disadvantaged communities have a genuine concern for public safety – they want to live in a safe environment for themselves and their families. Although they demonstrably do not trust the police, they seemingly have no other available social or institutional responses they can call on – a situation which has been exacerbated in many communities by years of neglect, unemployment, and withdrawal of social services. Chris Hayes’s book A Colony in a Nation makes the case that the criminal legal system in the US is not simply a single system with massive racial disparities, but rather two distinct systems. ‘One (the Nation) is the kind of policing regime you expect in democracy; the other (the Colony) is the kind you expect in an occupied land’.40 In an argument reminiscent of Frantz Fanon, Hayes maintains that in the Colony, police violence looms constantly, and any non-compliance can be fatal: ‘In the Nation there is law, in the Colony, there is only a concern for order. In the Nation, you have rights; in the Colony you have commands.’41 The racial composition of the Colony is primarily made-up of Black and people of colour. However, as a result of neoliberalism,

## Defund the Police

deindustrialisation, and wage stagnation, ‘the tendencies and systems of control developed in the Colony have been deployed over wider and wider swathes of working-class white America’.42 Ultimately though, there is no single experience of crime and punishment in the US, the experiential dierences mean there are two dierent countries separated by the intersections of race and class. This issue is not particular to the US, and can be seen from the policing of young people of colour in the banlieues of Paris to the youth prisons of the Northern Territory in Australia, where it is not unusual for Aboriginal children to comprise the total incarcerated youth population. It can be seen in the UK, where reportedly 85 per cent of Black people do not believe they would be treated the same as a White person by the police.43 Of course, the ‘colony’ and its aftermath is not simply a metaphor. As Justice Tankebe notes in his work on the Ghana police, successive postcolonial governments failed to shift policing from its colonial foundations, and contemporary human rights violations, police violence and corruption, and the absence of accountability can be traced to these colonial roots. In the aftermath of colonial independence, police reform was aimed at Africanisation and expanding the operational capacity of the police. The ‘ideological orientation of the police and how they carried out their functions were left largely untouched … [and] police were used by successive governments to suppress liberties and political freedoms’.44 If unaccountable police power had been a feature of colonial policing systems, it continued largely unabated in the postcolonial period. Indeed, if anything, it worsened. While Tankebe is specically discussing Ghana, the lessons can be seen elsewhere in police forces carrying on the tasks of colonial control through summary arrests, detention, imprisonment, extra-legal executions of suspects, and political opponents, and so on – now being done for the new local elites that replaced the former

## Police discretion

One of the dening features of police is broad discretion – the ability of police to decide whether, when, and how to act in enforcing the law and maintaining order. Police are sometimes

## Don’t police solve crime?

referred to as ‘street-level bureaucracies’ to capture the idea that police exercise wide discretionary decision-making in their interactions with the public. The question of discretion is connected to matters of accountability and legitimation. If discretion denes how police act, then we need to be concerned with whether police are accountable for their actions – police actions occur with ‘low visibility’ in terms of review and accountability. A further concern is whether police discretionary actions are seen as legitimate by the community being policed and the broader public. Moreover, police discretionary decisions dene the types of people, behaviour and events that come to be seen as criminal and crime – and that knowledge is mirrored back to public in their understanding of danger, risk, and criminality. The use of discretion is bounded and inuenced by a range of factors, including peer group pressure, elements of police culture more generally (such as loyalty, machismo, individualism), and police training, which inculcates a heightened sense of danger and the resort to violence. Various ocial inquiries and royal commissions46 over the years in many countries have identied endemic problems within police culture including a high tolerance of dishonesty, lying under oath, falsifying information and evidence, the view that inconvenient legal rules can be ignored, and systemic or institutional racism. At the more extreme level, police utilise discretion in whether to use violence (euphemistically referred to in policing literature as force), and the ‘appropriate’ level of violence. Coercive and sometimes lethal violence is used more frequently in interactions with Black, Indigenous, and people of colour. The use of individual police discretion is often mundane in the day-to-day decisions of who to stop, who to search, what subsequent actions to take, and whether and how these interactions are mediated by the individual attributes of the public including race, class, age, mental health/disability, sexual orientation, and gender. In other words, the use of police discretion is socially patterned. Other factors that may place limits around how police act include whether the boundaries of the law are seen to apply, systems of accountability, and the social visibility and location of encounters with the public. The events at protests after the death of George Floyd were an example of the absence of

## Defund the Police

these limiting factors – from indiscriminate police violence against protesters and bystanders to the selective targeting of journalists. Police do not (and could not) enforce all the laws all of the time, and it is through selective enforcement that police choose who is funnelled into the criminal legal system.47 The law itself may invite discretion through, for example, the use of diversionary options for young people, or the decision to proceed against an alleged oender by way of arrest or by court summons. Although these decisions may appear mundane from a policing perspective, the legal and social eects on those who are the subject of these decisions are far from mundane (for example, bail, court, pretrail detention, nes, jail, criminal record, loss of employment, loss of housing). Discretion exists at all levels of the organisation, from the police commissioner to the ocer on the beat. At the organisational level, it exists in the development of policing policies, in the setting of targets to police certain types of crimes, oenders, and locations, and in the allocation of policing resources. At a local level, it exists in the interpretation of these policies by local police commanders: how seriously they take diversion, where they place resources, whether they target particular neighbourhoods or housing estates, and so forth. If local police are being kitted-out with military weapons, hardware, tactics, and technologies to respond to public demonstrations, we need to ask what message that provides to police on the ground. What are they being encouraged to do? How are they being invited to utilise their discretion? These institutional and organisational imperatives dene matters such as task orientations and policy priorities and aect the use of discretion at the individual level. They directly impact on the denitions of and reactions to events and situations dened as ‘crime’. In the following sections, I briey consider two examples of how police discretion inuences the broader problems of both criminalisation and solving crime: the policing of children and young people, and the policing of violence against people from LGBTQIA+ communities.

## Policing young people

The social patterning of police discretion and the way it negatively impacts on Black, First Nations, and other racialised groups is

## Don’t police solve crime?

particularly apparent if we look at the policing of young people. There is evidence over many decades that police powers are applied disproportionately in accordance with racialised views of youth crime and disorder. Comparative work between England and Wales and Australia illustrates the problem.48 In Australia the adverse use of police powers has targeted primarily First Nations children, and various refugee and immigrant children, including from Indochina and more recently from Africa, and Arabic-speaking children in line with periods of Islamophobia. For example, over the last decade there have been consistent complaints by African–Australian young people of police racial proling, harassment, and violence in many Australian cities. In one case a racial discrimination complaint ended in a Federal Court settlement between the Victorian police and six young people of African background.49 Similarly, in England and Wales there is comparable long-term evidence that minority ethnic young peoples’ experiences of policing are often characterised by hostility, lack of confidence, and a general mistrust of authority, and that particular racialised groups are most at risk of disproportionate police attention including African Caribbean and Muslim young people. We see the problem manifested in both Australia and England and Wales with the disproportionate and routine use of stop and searches, knife searches, strip searches, and move-on powers. In the majority of these cases, nothing illegal is located – which compounds young people’s feelings of being subjected to targeted police harassment.50 Crudely racialised constructions of youth ‘gangs’ have further extended discriminatory policing. In 2014, the London Metropolitan Police reported that nearly 80 per cent of the people included in its Gang Matrix database were classied as Black and a further 9 per cent were from other minority ethnic communities. Comparable biases are found in other police gang databases in England. As Bridges explains:
     The ethnic composition of the Gangs Matrix and
     similar databases is not simply an issue of bias in the
     way such instruments are compiled. As the police
     themselves turn increasingly to so-called ‘intelligenceled’ operations … these databases feed directly into

## Defund the Police

     the ways in which policing policies and priorities are
     being targeted on particular groups. In other words,
     the racial bias in the databases becomes institutionalised
     in police practice.51
Generally-speaking, youth justice has developed historically with a greater emphasis on diversion from formal criminal proceedings than has been the case with adults – in recognition of the need to prevent unnecessary criminalisation and stigmatisation of children. The preference for using diversionary options for children in conict with the law is prioritised in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In most cases, police are the access point to diversion from formal criminal proceedings. However, it is clear that police discretionary decisions are dierentially applied along racialised boundaries – which leads to greater criminalisation and more punitive outcomes for some groups of children. In Australia, First Nations children are signicantly less likely than other young people to receive a police diversionary option (such as a warning or caution) and, conversely, they are more likely than other children to be arrested, to have bail refused and to have their cases referred to court for determination. In England and Wales, police can opt to either charge a child with a crime, or divert them from the legal system by way of ‘no further action’ or by issuing a reprimand or a nal warning. Various research has shown that police are less likely to issue a reprimand or nal warning to Black and ‘mixed race’ young people, and less likely to divert them through no further action, compared to White oenders. The outcomes of these police decisions inuence and cumulatively compound through the legal system with the greater use of police custody, more extensive criminal records and more punitive sentencing outcomes, including a greater likelihood of imprisonment.52 Discretion and the policing of young people highlights the discriminatory nature of many police interventions, and in particular how racialisation becomes embedded in police practice. It goes to the heart of the argument that contemporary policing is more about maintaining systemic inequalities than solving crime per se. It also speaks to how, in popular discourse, we come to see crime as being perpetrated by Black, Indigenous and minority young people – both male and female – rather than

## Don’t police solve crime?

seeing the role of police decision-making in creating a racialised ‘juvenile criminal’.
Investigating violence and murder of LGBTQIA+ people
Police violence against the LGBTQIA+ community has a long history and continues today – openly in many places. For example, in Turkey the annual Gay Pride parade has been banned since
2014. The LGBTQIA+ community continues to gather for the
procession in Istanbul to be met by police repression. In June 2021, battalions of Turkish police in riot gear red tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowds attempting to take part in the parade. In June 2022 police began arresting people before the march started, raiding cafes and bars in the area, and detaining nearly 400 people.53 Other Pride rallies internationally have challenged the participation of police in Pride parades, and some groups such as the No Pride in Policing Coalition in Toronto have called for the defunding of the police. It was noted earlier in this chapter that the LGBTQIA+ community is a group who is less likely to report criminal oences to police. The 2015 US Transgender Survey found that of the survey respondents who had contact with the police, more than half (58 per cent) experienced some form of mistreatment. Police often assumed that transgender people – particularly transgender women of colour – were sex workers. More than half (57 per cent) of respondents said they would feel uncomfortable asking the police for help if they needed it.54 Police responses to anti- homosexual/ transgender murders provide a window on how police discretion impacts on investigations, and how at a deeper level the structures of heteronormativity are policed. On the surface, we might expect the investigation of a murder is an area where police discretion is limited. Yet research into police responses to the deaths of people in the LGBTQIA+ community shows otherwise. For example, researchers have considered the dozens of killings of gay men and transgender women which occurred in NSW (particularly Sydney) during the 1980s and 1990s. They have raised the question of whether the unsolved homicides which were dismissed as accidents, suicides, or low priority killings by police, reected the view by police of LGBTQIA+ people as

## Defund the Police

‘unworthy’ victims. Over the last decade, a number of subsequent coronial re-investigations of these deaths (particularly into the murders of gay men in Bondi, Sydney) have been highly critical of the original police investigations, including ineptitude, poor practices, stereotypes of the murder victims as ‘paedophiles’ and the potential impact of police corruption. 55 An NSW Parliamentary Committee conducted its own inquiry into violent crimes committed against LGBTQIA+ people between 1970 and 2010. The Committee reported in May 2021 and found that the police force had failed in its responsibility to properly investigate cases of historical gay and transgender hate crime. As recommended by the Committee, a judicial inquiry has been established to inquire into unsolved cases of suspected gay and transgender hate crime murders.56 These issues are not particular to Australia. In many countries, including the UK, Canada, and the US, violence against LGBTQIA+ communities is on the rise. Reecting the problem of police discretion, a recent UK report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found that victims of hate crimes faced a ‘postcode lottery’ in terms of the eectiveness or otherwise of police responses.57 The US also provides a graphic example of the exercise of police institutional discretion at the highest levels, which minimises the importance of violence against LGBTQIA+ communities. Reporting hate crimes to the FBI is not mandatory, and the number of police departments making these annual reports has been declining. In 2019, some 71 US cities with populations greater than 100,000 either did not report data to the FBI or reported zero hate crimes. According to the Human Rights Campaign, a report of zero incidence is clearly not credible: ‘The lack of mandatory reporting means that the FBI data, while helpful, paints an incomplete picture of hate crimes against the LGBTQ and other communities’.58 The failure of police to properly investigate violence, harassment, and murder of people on the basis of sexual orientation reects particular use of police discretion on many levels and reinforces the structures of heteronormativity. Obviously, not all police ocers are heterosexual, and there are police who as individuals treat violence against gay, lesbian, and transgender people as a genuine issue. However, it is also the case that failing to take

## Don’t police solve crime?

violence against the LGBTQIA+ community seriously is a systemic problem that establishes and legitimises the structural boundaries of acceptability. Those who fall outside those boundaries are ineligible for protection, and those who commit harm are ignored or excused.

## Conclusion

The chapter has provided an outline of why we need to be sceptical of the ability of police to solve crime. We know that rates of reporting crime to police are low and the ability of police to solve crime is limited – as shown in the rates of crimes that are cleared. A distrust of police and the criminal legal system, an unwillingness to cooperate with the police, and various forms of racism and discrimination by police, impact on whether people will report and whether they will be believed. Localised increases in crime are often used as propaganda tools to argue for more police resources. However, we need to acknowledge the signicant limitations of crime data particularly in relation to what is reported, measured, and ignored, as well as the more fundamental question of whether police are necessary and appropriate for eective responses to the type of assistance which communities require. There are also questions which run much deeper, including the broader functions of police in the process of criminalisation. Hayes’s argument that the criminal legal system is in fact two distinct systems divided and experienced along primarily the line of race, needs to be expanded to include other social divisions such as sexuality, ableism, and age. Driving through these categories are race and class – thus we know, for example, that children and young people that end up in the juvenile legal system are drawn from the most disadvantaged and oppressed neighbourhoods and communities. They have biographies scarred by combinations of low income, disrupted education, and welfare and child protection involvement, that compounds further through police intervention.59 Similarly, we know that both class and race mediate which people living with mental ill-health and disability will come to police attention – it is particularly those who are poor and homeless.60 Policing creates the boundaries of legitimacy and

acceptability, of those that remain outside the legal system and those that become ‘police property’. Through the use of discretion, policing reproduces the social boundaries of who is problematic and who is not. It is a power utilised at an organisational and individual level that is one of the core attributes of policing. It enables police power to be exercised in a targeted and economical way – it is the lter device of criminalisation. Occasionally it is misdirected – the White middle class woman is shot dead by police on the lawn of her home after calling for police assistance, or the Harvard University professor who is Black is arrested in his leafy upmarket home for a suspected break-in – but mostly it works the way it is supposed to.61 The two examples drawn on is this chapter, the policing of children and young people, and the policing of violence against people from LGBTQIA+ communities, illustrate these issues. Discretion and the policing of young people highlights the discriminatory nature of many police interventions, and in particular, how racialisation becomes embedded in police practice – pushing racialised young people into the furthest reaches of the juvenile legal system. Police discretion also impacts on murder investigations. The research into police responses to the killings of people within the LGBTQIA+ community strongly suggests a situation where negative perceptions of victim status reproduce heteronormative assumptions and normalise violence. These examples go to the heart of the argument that contemporary policing is more about maintaining systemic inequalities than solving crime. Moreover, the question of police discretion is symbiotically connected to the utilisation of violence – police violence, carceral violence, state violence – the discretion to kill, maim, and imprison. It links the historical discussion in Chapter 2 on the history of the role of the police in enforcing colonial exploitation and control with Chapter 4, which picks up on the contemporary background to the movement to defund the police – movements that were forged in the direct challenge to the use of violence by police.

## to zero tolerance

The demonstrations, protests, and uprisings against police internationally, and the rise of the BLM movement, are inextricably connected to police violence and deaths in custody, and especially the deaths of Indigenous, Black, and people of colour. While there is a long history to policing as the violent arm of colonialism and slavery as discussed in Chapter 2, the more recent history of the struggle against police violence arises in the global revolutionary movements of the 1960s and 1970s. The anti-imperialist struggles against the US war in Vietnam and opposition to its interventions and support for dictatorships in Latin America and elsewhere, the anti-apartheid movement, the civil rights movements, the rise of worker’s and student’s militancy, and the women’s rights and gay rights movements, brought a generation of people into direct contact with the ferocity of state power. Police in various countries were at the forefront of often violent repression of these popular movements. The other important lesson from the resistance to police violence is that the popular movements were not simply oppositional – they were concerned with responding to the needs of communities in areas such as access to health, education, legal services, and housing, and in building solidarity across groups.

## Intertwining stories

Taking Australia and the US as examples, the struggle against police and state violence was central to the radical politics of the Black Panther and Indigenous liberation movements. The formation of the American Indian Movement (AIM) in Minneapolis, the Black Power movement and the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) in Sydney, and the Black Panther Party for Self- Defense in Oakland are central examples of First Nations and Black movements for autonomy, self-defence, and self-determination which emerged alongside protecting local communities from police violence. Reections on First Nations and Black history since the late 1960s bring to light parallels which bear directly on understanding the current BLM protests and the demands to defund the police. In short, the struggle against police violence and racism has been one of the dening features of modern First Nations and Black radical political movements in both Australia and the US, and it began at similar moments in both countries. The movements clearly understood that colonialism was a core structure that underpinned police violence. The Black Panther Party for Social Defense was formed in 1966 and the initial strategy involved direct resistance to policing. Activists like Stokely Carmichael and Bobby Seale linked the contemporary position of Black people in the US with the history of domestic colonialism and the war of US imperialism in Vietnam. The work of Frantz Fanon was used as a point of analysis in the Panther’ writings, and police violence and killings were constant themes. According to Seale, ‘the racist military police force occupies our community just like the foreign American troops in Vietnam’.1 The Black Panthers’ Ten Point Program called for an end to ‘police brutality and murder of Black people, other people of color, and all oppressed people inside the United States’. They called for an ‘end to all wars of aggression’ by the US. The Black Panthers were also abolitionists.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s First Nations political activists in Australia understood the contemporary position of Aboriginal people as created by colonial oppression. They had connections with Maori activists in Aotearoa New Zealand, the Polynesian Panthers in the Pacic, both the American Indian Movement and the Black Panthers in the US, First Nations people in Canada, and the Caribbean Black Power movement. They were also involved in the opposition to apartheid in South Africa and Australia’s involvement in the American war in Vietnam. The more radical activists were inuenced by a range of international writers, from Frantz Fanon and Sartre to Stokely Carmichael, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin. They saw their position within the context of colonialism and imperialism and as part of the international Black Power movement. In late 1971, Black Power activists established the Black Panther Party of Australia. Key members included Denis Walker, Sam Watson, Gary Foley, Paul Coe, Gary Williams, and Billie Craigie. Their platform and programme had some similarities to the US Party, except that it contained some important and specically Indigenous provisions for land rights, restitution, and a United Nations supervised plebiscite for Aboriginal people to determine ‘the will of black people as to their national identity’. In relation to the police, the Black Panthers of Australia demanded ‘an immediate end to police brutality, murder and rape of black people’. This could be achieved by giving ‘communities the control of the police’.3 Aboriginal activists such as Bruce McGuinness saw the establishment of the Black Panther Party in Australia not as a copy of the US but rather as part of an international movement and an international philosophy – it was akin to what Fanon had
## advocated for – a Third World movement.4

## Defund the Police

The Black Power movement in Australia and the Black Panther Party and AIM in the US were subject to covert surveillance, monitoring, active intervention, and violence by law enforcement and security agencies. The FBI’s CounterIntelligence Program COINTELPRO targeted the Panthers and AIM as well as other groups, and aimed to ‘expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit or otherwise neutralize’ their activities. It led to the killing of the chairman of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panthers, Fred Hampton.5 In Australia, the federal Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and state police Special Branch operatives monitored the rise of the Black Power movement throughout Australia during the late 1960s through the 1970s. The Indigenous and Black movements were never merely negative protests. Like the BLM movement and the calls to defund the police today, they were quintessentially about positive interventions for community protection, advocacy, and the building of community- led initiatives to support Black, Indigenous, and oppressed peoples. Huey Newton recognised the necessity to connect with communities and their needs. Thus began the provision of the Panther’s many survival programmes, including free breakfasts for children, food packages, schooling, legal and social security advice, free ambulances, free clothing, free bus transport for prison visits, housing, and medical treatment.6 So while the Black Panther Party set out to protect the community from police violence, they also provided community services and support that could not be otherwise accessed. They developed a wide- ranging commitment to addressing social need. As Mary Bassett writes, ‘the Black Panther Party evolved from an organisation focused on armed self-defense against police brutality to one that framed police violence as part of broader social violence’.7 The provision of community-based health care is an example of addressing social need. Utilising the assistance of health activists, the Panthers set up free community-based medical clinics beginning in Chicago in 1969. In the early 1970s, there were free health clinics established by the Panthers in 13 American cities and a national sickle cell screening programme.8 By 1972, the Ten Point Program of the Black Panthers called for ‘completely free health care for all Black and oppressed people’.

     We believe that the government must provide, free

     education and research programs must be developed to
     give all Black and oppressed people access to advanced
     scientic and medical information, so we may provide
     ourselves with proper medical attention and care.9
The Panthers pursued a community healthcare model. They linked ill-health with poverty and racism and had a holistic approach to healthcare – health and social justice were intertwined – and racism was a core determinant of ill-health. A similar model was developed by AIM in the US and Black Power activists in Australia. It has had a lasting legacy on the provision of community health care to poor and oppressed peoples ever since. The American Indian Movement began in Minneapolis in the summer of 1968. A group of First Nations activists led by George Mitchell, Dennis Banks, and Clyde Bellecourt called a community meeting to address the issue of extensive police violence, brutality, and racism experienced by First Nations people in the city – as a result AIM was formed. It was ‘born out of the dark violence of police brutality and the voiceless despair of Indian people’.10 It established the Minneapolis AIM Patrol to actively monitor police violence and brutality against First Nations people, particularly around public housing projects. A national network of AIM patrols was established in 16 cities and communities facing similar problems across the country. The following year AIM established the Indian Health Board of Minneapolis which was the rst First Nations urban-based health care provider in the US. In 1970, the Legal Rights Center opened in Minneapolis through the activism and support of AIM, Black activists and attorneys committed to addressing the overrepresentation of First Nations, Black and people of colour in the criminal legal system.11 The Legal Rights Centre still operates today and continues its ght against police violence and racial and culturally-based oppression.12 AIM continued with its activism, advocacy and demands for

## Defund the Police

self-determination, participating in the 19-month occupation of Alcatraz Island, the establishment of Indian Survival Schools to provide culturally-based education for First Nations children, and the Trail of Broken Treaties march on Washington DC in 1972, which resulted in the occupation of the Bureau of Indian Aairs. It engaged in a range of other community-based and national initiatives, from local food and employment programmes to strategies for ghting racism in sport and media nationally. The AIM was instrumental in establishing the International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) in 1974. Today, the IITC has membership of Indigenous peoples from the Americas, the Caribbean, and the Pacic. It is recognised by the United Nations and supports Indigenous struggles against colonialism and for Indigenous rights and environmental justice. In Sydney, Australia concern over deaths in police custody and constant police violence, brutality, harassment, and racially discriminatory arrests of Aboriginal people led to the establishment of the rst ALS. During the 1960s, the AboriginalAustralian Fellowship and the NSW Council for Civil Liberties were involved in a number of important legal cases over police killings, assaults, and the abuse of police powers. However, a group of young Black activists took more direct action. In 1969, Gary Foley, Paul Coe, Gary Williams, Bill and Lyn Craigie and others decided to establish a patrol to observe and collect information on police violence and harassment in the Redfern area. The group was aware of the Black Panther’s establishment of the pig patrol in Oakland, California to counteract police violence and intimidation, and similar pig patrols were also established in Brisbane by Aboriginal activists.13 Developing from the pig patrol and with support from volunteer lawyers, in early 1970, the ALS opened its doors as the rst free shopfront legal assistance service in Australia. It still operates today. The Black Power movement in Australia was committed to community empowerment. As Black activist Roberta Sykes stated, ‘concerted eort on behalf of the entire community, and with the assistance of the entire community, creates a force and a power in itself … which will propel the people towards a better way of life’.14 Gary Foley armed that ‘the establishment of the Redfern Aboriginal Legal Service was to create a resurgence

## The protest movement never stopped

of pan-Aboriginal nationalism’.15 In July 1971, the Redfern Aboriginal Medical Service was established based on the same model of community control as the ALS. Around the same time, the Aboriginal Housing Company was established as a community housing provider in Redfern. A breakfast programme was established for local Aboriginal children in Redfern in 1972, which later became a community-run childcare centre, Murawina. The National Black Theatre was also established. Over subsequent years, Aboriginal-controlled legal, medical, housing, and childcare services were to spread throughout Australia. The model of community-run legal and medical services was to inuence the establishment of similar service delivery initiatives in the broader society. Today, the peak bodies for First Nations’ legal and medical services, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service Secretariat (NATSILS) and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO), are two of the most inuential bodies representing the interests of First Nations peoples in Australia. In Minneapolis, Redfern and Oakland, First Nations and Black organisations, born from the struggle against police violence, were fundamentally concerned with ghting for sovereignty, self- determination and community control. In 1972, both the AIM’s march on Washington and the establishment of an Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra were powerful symbols of Indigenous nationhood within colonial states. The struggle against police brutality and the use of the prison system against Black, Indigenous, and other oppressed peoples were at the forefront, however it was always part of the development of broader strategic political platforms, including sovereignty, self-determination, restitution/reparations, and land rights. Furthermore, while organising and ghting against police violence was an immediate response to the need for survival, First Nations and Black organisations pushed those demands further through the provision of mutual aid projects in areas of health, education, housing, legal assistance, community safety, and other forms of support. Mutual aid was not charity. It was and is part of the process of meeting community needs, building solidarity across groups, and deepening the political understanding of the causes of racism, poverty, and oppression.16

## Defund the Police

The struggle against police violence and repression has continued through the late 1970s into the new millennium. The contemporary protest movement by First Nations, Black, and people of colour against police violence and racism is the continuation of an ongoing struggle.
Shock troops of the law and order society: Britain
One of the most important books published in the later 20th century on policing, race, and the politics of law and order in the global north was Policing the Crisis. Stuart Hall and his colleagues showed how crime and policing were used to reconstruct hegemony at a time of crisis in state authority.17 The promise of ‘law and order’ was the slogan for the counterrevolution against the social dissent of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Racism, authoritarianism, and state violence were enabled through the tropes of dangerous young Black men and the crime of ‘mugging’. The dog whistle of black youth and crime heralded the ‘problem’ of Black and Asian immigration and more strident levels of racism. Policing and the maintenance of law and order became attached to an appeal to the ‘British Nation’ and the policing of Britain’s internal colonies (to use Hall’s term) increasingly involved arbitrariness and brutality. Racist violence and Black and Asian resistance to police harassment and abuse were evident throughout the 1970s in places like Notting Hill, Stockwell, Southall, and Brixton in London, and elsewhere in England including Manchester and Birmingham.18 As another key Left intellectual, Sivanandan recognised, ‘the story of black struggles in the 1970s has almost always been the story of confrontations with the police’.19 Paramilitary police units began to play a greater role during the 1970s. The Special Patrol Group (SPG) was formed in the early 1960s and came under notice for dierentially policing particularly Black communities. From 1973, the Police Support Units (PSUs) were also introduced into the majority of the country’s police forces. According to Gordon, the PSU ‘cut its teeth on operations directed against black and anti-racist mobilisations’.20 Both the SPG and PSU were active in policing anti-racist and anti-fascist demonstrations such as Rock Against Racism and Anti-Nazi

## The protest movement never stopped

League protests during the 1970s. Anti-racist demonstrator Kevin Gately died in an SPG baton charge in London in 1974, and an SPG ocer killed Blair Peach in 1979 at a demonstration in Southall against the neo-nazi National Front.21 It took 31 years to release a contemporaneous internal police report which had found that Peach was ‘almost certainly’ killed by an SPG ocer. Forty years later, in 2019 there were renewed calls for a public investigation into his killing and why it had been covered up for so long.22 Another Black British academic and activist, Paul Gilroy, articulated at the beginning of the 1980s a key understanding of contemporary defund the police advocates: it is ‘fruitless to search for programmatic solutions to “discriminatory police behaviour” in amendments to [police] training’.23 For Gilroy, part of the problem was the tendency to see racism as a product of individual bias rather than a structural condition in which policing played a signicant role. Similarly, in its 1978 report Police Against Black People, the Institute of Race Relations had raised the challenge of institutionalised racism. Gilroy also noted that the war in Northern Ireland had aected policing in the rest of the UK through the adaptation of operational techniques and methods of surveillance. Policing was changing through the inuence of counter- insurgency planning and growing militarisation. Likewise, ‘community policing’ was never more than a complementary strategy to militaristic police interventions.24 In 1980, Stuart Hall followed up the themes of Policing the Crisis in a short piece for the Cobden Trust entitled Drifting into a Law and Order Society. He wrote: ‘We are now in the middle of a deep and decisive movement towards a more disciplinary, authoritarian kind of society. … This drift into a “Law and Order” society is no temporary aair.’25 While generated by several factors, Hall identied the role of social anxieties, polarisations and tensions which had become forged into a disciplinary ‘commonsense’ which demonised the poor and powerless. Controlling the ‘ungovernable’, the ‘scroungers’, or the ‘enemy within’ (to use Margaret Thatcher’s phrases) demanded a strong authoritarian response. This authoritarian state was the corollary to the reformulated capitalist ‘free market’ and the retraction of the

## Defund the Police

welfare state which was inevitably and simultaneously driving social conict and class polarisation. For Hall, police had become ‘the disciplinary arm, the shock troops of the Law and Order society’. He noted the highly visible role of policing in industrial disputes, and in the policing of racial conict which he referred to as the ‘war of attrition’ between the police and Black people. Hall also identied the militarisation of the police, particularly evident in the saturation policing of Black areas and use of discriminatory stop and searches. For Hall, the SPG showed the claim that the British police were an unarmed force was largely a ‘semantic quibble’: the British police were ‘now in eect an armed and fully equipped technical force’ which had been transformed to take on a wider disciplinary and law and order role.26 His analysis was prescient to the events of the 1981 and 1985 uprisings and the policing of the British Miners’ Strike in 1984. The summer of 1981 saw anti-police riots across many English cities involving mostly Black youth, sparked by aggressive policing, discriminatory stop and searches, and saturation policing in predominantly Black neighbourhoods. The most intense clashes were in Brixton (London), Toxteth (Liverpool), Handsworth (Birmingham), Moss Side (Manchester), and Chapeltown (Leeds).27 As a result of the riots, police received more riot training and more equipment, including CS gas and plastic bullets. Meanwhile, the public face of policing continued with a community policing prole – multiagency initiatives, racial awareness training, neighbourhood watch, and so on.28 The British miner’s strike began in March 1984 after the Thatcher Government chose to close collieries they regarded as uneconomical. The ensuing strike over the next 12 months was reportedly the longest in British history. It was met by a massive and violent police response – with police often outnumbering striking miners two or three to one. Arthur Scargill, the president of the National Union of Mineworkers, described the outcome of the policing of the miners’ strike:
      We had 11,000 people arrested during the course of
      the dispute, including myself. We had 7,000 people
      injured, many of them hospitalised, including myself.

## The protest movement never stopped

     We also had in the region of 200 jailed. We also had,
     tragically, eleven people killed during the miner’s strike
     … this involved four who were killed on picket lines
     and the rest killed in incidents associated with the
     dispute. The police also did something that was more
     blatant than we’d ever seen before. They fabricated
     evidence, they deliberately lied in the witness boxes,
     they forged documents.29
Riot police and their tactics had made the miners’ strike more violent, particularly when combined with broader government support for more ‘aggressive’ policing. 30 Comparing the experience the miners had with unrestrained state violence to that of racialised policing, Arthur Scargill commented, “police tactics in this dispute have revealed clearly to us what black and Asian communities throughout Britain mean by ‘police harassment’ ”.31 In September and October 1985 there were further violent confrontations between young people and police in Brixton and Tottenham (London) and Handsworth (Birmingham). All of these were sparked by police violence and brutality: the police beating of a Black woman in Handsworth, the police shooting of a Black woman in her home in Brixton, and the death of a Black woman in her home in Tottenham after a police raid. Sivanandan noted at the time that this was life in Britain’s Gulags.32 The confrontations with police through the 1970s and 1980s gave rise to new forms of community-based organisations and resistance. Some of these interventions used the legal system to advance political struggle through, for example, using criminal trials as a political platform, while at the same time mobilising community support and protest outside the legal system. As Paul Gilroy explained, ‘this combination of tactics and the synchronisation of protest inside and outside the law provided a model which was to become central to the political repertoire of black activism up and down this country’.33 The campaigns and struggles included self-defence groups against racist violence, defence and support groups for particular people victimised by police and the justice system, and local groups established to monitor police.34 There was also the use of independent, community driven inquiries after serious confrontations and

## Defund the Police

deaths had occurred at the hands of the police. This was a direct response to the limitations of ocial inquiries or the refusal by the state to hold any inquiry. After the SPG killing of Blair Peach, the National Council for Civil Liberties established an inquiry into his death and the policing of Southall during the anti-fascist demonstration of April 1979. As Sim et al note: ‘The Inquiry documented a chilling picture of uncontrolled state violence towards legitimate demonstrators whose primary motivation was to protect their community from a racist presence on their streets.’35 During the 1980s, local councils also established independent inquiries into policing, for example, in London and Birmingham. These Inquiries documented people’s experiences with the police. In Tottenham: ‘Witness after witness to our Inquiry spoke of the indignities which they suered at the hands of the police ocers for no other reason that they were Black. The bitterness of their experience was shared by old and young, men and women, professional people and unemployed.’36 In discussing the period of the 1990s, a key moment was the racist murder of Black teenager Stephen Lawrence in London in April
1993. He was killed by a White racist gang that were known for
other attacks in the area. The events following Stephen’s murder included the establishment of the Stephen Lawrence Campaign and the subsequent Macpherson Inquiry which reported in
1999.37 Macpherson concluded that there were fundamental
police errors in the murder investigation which was ‘marred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership by senior ocers’.38 The Inquiry echoed the words of the evidence of Black Church Leaders, ‘the experiences of black people over the last 30 years has been that we have been over-policed and to a large extent under-protected’.39 The aftermath of police corruption, incompetence, and racism in responding to the racist killing of Stephen Lawrence was to reverberate for decades. It was not until 2012 that two of the ve perpetrators were convicted for murder. The legacy of Stephen Lawrence’s death lived on in other ways. In 2013 Peter Francis, a former police ocer with the ‘Special Demonstration Squad’, revealed that while working undercover in an anti-racist campaign group, his superiors constantly pressured him to nd ‘dirt’ and ‘disinformation’ that could be used to smear the reputations of

## The protest movement never stopped

the Lawrence family and supporters, and to undermine their campaign. Senior ocers also withheld information from the Macpherson Inquiry about his undercover role.40 In the longer term, the importance of the Stephen Lawrence Campaign was critical. Adam Elliot-Cooper acknowledges that the campaign was both a search for justice by the family, and ‘also a movement of resistance which took on the most powerful state institutions, forcing London’s Metropolitan Police to concede publicly their own institutional racism in the face of irrefutable evidence and widespread community support’.41 The Campaign resulted in a range of community outcomes, including the Stephen Lawrence Centre in south London; the Stephen Lawrence Trust focused on education, and a Stephen Lawrence Research Centre at De Montfort University. Doreen Lawrence, Stephen’s mother, was made a Peer and sits in the House of Lords. She continues her work on social justice. In 2018, the government announced that 22 April would be recognised annually as Stephen Lawrence Day – although as shown in Chapter 5, police violence and racism continues. There are two nal points in this discussion on the recent history of policing in Britain. One is the debate which emerged (especially in the 1980s) among the Left on questions of reformism and abolitionism which, while bound by its historical milieu, is still relevant today in the discussions of Defund the Police. Those who adopted a liberal, reformist position on police and the state, emphasised that crime was a problem for working class communities which needed to be addressed, and further, that reform of the police and criminal justice system was capable of achieving that outcome. Those on the Left who understood the limitations of reform were disparagingly described as abolitionists and ‘idealists’.42 Yet the reformist position failed to address the profound impact of institutional racism and the intersections of class and race. Despite the weight of historical evidence, the extreme state violence evident in Britain during the 1980s and the social and political authoritarianism of the Thatcher Conservative government, reformists argued that the police could be made accountable to the community, that increasing militarisation could be stopped, and public condence restored. History was not kind to the reformist position. New Labour came to power in 1997 with a ‘Tough on Crime, Tough

## Defund the Police

on the Causes of Crime’ slogan, and a further strengthening of the law and order agenda. The second point concerns community activism and is drawn from the analysis of the Stephen Lawrence Campaign by ElliotCooper and his observation that ‘almost every campaign calling for justice following a Black death at the hands of the police is led by a woman’, a mother, a partner, a sister.43 He makes the point that Doreen Lawrence and her campaign for justice for her son was to inuence how subsequent campaigns approached grassroots community building, protest, the court system, and the mainstream media. In addition, he acknowledges the role of Black feminism in seeing the family as a potential source of strength, as a space or site of resistance against racism, rather than primarily as a site of oppression.44 We see something akin to this in the role First Nations families played in the public campaigns over police killings in Australia from the 1980s onwards and the role of Black and First Nations women in the BLM movement in the US. It is also a demonstration of the strength of Black, Indigenous, people of colour, and working-class familial relations which runs counter to the dominant racialised discourses (media, academic, political) of dysfunction, violence, and criminality.

## Aboriginal deaths in custody: Australia

In Australia during the 1980s, there was renewed concern over First Nations deaths in prison, and particularly in police custody. One of the most notorious killings was 16-year-old John Pat who was beaten to death by police in Roebourne, Western Australia in 1983. Five police ocers were charged, stood trial, and were acquitted by an all-White jury. Other Aboriginal deaths which captured media attention included Eddie Murray, Charlie Michael, Dixon Green, and Robert Walker. The number of Indigenous deaths in custody appeared to be increasing (although no-one was sure at the time of the exact number), many in suspicious circumstances, including the deaths of Mark Quayle and Lloyd Boney in police cells in NSW. The community-based Committee to Defend Black Rights (CDBR) estimated in 1987 that one Aboriginal person was dying in custody in Australia every 11 days.

## The protest movement never stopped

Key Aboriginal organisations including the ALS and the CDBR, along with the families of those who had died in custody and supporters, pressured the Australian government both domestically and internationally to establish an inquiry. The CDBR was especially important: it was a national organisation comprised of family members of Aboriginal people who had died in custody. It organised three national conferences of family members which focused on political action, as well as cultural expressions of family who had died in custody through poetry, artwork, and music. Like the involvement of Black women noted previously in Britain, Aboriginal women were key activists in the struggle. The CDBR organised a national speaking tour of family members, and also continued with direct political lobbying. International pressure on the Australian federal government to establish an inquiry into deaths in custody also mounted. From the mid-1980s, Amnesty International began to critically comment on Australia’s record on Aboriginal custodial deaths. Then in August 1987, foreshadowing the language of the BLM movement, the chairperson of the CDBR, Yawaru and Bibbleman woman Helen Corbett, addressed the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations in Geneva:
     The Australian Government must implement a federal
     Royal Commission to inquire into these deaths, to
     show that it strongly believes that Aboriginal lives are
     worth the same as the rest of the Australian population
     … these deaths of Indigenous people in custody show
     that our rights are not respected, that racism exists with
     disastrous eects on our families and that we cannot
     trust Australia’s justice system.45
In the weeks following Helen Corbett’s address in Geneva, the Australian government announced the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCADIC). The Royal Commission investigated 99 Aboriginal deaths and made 339 recommendations. It reported in 1991. Most deaths occurred in police custody and most of these involved people held for minor public order oences. Those who died had early and repeated contact with the criminal legal system: in almost half

## Defund the Police

of the deaths the person had been removed as a child from their families by welfare authorities, and a similar proportion had been criminalised before they were 15 years old.46 Broadly speaking, the recommendations focused on three areas: reducing the number of Aboriginal people in police and prison custody through various reforms to law, policy, and practice; addressing the social and economic underlying issues that brought Aboriginal people into contact with the justice system; and putting into eect the principle of Indigenous self-determination. The RCADIC identied the institutionalised and systemic racism by police directed against Aboriginal people. The Commission recommended prosecutors consider criminal charges arising from some deaths, however no-one was ever charged with a criminal oence. The absence of prosecutions led to a profound disappointment in the outcomes of the RCADIC. There were cases such as the death of David Gundy who was shot dead in his bedroom by SWOS police in an unlawful police raid. The Director of Public Prosecutions declined to prosecute ocers – although NSW Police did make an ex-gratia payment to his widow and young son. The Commission found that many deaths occurred because custodial authorities failed in their responsibility to exercise a duty of care, such as checking cells regularly, ensuring prescribed medicines were available, and facilitating proper medical treatment. There were some successful civil claims made by the families of the deceased against police, but there were no state criminal prosecutions. During the 1980s and into the 1990s, there were regular reports in Aboriginal communities of civil unrest generated by police violence and discrimination. This conict was exacerbated through the establishment of paramilitary police groups – the Tactical Response Group (TRG) in NSW and Western Australia and similar groups in other states. These paramilitary police squads grew in size and expanded operational duties particularly in the policing of Aboriginal communities. For example, a signicant paramilitary operation occurred in early 1990 with 135 police in a pre-dawn raid on a number of Aboriginal houses in the inner Sydney suburb of Redfern. Although the search for drugs was the ocial justication for the raid, no drugs were ever located. Senior police ocers also provided racist justications for the

use of paramilitary police – describing the community as ‘all one breed’ where normal policing operations were ineective. The Federal Race Discrimination Commissioner described the police raid as ‘a signicant act of racist violence’.47 In 1991, the Australian Human Rights Commission reported on its inquiry into racist violence. The Commission found that ‘Aboriginal-police relations had reached a critical point due to widespread involvement of police in acts of racist violence, intimidation and harassment’.48 During the 1990s there were several independent reviews of the post-RCADIC situation. One review found that in more recent Indigenous deaths in custody were numerous ongoing breaches of Royal Commission recommendations.49 Another review found a failure on the part of governments to adequately address recommendations to reform the criminal legal system, and many recommendations were being undermined by the political shift during the 1990s to a more punitive approach to law and order.50 Several reviews noted the ongoing and widespread complaints about violent, racist, and inappropriate police behaviour, the prevalence of racist attitudes and institutional racism in the police.51 Amnesty International also continued with its criticisms of Australia during the 1990s. In 1993 it found, among other things, that conditions in certain police and prison facilities amounted to cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment. For example, that Aboriginal men had been forced, through lack of water, to drink from toilet bowls while they were held in police cells. It also found that the families of Aboriginal people who had died in custody, and who were engaged in public activism over these deaths, were subject to police harassment.52 A further Amnesty report in 1997 conrmed systemic discrimination and ill-treatment by police and sometimes serious deciencies in the standard of custodial care.53 During the early years of the new millennium, political activism and collective anger continued over the ongoing high incarceration rates and deaths in custody of First Nations peoples, and lack of movement in implementing the recommendations from the RCADIC. Deaths in Custody Watch Committees had grown out of the earlier work of the CDBR in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In addition, Indigenous Social Justice Associations were established in Sydney and Melbourne. These groups continued with their support, activism, and advocacy

work, often led by family members of those who had died in custody. The anger and frustration at the lack of accountability were vented through protests and sometimes riots and uprisings. For example, the uprising on Palm Island (Queensland) reected the depth of Indigenous community anger at police violence and injustice. In November 2004, Cameron Doomadgee died in police custody on Palm Island after being arrested for a minor public order oence. Post-mortem results revealed that he had been violently assaulted by police, suffering four broken ribs, a ruptured spleen, and his liver almost cleaved in two. A protest riot occurred after Doomadgee’s death, and the local police station and courthouse were set on re and extensively damaged. Dozens of riot police were own to the Island. The White police ocer responsible for the death was charged, tried, and acquitted of manslaughter. Aboriginal people involved in the subsequent uprising were charged, convicted, and some received substantial terms of imprisonment. After a long activist campaign and legal battle against the police and state government relating to racial discrimination, in May 2018 the Queensland government settled a class action with 447 claimants from the Palm Island community for $30 million.54 It was not justice, but it was some vindication of the community’s struggle.
Penal abolition and mass imprisonment: North America
During the 1980s and 1990s, First Nations political pressure within Canada led to the establishment of various inquiries into Aboriginal justice issues and particularly police treatment of First Nations peoples. These included the Nova Scotia Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall, Jr., Prosecution (1989), the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba (1991), and the Canadian Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996). These inquiries recognised the importance of Indigenous selfdetermination. Further, all the inquiries made ndings in relation to the problem of systemic discrimination or institutional racism in the treatment of First Nations people by the criminal legal system. Activists in Canada also played a signicant role in building the global abolitionist movement. In the early 1980s, the Canadian

## The protest movement never stopped

Quaker Committee on Jails and Justice promoted the idea of an international forum on abolitionist praxis, which resulted in the ICOPA (the International Conference on Prison Abolition). The rst conference was held in 1983 in Toronto. Subsequently, ICOPA has continued to meet every couple of years in locations across the world. Black communities in Canada also organised against police violence during the 1980s and 1990s. In Toronto, the Black Action Defence Committee was formed after a number of police killings. As was the case in other countries, the family members of those killed were subjected to police surveillance and harassment.55 The burgeoning US carceral state resulted by the end of the 1990s and early 2000s in millions of people jailed and the highest national imprisonment rate in the world. Critiques of policing in the US were part of the social movements that developed to challenge Reagan’s and George Bush Snr’s war on drugs and the associated racially discriminatory legislation that led to massive imprisonment of racialised peoples. The Clinton and G.W. Bush periods of neo-liberalism and the war on terror furthered these trends of punitive law and order policies. Opposition to police violence, violence against women and against the LGBTQIA+ community, racism, and Islamophobia were foundational to the critiques of policing. Barbara Ransby in her discussion of the contemporary rise of the BLM movement and the M4BL in the US shows that there has been a continuity in community organising and activism from the 1970s to the present – led by a Black feminist politics which has been ‘the intellectual lifeblood of this movement and its practices’.56 Robin D.G. Kelley nominates many of the key activist organisations in the US that have maintained the struggle against police violence and promoted abolitionism for more than two decades, including (to name only some) SistaIISista (established 1996), Critical Resistance (established 1997), and INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence (established 2000).57 These movements laid the foundations for current ideas on abolition and defunding the police. Critical Resistance was formed by activists challenging the idea that policing and imprisonment was a solution for social, political, and economic problems. In 1998, Critical Resistance organised a conference which brought together over

## Defund the Police

3,500 activists, academics, former and current prisoners, labor and religious leaders, feminists, and LGBTQIA+ activists from across the US and internationally. Women played a foundational role in Critical Resistance.58 In 2001, Critical Resistance and INCITE! jointly called on ‘social justice movements to develop strategies and analysis that address both state and interpersonal violence, particularly violence against women’ and to ‘develop responses to gender violence that do not depend on a sexist, racist, classist, and homophobic criminal justice system’.59 In 2008 they published an organiser’s resource and tool kit on police brutality and other forms of law enforcement violence. It contained strategies and ideas for documenting and organising against police violence and ‘for building responses to violence in our communities that don’t rely on law enforcement’.60 SistaIISista was formed in Brooklyn in the context of the rise of zero tolerance policing. In the early 2000s, their work increasingly focused on racialised and gendered state and interpersonal violence. After the murder and rape, as well as police shootings of young women of colour in Brooklyn, the organisation created Sistas Liberated Ground as a place where ‘violence against women would not be tolerated’.61
Zero tolerance policing: reasserting the legitimacy of state violence The focus in this chapter thus far has been on community activism against police violence and the changing nature of policing in the post-1960s period. In drawing the discussion towards a conclusion, it is important to identify the nature and spread of zero tolerance policing (ZTP). Its origin and most immediate impact was in New York City. As Nicole Burrowes from SistaIISista recognised:
     In 1994, Rudolph Guiliani was the mayor, and we
     were watching the city transform beneath our feet.
     ‘Broken windows’ policing and ‘law- and- order’
     policies made the city less liveable for many of us
     as it meant an increase in arrests, surveillance, racial
     proling, and harassment in communities of color
     but did not lead to a corresponding increase in safety
     or justice.62

## The protest movement never stopped

ZTP impacted heavily as a strategy and de facto justication for the use of police harassment and violence against poor and marginalised communities – not only in New York City where it was aggressively adopted by Mayor Giuliani and Police Commissioner Bratton, but also in other US states and internationally. It became a beacon for police commissioners and politicians from around the world including other parts of the Americas, Britain, Australia, South Africa, and Europe. The idea behind ZTP was that a strong law enforcement approach to minor crime (in particular public order oences) would prevent more serious crime from occurring and ultimately lead to falling crime rates. The approach relied on an analogy drawn by Wilson and Kelling regarding ‘broken windows’. If one broken window is not repaired in a building, others will be broken and the building vandalised, followed by other buildings, then the street, the neighbourhood, and so on. An unrepaired window is a sign that no-one cares and therefore more damage will occur.63 Similarly, if disorderly behaviour is not dealt with, then more serious crime will result. Small ‘incivilities’ such as public drunkenness, vandalism, begging, and so forth create an atmosphere where more serious crime can ourish. In the decades after Wilson and Kelling articulated the ‘broken windows’ approach, the ZTP philosophy moved towards a more punitive approach to maintaining public order. The idea of negotiating acceptable public behaviour at the local level – which was in the original Wilson and Kelling proposition – was dropped, and instead ZTP emerged as a strategy aimed at increasing the use of stop and searches, targeted ‘street sweeping’, and increased arrest rates for disorder – or so-called ‘quality of life’ oences.64 This aggressive vision was captured in Giuliani’s electoral campaign in 1993 of ‘reclaiming the streets’. ZTP locked into the idea that tough policing can work if police are allowed unfettered power to do their job, with minimum oversight by external bodies and maximum legislative discretion to police the streets. It distanced itself from perceived permissive attitudes to crime; it distinguished itself from welfarist explanations of oending behaviour and from notions of community-based policing. ZTP also aligned with the requirements of neo-liberal managerialism: the demand for performance indicators, targeted use of resources, and measurable

## Defund the Police

outcomes. Zero tolerance strategies were geared to performance indicators that were immediately measurable and perfectly understandable to government: arresting people for targeted oences.65 During the 1990s, under ZTP, police numbers rose in New York and arrest rates increased for minor oences: misdemeanour arrests rose by 40 per cent and misdemeanour drug oence arrests rose by 97 per cent between 1993 and 1996. The period also saw a much harder police response to public processions, marches, and rallies – permits were regularly refused and there were complaints of police violence, provocation, widespread arrests, and a refusal to negotiate with organisers. More aggressive public order policing, the routine use of violence,66 and the targeting of minority groups were all indicative of the problems associated with ZTP. Complaints against the police registered with the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) rose sharply after 1993. Meanwhile, the Mollen Commission of Inquiry into corruption in the NYPD in 1994 found police ocers were involved in drug dealing, robberies, assaults, perjury, and falsication of records. It also found a failure by the NYPD to discipline ocers accused of violence. A 1996 investigation into the NYPD by Amnesty International revealed that more than two thirds of the cases of police brutality involved Black or Latinx complainants. Most of the police ocers involved were White. In the cases of deaths in custody reviewed by Amnesty, nearly all of the victims were members of racial minorities. Human Rights Watch noted in a 1998 report that there was ‘continuing impunity for many ocers who commit human rights violations’ and that ‘there is often a racial or ethnic component to police abuse cases in New York City’.67 ZTP is a simple proactive crime control strategy: arrest more people to reduce crime. It locked into a powerful populist rhetoric of tougher approaches to law and order and legitimated heavy handed policing strategies against minorities. It provided a bridge between old style ‘machismo’ police crackdowns on racialised and other groups, with the demands of a managerialism besotted with easily measurable performance indicators. It combined with ‘hot spot’ and saturation policing to make a ‘science’ of repressive policing strategies. Indeed, internationally, ZTP tted with growing xenophobia and racism in a range of countries. In parts

of Europe, zero tolerance approaches were linked by both the far-Right and more moderates with strategies to control asylum seekers and ‘foreigners’.68 In Australia, zero tolerance was seen as most attractive in states with large Indigenous populations and in major cities with racialised and criminalised minorities such as Arabic and Vietnamese communities. Zero tolerance policing signalled a revalorisation of the politics of intolerance – and not just in New York and the US.

## Conclusion

The contemporary calls to defund the police reflect the generational struggles against police violence and racism, from the late 1960s through to the present. Fighting against police violence was foundational – hence Sivanandan’s reection that the history of Black struggles in the 1970s is the story of struggle against police. His observation applies beyond Britain and that particular decade. These movements were often internationalist in their outlook, while simultaneously committed to local community empowerment and meeting community needs. The struggle against police violence gave rise to new forms of community-based organisations and resistance against police violence and racism – these often involved the families of people killed by police and/or White racists and were often led by Indigenous, Black, and women of colour. Some of these interventions used the formal system in calling for criminal prosecutions, and/or the establishment of royal commissions and other types of formal inquiries. Outside the justice system, there was systematic political lobbying, the use of media, public protest, and the mobilisation of community support. There was the use of the cultural expressions of the people who had been killed by the state through poetry, artwork, and music, and there were the larger intersections of music, youth culture, and political protest quintessentially captured in Rock Against Racism. At the same time, policing was changing with the adoption of new more heavily armed and equipped paramilitary police units. There was renewed ideological justification through ZTP for heavy-handed policing of minor public order oences which also reinforced and justied racially discriminatory use of

saturation policing and stop and searches. Underpinning this was the constant outrage at ongoing police killings, particularly of Black, Indigenous, and people of colour. Finally, we might ponder another continuity: in 2017, the FBI developed the term ‘Black Identity Extremism’ (BIE) to describe the BLM movement and Black activism. It was grouped with White Supremacy Extremism as an equivalent threat of racially motivated violent extremism. According to Kimberlé Crenshaw, ‘these allegedly equivalent tendencies were treated as a threat on par with ISIS, justifying a major programme of surveillance, investigation, and inltration’.69
        Police violence is the pandemic
Widespread outrage at police violence, fatal shootings, and deaths in police custody created the current international protest movements and calls to defund the police. However, as shown in previous chapters, there is a long history to protests against police violence, and there are multiple movements to change policing globally which draw on localised contexts. Police violence is experienced at a local level, however, it has global reach and is pervasive to the institution. It directly costs the lives of tens of thousands of people annually – and many more if we include the numbers of forced disappearances – and leaves incalculable numbers of people with permanent injuries and disabilities. The victims are overwhelmingly from the most marginalised communities whether dened by race, religion, class, Indigeneity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, citizenship or immigration status, and their various and compounding intersections. One of the main causes of death, disability, and injury for people deprived of their liberty are the acts of violence and use of force by police and other state agents.1 This chapter sets out what we know about the nature and context of police violence, shootings, and deaths in police custody – including overt violence and the violence of neglect – and it attempts to do so with reference to contexts of both the global north and south. It considers some of the wider drivers which are international but impact on domestic policing such as expanded militarisation, the impact of the war on drugs and the intersection of policing with security forces, border control, and other law enforcement bodies.

## Defund the Police

## Police killings and deaths in police custody

A dening feature of policing is state-sanctioned legitimacy for the use of force and violence, including lethal violence, against citizens. The importance of police discretion was discussed previously in Chapter 3. Police discretion extends to the use and intensity of violence. Notwithstanding the fundamental importance of a state-sanctioned decision to end someone’s life or seriously maim them, it is dicult to get a handle on the overall size of the problem of police violence, killings, or police custodial deaths. Most countries do not publish comprehensive national information, so the estimates are left to media, human rights, and other non- government organisations. A further problem is that even where governments do provide data, there are widely inconsistent reporting requirements and denitions that make international comparisons dicult.2 Dylan Rodriguez has argued that the absence of ‘accessible, coordinated data about the casualties of police violence composes an infrastructure of oﬃcial ignorance’. The absence of information is not a failure of states but rather part of the infrastructure of police power that obscures ‘the evidence of everyday police terror and its various forms of atrocity’.3 It enables plausible deniability. The US government fails to publish reliable national data on police violence, killings, and deaths in custody. In 2015, the Washington Post started to count every fatal shooting by an onduty police ocer. The newspaper began the Fatal Force database when it became clear there was no consistent national information after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. The FBI data is based on self-reports of justiable homicides by police and is voluntarily provided by some law enforcement agencies in the US. It undercounts the number of police fatal shootings by more than 50 per cent. According to the Washington Post data, police shootings remain steady at around 1,000 per year (1,055 in 2021). The database shows that more than half the people fatally shot by police are White. However, given their population size, Black Americans are fatally shot more than twice the rate and Latinx at slightly less than twice the rate of White Americans.4 Similar undercounting (by 55 per cent over a 40-year period) has been estimated from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention

## Police violence is the pandemic

(CDC) data on reported deaths by law enforcement, including non-rearm related deaths. The burden of these deaths falls on Black, First Nations, and Hispanic peoples – the rate of deaths for Black Americans was found to be 3.5 times higher than Whites.5 The rate of police killings also varies across the country and by race/ethnicity. In the Chicago metropolitan area for example, Black people were killed at 6.5 times the rate of White people.6 Despite the CDC estimates, little is known about deaths in police custody which arise in other situations – such as untreated medical conditions, trauma-related injuries, or suicide. In England and Wales, the community- based organisation INQUEST maintains a database on deaths in police custody. In 2020 it recorded 39 deaths, of which three were the result of police shootings, two occurred in road trac incidents, 14 during a police pursuit, and a further 20 while in custody. INQUEST’s analysis of 20 years of data found that ‘Black, Asian and Minoritised Ethnicities (BAME) die disproportionately as a result of use of force or restraint by the police, raising serious questions of institutional racism as a contributory factor in their deaths’.7 In 2017 a government-commissioned review of deaths and serious incidents in police custody found that ‘the disproportionately high number of deaths of black men in restraint-related deaths, often in contentious circumstances, is a serious issue’.8 Similarly in Aotearoa New Zealand, a review of the period 2000–2010 found that almost half the deaths in police custody involved Māori (who comprise about 15 per cent of the general population). Thirty per cent of Māori deaths occurred while being restrained by police, which was three times higher than the proportion of deaths of people from a ‘European’ background.9 In Australia, government data shows 24 deaths in police custody for the 12 months ending June 2020. Of the 24 deaths, 16 were fatal police shootings – they are obviously a signicant cause of deaths in police custody. Further, First Nations people are more than ve times more likely to die in police custody than nonIndigenous people.10 The Guardian newspaper established the Dying Inside database which covers First Nations deaths in police and prison custody from 2008 to the present and provides far more detail of the person and their death than ocial accounts.11 The Canadian Broadcasting Commission has established a Deadly

## Defund the Police

Force database to overcome the absence of ocial data on police killings and ‘fatal encounters’ where police used force. It does not include in-custody deaths, self-inicted wounds as a result of suicide or attempts to evade police, or accidental police-caused deaths (such as trac accidents). It currently covers the period from 2000 to mid 2020. The database shows that the rate of deaths has continued to rise over the past 20 years. Furthermore, Black and Indigenous people are disproportionately represented among the fatalities. Based on their population, Indigenous people are nearly four times and Black people nearly three times more likely to die in police fatal encounters. In 2019 there were 34 fatal encounters with police.12 An analysis of the database between 2000 and 2017 showed 70 per cent of fatal encounters involved a police shooting.13 The data is unequivocal in showing that Black, Indigenous, and people of colour are over-represented in police shootings, restraints, and other deaths in the countries just discussed. As discussed in Chapter 3, the Prison Policy Initiative has drawn some comparisons on police killings (primarily based on fatal shootings) across ten countries of the global north.14 The US is an outlier for police killing civilians with a rate more than three times higher than Canada and four times higher than Australia. However, Canadian and Australian police (who routinely carry rearms) have higher rates than other countries in the Prison Policy Initiative comparative group. Other research shows there is no clear evidence ‘that arming police automatically or necessarily makes them or the community safer’.15 The dierences raise many questions, not the least of which is the relationship between routinely armed police and the level of police fatal shootings, as well as the use of community-based and public health alternatives to police custody.
The war on drugs in the global south: Brazil and the Philippines
The incidence of police killing of civilians can take on qualitatively dierent dimensions when we consider the experiences of parts of the global south. As noted in Chapter 1, Brazilian police killed nearly six times the number of civilians compared to the US – despite having a national population only two thirds the size of the US – and Brazil is by no means the worst in Latin America.16 Outside of Latin America and compared to Brazil, the

## Police violence is the pandemic

problem of police killings has a similar, if not greater, magnitude in the Philippines. Both the Philippines and Brazil provide a window on the eect of the war on drugs on policing and violence. Further, both the Philippines and Brazil highlight the problem of where we place the role of police acting as vigilantes in conducting state condoned and/or encouraged extrajudicial killings – seeing them as ‘o duty’ and acting in their individual capacity seems disingenuous. In the Philippines, then President Duterte launched the ‘war on drugs’ in 2016, and publicly encouraged the extrajudicial killing of drug users. The Philippines Commission on Human Rights estimated in late 2018 that the number of drug-war killings could be as high as 27,000 and there were reports of local police forces being given targets to meet in terms of deaths.17 In September 2021 the International Criminal Court (ICC) ordered an investigation into the killings associated with Duterte’s war. The ICC said the initial evidence indicated that killings were not the result of legitimate law enforcement operations and that a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population took place. The prosecutor’s preliminary investigation found a reasonable basis to believe that the crime against humanity of murder has been committed in the Philippines between July 2016 and March 2019 when the Philippines withdrew from the ICC.18 Like the Philippines, the broader context for police killings in Brazil is the ‘war on drugs’ – which itself has led to a distorting, if not collapsing, of distinctions between police and military roles. In Rio de Janeiro in early May 2021, some 200 heavily armed police, supported by helicopters, moved into a poor, densely populated favela and engaged in a reght with alleged drug trackers that killed at least 25 people. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an independent investigation of the incident.19 Similar police massacres in Rio’s favelas have continued through 2022.20 The use of helicopters armed with snipers have been a feature of policing in Rio since at least 2018 when the city’s security was given to military commanders, ‘who assumed operational control of the police and also deployed troops in the favelas’.21 In recent years, the State Governor as well as then President Bolsonaro have both openly promoted deadly violence against “criminals” who, according to the President, would “die

like cockroaches”. The number of people killed by police in Rio has been rising steadily from around 1,000 deaths in 2016 to 1,800 annually by 2019. Across Brazil, police killings have also been going up, jumping by 20 per cent in 2018 to 6,220, then increasing to 6,357 in 2019. By the rst half of 2020 they had risen a further 6 per cent.22 These gures do not include extrajudicial killings by death squads. Police killings have sparked various movements since the late 1970s including the Unied Black Movement Against Racial Discrimination (MNU-CDR, later the MNU), and the Reaja ou Será Mortx (React or Die) which has been active over the last decade ghting against police violence and the genocide of Black people, and shares similar messages to the BLM movement. The ‘war on drugs’ was introduced into Latin America because of international pressure, and more specically in many countries in the region as a condition for US economic assistance and trade. Highly punitive drug laws, more heavily militarised policing, and growing prison numbers were the result. The ‘war’ has fallen most heavily on poor Black and Indigenous communities.23 Drug-related policing focuses on drug users and small drug dealers and has had little impact on the drug tracking chains. Police also exercise substantial discretionary power over whether a person is prosecuted for drug use or drug tracking.24 Like the comparisons that can be drawn within the global north, there is essentially a parallel system of law enforcement operating based on class and race: ‘Though recreational drug use is in eect already decriminalised in wealthy, white-majority enclaves of Brazil, going about your business in a black-majority neighborhood during a raid can get you killed.’25
Torture, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances: India,
## Bangladesh, and Pakistan

The use of torture by police to extract confessions and bribes and to impose summary punishment is commonplace in many countries, and provides another consideration in understanding the problems of police violence and deaths in custody. The major South Asian countries of India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan provide examples.26 HRW identied 591 deaths in police custody in

## Police violence is the pandemic

India between 2010 and 2015, the National Campaign Against Torture (NCAT) reported 125 deaths in police custody in 2019, while the National Human Rights Commission reported 77 deaths in police custody and 62 alleged extrajudicial killings by police in the rst 10 months of 2020.27 The torture of people in custody by police is recognised as a major problem in India. In 2016, HRW found that ‘police still often torture suspects to punish them, gather information, or coerce confessions’ and do so with continuing impunity.28 More recently, the National Human Rights Commission noted that ‘custodial violence and torture is so rampant in India that it has become almost routine’, while the NCAT found that the police practice of torturing suspects constituted the primary cause of deaths in police custody.29 India has not ratied the UN Convention Against Torture. NCAT indicated in relation to the 125 deaths it reported in 2019, that 74 per cent of people died during police custody due to ‘alleged torture/foul play’, while a further 19 per cent died under suspicious circumstances. In addition, the NCAT indicated that the armed forces (the Indian Army and the Central Armed Police Forces) who are deployed in insurgency aected areas and border areas, and have the power to take persons into custody, were the subject of many reported cases of torture and sexual violence.30 Further, Forest Department ocials were also responsible for torture, sexual violence, and killing, particularly of Adivasi (tribal) peoples.31 Irrespective of whether they are the victims of police, security forces, or other government agencies, the majority of torture victims come from poor and marginalised communities, including Dalit, Adivasi, and Muslim minorities. It is not uncommon for police to destroy incriminating evidence of torture by not conducting mandatory post-mortem examinations and quickly cremating the bodies of torture victims.32 Women continued to be tortured or targeted for sexual violence in custody, and children, because of poor implementation of juvenile justice legislation, continue to be illegally detained in police stations and subjected to torture. The NCAT documented the deaths of four children arising from police torture in 2019. In addition, the NCAT identied multiple cases of police torture of men, women, and children where the victims survived, and also the police rape of

## Defund the Police

women and children (including a child with a disability, and the sexual assault of a 7-year-old boy).33 The Chief Justice of India, Nuthalapati Ramana, publicly called out the nation’s police stations as the most signicant threat to human rights and bodily integrity. According to the Chief Justice, ‘custodial torture and other police atrocities … still prevail’ and fall disproportionately on the poor.34 A recent survey of over 12,000 police personnel in 21 Indian states indicated some commonly held police views which justied the use of violence. The survey reported that:

- four in every ve police believed ‘there was nothing wrong
with beating up criminals to extract a confession’;
- three in every four police felt that ‘police violence towards
criminals was justied’;
- one in ve police felt that ‘killing dangerous criminals was
better than a legal trial’; and
- one in ve police would not advise their own daughter to
attend a police station alone to report a crime.
In addition, two in ve police thought that ‘common people’ were hesitant to approach police even when there was a need.35 In neighbouring Bangladesh, deaths in police custody from torture, the frequency of extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances by police have been criticised by the UN Committee against Torture, HRW, and Bangladeshi policing scholars. The UN Committee recognised the allegations of widespread and routine use of torture and ill-treatment by police for the purpose of obtaining confessions or soliciting bribes. The Committee also noted the ‘numerous, consistent reports’ that law enforcement agencies have ‘arbitrarily deprived persons of their liberty, subsequently killed many of them and failed to disclose their whereabouts or fate’.36 The Committee particularly drew attention to the Rapid Action Battalion, which is comprised of police and military personnel, and has been responsible for committing torture, arbitrary arrests, undocumented detention, disappearances, and extrajudicial killings of people in their custody. Despite their reputation, the Battalion has received training from British police.37 According to HRW, and supported by other observers, extrajudicial killings and disappearances are committed ‘with near

## Police violence is the pandemic

complete impunity’ in Bangladesh.38 In addition, the frequency of forced disappearances has been increasing in recent years.39 Mistreatment and torture is not conned to adults. Children interviewed in youth detention revealed they were subjected to physical torture by police including electric shocks and beatings, as well as threats of violence and the production of false statements and confessions.40 In Pakistan there are numerous reports by human rights groups of police extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, detention without charge, torture of detainees to obtain confessions, biased investigations, failure to investigate crimes, corruption, harassment and extortion of individuals, incompetence, and lack of professionalism.41 Despite its obligation under the UN Convention against Torture, Pakistan has failed to enact legislation criminalising torture. HRW noted that:
     Several police ocers who spoke to Human Rights
     Watch openly admitted to the practice of false or faked
     ‘encounter killings’ in which police stage an armed
     exchange to kill an individual already in custody. …
     Police are rarely held accountable for these killings and
     families of victims are deterred from ling complaints
     against police out of fear of harassment or being
     accused of false charges.42
The National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) acknowledged the broad estimates of forced disappearances in Pakistan: Defence of Human Rights reported more than 5,000 cases of disappearances that were not resolved, while the Voice of Baloch Missing Persons identied that since 2001, some 18,000 people have been forcibly disappeared from Balochistan (the poorest province in Pakistan where there is also a separatist movement). The NCHR observed that not a single perpetrator has been held criminally accountable for an enforced disappearance in Pakistan and that the appeal to ‘national security’, although not dened in law, has been used ‘as a cover on many occasions to cover for unlawful acts committed by the personnel of law enforcement agencies’.43 In addition, HRW and the US State Department, among others, have noted that the government

## Defund the Police

has used draconian sedition and counterterrorism laws to stie dissent, and harassed and at times prosecuted human rights activists, lawyers, journalists, and civil society groups for criticising government ocials and policies.44 The US State Department Country Report on Pakistan found that: ‘Kidnappings and forced disappearances of persons took place in nearly all areas of the country. … Human rights organizations reported some authorities disappeared or arrested Pashtun, Sindhi, and Baloch human rights activists, as well as Sindhi and Baloch nationalists without cause or warrant.’45 Public surveys and reports show that the police are among the most feared, complained against, and ‘least trusted government institutions in Pakistan’, lacking accountability and ‘plagued by corruption at the highest levels’. Local police are ‘often under the control of powerful politicians, wealthy landowners, and other inuential members of society’.46 Victims of crime, especially women and those from vulnerable groups, fear approaching a police station because of harassment and poverty – the NCHR has previously indicated that there is a common perception that police will demand bribes before accepting a crime report, subject complainants to abuse, and falsely accuse the complainant of committing the crime.47 Policing scholar Zoha Waseem notes that police violence, excesses, and corruption have led to ‘social movements and civil society resistance borne out of public grievances with publicly punitive and authoritarian styles of policing’.48 An example is the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) that has grown out of opposition to the violence of law enforcement and security forces against the Pashtun and has been fuelled by extrajudicial killings of leading gures including Naqibullah Mehsud in 2018 in a staged counter-terror operation and Arif Wazir shot by unidentied persons in 2020, and the imprisonment of other activists. If we look more broadly across the policing examples referred to in this section, the nature and intensity of the problem of police violence and killings depends on a range of factors including:

- the inuence of ‘war on drugs’ policies and the militarisation
of police;
- the collapsing of police and military functions in the name of
protecting internal (or national) security and ghting crime;

## Police violence is the pandemic

- the extent to which specialist police squads conduct disappearances
and state-sanctioned extrajudicial killings either in the interests of a crime control enforcement policy or as a direct political tool of authoritarian regimes;
- the extent to which police torture is routinised; and
- the extent to which police play a direct role in dispossessing or
controlling local landholders, villagers, and communities who, for whatever reasons, threaten capitalist economic development and its projects.
The list is not exhaustive. Perhaps apart from political repression and the ‘disappearing’ of political opponents, journalists, and activists, the targets of all this violence and corruption are inevitably poor and marginalised communities – whether by way of class, caste, race, Indigeneity, gender, religion and ethnicity, or other status, such as police involvement in the abuse of LGBTQIA+ communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Finally, in this discussion on state violence, we must consider the example of a settler colonial state at war with a colonised, largely dispossessed, and racialised minority. I refer here to the Israeli state’s war against Palestinians which utilises a combination of military, police, and settler terror. The killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians (including children) over the last decade alone has kept Palestinians ‘in a permanent state of terror’.49 The recent state terror in May 2021 showed that military and police violence goes unchecked, while settler vigilante violence against Palestinians receives police protection. As has occurred previously, the use of criminalisation and mass arrests plays an important part of colonial control. It has been noted that a dual process of suppression entails ‘the securitization of crime (treating crime as a security issue) and the criminalization of resistance (treating political mobilization as a criminal issue)’, coupled with enhanced punishments for Palestinians and the use of indenite administrative detention.50
Deaths arising from police interventions for minor offences
Notwithstanding the systematic use of violence against groups of people discussed in the previous section, one of the features of police killings and deaths in police custody is that in many

## Defund the Police

cases, the deaths occur where the initial police intervention is for a seemingly trivial matter – such as Eric Garner in New York (arrested for selling single cigarettes); the so-called Saskatoon ‘freezing deaths’ in Canada during the 1990s and early 2000s when First Nations young people were apprehended for minor public order oences, driven from the city and left by police to die in freezing conditions51; or First Nations deaths in Australia such Cameron Doomadgee (detained for oensive behaviour), Ms Julieka Dhu (detained for unpaid nes), or Adama Traoré in Paris (detained for not having ID). Research over many years strongly supports this nding. A review of deaths in police custody in England and Wales between 1998–1999 and 2008–2009 found that more than half of the 333 deaths involved custody for public order, public drunkenness, driving, and theft oences. Similar results have been found in later studies.52 As noted previously, the RCADIC in Australia found that the majority of deaths of Aboriginal people in police custody involved people held for minor public order oences (such as oensive language or public drunkenness) or being unable to pay nes.53 A review of police fatal shootings of 135 unarmed Black men and women in the US found many of the deaths arose from police interventions for minor oences or from interventions where there was no legal reason for arrest. More than two dozen of the police involved had previous citizen complaints with some relating to the use of force. Some police had also been involved in previous shootings. Of the 135 fatal shootings of unarmed citizens, two police were found guilty of murder, and two were found guilty of manslaughter.54 The apparent senselessness of these deaths adds to the public outrage globally. As indicated in Chapter 1, the violent policing of COVID-19 public health regulations has resulted in children and adults dead in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Police killings often involve innocent bystanders. In Brazil, children have been killed in favelas as collateral damage in police shoot-outs in their ‘war on drugs’ – such as 14-year-old João Pedro Mattos Pinto killed while playing with friends during a botched police raid, or an 8-year-old Ágatha Félix shot dead by police while inside a van travelling with her mother, both in poor areas of Rio de Janeiro.

## Police violence is the pandemic

And it is also important to remember that it was the deaths of young Black teenagers that led to the establishment of resistance movements to police violence and institutional racism – the Committee to Defend Black Rights in Australia after the police killing of 16-year-old John Pat in 1983, the Stephen Lawrence Campaign that led to the Macpherson Inquiry after 17-year-old Stephen’s killing by a White racist gang in 1993, and the Black Lives Matter movement after the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a neighbourhood watch captain in 2012.

## The violence of neglect

Although lethal police violence (particularly fatal shootings) attracts a great deal of public attention, many deaths in police custody occur through inaction and neglect by police – a failure which represents the violence of neglect when authorities fail to exercise their responsibilities and duties. These deaths cannot be written o as accidental or through ‘natural causes’ when there is an active disregard for a detainee’s well-being. When a State deprives a person of their liberty they rob that person of the ability to protect themselves. The State thus assumes a direct responsibility to safeguard the life and bodily integrity of the detainee. The Australian RCADIC found there was a signicant failure by police and correctional authorities to exercise a proper duty of care and this failure directly contributed to or caused numerous Aboriginal deaths in custody. For example, in the RCADIC regional report on southeast Australia it was found that every one of the 18 deaths investigated was potentially avoidable and further that ‘negligence, lack of care, and/or breach of instructions on the part of custodial authorities … played an important role in the circumstances leading to 13 of the 18 deaths investigated’.55 Although the circumstances of police neglect were extensively documented by the RCADIC, more recent deaths in police custody over the last 30 years continue in similar circumstances. For example, Yamatji woman Ms Dhu was in police custody for unpaid nes. She complained to police about severe pain, vomiting, and partial paralysis. She was twice taken to hospital but on both occasions sent back to the police cells. Police told nursing sta she was “faking” her illness. On the third occasion

## Defund the Police

she was taken to hospital she was dying from septicaemia and pneumonia and could not be revived. There are many examples in Australia where people (and particularly First Nations people) have received rough and inappropriate treatment by police and medical sta; inadequate cell checks and supervision; and been denied access to medications and medical services by police. The type of callous disregard for well-being which was so extensively documented by the RCADIC remains a deadly problem today. In an analysis of The Guardian’s database of several hundred First Nations deaths in police and prison custody since the RCADIC, it was found that:

- Police watch-houses, prisons and hospitals failed to follow all of
their own procedures in 41 per cent of cases where Indigenous people died.
- The proportion of Indigenous deaths where medical care was
required at some point, but not given, was 38 per cent.
- Mental health or cognitive impairment was a factor in 42
per cent of deaths in custody, and Indigenous people with a diagnosed mental health condition or cognitive impairment, such as a brain injury or foetal alcohol syndrome disorder, did not receive the care they needed in half the cases.
Police attitudes of neglect were especially prevalent for Indigenous women who were less likely to have received appropriate medical care prior to their death compared with men. Authorities were also less likely to have followed all their own procedures in cases where an Indigenous woman died in custody.56 In England and Wales, the vast majority of deaths arising from police intervention occur while a person is held in a custodial setting, rather than through a police pursuit or shooting. INQUEST data shows that over a 30-year period from 1990 to 2020, police fatal shootings comprised only 4.2 per cent of all deaths compared to 63 per cent in custody and 24 per cent in police pursuits.57 The number of deaths in police custody (other than police shootings or as a result of direct physical violence) is dependent on a range of policies and practices including, to name only some, public health initiatives such as alternatives to arrest and custody, the extent of criminalisation for minor matters, the

## Police violence is the pandemic

frequency of the use of police custody, access to medical assistance, as well as policies governing police pursuits, cell checks and supervision. While there is considerable international focus on police shootings, other factors are also important. Conditions in police detention can play a part in causing death, injury, and disease. Inadequate sanitation, food, water, and overcrowding can impact on detainee’s health – and particularly so during health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The UN Human Rights Council identied the ‘lack of basic medical attention and denial of access to medicine, make otherwise treatable conditions, such as infected wounds, asthma or diabetes, fatal’.58 Poor conditions can also contribute to self-harm and suicide in custody. As noted previously, access to proper healthcare is critical when we know that people coming into police custody have higher rates of poor health, drug dependency, and mental illness than the general population. These problems are further compounded when police engage in physical mistreatment and torture. Indeed, some organisations such as INQUEST in the UK and the NCAT in India also measure the incidence of suicide among people after their release from police custody where the suicide may have been related to custodial experiences or the threat of ongoing state violence.

## Violent responses and use of force

Police regularly use violence in ‘non-fatal’ forms, including police dog attacks, the use of batons, OC (capsicum or pepper) spray, hoods, tasers, the use of restraints and restraint positions,59 and other types of crowd control. Police use of excessive force constitutes an important cause of serious injury and permanent disabilities, and the use of ‘less lethal’ weapons not infrequently results in death. Unfortunately, there is relatively little ocial data published on police use of force – like the problematic reporting on fatalities, the state does not prioritise accurate data on its use of violence against citizens. In the US the Marshall Project recently used data from the CDC to show that from 2015 to early 2021, some 400,000 people were treated in hospital emergency because of violent interactions with police or security guards. However, there is limited nationwide data in the US on the context, nature, or extent of injuries. It is

## Defund the Police

also likely an underestimate of injury when it is police who decide whether to call an ambulance – and the policies and practices governing this decision vary widely among police forces.60 It is well established that police are signicantly more likely to use violence against Black, Indigenous, and people of colour. In England and Wales during 2019–2020 Black people were nearly six times more likely to have force used on them by police than White people. Black people were eight times more likely to be ‘compliant handcued’, and over three times more likely to have a spit and bite hood/guard used on them than White people.61 Sometimes these interventions proved fatal. In the UK, police use of restraint is identied as the cause of death in 10 per cent of cases, while it is used at some stage in 25 per cent of deaths in police custody.62 There have been signicant increases in the use of tasers – with a 500 per cent increase between 2010 and
2019. Police were nearly eight times more likely to use tasers
on Black people than on White people. There has also been more frequent use of tasers against children – over 74 per cent of whom are Black or Minority Ethnic. The UN CROC have called for the prohibition of the use of tasers on children because of the impact on their physical and mental health.63 In New York City, an examination of complaints to the CCRB regarding the NYPD’s use of tasers between 2014 and 2017 showed that 59 per cent of complainants self-identied as Black – which is twice the proportion of their population in the city. Conversely, White complainants were 9 per cent of the total but are 33 per cent of the city’s population.64 In 43 per cent of all complaints, police ocers gave civilians no warning before using a taser. In Aotearoa New Zealand, racialised dierences in the use of police violence are evident. Māori are six times more likely to be handcued, 11 times more likely to be subdued with OC spray, six times more likely to be batoned, nine times more likely to have dogs set on them, ten times more likely to be tasered, and nine times more likely to have rearms drawn compared to Pākehā (non-Māori).65 In Australia, there has been an increasing use of tasers and OC spray as compliance tools, especially on people who are already in custody, and their inappropriate use on children, pregnant women, people with mental health issues, and First Nations people. In NSW, First Nations people comprised 29 per

## Police violence is the pandemic

cent of people tasered, nearly ten times their proportion of the general population. They were also more likely to be subjected to multiple/continued taser use than other groups. A similar over-representation was evident in Queensland in the use of OC spray against First Nations people.66 This increasing use of force by police has occurred as an alternative to the utilisation of deescalation techniques. In some cases, this has led to or contributed to the death of the person in custody. For example, GB died in the Northern Territory after he was subjected to multiple taser applications and bursts of OC spray by police. The man had been taken into custody for a mental health assessment. The coroner found that where the deceased was not armed nor making any threats to kill or cause serious harm, ‘the use of the Taser was premature and inappropriate’.67

## Racial proﬁling and the use of stop and search

In January 2021, several non-government organisations in France led a class action against the French state for racial proling by police. It argued that police identity checks perpetuate ongoing and systemic ethnic proling by targeting individuals of Black and Arab origin. The legal action includes adavits from police ocers which conrm the prevalence of ethnic proling, as well individual statements from individuals who have suered police discrimination and violence. Various research indicates that Black or Arab young men are up to 20 times more likely to be stopped by police.68 The racism behind stop and searches is an international issue. In England and Wales, the racially discriminatory use of stop and search powers by police has been controversial since the introduction of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984, more than 35 years ago. Evidence published since 1995 regularly shows that Black people are consistently between four and nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than White people. In the Inquiry into the racist killing of Stephen Lawrence, Lord Macpherson found that:
     If there was one area of complaint which was universal
     it was the issue of ‘stop and search’. Nobody in
     the minority ethnic communities believes that the

## Defund the Police

     complex arguments which are sometimes used to
     explain the gures as to stop and search are valid. In
     addition, their experience goes beyond the formal stop
     and search gures recorded under the provisions of
     the PACE, and is conditioned by their experiences of
     being stopped under trac legislation, drugs legislation
     and so called ‘voluntary’ stops.69
In 2010, the Equality and Human Rights Commission concluded that racial discrimination was a ‘signicant reason why Black and Asian people are more likely to be stopped and searched than white people’.70 Little has changed. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found that during 2019–2020, Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic people were over four times more likely to be stopped and searched than White people; and for Black people specically, the rate was nearly nine times greater. Over three quarters of searches resulted in ‘no further action’. Drugs searches, particularly for possession, contributed substantially to racial disparity – they comprise around two thirds of all searches under the PACE and Black people are much more likely to be searched by police.71 However, fewer drug searches of Black people result in drugs being found compared to White people. Despite this, because of the large number of searches of Black people, they are 12 times more likely than White people to be prosecuted for cannabis possession in England and Wales.72 Police can also search a person or vehicle for oensive weapons under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Black people are around 18 times more likely to be searched under the legislation than their White counterparts. Only 3.7 per cent of searches result in nding oensive weapons.73 Some US commentators have argued there is no evidence of anti-Black disparity in police shootings because if Black people commit more crimes, then a higher rate of police killings would naturally follow. However, the counter argument has been that if racism and racial proling impact on stop and searches and other police interventions, then the racism in police violence and killings is essentially masked.74 Research in the US shows that disproportionate police violence against Black Americans is driven by systemic racism. Black Americans experience disproportionate levels of police contact, even for crimes that both Black and White

## Police violence is the pandemic

Americans commit at similar rates, such as certain drug oences, and for police interactions, such as investigatory trac stops.75 Under the stop and frisk policy, NYPD ocers regularly stopped and searched hundreds of thousands of people annually. Between January 2004 and June 2012, 4.4 million people were searched, of whom 83 per cent were Black or Latinx. In 2013, a federal judge found the stop and frisk policy to be unconstitutional. The most frequent reason given by police for a stop was ‘furtive movements’ which could include ‘changing direction’, ‘getting a little nervous’, or ‘being very dgety’. Ocers recorded furtive movements in many more stops of Black and Latinx people than White people. Police stops relative to charges and convictions are relatively low – a study of the NYPD stop and frisk programme found that well over 90 per cent of people stopped by the police were not committing any crime and did not have any contraband or weapons on them. Even after the Federal Court decision, racial disparities in police stops continue.76 Black and Latinx women are similarly stopped by police in disproportionate numbers. They also experience racial stereotypes of women of colour as drug couriers, sexually deviant, and/or promiscuous and thus engaged in prostitution-related oences, or as bad mothers and therefore involved in oences related to child welfare.77 These problems are by no means conned to the NYPD. A Department of Justice investigation in 2016 of the Baltimore City Police Department found that the Department engaged in ‘a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the Constitution or federal law’. Specically, ‘making unconstitutional stop, searches and arrests; using enforcement strategies that produce severe and unjustied disparities in the rates of stops, searches and arrests of African Americans; using excessive force; and retaliating against people engaging in constitutionally-protected expression’.78 Nor have the targets of racial proling remained static – in the post9/11 era we can add people of ‘middle eastern appearance’ and suspect populations of ‘illegal immigrants’ to the list.79
On protests, ‘kettling’, and police militarisation
The connections between police, military and war have a history as long as the institution of police, as discussed in Chapter 2. The

## Defund the Police

various convergences during the colonial period with police acting as a military force of occupation, control and dispossession showed that the police have been ‘militarised’ to a greater or lesser extent since their inception, depending on the colonial and domestic context. For this reason, we when talk of the militarisation of police, it is important to recognise this is neither a new nor unique phenomena. The militarisation of police is an ongoing process rather than a specic outcome, it is a continually recurring process that reproduces police power. As Neocleous argues, police power and what he terms ‘war power’ are intertwined and not surprisingly the technologies of state violence are shared.80 However, the specicities and intensity of the ‘sharing’ process varies over time and are contingent on a range of local and geopolitical factors. There have been clear links between the militarisation of policing within the US and the police training and technical assistance oered to regimes globally to suppress popular revolts and enforce political priorities. Shifts towards further militarisation occurred with Reagan and later Bush’s ‘war on drugs’ from the early 1980s, and the post-9/11 ‘war on terror’. Indeed, it has been argued by Harcourt and Schrader, among others, that the model of counterinsurgency which views all citizens as a potential threat to the state has become the paradigm for contemporary policing.81 In the decades post-9/11, various US cities have also sought police training from other countries – particularly from Israel, one of the most violent and repressive settler colonial states.82 Acknowledging the negative eects of this training, ocials in Durham, North Carolina introduced a policy to prevent these international collaborations because it had led domestically to ‘intensifying surveillance and racial proling as well as harsh responses to public protest’.83 In addition, after decades of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has been estimated that nearly one in ve police ocers in the US are military veterans who bring their own training to domestic counterinsurgency.84 The nature and drivers of the militarised response to civil protests in the US and the role of the federal policy in arming police has been well documented and evident well before the policing of the 2020 protests.85 Since its creation in the 1990s, the Department of Defense’s Excess Property Program (or 1033 Program) has transferred military equipment to law enforcement

## Police violence is the pandemic

agencies. In addition, since 9/11, further funding for military equipment to police has been provided by Departments of Homeland Security and Justice programmes for the ‘war on terror’. We are all aware of the outward signs on the street – not just in the US but globally from Lagos to the favelas of Rio – the commando and army fatigues, military-grade weapons, armoured vehicles, helicopters, BearCats, and Humvees. While overt militarisation is evident in police hardware, there are also much deeper inuences on police tactics and use of force. According to Kraska, militarisation permeates through the material, cultural, organisational, and operational characteristics of law enforcement.86 For example, police paramilitary units such as SWAT teams that were modelled on military special operations have become normalised into the everyday functions of policing, and their use has increased dramatically – for example in raiding houses for evidence of small-time drug dealing. Kraska and Williams estimate 80 per cent of SWAT deployments are proactive drug raids. Every year roughly 60,000 of these raids occur, and in 50 per cent of the cases no drugs are located nor are any arrests made. Nearly 50 per cent of the raids are conducted against Black Americans.87 Warrants involving ‘no knock’ or ‘quick knock’ raids are common. Breona Taylor was killed by police in a ‘no knock’ drug raid on her apartment in March 2020 – she was not the target of the raid and the suspect was not at the house. In acknowledgment of the wrongful death, Louisville paid $12 million to Breona’s family in a lawsuit. In relation to the cultural impact of militarisation, Leigh Goodmark has argued that it leads to a ‘militarized masculinity’ which values aggressiveness, force, and violence.88
Protests, containment, and violence
George Floyd’s killing sparked one of the largest protest movements in US history. As has been the case in many countries, notwithstanding that the protests were in direct response to racist police violence, the protesters were met with more state violence.89 According to HRW:
      Tens of millions of protesters went to the streets in
      all 50 states. … The police in many places responded

## Defund the Police

     … with unnecessary and excessive force and other
     abuses: beating up protesters, conducting mass arbitrary
     arrests, and deploying police and national guard
     forces to discourage protests … police used less-lethal
     weapons to disperse protesters, including teargas,
     pepper spray, stun grenades, and rubber bullets –
     sometimes ring directly at protesters, resulting in
     serious injuries. 90
The way the protest movements were policed reected tactics of counter-insurgency containment. The tactic of ‘kettling’ is a premeditated operational decision designed to encircle and trap protesters through forcing them into narrow, conned spaces, and blocking any exit – and then engaging in arbitrary mass arrests often with unnecessary violence. As Neocleous has commented, the ‘kettle is a microcosm of the police war of containment’ deriving from the political and military containment of enemies.91 The police tactic of kettling is used internationally – it was prevalent during the 2020 demonstrations, for example in the UK and Australia. These policing tactical decisions are made at the top of the organisation. A study by HRW of a ‘kettling’ tactic against a demonstration in Mott Haven in the Bronx – where 82 per cent of the population are people of colour, mostly Black or Latinx – found that the decision to block alternative routes, trap protesters, and undertake arbitrary mass arrests was a premeditated plan. The operation was described by the NYPD Commissioner as being ‘executed nearly awlessly in the Bronx [those arrested were] outside agitators … tearing down society [with the] intent to destroy property, to injure cops, and to cause mayhem’.92 In other words, this was a counterinsurgency operation. These are not decisions made by individual police ocers – they are policy formulated by and activated at senior ranks of the police department.93 Perhaps the highest level of direct intervention was when then President Trump ordered the US Marshals Special Operations Group and US Customs and Border Protection’s Border Patrol Tactical Unit to Portland, Oregon to protect federal property. During protests against racism and police brutality, protestors were grabbed o the street in unmarked vans, while

heavily armed law enforcement in military camouage beat people.94 The policing of protesters and protest movements are political decisions. Furthermore, there is a clear asymmetry between the policing of progressive social movements and right-wing extremists/White supremacist movements.95 Indeed, the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol showed both this asymmetry as well as the participation of some police as
## White supremacists.96

## Conclusion

An understanding of the extent and nature of violence by law enforcement agencies is an important driver to the call for defunding the police, and the call to redirect social and economic support to community-based solutions, and eventually moving to police abolition. As indicated earlier, most countries do not publish comprehensive gures on the extent of police violence. In the US, the federal government provides more informative data on the number of livestock in the country than on the number of people who die in police custody – and that is not a problem particular to the US. Despite this, we are able to piece together a frightening picture across much of the world. Police violence is a pandemic for the poor and marginalised globally. We also know that the extent of violence varies. The US is an outlier for police killing civilians in the global north, but the US rate is much lower than many countries in the global south. The war on drugs has facilitated rampant police killings in countries like Brazil and the Philippines – leading to questions of state crimes against humanity. The examples of India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan provide insight into the routine use of torture by law enforcement to extract confessions and bribes, and impose summary punishment, in addition to extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. One feature of deaths in police custody is that in many cases the deaths occur where a trivial matter provides the ocial reason for police intervention. In example after example, these are people engaged in small crimes of survival, or the victims of discriminatory police stop and searches, or they are innocent bystanders. Moreover, deadly violence is also only one part of

## Defund the Police

the story – violence is used in multiple forms from dogs to tasers and chemical and physical restraints. And there is the violence of neglect and indierence where police fail to exercise their responsibilities and duties of care. Inadequate sanitation, food, water, the lack of access to medicine or medical attention – all these lead to unnecessarily fatal or disabling outcomes. What this chapter repeatedly demonstrates is that the targets of law enforcement violence are inevitably poor and marginalised communities, whether by way of class, caste, race, gender, Indigeneity, ability, sexual orientation, religion and ethnicity, or other status. In many cases the targets of police repression represent the ongoing legacies of colonialism, imperialism, and slavery – these legacies intersect across divisions between the global north and south and are prevalent in, for example, Brazil, the US and Australia, where Black and Indigenous peoples are over-represented among the dead. The targets of police repression also intersect with the contemporary demands of local and global elites – the castes, the classes, the Indigenous and tribal peoples, and local communities who threaten capitalist economic development and the prots of the few from South Asia to South America to Africa – these are the victims of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and criminal legal systems that legitimate state violence as a tool of authoritarian regimes. The US ‘war on drugs’and ‘war on terror’have impacted on domestic policing, but their international export has impacted broadly on policing and violence through the training, the sale and supply of armaments, renewed militarisation of police, and a further collapsing of police and military functions in the name of protecting security. One nal point to make is that the social and political forces driving the police use of violence overlap with those driving a more punitive approach to crime and crime control. In addition to policing, these approaches place a heavy reliance on the use of imprisonment – police power and the carceral state are intertwined.

## The protection racket

One of the core public rationales for policing is that it provides a necessary institutional response to protect citizens from crime and to maintain order. This is a powerful rhetoric that plays on people’s fears and insecurities, even where they have witnessed or experienced police violence or the failure of police to provide protection or assistance. This chapter considers perhaps one of the most contested points of argument in calls to defund the police: are police necessary to ensure the safety of women against harassment, violence, and sexual assault, and do they provide these outcomes? It is argued that the evidence shows that police as an institution fail to protect women and this particularly (although not exclusively) impacts on specic groups of women from Black, First Nations, Brown, racialised, poor, and other minoritised communities. At the time of writing this book, there were vigils in London for the killing of Sarah Everard, a White professional woman in her early thirties. A police ocer was charged with her kidnapping and murder. A vigil for Ms Everard on Clapham Common in mid- March 2021 resulted in a violent police response which led to arrests and the dispersal of women who attended. There was widespread condemnation of the violence of police tactics, although a later police inspectorate report exonerated police and argued that the Metropolitan Police did not have a ‘choice’ but to use force.1 The death of Sarah Everard and police violence at the subsequent vigil for the dead woman was problematic enough. However, a further dimension was the relative silence around the murders of other young women in London who were Black. Mina Smallman questioned why

the deaths of her two daughters, Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry, killed in London nine months before Ms Everard, had received comparatively little attention and why police were slow to respond to their disappearance. In that case, two police ocers were subsequently suspended and arrested after allegedly taking ‘sele’ photos with the bodies of the two women. A 19-year-old male was later charged with their murder. Emphasising the importance of the death of one woman compared to another raises the broader social value placed on dierent women and victims/survivors of violence particularly by reason of their race, religion, ethnicity, class, sexuality, and ability, and whether the deaths of minoritised women attract the same public outrage and police responses as White and socially privileged women.2 At roughly the same time as the deaths of Mina Smallman’s daughters, the women prisoner’s advocacy group, The View, released their report We Are Invisible on Black and minority ethnic women’s experience in the criminal legal system in the UK.3 The report found that minority women who are victims/ survivors of domestic abuse and sexual violence suer systemic and institutional racism in the justice system. Police brutality was a recurring theme among Black women.4 Shortly after the controversial policing of the vigil on Clapham Common, then Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced as a response to violence against women plans for increased CCTV, increased policing in ‘clubs, bars and popular nightspots’ and pushed for the passage of the controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill.5 Among other changes, the new legislation allows greater police powers to prohibit public protests, negatively impacts on Roma, Traveller and Gypsy people, expands youth imprisonment, and extends prison sentences for various oences, including up to 10 years’ imprisonment for defacing statues and monuments – apparently showing a greater concern for controlling the Black Lives Matter and Extinction Rebellion movements than responding to violence against women.
How policing became the answer to violence against women
Promises of more policing and increased police and penal powers seem to be the stock answer by government to women’s demands

for safety and protection against harassment, violence, and rape. The World Health Organisation estimates that 30 per cent of women globally have been physically or sexually assaulted.6 The likelihood and incidence of physical and sexual violence is increased for Black, Brown, Indigenous, women with disability, and poor women. For example, in the US one in ve women of colour and one in three First Nations women experience rape, compared to one in six of all women.7 First Nations women in Australia are 10 times more likely to be murdered than other women and twice as likely to be a victim of sexual assault. Similar levels of violence against First Nations, Metis, and Inuit women can be found in Canada, and in the US the National Congress of American Indians has described the violence against First Nations women as at epidemic proportions.8 The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) has on several occasions expressed deep concern about the incidence of rape and sexual violence against First Nations and Inuit women, the insucient will of US federal and state authorities to take action, and in particular the need to ensure Indigenous women’s right of access to justice.9 The frequency of violence is also impacted by other factors – women with disabilities are nearly twice as likely to experience partner violence than other women, and between 4 and 10 times (depending on national data) more likely to be sexually assaulted.10 Other violent patriarchal practices also come into play: India records nearly 20 ‘dowry death’ murders of women a day, including bride burning.11 However, questions remain: how did we get to the position where more policing, criminalisation, and incarceration has become the primary answer to the problem of violence against women? And is it eective? Feminist activism in the 1970s and early 1980s was instrumental in bringing about change in the legislative frameworks and policing of violence against women, including both domestic violence and sexual assault. It was a period of ‘breaking the silence’ on the eects of violence on women and children and the discriminatory responses that were prevalent. In the 1970s, the focus was on providing women’s shelters and rape crisis centres as well as identifying the wider systemic issues including health care, housing, childcare and the broader problems of male violence and gender inequality.12 Although changes and

developments were specic to the political dynamics of various countries, during the 1980s many governments shifted their responses to domestic and sexual violence against women. For example, in 1984 the Final Report of the US Attorney General’s Task Force on Family Violence clearly argued for prioritising the role of police in domestic violence law and policy.13 Domestic violence was dened as a crime problem that required a strong response from criminal justice agencies including police. The tenets of this position were not surprising given the extent to which historically male violence against women had been considered a ‘private’ and ‘personal’ matter and the police when they did become involved were focused on mediation. However, it was clear at the time that a belief in the ecacy of criminalisation and mandatory or pro-arrest strategies was not shared by Black, Indigenous, and other women of colour. Aya Gruber notes that in the late 1970s Black feminists in the Combahee River Collective ‘challenged mainstream feminists’ commitment to “separatism” from men – a commitment that signicantly underwrote feminists’ comfort with invoking a violent, racist, sexist, and hierarchical penal system to discipline individual men’.14 Angela Davis observed in the early 1980s, that few White men were prosecuted for rape, while between 1930 and 1967 almost 90 per cent of men executed for this oence were Black. She wrote, ‘too many innocents have been oered to gas chambers and lifer’s cells for Black women to join those who often seek relief from policemen and judges’. Further, police assaults on Black women, including rape, are ‘heard too frequently to be dismissed as aberrations’.15 Similarly, Beth Richie had argued that questions of race and class were lost as the anti-violence movement began to converge with the conservative law and order policies of criminalisation and mass incarceration.16 Certainly by the late 1990s it was also clear in Australia that dominant approaches to domestic violence were not working for First Nations women: the criminalisation and removal of oenders was not addressing violent behaviour, nor respecting the wishes of women.17 During the 1990s, as the adoption of either mandatory or proarrest police strategies for responding to domestic violence became popular, developing research showed that these policies did not necessarily deter the occurrence of violence, although they did

## The protection racket

deter women from reporting violence. Research also showed that mandatory arrest policies had increased the likelihood of women being arrested more than men, and that intimate partner homicides had increased in US states where mandatory arrest policies were in force – most likely because of decreased reporting.18 The impact of increased arrests for women, particularly racialised women, meant those women were subjected to even greater violence through police use of force (sometimes lethal), abusive strip searches, and custody.19 Coinciding with this period was a rapid growth in the criminalisation and incarceration of Black, Indigenous, and First Nations women and the recognition that many women who were criminalised were also victims/survivors of violence and abuse.20 The criminal justice response was to also have a negative impact on Black and other racialised men – for example recent research in Australia indicates that First Nations men who breach a domestic violence order are more than twice as likely compared to other men to be sent to prison. For First Nations women, the situation is even worse – they are more than three times as likely to be sent to prison compared to non-Indigenous women. Indeed, in Queensland nearly 70 per cent of all women sentenced to imprisonment for breaching a domestic violence order are First Nations women, although they comprise slightly more than 3 per cent of the female population.21
Why is policing problematic?
There are numerous reasons that show why police are not the solution to violence against women and why an increase in policing does not equate to more protection for women in general and in particular for those women from communities that are already subject to intense police surveillance. In the rst instance, we know that very few women actually report violence and sexual assault to police, and this is particularly the case where the assailant in known to the victim. The International Violence Against Women Survey (IVAWS) which covered multiple countries found that less than one third of women reported experiences of physical and sexual violence to police, including in cases where they believed the violence to be serious.22 Indeed with intimate partner violence, even where women believed their

life was in danger, or they were in danger of serious bodily harm, only one third or less sought protection from police.23 Women are more likely to seek help from family, friends, colleagues, or community services. A recent survey of migrant and refugee women’s safety in Australia found that one in three women had experienced domestic and family violence. However, while half of the women disclosed the violence to someone, only a small minority (19 per cent) of those did so to police. The women were far more likely to report the violence to family and friends (84 per cent), health professionals (28 per cent), or a doctor (21 per cent). Women who had experienced domestic and family violence or other forms of criminal victimisation were less likely to trust the police or see them as fair, than other migrant or refugee women.24 The IVAWS noted that many women choose not to report violence because they are afraid of the ‘negative attitudes’ of police and others in the justice system. Research with health professionals in the US showed that 80 per cent saw contact with the legal system as ‘psychologically detrimental to rape survivors’.25 The revictimisation of women can take other forms: some women, especially Black, Indigenous, and women of colour will not report domestic and family violence to police because of a direct fear, if police are called, that their children will be removed by child welfare agencies – which has been a long-term strategy of colonial states to disrupt and separate poor and racialised families.26 For the minority of women who do report to police, there is no guarantee that their complaint will be taken seriously and progress through the justice system. As I prepared to write this chapter, a Sydney coroner in Australia held back tears as she delivered her ndings in the case of two teenage children, aged 13 and 15 years, deliberately shot dead by their father. The mother had reported previous violence against herself and her children, but police had failed to take the reports seriously. The male perpetrator had a history of domestic violence with previous partners. The coroner found that the deaths were preventable and was highly critical of the failures of the NSW police, including the female ocer who categorised the women’s nal complaint as ‘no oence recorded’. After the deaths of her children, she subsequently committed suicide.27

## The protection racket

There is a fundamental problem with the police inability to correctly identify male perpetrators. In Canada the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls (NIMMIWG) noted that Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA (Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, and asexual) people feared reaching out to police because they might be arrested and charged in situations of intimate partner violence.28 The Australian National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety (ANROWS) found that in Queensland nearly half the women killed by an intimate partner in 2017 had been previously misidentied by police as the perpetrator of violence. ANROWS found that ‘racism, poor relationships with local communities, misogyny, and the patriarchal culture of the police service’ negatively impacted the responses towards women, including police ‘not acting on women’s allegations and a lack of compassion or respect in their interactions’.29 Meanwhile in the UK, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Women in the Penal System has found that thousands of women are ‘needlessly arrested’ by police, and many of these arrests are linked to incidents in the home where women had sought to defend themselves, where women were victims of crimes, or were arrested while visibly distressed, as well as when there were fears about their mental health.30 The evidence shows that in many jurisdictions, reports of violence against women are not taken seriously by police. The IVAWS notes that less than half of reported cases of violence against women are referred to prosecution and, in some instances, less than one quarter. Specically, in relation to sexual assaults, police in Canada classied almost one in six reports as ‘unfounded’.31 In the US there have been reports of widespread incidents of police destroying rape kits and other physical evidence.32 The Australian Law Reform Commission has noted that less than one in ve sexual assault reports to police result in a person being charged and prosecuted.33 When we combine the failure to prosecute with the low level of reporting to police, then the likelihood of a violent perpetrator being charged with a criminal oence is estimated by the IVAWS to be between 1 per cent and 7 per cent of the incidents of victimisation. Although varying between countries, the likelihood of conviction is an even

## Defund the Police

smaller percentage of those who have been arrested, charged, and brought to trial. Racialisation and gender also come into play at the point of conviction and sentencing: for example, in the US, White women victims of rape are more likely to have successful court outcomes than other women, and in Australia, non-White accused are more likely to be convicted.34
Police violence against women
A further problem in relying on police for protection in matters of violence against women is that police ocers frequently commit domestic and sexual violence themselves, and regularly use their authority to ensure immunity from sanctions and prosecution. In Britain, the number of police ocers facing disciplinary proceedings for abusing their positions for sexual purposes has risen signicantly in recent years. Of 2,000 ocers accused of sexual misconduct, in nearly 60 per cent of cases no further action was taken, and in the vast majority of matters where misconduct was identied there were no criminal charges.35 An ABC (Australian Broadcasting Commission) investigation in Australia found police were often unwilling to take action against domestic violence perpetrators within their own departments, which contributed to a culture of invulnerability and put victims’ safety at risk. An examination of incidents of domestic violence in 2017 in Victoria found that where perpetrators were also police ocers, they were signicantly less likely to have action taken against them and were more than four times less likely to be arrested, charged, or cautioned by police than when perpetrators were members of the public.36 Similar reports in NSW identify the absence of sanctions against police, as well as the harassment of women who report domestic violence against police ocers.37 North American research also points to a higher incidence of domestic violence by police ocers – some estimates suggest 15 times greater than the general population –as well as identifying the various problems that women face when police are central to accessing legal protections.38 Leigh Goodmark has argued that intimate partner violence by police is a systemic problem exacerbated by the power, training, and socialisation of police, including the ‘militarised masculinity’ mentioned in Chapter 5

## The protection racket

which valorises aggressiveness, force, and violence as legitimate ways to solve problems. Domestic violence law and policy heavily invests in police as rst responders to domestic violence. Goodmark questions whether criminalisation can succeed as a policy to control domestic violence when police are meant to enforce laws they disproportionately violate.39 Apart from the incidence of police ocers committing domestic violence, there is widespread evidence of police engaging in violence against women outside of an intimate partner relationship. The Prison Policy Institute has found that in the US women make up an increasing share of arrests (particularly for drug oences) and report much more frequent use of force than they did 20 years ago: police use of force against women quadrupled between 1999 and 2015, during the same period it doubled for men. In 2015 some 12 million women had ‘non-voluntary’ contact with police through various trac stops, street stops, and with arrest warrants. Black women were three times more likely to report the use of force by police during a police-initiated stop than other women.40 Another group of women who experience high levels of police violence and harassment are sex workers. INCITE! found that nearly 17 per cent of sex workers interviewed reported sexual harassment, abuse, and rape by police. Zero tolerance policing and the enforcement of ‘quality of life’ oences such as loitering, obstructing trac, public nuisance, and disorderly conduct enable police to harass, detain, and arrest individuals they believe to be involved in sex work, and particularly street-based sex work.41 More generally, Andrea Ritchie has noted that the war on drugs and the war on terrorism, along with ZTP, has increased the frequency and intensity of particularly Black and women of colour’s interactions with police. These women experience many of the same forms of police racial proling, brutality, and violence as men of colour, as well as gender/race specic forms of abuse.42 Ritchie provides a harrowing account of women shot, raped, and abused by police, including when responding to domestic violence incidents. She notes the prevalence of complaints of police sexual misconduct is the second most frequently reported form of police misconduct, after the use of excessive force. ‘Yet it is clearly not the second most frequently talked about’, says Ritchie. She shows that many victims of police sexual violence do not come forward

## Defund the Police

for fear of reprisal or not being believed or taken seriously, and that police often receive little or no punishment, when women do raise complaints.43 In Canada, HRW reported on abusive policing practices against First Nations women and girls, and police failures to protect First Nations women in cases of domestic violence and sexual assault. Police violence has included the use of excessive force, assaults, inappropriate use of police dogs, pepper spray, and tasers, and rape and sexual assault by police ocers.44 These incidences of abuse were compounded by the widely perceived failure of the police to protect First Nations women from violence. HRW found that, because of the injustices they have experienced, Indigenous women did not feel safe approaching the RCMP when they experienced violence: ‘Police abuse undermines women and girls’ safety far beyond the direct physical consequences of any physical mistreatment. The impact is felt in the reticence of Indigenous women and girls to call the police for help when they fear or have experienced violence.’45 In 2015, the UN Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) found that there was a ‘grave violation’ of the rights of Aboriginal women in Canada through insucient and inadequate measures to protect Aboriginal women from gender-based violence, including disappearances and murders.46 I return to the issue of missing and murdered First Nations women and children later. In India, the National Campaign Against Torture (NCAT) and the National Human Rights Commission have detailed the killing, torture, and rape of women, including minors, by police.47 Most of the deaths in police custody are male, however NCAT notes that a number of women have died in custody as a result of torture, ‘foul play’ or unknown circumstances – including a 55-year-old Dalit woman at an All Women Police Station in Tamil Nadu. Of those women who were tortured and raped by police and survived, they included, for example, the rape of a 15-year-old girl by four police ocers and her subsequent sex tracking.48 Beyond the fear of police violence, there are multiple reasons for women not reporting violence to police. In Australia, inadequate police responses to First Nations women who experience violence have the result that women are reluctant to seek assistance from police.49 Similarly, research in Belize in Central America found

## The protection racket

the lack of reporting by women was a result of previous negative outcomes with police.50 In India, the data from the National Crime Records Bureau shows a steady increase in crimes against women – up by nearly 8 per cent between 2018 and 2019.51 The country has been the site of shocking police responses to women who have been killed, sexually assaulted or abused in the community. To take just one example, in September 2020 where a 19-year-old Dalit woman died after being gang raped and tortured, the Uttar Pradesh police immediately and forcibly cremated the body against the wishes of her family whom the police detained in their home. The police denied the young woman had been raped, despite her dying declaration. The NCAT has observed the problem of the ‘hasty cremation’ of bodies by police to hide evidence and prevent post-mortem. Writing in the Economic and Political Weekly, Nathan and Thorat noted, regarding the failure of police to protect Dalit women and girls: ‘We hold the police and the state responsible for their inaction to register complaints and not arresting the accused. … Every case reveals that the state machinery has turned a blind eye [and] through its apathetic response, violated rights of victims to access justice and has nullied human dignity.’52 Similar comments have been reiterated frequently enough. The CEDAW concluded in relation to India that there was ‘continuing impunity’ for the increasing violent crimes against women and girls, particularly rape and abduction; that this violence especially impacted on marginalised castes and communities, including Dalit and Adivasi women, and that key state ocials continually downplayed the ‘grave criminal nature of sexual violence against women and girls’.53 In the case from Uttar Pradesh, subsequent protests concerning the young woman’s rape and death were described by the state government as part of an ‘international conspiracy’ and subsequently the government had a number of journalists, activists, and protestors arrested and charged with terrorism, sedition, and conspiracy oences.54 In neighbouring Pakistan, there were nationwide protests in September 2020 demanding police reform after the Chief of Lahore Police stated that a woman who had been raped by two men in front of her children on a highway in Punjab was to blame because she should not have been traveling ‘without her

husband’s permission’ on a motorway late at night.55 A similar attitude that women were to blame for being raped was reected by Prime Minister Imran Khan in June 2021. The Global Gender Gap Report for 2021 ranks Pakistan at 153 from 156 countries for gender inequality. Various reports indicate in Pakistan there are almost 12 rape cases reported daily, with only 0.3 per cent of accused being convicted, as well as around 1,000 ‘honour’ killings annually. The CEDAW has drawn attention to the high prevalence of violence against women, the social acceptance of domestic violence, the under-reporting of violence, and the impunity for perpetrators in Pakistan.56 According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, the issues that face women are starkly shown by the prevalence of domestic and sexual violence and are exacerbated by other patriarchal factors including ‘so-called “honour” killings, acid attacks, extended family dynamics, social restrictions on movement and jobs, inequality and abject poverty, forced and arranged marriages’. Only one in two women report feeling safe in their own home.57
Missing and murdered First Nations, Black, and marginalised women and children There is a road in northern British Columbia, Canada called the Highway of Tears. This stretch of the Yellowhead Highway runs for around 700 kilometres and was named after the estimated 40 unsolved cases of missing and murdered First Nations women associated with that location. 58 The story of the failure to investigate the disappearances and murders of Aboriginal, Black, and other marginalised women and children goes to the heart of the failure of police to protect racialised and vulnerable women and children – to take their disappearances and deaths seriously. It is a story that can be found in various forms in multiple countries. In India it is a story of hundreds of thousands of adults who are recorded missing each year, nearly two thirds of whom are women, and the tens of thousands of children similarly recorded as missing annually.59 Most come from Dalit, Adivasi, or other marginalised communities. The numbers for both adults and children have been increasing. Children make up about two thirds of those who are abducted and end up tracked for forced

labour, sex work, or domestic slavery. Activists put the number of missing children much higher than the ocial gures – up to half a million each year. The reason for the discrepancy is that police do not record notications, or parents are too poor or scared to attend police stations and do not have the resources to follow-up with police.60 Police corruption also comes into play where police are either directly part of tracking networks, or brothel owners and trackers bribe local police to maintain their silence and inaction.61 One might argue that if the Indian police were provided with more resources, they would achieve better outcomes. But what do we nd when we look at highly resourced police services in the global north? In England and Wales, Black people are four times more likely to be reported missing relative to their population size. There is particular concern about the number of missing Black children and the failure to recognise the seriousness of these cases.62 In the US more than half a million people go missing annually and more than half of those are children under the age of 18 years. Black American children make up well over one third of this group, although they are only 14 per cent of American children. It has been noted that Black families can be hesitant to call police to report their children missing because of distrust. When Black families do report their children missing, they can be misclassied as runaways or criminals. As a result, police do not provide ‘amber alerts’ unlike when White children are classied as missing.63 There is also the issue of tens of thousands of missing Black women annually and missing First Nations women and children in the US.64 In Australia, there are many examples of missing or murdered First Nations women and children which have involved inadequate police investigations characterised by various failures and shortcomings. These include police failure to follow up on crucial leads, the delay in collection of evidence due to racial assumptions made by investigating police ocers because of the victim’s Aboriginality, political inaction in the decision to prosecute by attorneys-general and public prosecutors, and other systemic oversights and shortcomings. These issues have been further exacerbated by a lack of interest within the mainstream media over the deaths of Indigenous people. The Bowraville case highlights these problems. In the space of 5 months between

## Defund the Police

September 1990 and January 1991, three Aboriginal children went missing from a small NSW community with a population of a little over 1,000 people. It has a history as an Aboriginal mission and the area where many First Nations people in the town live today is still known as the ‘the mission’. It was from the mission that three Aboriginal children – Colleen Walker-Craig aged 16 years, Evelyn Greenup aged 4 years, and Clinton Speedy-Duroux aged 16 years – went missing. The initial police investigations in the Bowraville cases were riddled with incompetence and inaction often arising from racist assumptions about First Nations people. When Colleen Walker disappeared, the missing person report from the family was not taken seriously, there were no searches or other formal action undertaken. There were later delays in calling in specialist homicide detectives, failures to follow up on crucial leads including witness statements, and delays in the collection of evidence. One could only compare the dierence in police responses, the level of resources which would have been deployed, and the public interest generated by the mainstream media, if three White children who all lived on the same street in a small rural community had disappeared within a matter of months. Colleen Walker-Craig’s body was never found, although some of her clothing was located in a nearby river. The remains of Clinton Speedy-Duroux and Evelyn Greenup were located within a few kilometres of Bowraville. The families have continued to demand justice. In August 2016, 25 years after the disappearances, then NSW Police Commissioner Scipione delivered a formal apology to the Bowraville families for inadequacies in the initial police investigation. He stated: ‘I want to publicly acknowledge that the NSW Police Force could have done more for your families when these crimes rst occurred and how this added to your pain, as a grieving community.’65 The Bowraville story bears similarities to events in other regional and remote centres across Australia. It is not an isolated case. In 1987 in the remote NSW township of Bourke, two teenage Aboriginal girls – Mona Smith aged 16 years and Cindy Smith aged 15 years – died in terrible circumstances after accepting a ride in a vehicle driven by a White middle-aged man who was drunk and subsequently crashed the car. The driver sexually molested one of the girls as she was dying or shortly after she had died. The

## The protection racket

police investigation was minimal. The driver was never arrested nor ngerprinted, little evidence was collected and some that was collected went missing. The driver was acquitted of culpable driving and the charge of interfering with a corpse was withdrawn. The family have continually sought an explanation from police – in March 2020 Police Commissioner Fuller announced that the police investigation had been ‘adequate’.66 Some 35 years after the girls’ deaths, and a constant struggle by the families, on 14 July 2022, the NSW State Coroner conrmed that the inquest into the deaths of Mona Lisa and Cindy Rose Smith would be resumed.67 The examples of Bowraville and Bourke have been repeated across the nation, with no or substandard investigations by police into the deaths of First Nations women and children.68 In August 2022, it was announced that the Australian senate would conduct an inquiry into missing and murdered First Nations women and children.69 In Canada there were years of political agitation by First Nations women and supporting organisations over the incidence of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and children. In 2004, Amnesty International had identied a number of cases of disappearances of Aboriginal women and the failure of police to conduct serious investigations.70 In 2013, HRW again drew attention to the problem of police apathy towards investigating violence against Aboriginal women and girls.71 A report by the RCMP in 2014 found that there were 164 Aboriginal women considered missing at that time, and there were 225 unsolved cases of either missing or murdered Aboriginal women.72 UN human rights committees also weighed into the debate, noting the disproportionate homicides and disappearances of Aboriginal women, and in 2015 called on the Canadian government to establish a national public inquiry into missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls.73 The Canadian Liberal Government established the NIMMIWG in
2016. The Inquiry reported in 2019. More than 2,380 people
participated and 468 family members and survivors of violence shared their experiences. The Inquiry revealed a persistent and deliberate pattern of human rights abuses and systemic racism within the police. The report outlined routine police indierence to First Nations people, the failure to investigate, to take statements from witnesses, and to treat matters of missing and murdered First

Nations women and children either urgently or seriously. To justify their inaction, police utilised racist and sexist stereotypes of Indigenous women as prostitutes, as drunks, as criminals, as negligent parents, and so forth.74 The police consistently devalued the lives of Indigenous women.
     The women were deemed as disposable. And it was
     very, very tragic; their lives were tragic. You know,
     they were human beings; they were sisters, mothers,
     daughters, loved ones, wives; partners, aunties,
     grandmas. They were human beings worthy of dignity
     and respect, and that wasn’t accorded to them in life.75
The Inquiry found that the police failed to ensure justice and protection, and failed to provide adequate, bias-free policing services. The treatment of First Nations women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people was discriminatory and contributed to systemic harm.76 Further, the Inquiry found that the violence against Indigenous peoples in Canada was genocidal. The connection between the deaths and endemic violence was and is founded in the colonial violence, racism, and oppression which is embedded in everyday life and institutional structures (including the police). This violence amounted to genocide.77

## Conclusion

There have been long-standing criticisms dating back to the 1980s of a public policy approach to violence against women which relies on stronger policing, criminalisation, and penal sanctions. These criticisms have received greater traction in recent decades along with the growing intellectual and political movements against mass incarceration which have coincided with the interest in abolitionism, and the comparatively newer BLM and Defund the Police movements. Alongside this there has been a wider acknowledgment of the centrality of intersectional analysis in understanding the profoundly negative eects of criminal law reforms on Black, Indigenous, and women of colour. It has been noted that ‘to see policing and punishment simply as feminist solutions is an act of bad faith when the injustices

of mass incarceration—the connement of 2.3 million people, predominantly Black and Hispanic men [in the US]; the brutal conditions of detention; the lasting legal discrimination faced after release, to name but a few—are widely known’.78 Decolonial feminists have also been critical of a criminal legal approach: reliance on criminalisation furthers the colonial and patriarchal continuities of punishment within countries of the global south and north.79 Broadly speaking this has given rise to a critique of carceral feminism – that is a critical opposition to the reliance on policing, criminal prosecution, and imprisonment as a core solution to violence against women. Feminist abolitionists have argued instead for the development of non-state, community-controlled responses that protect women, hold oenders accountable, and address the underlying causes of violence. It is argued that criminal legal interventions are ‘extremely poor at dealing with the underlying causes of criminal behaviour and make a negligible contribution to addressing the underlying consequences of crime in the community’.80 The failures of these interventions are manifold. For example, they fail at the symbolic and political level because the justice institutions, including police, lack legitimacy within many communities; the interventions fail by leaving women socially and economically worse o; they have led to increased levels of criminalisation of women; and they fail by escalating the violence against women and children if imprisoned men return more traumatised after their imprisonment experiences. It has been suggested that rather than seeing domestic violence as a criminal legal problem, it can be more usefully understood and responded to as a public health, economic, community, and human rights issue – a point discussed more fully in later chapters.81 The call to defund the police is an important part of this critique of carceral feminism because police both directly and indirectly soak up so much of the resources that might be available to provide socially benecial responses in health, housing, education, and employment. For example, in the US, nearly nine times the amount of grant funding from the federal Violence Against Women Act goes to the criminal legal system compared to housing, despite repeated studies that show housing is ‘the single greatest need

## Defund the Police

identied by people subjected to abuse’.82 Indirectly, a carceral approach soaks up society’s resources because the criminalisation and imprisonment of women further generates a raft of additional costs from operating a bloated system of criminalisation and incarceration. These costs include all the social, health, and economic costs associated with, for example, child welfare, lost educational and employment opportunities, and so on. The distinction between carceral feminism and feminist abolitionism is an important underpinning to the debates between those who seek greater reliance on policing and the processes of criminalisation, and those who are committed to circumscribing and ultimately removing criminalisation from state responses to domestic and sexual violence against women. This is putting the issue in a somewhat simple polarity and there are dierent positions argued along this spectrum.83 However, there is a fault line which ultimately separates abolitionism from reformism and that is whether the proposed changes expand or contract the criminal legal system. We can see this line currently in debates within Canada and Australia over whether to criminalise coercive control or controlling behaviour within intimate partner relationships along the lines that have already occurred in the UK, Ireland, and proposed elsewhere.84 The strongest opposition to the proposed changes in Australia has come from First Nations women who see the legislation as further empowering police to criminalise Indigenous women rather than protect them – a legitimate fear given the data on criminalisation already canvassed in this chapter.85 It is also apparent in arguments over the utility of women-led or all-women police stations used in some parts of India and a number of Latin American countries. They have been advocated recently as a solution to violence against women in Australia. First Nations women are especially critical of the proposal to expand policing when there is already such strong evidence that First Nations women are extensively criminalised, reluctant to contact police, and desire communitycontrolled interventions within a framework of Indigenous selfdetermination.86 There is also considerable debate over whether women-led police stations have been eective in curbing violence against women or in improving police response to women in those countries where they have been established.87

## The protection racket

In short, rather than protecting women from violence, there are signicant failures by police in taking violence against women seriously – through the failure to record reports, to act on information, to investigate serious crimes, and through the use of demeaning stereotypes of racialised women. In addition, police are a major source of violence, especially for Black, First Nations, women of colour, and other marginalised women. Perhaps then we can leave the last words to Andrea Ritchie, author of Invisible No More, ‘What’s clear is that police are not preventing violence – they’re perpetrating violence, and they are being lifted up as the answer in the aftermath of the violence. Through that, they are able to perpetrate even more violence’.88

Many videos went viral after the military coup in Myanmar in February 2021, however, one that was particularly disturbing were the images of a group of police publicly beating a young man who had a physical and cognitive disability.1 There is an absence of systematic evidence internationally on the extent of police violence, including lethal violence, against people with disabilities and mental ill-health – this absence is part of the state’s strategic ignorance which disavows knowledge of the targeted victims of state violence noted in Chapter 5. However, we know from individual cases and research data that the problem is extensive. Some of the most well-known police killings in the US which spurred the BLM movement involved Black Americans with disabilities, including Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Tanesha Anderson, Freddie Gray, and Sandra Bland.2 In Canada in the 3 months between April and June 2020 in the lead-up to mass protests over police killings, six people died during mental healthrelated contact with police: Ejaz Ahmed Choudry, Rodney Levi, Chantal Moore, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, Caleb Tubila Njoko, and D’Andre Campbell. All were Black, Indigenous, or people of colour. Four were shot dead by police. The other two fell from balconies after police intervened. The circumstances of these deaths provided a powerful impetus to Canadian calls to defund the police and to provide non-punitive support for people in need. Similarly, in Australia, police fatal shootings and violence against people with disability have been detailed in evidence to recent state and federal royal commissions into mental illness and
            Disabling policing, protecting community health
disability. It has also been a source of First Nations activism in relation to deaths in custody. According to The Guardian’s database Deaths Inside, during 2018–2019, nine First Nations people with disability died in police custody.3 There is extensive police intervention into the lives of people with mental ill-health and cognitive impairments, and policing is a key part of the disablist and ableist processes of state control. I use the term dis/abling to encompass these dual processes of (i) the directly disabling eects and outcomes of police violence and trauma which cause disability, and (ii) police intervention, criminalisation of, and violence against people with disability because of ableist assumptions of what constitutes normative behaviour. There has been a profound penetration of policing and the carceral system into the repressive management of people with disability – both creating and reinforcing the social stigma and disposability of such a signicant group of people. The evidence underlines the intersections of race, class, gender, and other social divisions with the state’s dis/abling violence. The policing of disability is not a new phenomenon, but it has intensied with the neoliberal contraction of social support and the growth of the carceral state. Further, police decisions aecting people with disabilities compound through the carceral system, often justifying more extreme legal measures. As will be evident in this chapter, it is impossible to conceptualise policing without understanding its dis/abling eects. Centring disability is fundamental to the defund the police project and abolitionism more generally. Before launching more fully into this discussion, it is necessary to draw attention to the problematic nature of how disability is responded to globally.
      Worldwide one billion individuals have a disability.
      Many people with disabilities live in conict settings
      or in developing countries. … In many countries,
      they are subjected to violence and discrimination.
      People with disabilities are also often deprived of their
      right to live independently, as many are locked up in
      institutions, shackled, or cycled through the criminal
      justice system. [Many] abuses are a result of entrenched
      stigma and a lack of community-based services.4

## Defund the Police

Criminalisation and imprisonment are not the only mechanisms of control, as other forms of surveillance, connement, restriction, and regulation exist both within and outside state-based institutions. Some 80 per cent of people with disabilities globally live in low to middle income countries where private institutions, religious-based centres, and families can play a major role in enforcing captivity.5 However, policing and prisons are also a vital part of control and connement, and the use of state violence is ubiquitous. As we will come to see, prisons in countries like Australia, Canada, and the US hold more people with mental illness than psychiatric hospitals – the point being that police and prisons are central to the state’s processes of dis/ablement. In other countries, police often play a role in feeding people with disabilities into places of connement which are distinguishable from the prison, but are still systems of carceral control, both state and private. At this point, a clarication of terminology is necessary. Although not always recognised in the law, literature, or ocial data, there is a distinction to be made between mental ill-health and cognitive impairment. Mental ill-health is a temporary or continuing health problem that aects functioning such as anxiety disorders, psychoses and personality disorders. A cognitive impairment or cognitive disability is an ongoing impairment such as an acquired brain injury, dementia, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, and autism spectrum disorders.6 In addition, cognitive impairments and mental illness can and often do co-exist – such as acquired brain injury and anxiety disorders. Sometimes in the literature, mental ill-health and cognitive impairment are simply referred to as ‘disabilities’ without distinction, and it is not always clear who is included or not. For the purposes of the discussion, I use the term ‘disability’ to cover both groups – except where it is appropriate to refer separately to mental ill-health or cognitive disability.7 A political and sociological model of disability emphasises that people are dis/abled by attitudinal, social, political, economic, and environmental barriers that prevent participation and actively disable individuals. In other words, it is not the condition itself but the social responses and dis/abling processes to the condition that are deeply problematic. Policing and criminalisation are important processes in actively dis/abling people, and indeed, in more extreme cases, killing
            Disabling policing, protecting community health
people with mental ill-health or cognitive impairment. Further, the disabling eects of policing intersect across racial, gendered, and other social divisions which intensify oppression and the risk of state-sanctioned maiming and death. It is the active process of dis/abling (or what Puar calls debilitation8) which is highlighted in the role of the police and the carceral state in producing a criminalised and disabled population. Disability activists internationally have provided a compelling voice to the arguments for defunding the police and the need to transfer resources into non-stigmatising and non-punitive processes for support.
Policing dis/ability: not a new, but a resurgent problem
As noted in Chapter 2, historically, police performed a central role in controlling people with disabilities. During the 19th century and later, police were engaged in the long history of institutionalising the mentally ill and cognitively and physically disabled, alongside those who were vagrant, poor, or seen as a threat to public order and stability.9 Indeed in contemporary India, laws relating to beggary are still used to conne people with disabilities in various institutions.10 The period of hyperincarceration since the 1980s, at least in parts of the global north, has reinvigorated the police role in dis/abling signicant sections of the population. It has been tempting to argue that policework itself has changed from law enforcement to maintaining social control and managing disadvantaged people – that police have become the ‘carers’ of last resort, and a ‘lead agency’ in responding to people with disability.11 However, the historical record challenges the simplicity and passivity of this argument – a core function of policing has always focused on actively controlling populations who in some way contest capitalist exploitation and the legitimacy of rule, and indeed the police were key well before the 1980s in the control and institutionalisation of people with disabilities. Having said that, the neoliberal retraction of social supports – the increasing homelessness, stagnant wages, cuts to public services, and the decades-long failure to invest in community mental health resources across many countries – has increased demand for repressive state agencies to take a more proactive role in containing the generative social and economic problems of capitalism. This demand

## Defund the Police

for repression has been matched by policing strategies, including ZTP, which are proactive in criminalising the types of public order ‘lifestyle’ oences likely to involve poor, unsupported people with disabilities (such as homelessness-related activities or behaviours). The ravages of neoliberalism and the current criminalisation of disability has occurred at a time of profound and entrenched poverty. People living with disability are signicantly more likely to be unemployed, to be poor, on low incomes, to have inadequate access to health services, and to be homeless.12 In addition, disability is more likely to be manifested in poor and racialised communities precisely because the material conditions of poverty (such as lack of access to medical care, aordable healthy food, environmental factors and so on), combined with marginalisation and structural racism create the conditions for disability.13 Not all people with disability experience poverty and disadvantage, but it is clear globally that disability is disproportionately evident in poor, marginalised, and racialised communities – both within over- developed capitalist societies as well as the global south. These are precisely the communities where proactive public order policing is actively engaged in criminalising poor people in the public sphere, many of whom live with one or more disabilities. Thus, the criminalisation of disability follows the same path as criminalisation more generally, which picks up people who are poor, unemployed, homeless, and from minoritised and disenfranchised populations. People with disability have increased risks of criminalisation and are treated dierently from those without disability. People with disabilities are more likely to be arrested, questioned, and detained for minor infringements of public order. Both the Royal Commission into mental health services in Victoria and the federal Australian Disability Royal Commission found that people with disability were particularly criminalised for minor oences relating to homelessness, begging, vagrancy, drug/ alcohol use, public transport fare evasion, oensive behaviour, and unpaid nes.14 Similar ndings have been made in the US.15 The statement given by Justen Thomas provides an example of these compounding problems.
      My name is Justen Thomas. I gave evidence at the
      Disability Royal Commission. I am a 43- year-old
             Disabling policing, protecting community health
      Aboriginal man with an intellectual disability and
      epilepsy. I was homeless as a young person and I started
      to get nes for sleeping on trains. I was never able
      to pay my nes and it escalated to a big issue where
      I was getting locked up for nes. When I got arrested
      I didn’t understand the police or the court system
      and I ended up in prison many times. The cycle ended
      when I nally got the help and support I needed.16
A community health survey in Canada found that nearly 35 per cent of people with a mental health problem or substance dependency reported contact with the police in the previous 12 months. There is also a high prevalence of homelessness. For example, studies have shown that people with mental ill-health make-up three quarters of people accessing homeless services.17 Police across many countries typically have extensive powers to intervene and apprehend a person who is thought to be suering from mental ill-health. For example, in England and Wales the police can remove a person from a public place to a ‘place of safety’ if there is a risk of harm to self or others. A police station is designated as a place of safety. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) review of 333 deaths in police custody, referred to in Chapter 5, found that although police stations should be used as a last resort, this was not the case in practice, and not surprisingly that using police custody as a place of safety in reality can ‘exacerbate the individual’s condition’. More than one in six of the 333 people who died in police custody were detained under s136 of the Mental Health Act or were identied as having mental health needs when apprehended. Most were in custody for oences related to public order, public drunkenness, or property damage.18 In Victoria, Australia, the legislation allows for police ocers to apprehend a person if they ‘appear mentally ill and may be of serious and imminent harm to themselves or others’. Evidence to the Victorian Royal Commission detailed how confronting and upsetting being apprehended by police can be for people with a disability and the distress caused by police involvement in mental health responses.19 Police spend signicant time on policing disability. Approximately 10 per cent of all police interactions in the US involve people

## Defund the Police

with mental health conditions.20 Similarly, in Sydney, Australia, on average 10 per cent of police time is spent policing people with mental health conditions. The role of policing mental health disorders and cognitive impairment has grown with, for example, a ten-fold increase in the number of ‘mental health events’ recorded by NSW police between 2000–2009, and this was on top of a 500 per cent increase during the previous decade. Similarly, in Canada, police in Ontario and British Columbia have reported signicant annual increases in attending ‘mental health occurrences’ over recent years.21 However, these increases in police focus should not be seen as simply a passive response for two reasons. First, police are dened and enabled as the appropriate responders in contrast to other forms of community-based and/or stateassisted interventions; second, proactive police strategies which focus on public order oences are likely to criminalise people with disabilities. As noted in Chapter 3, calls to police regarding homeless people are usually not about criminal behaviour. However, police intervention generates arrests for minor public order oences, particularly for people with disabilities. In addition, there is widespread evidence of police actively resisting an acknowledgment of a person’s disability and as a result police then fail to full any procedural requirements that might be required when a person being detained has a disability. Studies of police attitudes towards people with disability reveal the use of derogatory language, negative or paternalistic stereotypes, and assumptions about ‘normality’ that frame police discretionary decisions to intervene and criminalise.22 Further, it is clear that people with disability are more vulnerable to police violence and misconduct and have distinctive challenges in making complaints about police. A police complaints legal clinic in Melbourne revealed that almost half the formal complaints which they lodged against police involved people with a disability.23 Police decisions aecting people with disabilities compound through the carceral system. People with disability are more often refused bail and are more likely to receive a custodial sentence due to a lack of community-based options. They are thus exposed to extended and repeat incarceration, building up a long criminal record for minor oences. The nature of their impairment may cause trouble with memory, attention, impulse control, and
            Disabling policing, protecting community health
communication. Their behaviour may be misinterpreted as non-compliance, rudeness, deance, or indierence. The ability to conform with the legal requirements of, for example, bail, probation, and parole may be impaired – thus furthering ongoing police interventions and imprisonment. People become caught within the net of criminal justice with cycles of arrest, court, and imprisonment from which they are unable to extricate themselves. Being caught in cycles of criminalisation is itself harmful to recovery and to maintaining social support.24 Indeed, for some – particularly racialised peoples – it leads to gross miscarriages of justice. To take just one recent example, in May 2021, two Black men who had cognitive impairments and were also brothers were awarded compensation for wrongful convictions after 31 years spent in prison.25 It has been estimated in the US that 64 per cent of jail inmates, 56 per cent of state prisoners and 45 per cent of federal prisoners have mental ill-health.26 Reportedly, some 44 states and Washington DC have ‘at least one jail that houses more people with mental illnesses than the largest state psychiatric hospital’, while less than 13 per cent of incarcerated people report receiving any treatment for mental illness during their sentence.27 In Australia, 40 per cent of prisoners reported a previous diagnosis of a mental health condition, while physical and cognitive impairments are also signicantly more prevalent than in the general population.28 Several reasons are put forward for the mass incarceration of people with disabilities, including selective enforcement, repeated arrests for low level oences, and inadequate provision of community treatment.29 The result is a constant ow of people with disabilities in and out of the prison system on short sentences. HRW found that in many countries the conditions for prisoners with disabilities are extraordinarily harsh and degrading. For example, in South Sudan, individuals were imprisoned for being said to show evidence of mental ill-health or cognitive impairment. Very few were accused of a criminal oence, and they could not appeal their imprisonment. Many had no release date. ‘Some of these prisoners are chained day and night while naked and soiled in excrement, unable to access proper health care’.30 In Uganda, those incarcerated in rural prisons are required to work the land for the prot of prison governors or

## Defund the Police

contracted to private landholders. ‘The elderly, individuals with disabilities, and pregnant women, are frequently caned, or are even stoned, handcued to a tree, or burned, when they refuse to perform hard labor’.31 While a key argument presented here is that the incarceration of people with disabilities is dependent on police intervention in the rst instance, it is also important to recognise that the resulting connement can take place outside the prison. Police play a role in sending people to private and state-based institutions and faithbased centres where they are kept in abusive situations. Police can also put pressure on families to shackle and imprison family members. One mother in Bali, Indonesia shared with HRW why she had chained her son with mental ill-health for over 10 years:
      We took Ngurah to more than 40 traditional healers
      where they poked him with a stick and put herbs in
      his eyes but it didn’t work. We didn’t know what to
      do. When Ngurah kept getting lost, the local police
      and community blamed and put pressure on us. We
      felt ashamed so we decided to chain him.32
In India it has been noted that there are various institutions where people with disabilities are incarcerated, including ‘mental hospitals’ and residential facilities. The majority of States have ‘Beggars’ Homes’ which are used to detain people. Disability advocacy organisations have armed that:
      Many ‘beggars’ homes’ have been converted into
      ‘old age homes’ or ‘disabled homes’, where people
      who are homeless, elderly or destitute and people
      with disabilities are ‘lumped’ together without any
      reasonable accommodation, services or care. The
      Beggary Act does not provide for minimum standards,
      safeguards or monitoring. … The role of the police in
      ‘round up’ operations which ensure people are taken
      forcibly to these institutions has been observed.33
In India, as elsewhere, there are many accounts of police violence against people with disabilities. The institutions are over-crowded,
            Disabling policing, protecting community health
dirty, and lack sanitation; those detained are subjected to abuse, prolonged detention, involuntary treatment, and violence.34

## Police fatal shootings and other violence

The Washington Post database on police fatal shootings shows that between 2015 and September 2021, some 23 per cent of those killed had a mental illness.35 More broadly it has been estimated that between one third and one half of people killed by police in the US have mental ill-health, cognitive impairment, or other disability.36 Other studies in Australia, Canada, and the UK on fatal police shootings indicate similar ndings.37 Some of the independent data collections put the gures even higher: the Deadly Force database in Canada estimated that during 2000– 2020 some 68 per cent of people killed in police encounters had mental health or substance abuse problems, or both.38 Although it is dicult to locate police use of force data involving people with disabilities, there are investigations which suggests a signicant problem. For instance, the US Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division investigations of the Baltimore, Ferguson, and Seattle Police Departments all found extensive and unnecessary force against people with disabilities, and the New York City CCRB examination of taser-related complaints against the NYPD between 2014–17 found that a signicant number of cases involved complainants ‘who appeared to have been in the midst of a mental health crisis’ at the time they were tasered.39 Research in Victoria, Australia, found that police were more than twice as likely to use OS spray against people with mental illness.40 Disability intersects with other social categories of race, class, gender, and sexuality to magnify marginalisation and to increase the risk of police violence.41 Black, Indigenous, and other racialised communities are over-represented among police killings of people who are in a mental health crisis or have cognitive disabilities in the US, the UK, Australia, and Canada. In England and Wales, the Runnymede Trust noted that Black and minority ethnic people are twice as likely to feature in mental health-related deaths in police custody than others, and particularly those deaths involving restraint by police ocers.42 In Canada, Black and Indigenous people with mental ill-health are over-represented

## Defund the Police

among those fatally shot by police.43 In Australia, The Guardian’s database Deaths Inside, indicates disproportionate numbers of First Nations people with disability dying in police custody.44 A fundamental feature of the lives of criminalised people with disability is that they have also been subjected to frequent and recurring forms of non-state violence, including inter-personal violence and violence in non-prison institutional settings. The rates of violent victimisation are higher than in the general population.45 These issues come to the fore particularly when considering women with disabilities and their contact with police. Women with disability are almost twice as likely to experience partner violence than other women, and between four and ten times more likely to be sexually assaulted. Around half of women with cognitive disability are sexually assaulted before the age of
18.46 An investigation of 850 police records of rape allegations in
Australia found that cases involving victims with a disability were least likely to lead to criminal charges against an oender and were twice as likely to be rejected as false. A similar examination of rape and sexual assault police les in New Zealand found that of the complaints made by women with cognitive disability or mental ill-health, only 13 per cent were regarded by police as genuine.47 In India, HRW has reported police inaction and the refusal to register complaints when women and girls with disabilities attempt to report sexual violence, including gang rape.48 Thus, women with disability experience both violence in the community and police violence. The statement of Dorothy Armstrong to the Australian Disability Royal Commission captures this intersection.
     I have an acquired brain injury. … I rst noticed that
     there was something dierent about my thinking
     patterns when I was 16 or 17. I also have mental health
     issues. I have experienced a lot of physical violence
     and homelessness during my life. … My rst direct
     experience with the police was because of someone
     else’s crime. I was 17 years old. … I called a police
     station because my handbag had been stolen. I was
     raped by a police ocer who worked on the case. …
     After this experience and many more incidents I have
            Disabling policing, protecting community health
     learned to be terried of police. … Getting help was
     challenging. I struggled to get my story right or in
     the right order. Often police did not believe I was a
     victim of domestic violence or they did not follow up
     on my complaint. … Once I was attacked by three
     men and went to Geelong Police Station. My clothes
     were ripped and I was screaming and bloody. A police
     ocer came out and yelled at me to “fuck o ”.49
Low reporting rates to police are compounded by the gendered attitudes held by police – some research suggests two consistently held myths about women with disability: that they are promiscuous and that their stories are not credible. These intersect with other social stigmas including that women with disabilities have less worth than other women, and the gendered stigmas attached to being a female victim of sexual violence.50 This is further intensied by racist myths that pervade police responses to Black, Indigenous, and women of colour. Assumptions about ‘normality’ and ‘abnormality’ infuse police decisions regarding their intervention, the use of violence, and criminalisation. Andrea Ritchie has written eloquently on the tragic consequences of the controlling narratives that frame police interventions into the lives of Black women with disability – for example, their supposed inhuman or superhuman strength – and the role of scientic racism in the conceptualisations of disability and disorder.51 All these narratives come into play in justifying the police killing of Black, Indigenous, and women of colour – as they did recently in Australia where a police ocer shot and killed 29-year-old Yamatji woman ‘JC’ who suered from mental ill-health and had been previously imprisoned. During a mental health episode she was surrounded by eight police ocers. As she stood there motionless, one police ocer killed her with a fatal shot. He was acquitted of murder. The court heard that ‘JC’ had ‘to be taken down’ like she was some wild deranged animal.52 Unresolved trauma is ubiquitous in the lives of people with disabilities who have survived both criminalisation and victimisation. Experiences of trauma are compounded particularly by gender, race, Indigeneity, and sexuality. Survival techniques and

## Defund the Police

resistance to victimisation may be labelled as oending behaviour and can lead to further criminalisation.53 Georey Thomas is a 59year-old Aboriginal man who self describes as having a cognitive brain impairment, psychosocial disability, chronic depression, and other disorders. He provided a written statement to the Australian Disability Royal Commission where he talks about being arrested at age 15 and ‘bashed by the police’. Decades of policing, imprisonment, and institutional violence followed.
     I feel like too often police are immediately aggressive
     toward me and assume the worst about me. …
     Authorities in general need to improve the way they
     deal with people who are experiencing psychosis
     or serious mental health issues. There is no way
     that a person in that situation is going to cope with
     authoritarianism. … If you start threatening someone
     who is already feeling mentally and psychologically
     threatened, they will lose the plot every time.54
The medicalisation of disability as abnormality is also used to justify police violence. Disability becomes an underlying medical condition that explains police murder and represents killing as excusable or inevitable. For example, the autopsy report for George Floyd, signalled ‘underlying conditions’ including hypertension and a previous COVID-19 diagnosis – which enabled an inaccurate narrative that Floyd’s disability contributed to his death as opposed to the ocer’s knee on his neck. Or that a deaf victim who failed to hear a police command to stop was thus ‘legitimately’ shot and killed.55 We see this also with the advent of the so-called ‘excited delirium syndrome’ which is used by police to defend the use of (fatal) force as well as to explain sudden deaths of people in custody. Although it has been raised by authorities to ‘explain’ many deaths in custody in the US, the UK, and Australia, it has not been medically recognised internationally outside of a small group of doctors in the US. In the UK the Angiolini review of deaths in police custody criticised its use, and in July 2021 the American Medical Association issued a policy advising that it should be avoided in attributing cause of death.56
            Disabling policing, protecting community health

## The great misnomer: police welfare checks

One of the greatest misnomers in the history of policing is the idea that police ocers can conduct welfare checks on vulnerable people, including those suering from mental ill-health and cognitive impairments. In many countries, police ‘welfare checks’ or ‘wellness checks’ on people with disabilities are common. For example, in the UK it has been noted that it is not unusual for a medical practitioner, social services, or other agency to request police to check on someone when they cannot be contacted or have not attended an appointment.57 Similar use of police is made in the US, Australia, and Canada. It is also common for family and friends to request police to check on someone, or for the person with the disability or mental illness to call police. Canadian data suggests that more than half of all requests to police were made by family, friends, or were self-initiated, rather than by an agency.58 It is dicult to determine how many of these police checks end in violence, arrest, and in some cases death. However, these outcomes are frequent enough to have become one of the major drivers in the calls to stop police involvement in responses to people with disabilities. As the US-based Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (representing over 20 key advocacy bodies) has stated, ‘stories of people with disabilities killed by police during wellness or welfare checks abound’.59 Among many examples, the Consortium refers to the death of Osaze Osagie in March 2019, a 29-year-old Black man with autism and schizophrenia, who was shot and killed by police after his father called local police to make a mental health wellness check on him. In Canada, the deaths of Choudry, Levi, Moore, KorchinskiPaquet, Njoko and Campbell between April and June 2020, all arose in the context of wellness checks by police. In response, the Canadian Mental Health Association issued a Statement on Police and Wellness Checks pointing out perhaps what should be obvious, ‘mental illness is not a crime’.60 The Association observed that the deaths were ‘the most recent in what has been a terrible history of fatalities involving people in mental health crisis situations. Systemic racism, including anti-Black and antiIndigenous racism, has gravely increased the risks associated with experiencing a mental health crisis’. In Australia, there

## Defund the Police

are many examples of police killings of people with disabilities after family members have requested help – such as the death of Yamatji woman ‘JC’ referred to previously.61 Even where police intervention does not lead to death there are multiple accounts of police violence, arrest, and criminalisation arising from what should be a supportive check on someone’s well-being, particularly when a large group of police arrive to ‘check’ on a single person.62 When contrasted with the idea of a welfare check on a person with a disability, the violence of policing becomes manifestly obvious. The contradiction between violence and welfare is so overladen that it cannot be ignored and not surprisingly many government and independent agencies have expressed concern over the police role in the ‘management’ of disability in the community. They have variously aimed to limit or remove police involvement and transfer responsibility to other areas of community and/or government responsibility.63 Certainly, not all of the organisations calling for change would see themselves as abolitionist in their focus – however, they do clearly argue for removing police from crisis and welfare responses to mental illhealth and disability and for increased funding into the community sector.64 There is potential for broad-based solidarity in building non-carceral community-based approaches based on principles of care rather than force, and for a signicant retraction in the police/carceral state.65

## Conclusion

In bringing this chapter to a close I want to draw some of the links between policing disability and the idea that policing itself is inconsistent with protecting and enhancing community safety and public health. The relationship between policing and community health can be conceptualised at various intersections. One is the manner in which police violence is itself a public health issue, like other forms of violence such as family and intimate partner violence, or gun violence. In other words, it is a signicant cause of death, disability, and ill-health. Second, policing is linked to public health to the extent that policing and criminalisation are brought into play for social issues which could

otherwise and more appropriately be responded to as community health concerns, such as mental ill-health and drug and alcohol addiction.66 Third, policing and criminalisation are key regulatory responses to social and economic conditions which we know to be determinants of ill-health – for example, homelessness and poverty – and indeed further exacerbate these problems through cycles of criminalisation and imprisonment. Finally, policing as an activity joins the violence of (dis)ablism with racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination and exclusion which negatively aect a person’s health. By this I simply mean that state violence against people with disability is coupled with racial, sexual, and other forms of violence.67 Understanding the connections between disability and policing brings to the fore these public health concerns. A profoundly neglected area has been the extent to which police violence and brutality causes or directly contributes to physical and cognitive disability and mental ill-health. There is a growing public health literature discussing the role of police violence as an individual and community health issue, particularly for Black, Indigenous, and people of colour. In the context of disability and mental health, Alang and colleagues show that death, injuries, psychological stress, racist public reactions, economic stress and systemic community disempowerment can arise from police brutality and racism.68 More specically, it is clear that police violence often results in disabilities – this can include for example the number of people who have become blind as a result of being shot with rubber bullets or other projectiles, or have acquired brain injuries or become paralysed as a result of police violence. It can also include those whose mental ill-health was caused by or deteriorated as a result of the trauma of police abuse, including those who have committed suicide as a result.69 Many public health practitioners and organisations have increasingly moved towards an abolitionist position. As Deivanayagam and colleagues note: ‘We dene abolitionist public health as work directed towards the dissolution of the PIC [prison industrial complex], recognition of its discriminatory roots, and the implementation of interventions that tackle the social, economic and political determinants of health at the root of societal problems, thus making policing obsolete.’70 The American Public

## Defund the Police

Health Association (APHA) has released two policy statements in recent years relevant to this discussion. In 2018 the APHA released its Addressing Law Enforcement Violence as a Public Health Issue policy which notes that law enforcement violence is a critical public health problem that impacts on marginalised communities. The policy argues strongly for a defund the police and divestment/ investment proposition when it calls for the ‘reallocation of funds from policing to the social determinants of health’.71 According to the APHA: ‘This type of approach includes increasing access to housing, expanding educational and employment opportunities, increasing access to mental health and substance use treatment, and restoring a sense of safety by addressing interpersonal and institutional factors contributing to perceptions of safety and experiences of discrimination.’72 At its 2021 Annual Conference, the APHA adopted a more general policy on carceral abolitionism, calling for decarceration, divestment from carceral systems, and investment in the social determinants of health, decriminalisation, and a commitment to non-carceral measures for accountability, safety, and well-being.73 The nal sections of this book pick up on these ideas. Following a discussion of the contemporary failure of police reform mechanisms in Chapter 8, there is more specic consideration in Chapter 9 of limiting, retracting, and eventually replacing police power with a logic and programme of community solidarity and care.

## The failure of reform

Over the last 50 years, there have been numerous high-prole judicial inquiries, presidential commissions, royal commissions, and national reports into one policing crisis after another across a spectrum of countries. While these reports have varied in terms of scope and specic content, there are many commonalities in the broad focus of recommendations, particularly in the need to change police through a suite of internal police reform mechanisms and improved measures for accountability. The key police reform priorities which are often identied (and endlessly repeated from one inquiry to the next) include enhancing community policing, introducing diversity quotas and recruitment initiatives, technical solutions such as body cameras, a greater reliance on evidencebased policing (EBP), and various measures to improve citizen complaints systems and accountability mechanisms. Added to this catalogue is recommended investment in an the almost neverending list of training courses: in de-escalation techniques, in cross-cultural awareness, anti-racism and unconscious bias, in the use of force and physical restraints, to identify signs and symptoms of mental illness, in community policing and community-based crime reduction programmes, in responding to domestic violence and sexual assault, and so on. This chapter turns to the failure of reform and the problem of police reformism. The discussion focuses on the limitations of programmes of reform in affecting meaningful change. Given the number of inquiries and recommendations and the failure of empirical evidence, research, or practice to show signicant improvements, it appears to be a case of not learning

## Defund the Police

from continual failure and instead doing more of the same over again.1 However, in a deeper sense, and from a perspective of the impact on police as an institution, reformism reinvigorates and reinforces the centrality of the institution of policing rather than challenging it. Indeed, police are able to command even greater resources through reforms, and police power is enhanced rather than contested. What we do not see on the reform lists is a recommendation for the retraction of policing. In contrast, the Defund the Police demand has been for divestment of resources from police and investment in community structures. It is a perspective which works towards diminishing police power by questioning the necessity of police – thus unlike reformism, the institutional role of police is no longer seen as unassailable.
The forlorn hope of police inquiries and the liberal reform agenda The early 1990s saw the publication of prominent, state-funded investigations in response to crises in policing occurring in various countries. In the United States, the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department (the Christopher Commission) on the beating of Rodney King was published in April 1991. In Australia, the RCADIC was published in the same year. In Northern Ireland, the Report of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland was published in 1998, meanwhile the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (which dealt with human rights abuses relating to policing in apartheid South Africa among other issues) was established in 1995 and presented its report to government in two parts in 1998 and 2003. In Britain, the Scarman Inquiry into the Brixton riots had reported in 1981. The Inquiry held that the cause of the riots was unemployment, poverty, and social deprivation. Scarman believed that both community policing and saturation- style militarised policing could co-exist and that solutions to policing could be found in changing police attitudes and prejudices. His recommendations also relied on social and economic reforms (which were ignored) and on an expanded programme of police training on community and race issues and the establishment of

## The failure of reform

community consultative committees. As Sivanandan commented, Scarman failed to recognise the structures of institutionalised racism within British society and his recommendations ‘did nothing more than put new gloss over old policies’.2 Indeed, Stuart Hall noted,
     Scarman put his trust in [police training] as a way of
     trying to get to grips with the racialization of routine
     police work. … Racism Awareness Training … was
     so patchily introduced, the trainers so inadequately
     prepared, the programme so lacking in senior
     managerial authority or integration into wider policing
     practices, to be grossly inadequate on the ground to
     the liberal purpose intended.3
Nearly 20 years after Scarman, Macpherson issued his report on the racist killing of Stephen Lawrence and identied the problem of institutional racism. However, the government response did not prioritise the investigation of complaints and accountability, and as Hall commented at this time, “a few Racism Awareness Training lms are no doubt at this very moment being prepared … with the laughably ineectual results about which we already have overwhelming evidence”.4 Another 20 years after the McPherson report, policing and institutional racism continued to be heavily criticised in the 2017 report by the British member of parliament David Lammy.5 In Australia, controversy over the reform of police and criminal legal institutions continues 30 years after the 1991 RCADIC. In 2018, the federal government requested multinational consultancy rm Deloitte to review the implementation of the 339 recommendations from the RCADIC. In what was largely seen as a self-serving exercise for government: Deloitte determined whether recommendations had been implemented based on the assessments and responses of state, territory, and federal governments. Not surprisingly it was found that nearly 80 per cent of recommendations were either fully implemented or mostly implemented – an estimation roundly challenged by academics, media, and human rights organisations. Meanwhile, the over-representation of First Nations people in prison is at

record highs, and deaths in police and prison custody continue in situations of violence and neglect similar to those originally identied by the RCADIC.6 Of the multiple inquiries that could be referred to in the United States, the focus here is on three reports, each roughly 25 years after the other: the Kerner Commission in 1967, the Christopher Commission in 1991, and the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing in 2015. The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (the Kerner Commission) was appointed by President Johnson to inquire into riots across 23 American cities during the mid 1960s. The Kerner Commission recommendations included improved community policing and strategies to enhance community support and legitimacy, recruitment of Black Americans into the police, reviews of training, and improvements to police complaints mechanisms.7 The recommendations also included wider use of non-lethal weapons and chemical agents as methods of riot control. In addition, Kerner made recommendations to address racial and economic inequality, which were largely ignored. However, some of the Kerner Commission’s recommendations relating to police and what Johnson was increasingly referring to as a ‘war on crime’ were acted upon. According to Schrader, the increased allocation of federal funding to police, with bipartisan support, laid the ‘foundations of the carceral state: aggressive policing, mass incarceration, and the engulng of the state’s welfare capacities by penal demands’, all in the name of police reform.8 The Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department (the Christopher Commission) was established following the beating of Rodney King in 1991. The Christopher Commission found there was a signicant number of LAPD ocers who repeatedly used excessive force against the public and that the problem of excessive force was aggravated by racism and bias. Recommendations from the Commission followed a well- trodden path designed to address improvements in training (including cultural awareness), diversity recruitment, complaints and disciplinary procedures, and various management issues. Failure to adequately implement the recommendations, particularly those related to accountability, were noted during the 1990s.9

## The failure of reform

After the police fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, President Obama established the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing. The Task Force was given 90 days to ‘identify best policing practices and oer recommendations on how those practices can promote eective crime reduction while building public trust’.10 It reported in 2015. The President’s Task Force identied six ‘pillars’ around which it organised the report and recommendations: building trust and legitimacy, policy and oversight, technology and social media, community policing and crime reduction, training and education, and ocer wellness and safety. As several commentators have noted, the reforms were familiar territory: better training, police–community relations, diversication, and various other procedural tweaks.11 The priority of trust and legitimacy belied a conservative approach that focused on strategies to ensure that citizens trusted the police and obeyed the law, and was not directed at fundamentally changing policing. As noted at the time, the solutions proposed by the Taskforce ‘will strengthen police, expand their budgets and insulate them from public criticism. … [T]he reforms are designed to increase the legitimacy of the police. But they will also make the police’s powers more extensive’.12 The focus on trust and legitimacy in the 2015 Taskforce Report was perhaps not surprising. In late 2014, the US Department of Justice had launched the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice in six locations with the aim of improving relationships and increasing trust between communities and the police and justice agencies. One of those sites was Minneapolis. As Robin D.G. Kelley observed, these reforms have not made communities safer, despite the fact that, prior to the police killing of George Floyd, ‘the city’s police department was a poster child of reform. Minneapolis’s diverse force was well-trained in mental health crisis intervention, implicit bias, de-escalation, and praised for being exceptionally compassionate’.13 In a nutshell, the liberal reform agenda sets out to strengthen policing, not to primarily challenge it. It does not question the nature and role of police power in upholding and protecting the structural inequalities and systemic abuses embedded within society. The liberal reform agenda has absolutely no sense of history, either of the institution of police nor of its own continually

## Defund the Police

failing agendas. The inadequacies of the liberal reform agenda are what makes it so appealing to the institutions it seeks to reform, because it inevitably strengthens them through more human, nancial and technological resources to support the ongoing institutional systems of power. US President Joe Biden captured this liberal agenda in his 2022 State of the Union Address, ‘We should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. It’s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with resources and training’.14 If more public money is continually thrown at police for reform, we should question the nature of the reform agenda.

## Diversity

The proposal to increase diversity within police ranks has a long history. One form of it dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries in relation to employing more women in police forces to better respond to needs of women citizens.15 The rationale is the same today: if we could employ more women, LGBTQIA+, Black, Indigenous, ethnic, religious or cultural minoritised groups within the police, then the organisation will change the way it works to be more reective of the needs of citizens, and as a result, increase its overall legitimacy and trust among the wider population. Further, the reforms can have a commonsense appeal to them: take a recent example from India published in the Hindustan Times, which describes the importance of diversity for Indian police: ‘Not being inclusive and not having adequate representation from diverse communities adversely aects police response and performance especially in its dealing with marginalised sections of society. Access to justice for such disadvantaged communities becomes more dicult.’16 There are several major problems with this approach. First, for a variety of reasons, most police forces seem incapable of diversifying their recruitment. Moreover, there is an expedience to this approach – such as putting up a few posters or running some recruitment advertising campaigns – that does not require substantive change to the organisation. Second, it ignores the historical function of policing which has adversely targeted and terrorised the very groups it now seeks to include. Third, the assumption that diversication changes the policing of diverse

## The failure of reform

groups within the community, or indeed changes policing more generally, seems dramatically misplaced. There is an essentialism to the basic idea that identity based on gender or ethnicity or race will trump institutional culture and practices, rather than become absorbed into the fabric of police work regarding, for example, stop and searches, the use of force, proling and the targeting/overpolicing of particular types of oences, social groups, neighbourhoods, or other locations. There are many examples that could be used to illustrate the problems with achieving diversication. In India there are reserved positions within police forces for scheduled castes (Dalit), scheduled tribes (Adivasi), and ‘other backward classes’. In addition, the Ministry of Home Aairs require State governments to increase the representation of women to at least 33 per cent of the police force. Only a small minority of the 28 States and eight Union Territories have lled their reserve quotas, and the proportion of women in police forces nationally is 12 per cent.17 At the present rate of change it will take decades for many States, and in some cases more than 100 years, to meet the target for women ocers.18 The marginalised groups that are recruited into the police remain concentrated in the lower echelons of the force, and reect the broad social, political, and economic hierarchies of power in Indian society. A particular colonial relic has been preserved whereby constables are required to work as orderlies (essentially personal servants) for senior ocers, thus reinforcing their subservience.19 These problems of recruitment, racism, and entrenched discrimination within the police are hardly particular to India. In Australia, First Nations people are under-represented by about one third in the composition of the nation’s police.20 In addition, there is a long history of complaints of racist treatment towards Aboriginal ocers within the police service.21 It is not surprising that employment targets are not met. Furthermore, if police power reproduces caste, class, gender, and racial divisions within the institution, as in both the Indian and Australian examples, why would we expect police practices towards the public to be fair and inclusive? What happens though when police forces do diversify? In the US, the composition of police forces is roughly equal to the national population gures, particularly for Black and White

## Defund the Police

ocers. Alex Vitale has reviewed the evidence on whether the racial background of an ocer aects the use of force. He concludes that ‘most studies show no eect … a few indicate that black ocers are more likely to use force or make arrests, especially of black civilians’.22 At a departmental level, ‘More diverse police forces fare no better in measures of community satisfaction, especially among nonwhite residents. … Both New York and Philadelphia have highly diverse forces … both have come under intense scrutiny for excessive use of force and discriminatory practices such as “stop and frisk”’.23 As discussed in previous chapters, individual policing involves discretion, but it is also driven by operational priorities set by local, divisional, and departmental directives which are themselves guided by the broader political context of crime control policies. Tough on crime and law and order agendas inevitably target poor, workingclass and racialised communities. The nature of police power does not change because an ocer is a woman or Black.
Training
After half a century or more of recommendations for improved police training, we might have expected that various public inquiries would have grown tired of recommending more of the same. However, like appeals to diversity, the expectations that training will improve policing and resolve problems of racism, violence, and discrimination remains deeply embedded in the liberal agenda for reform. It’s an easy recommendation to make – one that involves little thought, can be applied to almost anything, and gives the appearance of addressing the issue in a practical, achievable and measurable way. Most importantly it does not upset anyone unnecessarily (particularly senior police and police unions) and is good for business – police receive more resources, consultants and trainers make money, and police can claim greater professionalism. However, the evidence of eective change is far from compelling. Stuart Hall’s scathing comments on British attempts at ‘Racism Awareness Training’ during the 1980s and 1990s were cited previously. Yet, advocates continue to promote anti- racism, diversity, and implicit bias training. In relation to the US, the

## The failure of reform

research indicates this training has no long- term impact on problems ‘like racial disparities in trac stops or marijuana arrests; both implicit and explicit bias remain’.24 While anti-bias training may impact for short periods of time, it does not last. Many police ocers, including those involved in police killings, have received various de-escalation, anti-bias and cultural awareness training. For example, the NYPD implemented anti-bias and de-escalation training, and over half of the patrol force has been ‘certied in a crisis intervention training involving de-escalation techniques’.25 In 2018, NYPD ocers had implicit bias training as part of a $4.5 million contract with Fair and Impartial Policing.26 A later evaluation found that while police had a greater awareness of bias and discrimination, there was no reduction in disparities in enforcement.27 Part of the problem is that strategies like ZTP will inevitably focus on low level oending by poor people, which will also more likely be Indigenous, Black, or communities of colour. As Alex Vitale remarks, that’s not because of the biases or misunderstandings of police ocers, it ‘is how the system is designed to operate’.28 Much of the other training in police academies and in the eld militate against de-escalation training. Indeed, in the case of the killer of George Floyd, ocer Derek Chauvin was an operational eld trainer at the time.29 Particular use of force techniques like chokeholds may be banned by police departments, but still used in practice, as was the case in the police killing of Eric Garner. Further, it is not only use of force but who it is used against – as demonstrated throughout this book, lethal and non-lethal violence is directed against racialised and marginalised groups. Human Rights Watch suggests that legal changes such as those introduced in New York state after the death of Eric Garner which prohibit the use of chokeholds, ‘while welcome, will likely have little eect on policing because they rely too much on an ocer’s easily abused discretion and, without more fundamental changes, can be replaced by other easily abused uses of force’.30 Indeed, part of the problem with police training is the overemphasis on deadly force. Various commentators have detailed the use of independent training companies in the US that train both police and military personnel and emphasise ‘military-style approaches and the “warrior mentality” ’.31 In addition, there is

## Defund the Police

the number of serving police who were former military personnel. This issue came to the fore in Australia during 2022 when a former soldier and then a Northern Territory police ocer Zachary Rolfe was charged with murder after shooting dead a 19-year-old Aboriginal youth Kumanjayi Walker from Yuendumu while the youth was being held down by another police ocer. He was acquitted by a jury with no Aboriginal members. Rolfe had a history of multiple assaults on Aboriginal people during arrest, of allegedly falsifying reports in three of the incidents, and negative comments about his honesty by a judge.32 Ex-military recruits are sought after by police services in many countries, and may be oered waivers on certain requirements, given other preferential recruitment, and provided with additional benets. It is dicult to locate the number of ex-military serving in police forces, although research from the US shows that 19 per cent of police ocers are veterans and that it is the third most common occupation for veterans after truck driving and management.33 A national survey of police ocers in the US also found that 28 per cent reported current or prior military service.34 US research indicates that former military personnel are signicantly more likely than other police to have red their weapons while on duty, are over-represented among police who have had use-of-force complaints led against them, and are over-represented in fatal police shootings.35 One area of substantial discussion on police training relates to people with a disability. As noted in Chapter 7, this has become particularly relevant in recent years because of the signicant number of people with disabilities killed by police, especially during what are meant to be welfare checks.36 Reforms to policing have focused on changes to police training, operational procedures, and guidelines, and have proved to be completely inadequate because they misunderstand the nature of policing – particularly when non-compliance escalates the police response.37 The Police Accountability Project observes that in Victoria, Australia, the police Operational Safety and Tactics Training and more specically the Tactical Options Model reinforce the problem, ‘When a person who police are interacting with becomes distressed, upset, argumentative, swears or otherwise displays uncooperative behaviours, police “scale-up” their response

## The failure of reform

accordingly. This escalated response then prompts further distress, fear or anxiety, to which police respond to accordingly’.38 Added to the problem has been an increasingly armed and aggressive police response to people with disabilities despite decades of reform attempts.39 There appears to be no evidence that police disability awareness training has improved the knowledge and skills of police ocers: a systematic review of the published literature on training provided to police ocers found limited evidence for the eectiveness of police disability sensitivity programmes.40 The prevalence of people with disabilities in police shootings and as victims of other police violence does not appear to have reduced in frequency despite various training programmes.41 Changes to training also does not appear to have impacted on police responses to people with disability who have been victims of sexual violence, particularly women.42 A further area where there has been constant demand for improved police training, with seemingly poor results, has been in response to domestic violence. As noted in Chapter 6, criminal justice responses have been ineective and negatively impact on First Nations, Black, and other minoritised women and men. Although the need to improve police training is a constant refrain, research indicates that police culture impacts on decision-making around domestic violence through, for example, the ‘pervasive, stereotypical assumptions about victim behaviour’ and whether there is ‘visible or physical violence’.43 A US National Institute of Justice Report found that general domestic violence training for police does not necessarily change attitudes toward domestic violence or, more important, change police behaviour.44 As Goodmark has observed,
     Hundreds of millions of federal dollars have already
     been committed to the training of police ocers on
     domestic violence, with equivocal results for people
     subjected to abuse. … Resources should be used
     on services for people subjected to abuse instead of
     continuing to pour money into police coers for
     training that does not seem to fundamentally change
     the quality of the law enforcement response to
     domestic violence.45

## Defund the Police

The focus on training diverts attention away from larger questions around the ineffectiveness of policing and criminalisation approaches to domestic violence because it disregards ‘the structural issues that drive abuse, and that rob women of autonomy and ignore women’s needs’.46 These questions go to the heart of the problem of police reform through training. It takes no account of the role of police as an institution in maintaining inequality: economic, racial, ableist, and gendered. It ignores the deeper cultural values that underpin policing – embedded ideas of the legitimate victim, the stereotypical oender and what ‘real’ crime looks like. And there is the tangible problem of what the Australian RCADIC referred to as a failure of the duty of care, or what Vitale calls a ‘problem of values’ which we see writ large over and over in deaths in police custody – it is the sheer indierence by police to a person’s well-being and whether they live or die.

## Technologies and techniques

Technical xes for police abuse are also popular – the idea that the deployment of ‘less than lethal’, ‘non- lethal’, and other technologies will improve policing. It was advocated by the Kerner Commission in the US back in the mid 1960s with the use of tear gas, and has been furthered ever since: tasers, CS spray, and now body cameras are the most recent development. The two basic points in relation to technical xes like tasers are that rstly, they are in fact lethal and maiming when used incorrectly or abused by police ocers, and second, they have supplemented lethal weapons, not replaced them.47 Chapter 5 has already discussed the misuse of tasers and CS spray by police and the targets of misuse – in particular Black, First Nations, and people with disabilities. Over recent years, police body- worn cameras have been promoted as a way to ensure the accountability of police. A systematic review of the evidence on body cameras found that they did not have clear or consistent eects on most ocer or citizen behaviour,48 with some studies in the US showing higher rates of civilian deaths where cameras are deployed.49 Perhaps there is a belief that the footage justies the action. As a number of commentators have noted, the images are not neutral – they are open to the interpretation of experts through a frame-by-frame

## The failure of reform

analysis which can reconstitute events in particular ways. Further, the cameras individualise interactions and sever them from the socio-political context in which they occur: a police stop may look innocent but it fails to capture the racist targeting of particular individuals – ‘the recorded image is never neutral in a racist society’.50 A major issue is also the lack of police compliance. The Washington Post database on police fatal shootings showed that there were body camera recordings of only 14 per cent of 6,578 deaths between 2015 and September 2021.51 Despite the widespread distribution of body cameras to the NYPD from 2017 onwards, the CCRB complaint investigations conrm that police routinely fail to follow the NYPD policy which requires ocers to activate their cameras in various instances. Further, police use various signals to indicate to other ocers whether their cameras are activated or not.52 The struggle for police legitimacy is not only about the use of technical xes provided by hardware like body cams and tasers. It is also about policing techniques in the broader sense, which involve legitimation through the application of methods and procedures, especially those that can claim authority as being in some way neutral and scientic. ZTP was based on a simplistic and deeply conservative theory which tted well with police managerialism of the 1990s; it provided a rationale for the allocation of police resources towards less serious public order oences and for the accountability of line managers – not to the public or the policed but to senior managers and politicians who could claim tactical victories in the war on crime, on drugs, on terror, etc. ZTP lives on with variations on ‘hot spot’ policing and a focus on minor crime in poor communities. However, the modalities of police power and language have changed with the rise of EBP, problem-oriented policing, and predictive policing. According to the blurb of a recent book, ‘Evidence-based policing is based on the straightforward, but powerful, idea that crime prevention and crime control policy should be based on what works best in promoting public safety, as determined by the best available scientific evidence’.53 Problem-oriented policing has some overlap with EBP, and focuses on eectiveness in resolving crime problems. EBP poses the question of what works in policing. A critical approach to EBP is to ask: What works best for whom,

## Defund the Police

and for whom does policing work? While there are multiple critiques of EBP on the basis of its narrow conceptualisations of evidence, it is the wider lack of reexivity that is questioned by the calls to defund the police. The appeals to evidence and science displace the need to question police power as a requisite condition for maintaining embedded systems of inequality and oppression. Ironically enough, some have called for a greater investment in EBP as a response to the Defund the Police movement with the view that if we know what works and, just as importantly, what doesn’t work (like police body cams and anti-bias training), we can create more ecient and accountable police.54 However, as Betts notes, EBP has reached a hegemonic position in policing which silences and excludes other ideas about policing from consideration, and reinforces state denitions of crime and criminality.55 Further, EBP assumes that police policy is determined on the basis of rational assessment; and that science itself is neutral. The mathematical ‘science’ of predictive policing particularly highlights the latter problem. Predictive policing has emerged with the development of new algorithmic techniques for the predictions of crime which aims to stop crime before it occurs. It relies on data from a range of sources, including, for example, facial recognition technologies, police body cams, video surveillance systems, automatic vehicle number plate recognition and social media data.56 Various corporations sell software to police departments including Microsoft, Amazon, ShotSpotter, Mark43, and Axon (who are also the major manufacturer of tasers and police body cameras). However, algorithms and AI involve assumptions which have adverse social consequences, particularly for racialised groups – a problem which is evident in various scenarios from the London Metropolitan Police’s Gangs Matrix database to the policing of Black teenagers in Melbourne.57 Ugwudike demonstrates that the ‘structural and creational dimensions of prediction technologies … can give rise to racialising eects such as the over-prediction of risks ascribed to racialised people’.58 The evidence rebuts the liberal ideology of race neutrality and the claim that scientic standardisation eliminates racial bias. In 2020, more than 1,400 US mathematicians signed a petition criticising PredPol, a corporation that produces software for predictive policing, because of racial

## The failure of reform

biases in the software. PredPol software was used by the LAPD.59 The Stop LAPD Spying Coalition showed that:
      The same month LAPD stopped using PredPol, it
      announced a surveillance framework entitled ‘DataInformed Community-Focused Policing’ that claims
      police will now use mass data to ‘measure results,
      improve eciency, and provide overall accountability’.
      Soon after, PredPol reincorporated as Geolitica and
      undertook a nearly identical rebranding, changing its
      slogan from ‘The Predictive Policing Company™’ to
      ‘Data-Driven Community Policing’.60
ShotSpotter is another company that has come under scrutiny for its gunshot detection technology, especially after it was linked to the police killing of a 13-year-old boy in Chicago in early
2021. The technology uses acoustic listening devices to identify
gunshot locations and relies on algorithms and AI. ShotSpotter is in use in 124 cities and counties mostly in the US, but also in Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and South Africa.61 Research based on a study of 68 large US cities found that the results suggest that ‘implementing ShotSpotter technology has no signicant impact on rearm-related homicides or arrest outcomes’. The authors argue that policy solutions relating to the carrying of rearms may represent ‘a more cost-eective measure to reduce urban rearm violence’.62

## Community policing

An item on many reform lists is community policing, not necessarily as a mechanism for democratising policing, but certainly as a process for building police legitimacy. In the 1980s, it was connected to ‘problem solving policing’, whereby the police were to build relationships and work with communities to solve local crime problems. However, it was always dicult to see how community policing would sit with the problem of overpoliced racialised, marginalised, and Indigenous communities – especially when these communities see themselves as the object of constant police surveillance, continual stop and searches by police, saturation

## Defund the Police

policing, and intervention by aggressive police paramilitary units.63 This was a problem that Stuart Hall identied with the Scarman Inquiry back in 1980s, and is just as relevant today: community policing is overridden by racialised and oppressive police practices, and various ‘community consultative committees’ have very little power to change police practice.64 Community policing is perhaps the most over-used legitimating idea behind the liberal agenda for police reform. It dates back to the Peelian concept of the London police and has never disappeared from our policing vocabulary since. Yet as demonstrated in this book, it has always been part of a mythology of policing. Community policing was largely irrelevant to colonial policing; and today it is dicult to imagine anything more removed from the community than phalanxes of riot police shooting tear gas, rubber bullets, and at times live rounds into eeing crowds. If we fast forward more than three decades from Scarman to President Obama’s 2015 Task Force on 21st Century Policing, we nd community policing is again a key recommendation. In the same year, the NYPD launched a community policing plan ‘One City: Safe and Fair Everywhere’ to develop positive police and community relationships. An independent review of the programme found that it had stalled. In commenting on the NYPD plan, HRW observed that:
     activists have found that community policing serves to
     legitimize and expand the role of police in everyday
     lives, and contributes to a greater police presence and
     surveillance without solving the underlying social
     problems that contribute to crime. Where Human
     Rights Watch has examined ‘community policing’
     reforms, we have made similar critiques and observed
     that they tend to emphasize the public perception of
     police without changing harmful behaviors.65
As has been noted often enough, police community consultative committees tend to be hand-picked and do not represent the targets of police interventions. Yet even if they were comprised, for example, of the poor, the homeless, and people with disabilities, it is legitimate to question whether they would have any serious

impact on policing strategies. Community policing exists to police the community, not to control the police.66

## Police accountability

Criminal prosecutions of police officers involved in lethal violence are rare, and convictions even rarer. For example, not one police ocer in England and Wales has been found guilty of murder or manslaughter following a death in custody or after police contact since INQUEST started recording deaths in 1990, despite nearly 1,800 deaths either in police custody, through police pursuits or from police shootings.67 These are global problems. In South Africa, the civilian oversight body, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) has been accused of poor investigations and closing cases prematurely to boost its performance indicators, despite a 9 per cent increase in complaints against police.68 In Kenya, killings by police are unaddressed. The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) has been unable to investigate and prosecute over 2,000 incidents of police killings currently on its les. It has managed six successful prosecutions since its establishment in 2011.69 Similarly, in Ghana, there is a lack of police oversight which continues ‘the inuence of the colonial militaristic orientation to policing, with its quintessential lack of accountability and respect for the fundamental rights of citizens’.70 In Malaysia, HRW has outlined deaths in police custody, violence, and abuse of human rights, and the lack of transparency and any meaningful system of accountability.71 Accountability and oversight mechanisms are notoriously limited through lack of independence, eectiveness, and legitimacy. In contrast to this reality, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has found that because of the heightened duty of care placed on the State for individuals who are deprived of their liberty, there is ‘a presumption of State responsibility for deaths in custody which can only be rebutted through a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation carried out by an independent body’.72 There is no shortage of regional and international human rights standards and academic literature outlining the eective processes that should apply to police accountability mechanisms.

## Defund the Police

The standards are typically not realised, although some countries fall short of them more than others. We might consider the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) in Hong Kong where the Chief Executive chooses the Chair. After violent police responses to pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019–2020, some 8,000 complaints were led against police, only 242 were referred to the IPCC and of these only two ocers were reprimanded for ‘harsh language’.73 In India, despite a Supreme Court directive in 2006 on police reforms, only one state is fully compliant and two states partially compliant with the Court’s directive relating to the establishment of police complaint authorities.74 Moreover, it is dicult to meaningfully talk about accountability mechanisms in jurisdictions where the use of torture is routine, extrajudicial killings are frequent, and corruption by police, other justice ocials, and politicians is commonplace. There are many hopeful statements on the need for civilian oversight – such as the US President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing who opined that ‘there are important arguments for having civilian oversight even though we lack strong research evidence that it works’. The ‘arguments’ by the Taskforce reiterate the importance of police legitimacy – of paramount concern to those whose primary aim is the preservation of existing policing institutions.75 Even where multiple mechanisms for oversight exist, these may all fail to deliver accountability. For example, after the violent abuse by the NYPD of protesters in 2020, HRW considered the current available avenues of accountability including internal oversight, independent external oversight bodies (there are three bodies for the NYPD), judicial oversight, and other avenues such as civil lawsuits. It documented their limitations and failings and concluded that
     Despite the harm caused to the protesters, and violations
     of international human rights law, constitutional civil
     rights protections, and the NYPD’s guidelines, police
     ocers and their supervisors are unlikely to face any
     disciplinary or legal consequences. This is due to a
     deeply entrenched system that prevents meaningful
     scrutiny and allows ocers and police departments
     to commit abuses with impunity. Existing structures

## The failure of reform

      in the United States to hold police ocers to account
      for misconduct and abuses are largely ineective.76
Similarly, in Canada, the NIMMIWG report found that police services are able to ‘infringe and violate the human rights of Indigenous women … without remedy and recourse’. The Inquiry found that existing oversight and accountability mechanisms were inadequate and failed to ‘elicit the condence of Indigenous peoples’.77 There are a range of technical questions about the nature of oversight bodies in terms of understanding their eectiveness – are they truly independent (not just institutionally but also culturally and politically), are they resourced properly, can they initiate their own inquiries and investigations (with civilian investigators), are hearings public, and so on.78 These are important questions, however, there are also issues with criminal prosecutions and civil claims that limit accountability, including the various legal processes in many countries that protect police from successful prosecution or being dismissed from their employment, for example, Law Enforcement Ocers Bills of Rights, qualied immunity or immunity when acting in good faith, and the requirement for prosecutions to be approved by government.79 Even the best systems of oversight and accountability are often limited by the relative political power of police institutions and police associations, and thus the success rate for police complaints remains low. Ultimately the questions of oversight and accountability relate to the nature of policing itself and police power. Increases in policing and police powers, exceptional laws for the various ‘wars’ on drugs, terror and crime, the apparent easy collapsing of police and military roles, the rise of ‘presumptive enemies’ who may not have committed oences, and the political champions of always ‘more police’ have all militated against eective police scrutiny.80

## Conclusion

This chapter points to the failure of police reform and raises some fundamental questions for advocates of defunding the police and for abolitionists more generally. We know that most police reforms represent stories of constant failure. Yet despite this they

## Defund the Police

are endlessly repeated. Meanwhile, policing is expanding into new terrains on the back of corporations using Big Data for systems of surveillance and control, while also strengthening connections in old terrains including the police/military/colonial nexus. The routine use of violence, the profound racial and other disparities in policing, and the failures of police accountability and oversight challenge policing’s foundational legitimating ideologies of consent, fairness, and the rule of law and which underpin liberal agendas of reform. The limits of incremental reforms in bringing about real change are painfully obvious. The question that arises, then, is how do we respond to police reform? Many commentators have argued that movements for police accountability and reform – like Defund the Police – must look not to ‘reform’ police, but to reduce their scope and power. At the same time, they should also be working towards transformative justice practices and demanding the provision of jobs, housing, education, and healthcare.81 Abolitionists speak of an abolition horizon – the future point of police and carceral abolition. Ruth Wilson Gilmore states that abolition is about ‘building the future from the present’.82 This work of building involves strategic decisions about reform – about understanding which reforms take us closer to the horizon of abolition.83 There is a fault line which ultimately separates abolitionist views of Defund the Police from reformist positions and that is whether the proposed changes expand or contract policing (and the criminal legal system more generally). It is about being able to distinguish between ‘reformist’ and ‘non-reformist’ demands for change. Reformism expands and strengthens the existing policing and penal system, rather than challenging it. Indeed, criminal legal institutions are able to command ever greater resources through reformism, and police and penal power is enhanced, not contested. The types of reforms advocated for by various governmental inquiries discussed in this chapter are clearly reformist: greater resources for training, technological xes, non-lethal alternatives, and various new and old techniques (EBP, community policing, predictive policing, etc). In contrast to reformism, changes which diminish the role of police include, for example, redirecting calls for service away from police, developing community safety programmes that do not rely on police and penal power, disarming police, and legal and

## The failure of reform

policy changes that decriminalise behaviours or otherwise reduce policing and shrink police and carceral budgets. The importance of any one of these changes is that they are not simply seen as an end in themselves (although the end is a social benet), but they are contextualised within an overall strategy to replace policing. What we replace policing with is the subject of Chapter 9. For now, though, it is important to recognise that not everything suggested here is clear-cut. At the mid- point on the Defunding the Police spectrum between abolitionism and reformism, there are multiple ambiguous grey areas. For example, is the democratic control of existing police institutions and an eective system of police accountability achievable? Will prosecuting police ocers for murder and other acts of violence ensure justice? There are not always straightforward, denitive answers to these questions. As Mariame Kaba recognises,
     People think you’re either interested in reform or
     you’re an abolitionist – that you have to choose to be
     in one camp or the other. I don’t think that way. For
     some people, reform is the main focus and end goal
     and for some people, abolition is the horizon. But
     I don’t know anybody who is an abolitionist who
     doesn’t support some reforms.84
The question of police accountability is probably the most dicult of all, particularly when there is both a widespread demand that civilian oversight boards respond to complaints against police and that police be prosecuted for criminal oences, while at same time recognising the ‘justice system’ is incapable of actually delivering justice – in fact the most it delivers is the furtherance of its own carceral ends through imprisonment. Alternative approaches to achieving justice are required and there is a need to engage in dialogue and reection that works to build solidarity across various endeavours. We know that collective action and protest outside of the criminal legal system can force governments to respond – however piecemeal that may be. However, collective action can do much more than this in building other ways of responding to the concerns of communities that do not require policing at all.

## What is to be done?

Before we directly address the question, it is important to restate some of the basic propositions from the Defund the Police movement, and abolitionism more generally. The rst is that it is about presence, not absence. It is focused on building the type of society that does not require heavily armed police and mass imprisonment. For Ruth Wilson Gilmore, for example, it is both a long-term goal and a practical policy programme that requires investment in social goods that enable a productive life. ‘It’s obvious that the system won’t disappear overnight … no abolitionist thinks that will be the case’. Reforms are needed, but they need to be reforms that actually change the order.1 As Patrisse Cullors acknowledges, ‘we need to have a movement around divestment – to divest from police and prisons and surveillance and to use that money to reinvest in the communities that are most directly impacted by poverty and the violence of poverty’.2 The second proposition which is foundational to answering the question of what is to be done is developing a movement built around alliances. The Defund the Police movement has brought together a range of groups across diering perspectives and with various agendas. While there may be a common view on the need to take resources away from police and to expand and develop community responses to social needs, there is less uniformity on the question of abolitionism – that is whether the police and prisons should be abolished. Gilmore has consistently stressed the need for creating and building alliances – the need to build a popular front to make connections and pursue

## What is to be done?

transitional goals: ‘Solidarity is something that’s made and remade and remade. It never just is’, thus it is good practice for ‘people engaged in the spectrum of social justice struggles to gure out unexpected sites where their agendas align’.3 Building alliances also needs to avoid what Davis and Martinez referred to as the ‘oppression Olympics’.4 Building coalitions for challenging, defunding, and moving to abolish the police requires thinking about the connections between groups of people who bear the brunt of state violence, criminalisation, and imprisonment, and the common interests and connections that exist, rather than emphasising hierarchies of oppression. Dean Spade speaks of the need to develop ‘a multi-issue and solidarity-based approach because … lives are cross-cut by many dierent experiences of vulnerability’.5 This leads to the third proposition, which is the need for ways of doing things that do not involve police. Mariame Kaba and Andrea Ritchie’s disarmingly simple question, ‘why are we asking the police to stop being the police over and over again?’ belies the greater complexity about alternatives or options.6 The minimalist view of Defund the Police is that government should reallocate resources away from police to other sectors – supported by arguments such as those at the Brookings Institute that increases in funding for police do not signicantly relate to a decrease in crime, but support, for instance, for education and employment does. Or a similar argument in the UK that ‘sensible’ public policy decision-making requires assessment of the most eective ways of expending public resources.7 A more signicant demand is for a radical democratisation of the state which challenges policing as a practice that occurs beyond the police and the criminal legal system and involves social welfare, child protection, education and health systems in the web of policing Indigenous, racialised, working-class, and other marginalised peoples. Here the political programme is more ambitious and seeks to ‘transform the state by building democratic institutions that distribute social, economic, and political power more equitably’.8 Finally, to what extent do we need to think beyond the state? Mutual aid approaches pursue transformative change by addressing community needs through collective action outside of the state.9 Further, for decolonial theorists like Mignolo, there is no hope of reforming state

## Defund the Police

processes because the state is a fundamental dimension of the colonial matrix of power. Thus decoloniality, ‘is not a task that States could enact’.10 The nal proposition is the recognition that the state is a colonial state in which the police and the military are core components. Therefore, the struggle to defund the police must be a struggle for decolonisation. The popular challenge to police violence and unaccountability has extended in various forms across most parts of the world, and there is a strong connection between the political and intellectual programmes of abolitionism and decolonialism. This book has argued that the foundations of the contemporary institutions of policing are found in the interplay between the centre and periphery of the colonial experience. However, neither the praxis of decolonialism, nor the programme of Defund the Police, can be universally prescribed – it will be dierentiated along a range of axes, determined by historical and contemporary contingencies. Despite the global uprising in 2020 against police and state violence, the prole of BLM and Defund the Police and indeed contemporary abolitionism more generally, has tended to be dominated by the countries of the global north, especially the US. As Angela Davis and colleagues have argued, ‘US-centric discourses and organising can saturate contemporary abolitionist political movements, reinforcing and deepening US imperialism and potentially eliding local histories of violence and resistance’.11 The local histories of police oppression and resistance have been a theme throughout this book. In summary then, the discussion on practical options to police power is built on the premise of activism in creating solidarity for change across a spectrum of broadly like-minded groups. It sees this struggle as global and decolonial, dened in its specicity by the multiple intersecting groups who bear the burden of police violence and oppression: women, Indigenous peoples, Black and other racialised groups, people with disabilities, and people living in poor, working-class, and overpoliced communities. It calls for imaginative and radical change to remove policing as we understand it through an arrangement of alternative strategies and institutions – not all of which can be laid out in advance.12

## What is to be done?

## Practical options/structural change

There is no shortage of practical options13 for reducing police numbers, police interventions, police budgets, and police power. Many community-based organisations, philanthropic and other research centres, and individuals have provided extensive evidence of viable options for reducing the police presence within society. These are the intermediate steps we can take to reduce policing and restructure our relationships, in Mariame Kaba’s words, ‘on the way to abolition’.14 And there are lists of reformist changes that should not be supported because they further entrench police power – including the specic examples of reformism identied in Chapter 8. It needs to be emphasised that the precise focus of any programme for change is dependent on local historical, political, legal, and administrative contexts which will vary considerably from state to state and country to country – not every item listed here is an issue in every jurisdiction, but many are. Box 9.1 is an amalgamation of multiple sources from activist organisations and scholars working to develop options and programmes for change – it does not claim to be either comprehensive or prescriptive.15

It is not possible in the context of this book to discuss every strategy identied in Box 9.1 and there is considerable literature which already does.16 Here I provide a focus on a number of general issues and strategies that are particularly important, given the nature of police violence and repression. Citizen and community action is essential in building support and solidarity for diminishing and removing police presence, and for providing community education around what police do, how much they cost, and what they don’t do (solve crime). There are various community education ‘toolkits’ available in multiple countries, and there is no need to repeat their content here.17 One area of community activism where there has been less attention is the development of open-source databases, for example, with the development of ‘problem police’ databases in the US. These include open-source police brutality databases to ll the gap in the lack of public information on a range of issues relating to death and violence caused by ocers. As noted in Chapter 5, there are various databases on police killings, but this is only a fraction of the story. For example, the Accountable Now site is collecting data on police use of force from a variety of sources.18 Databases have been established on police ocers accused of misconduct, such as the Citizens Police Data Project in Chicago which identies individual ocers and provides aggregate statistics, including on ocers with ten or more complaints against them who generate 64 per cent of all complaints.19 In New York the Cop Accountability Project has the CAPstat database based on civil rights lawsuits against NYPD. It can be searched by name, badge number, and location.20 In addition, The Washington Post has developed an interactive website on the nancial costs of police misconduct

## What is to be done?

to the community.21 The newspaper collected data on nearly 40,000 payments at 25 of the nation’s largest police departments over the last decade and identied more than $3.2 billion spent to settle claims against ocers. The database is searchable by city, ocers, type of lawsuit, and settlement. A further nancial development is bond analysts’ calling for the incorporation of the cost of lawsuit settlements for police misconduct, as well as municipal budgets with ‘over-reliance’ on nes, and indicators in inequality when rating the value of municipal bonds.22 There is also the opportunity to build divestment campaigns around the corporations that prot from policing, similar to those that name the corporate sector players that prot from prisons and immigration detention.23

## Disability activists demand an end to policing

Many disabled people all over the world nd themselves in situations of precarity: poverty, marginalisation, and connement. Policing and carcerality are integral to controlling disability globally, but the extent to which they do that and how they achieve these ends differ depending on context.24 Activist responses vary but are aimed at decarceral options. However, much of the literature on defunding the police and abolitionism in the disability space emanates from the global north. The specicity of this origin does not make it ‘wrong’, but we also cannot expect that it can be emulated without understanding specic contexts. One of the most frequently cited community- run and responsive models for mental health crisis support that does not involve police is the Crisis Assistance Helping out on the Streets (CAHOOTS) programme in Eugene and Springeld, Oregon and has been adapted in other parts of the US.25 It is based on harm reduction and trauma-informed care, and operates as a consensusbased collective. The programme operates 24/7 and dispatches unarmed civilian teams of crisis intervention workers and medics or nurses to respond to emergency and non-emergency calls involving people experiencing behavioural health crises – calls which would normally be directed to police. More than 60 per cent of the clients are homeless, and 30 per cent live with severe and persistent mental illness.26 CAHOOTS provides a range of

## Defund the Police

functions, including: unarmed de-escalation, crisis counselling, suicide prevention, conict mediation, grief and loss support, welfare checks, substance abuse support, housing crisis, harm reduction, information and referral, rst aid and non-emergency medical care. It also oers connections and transportation to various medical and social services to help support clients’ longerterm needs.27 The services are non-coercive, and prioritise informed decisionmaking by the person in crisis. The use of trained civilians who have lived experience of behavioural health conditions as crisis workers highlights the importance of peer responders as an eective and accessible crisis intervention strategy.28 The most common types of calls diverted from police to CAHOOTS are welfare checks (35 per cent), transportation to services (35 per cent), and for public assistance (66 per cent); some calls may require more than one response type. Of the estimated 24,000 calls responded to by CAHOOTS in 2019, only 150 required police backup – approximately 0.6 per cent.29 It is estimated that COHOOTS’s call out costs are around one third to one quarter the cost of police.30 While the CAHOOTS model is US based, there are core principles which underpin the approach that have broader applicability. A fundamental starting point is to avoid the mistake of responding to disability by furthering the criminal legal system through more police training, more specialist courts, more statecontrolled diversion programmes, and so forth. There are examples of co-response models to mental health crises in various countries outside the US. However, most still involve police. CAHOOTS shows that only a tiny percentage of requests actually require a police response. The principle at play here is the need to remove police and the criminal legal system from the assistance being oered. The combination of a medic to address medical needs, and a trained peer support worker with lived experience to be able to oer understanding and support and de-escalate a crisis situation are paramount. It is precisely the opposite of police responses which often rely on compulsion and loss of dignity and can easily escalate into force and violence. Removing police from response teams is an important development, but it does not in itself expand the availability

## What is to be done?

of community-based mental health and other services such as accommodation and support. Services are fundamental. How they are developed, who they are delivered by, and to whom they are accountable are also vital issues. If an approach like CAHOOTS does not have options for further referral and assistance, then the same dilemma of eventual criminal legal intervention and/ or forced medicalisation remains. Simply removing police from initial intervention reduces the likelihood of violent encounters but ultimately does not work as a decarceral approach unless there is an increase in available community-based services.

## Community responders

Rechannelling calls for police service can take multiple forms, from providing alternative community-based responses to calls about noise complaints, homeless people, people with disability including for welfare checks, as well as property oences and motor vehicle accidents where reports are made essentially for insurance reasons. The principle behind community responders offers opportunities for developing responses to a broader range of issues. Community responders should be ‘credible messengers’ who have ‘strong ties to the community, oftentimes with a personal history of overcoming violence or justice system involvement, who are able to connect to community residents based on their shared background and experiences’.31 There are two areas of common calls for service to emergency police numbers where community responders could intervene. First, they could attend calls related to homelessness, behavioural health crises, and substance (mis)use. These calls might currently be classified by emergency dispatchers as wellness checks, disturbances, drug overdoses, intoxicated persons, or mental health crises. These responders would then typically include a peer responder and a paramedic.32 The second group of calls for service relate to so-called ‘quality-of-life’ matters and low-level community conicts that do not require a mental health team. These might include calls that are classied as suspicious persons, disorderly conduct, noise complaints, juvenile disturbances, or trespassing.33 There has been considerable discussion on how the community responder model works, and practical options

## Defund the Police

of community responder schemes which are already in place.34 Violence interrupters have been promoted as trained ‘credible messengers’ who use their social standing to mediate conict before it escalates.35 The decriminalisation of public order or ‘quality of life’ oences and street level drug oences would assist in both removing a police presence and with developing community responder models. It has been proposed that civilian oces of neighbourhood or public safety at city or regional levels could full signicant tasks in organising non- police civilian services, such as violence interrupters, transformative mentoring and transitional employment and training for justice-involved residents and in coordinating responses to calls for service.36
What is to be done about violence against women?
Aya Gruber, the author of The Feminist War on Crime, has commented that:
     The evidence is clear: dialling back aggressive policing,
     even without other changes, promises to benet women,
     especially those living in low-income communities of
     color. Investing in programs proved to reduce violence
     and increase victims’ well-being, instead of policing,
     is even better. The question ‘What about domestic
     violence?’ is better understood not as a critique of
     defunding the police but as an argument for it.37
Like many other areas of more progressive social policy, substantial work has been completed on options for responding to domestic violence which do not involve the police and criminalisation as a stock response.38 Leigh Goodmark invites us to consider a dierent path from the criminal legal system that instead incorporates economic, public health, community, and human rights policies. Economic abuse is a form of domestic violence experienced by the majority of women in violent relationships, and economic instability prevents women from leaving abusive relationships. Individual and structural programmes that increase economic security for women are an important alternative to criminalisation

## What is to be done?

policies.39 Likewise, public health responses to domestic violence can involve prevention and interventions at various points from preto post-harm or abuse and at individual and structural or population levels.40 In 2017, the US CDC published a report on approaches that are eective in reducing domestic violence. The report highlighted social, economic, and environmental programmes which are shown to be eective in reducing violence including prenatal care, housing, employment, free preschool, and access to green urban spaces.41 Domestic violence and sexual assault also prevents women from realising their human rights as full and equal citizens and the violence also reinforces systemic and intersectional forms of discrimination against minoritised women. As shown throughout this book, the failure of policing and the criminal legal system to protect women from violence is a global problem. In 2001 a joint statement by INCITE! and Critical Resistance called on social justice movements to develop strategies and analysis that address both state and interpersonal violence, particularly violence against women. The statement identied the need to initiate community-based responses to violence that do not rely on the criminal legal system and have mechanisms that ensure safety and accountability for survivors of sexual and domestic violence.42 The statement noted that transformative practices emerging from local communities should be documented and disseminated to promote collective responses to violence. Today, many community-based organisations are working outside of the state and the criminal legal system to stop violence against women, including Sisters Inside in Australia, and Sisters Uncut in the UK. Both organisations are abolitionist and support direct action against state violence and racism as well as domestic violence and sexual assault. Sisters Inside supports sovereignty and self-determination for First Nations peoples in Australia.43 Sisters Uncut has initiated direct action opposing state violence perpetrated against migrants in detention and through forced deportations. It has also supported First Nations’ struggles for sovereignty and protest movements in Canada.44 In the US, organisations such as Sista II Sista, the Coalition Against Rape and Abuse (CARA), the Audre Lorde Project’s ‘Safe Outside the System’, Survived and Punished, and INCITE! are working within transformative justice frameworks to respond to

domestic and sexual violence in ways ‘that address social as well as individual accountability and transformation, and that do not reinforce or funnel more resources towards the main perpetrators of sexual, gender, racial, colonial, and class violence—the police and the carceral state’.45 Although not necessarily abolitionist in their outlook, other sexual assault and domestic violence organisations are promoting options that shift the focus away from policing and criminalisation. In June 2020, some 46 sexual assault and domestic violence state coalitions signed the ‘Moment of Truth’ statement which called for reframing the idea of public safety, removing police from schools, decriminalising survival, providing safe housing for everyone, and investing in care, rather than police.46 Many Indigenous women have argued that stopping violence against women must simultaneously involve opposition to the violence of the colonial state – that a decolonial position and advocacy for Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination are essential. Sarah Deer of the Muscogee (Creek) nation argues for a synthesis of safety and sovereignty whereby tribal communities can respond to and address crime in a culturally appropriate way.47 Not all First Nations positions will be completely abolitionist, but at a minimum many demand the removal of policing as a rst response, and do not see incarceration as a solution. In Australia there has been strong First Nations support for ‘on-country’ or placebased approaches to domestic and family violence. Work with communities across northern Australia found that programmes were needed which were underpinned by social and emotional wellbeing, and which focused on a range of issues facing Indigenous people, including ‘unresolved grief and loss, trauma and abuse, domestic violence, removal from family, substance misuse, family breakdown, cultural dislocation, racism and discrimination, and social disadvantage’.48 As Figure 9.1 shows, Aboriginal Law and Country are at the centre of responses, immediately followed by Indigenous practices that support and strengthen Law and Country. As one moves further away from the centre of the circle, non-Indigenous responses become more visible with, nally, non-Indigenous justice institutions like the police, courts, corrections, youth justice, and child protection agencies essentially outside the circle. Female and male Elders and respected persons need to be at the

centre of intervention wherever possible, and there needs to be greater recognition of the important role Aboriginal-controlled interventions play in preventing family and domestic violence. Mainstream systems should defer to Indigenous organisations and any role for non-Indigenous institutions must be peripheral to Aboriginal justice: ‘Achieving meaningful reductions in family violence hinges on a decolonising process that shifts power from settler to Aboriginal structures’, that utilises Aboriginal law and culture, and involves ‘strengths-based and community-led solution solutions that are culturally safe’.49
Decolonial and Indigenous community defence initiatives
Indigenous activism has been fundamental to challenging the way state police operate, and it has also been at the forefront of developing various autonomous or semi-autonomous modes of Indigenous community safety. There is a perception among many Indigenous people that western criminal justice interventions are ‘extremely poor at dealing with the underlying causes of criminal behaviour and make a negligible contribution to addressing the underlying consequences of crime in the community’. 50 The failures of these interventions are manifold. They fail at the symbolic level because there is little or no ownership of justice institutions, including police; they fail by escalating community disorder when imprisoned men and women return to communities even more traumatised than before; and they fail by continuing to separate Indigenous families – which is seen as an ongoing strategy of colonialism. Indigenous communities have a right to security, and practices of maintaining social order are required to legitimately support, ensure, and maintain community safety and harmony. While Indigenous people deserve the same level of community safety as other people, ‘what remains an issue is the way this security is provided: how it is structured and administered; how it is embedded culturally; how, and to whom, it is made open and accountable’.51 Developing and extending Indigenous modes of community safety have become an important part of Indigenous governance and capacity-building often at a localised level. They have developed in response to ineective and colonising state police who are seen as violent,

## What is to be done?

oppressive, and lacking both political and cultural legitimacy. In some settler colonial states, such as Canada and Australia, the challenge by Indigenous people has extended to contesting the sovereignty of the colonial state over Indigenous people – thus denying the foundational legitimacy of the state criminal legal system.52 In other states such as South Africa and Zimbabwe, it has been noted that Indigenous bottom-up approaches have developed to provide security when policing services are either unavailable, ineective, corrupt and/or violent and more broadly when ‘state policing falls short of providing security for citizens as it remains deeply rooted in colonial practices’.53 There are a wide variety of justice approaches that are organic to Indigenous communities and include, among others, reintegration/diversionary projects, holistic healing programmes, various anti-violence strategies, Indigenous sentencing courts, community justice groups, justice reinvestment projects, community patrols, and safe houses. These justice strategies seek to enable more eective responses to sanctioning, community reintegration, rehabilitation, social and emotional well-being, and trauma healing.54 They draw their legitimacy from Indigenous culture and the collective right to self-determination (as found in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples) For example, contemporary First Nations community safety patrols question the way state policing is built on bureaucratic authority and the threat or use of violence. The patrols represent a dierent vision of community engagement and authority to state-based police: the external authority of the state is replaced by local cultural authority; and bureaucratised state-centred methods of crime control are replaced by an organic approach to community need which focuses on assistance, prevention, mediation, and persuasion rather than reactive force.55 The work of community patrols requires us to rethink the concept of policing as it is understood within dominant criminological and legal discourses.56 The colonial logic of policing founded in the constant potentiality of state violence and imprisonment is replaced with a dierent logic of care, of thoughtfulness and sensitivity to community and individual needs – community patrols are a form of counter policing.57 They are consistent with decolonial and abolitionist calls to

## Defund the Police

replace current policing practices with community control, interventions that promote harm reduction, individual and community well-being, and social justice. Another innovative development in Australia has been a radical reinterpretation of justice reinvestment (JR) by Aboriginal communities as a way of building and exercising local authority over justice issues and which aligns with the collective right of self-determination. Indigenous approaches ‘transform an understanding of the [JR] process beyond simply a technocratic means of crime control and decarceration, to one that is centrally concerned with Indigenous controlled governance’.58 In this approach the community denes the core problems for maintaining social order and the best way to respond to those issues.59

## Changing drug policies

The war on drugs has taken a shocking toll on human lives globally, from the police killings in places like Brazil and the Philippines, to the vast numbers of people imprisoned for drug oences or drug-related crimes internationally and often serving extraordinarily long (mandatory) sentences. Internationally, more than 30 countries have the death penalty for drug oences, with China, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and Iran among the most frequent executioners. In addition, there is the distortion of local economies and the profound corrupting inuence on political and governmental institutions (including the police, military, and judiciary). As many have argued, the war on drugs has only ever been tangentially related to stopping illicit drug use. Rather, it has been about extending and ensuring imperialism, it has been about supporting corrupt and violent regimes, and it has been concerned with exercising control over Black, Indigenous, racialised, and poor communities. As Carvalho has commented in relation to Latin America, ‘If the intent is to reward corrupt actors while propping up arms manufacturers, the prison industry and entrenched law enforcement bureaucracies, then the war on drugs has been successful’.60 The Global Commission on Drug Policy found two prominent outcomes of the war on drugs were: ‘The growth of a huge criminal black market, nanced by the risk-escalated prots of supplying international demand

## What is to be done?

for illicit drugs; [and] extensive policy displacement, the result of using scarce resources to fund a vast law enforcement eort intended to address this criminal market.’61 Policing has, either as matter of policy or convenience, inevitably targeted those on the bottom-rung – consumers, small-scale farmers, low-level dealers, and carriers – who are the easiest targets without the power, inuence, and money to ensure their freedom.62 These insights are not new. In the US context, Michael Tonry argued in 1995 that drug legislation was racist because it heavily criminalised some drugs (ice) over others (cocaine) and had a foreseeable impact of massive disparities in arrests, convictions, and imprisonment for Black Americans.63 The war on drugs also has a gendered impact – in many countries in Asia and Latin America, convictions for drug oences are the main cause of imprisonment for women, mostly for low level oences such as transporting drugs. In 2018 the UN estimated that 35 per cent of women in prison worldwide were incarcerated for drug oences, compared to 19 per cent of men. There is also the collateral punishment of their children.64 In addition, when police have instigated localised ‘crackdowns’ on drug markets, research in Australia, the UK, and the US has found that levels of violence (including homicide) increase.65 Progressive reform to policing and drug laws is not dicult to conceive. The central aim should be to make policing irrelevant to drug policies. Decriminalising drug use, possession, and low-level sales is a rst step in getting police out of the drug enforcement industry. Decriminalisation also impacts on the illicit drug market. Removing the large prots that can be made from the sale of illegal drugs can dramatically change both the market and the dynamics of political and law enforcement corruption. In the context of Defunding the Police, it has been estimated that globally over US$100 billion is spent annually on drug law enforcement. In contrast in 2019, US$131 million was spent on harm reduction in low- and middle-income countries.66 Beyond decriminalisation, what is needed is a public health approach of harm reduction in the community for drug users which is led by peers with lived experience and that rejects forced treatment, drug detention centres, and imprisonment.67 There are multiple programmes and approaches to providing support: needle and syringe programmes for safe injecting, pill testing, help lines, therapeutic treatment centres,

## Defund the Police

Hepatitis C testing and treatment, providing support for people with complex trauma, and school education to name only some. Although not perfect, Portugal has long been held as an example of a decriminalised approach to drug policy.68 In those countries where people are detained by police when aected by alcohol there is also a need for a public health approach that removes intoxicated people from police control.69 Second, there needs to be alternative opportunities for those in poverty and dependency who form the never-ending supply of low-level workers for the drug trade, as well as alternative livelihoods for the small farmers, sharecroppers, and day labourers dependent for their survival on supplying the narcotics trade. Simultaneously, it is also necessary to recognise the long history to the traditional cultural, medicinal, and ceremonial uses of coca, opium, and cannabis which is ‘still widespread in many places around the world today among Indigenous peoples, minorities and religious groups’.70 The problem is not one of nding solutions, it is rather the absence of political commitment by governments domestically and internationally who nd adherence to punitive law and order policies more attractive irrespective of their staggering human and nancial cost.

## Disarm and demilitarise

Discussion of drug policies leads directly to the question of militarisation and policing. In previous chapters, the international role of the US in nancing and training of police and military has been noted, including police training conducted by the military, and military forces themselves being trained in internal security matters, with the functions of both being blurred.71 However, there has also been extensive discussion in earlier chapters of the historical and contemporary intersections between colonial policing as militarised and the failure to reform the colonial structure of policing. Although there may be variations at dierent times – for example in South Africa, the attempted demilitarisation of the police after the end of Apartheid in 1994 and the more recent remilitarisation since 2009 with increased state repression and rising police violence and deaths in custody – the basic problem of police power within colonial contexts remains. In the

## What is to be done?

South African example, the police have changed from ensuring the privilege and control of the White minority to a new war on the poor presented as a ‘war on crime’.72 We need to be careful, as Neocleous suggests, to not perpetrate the myth that police power is separate to military/war power or that it can be fair, legitimate, transparent, and just.73 Having said that, how can we approach the question of what is to be done? What political demands and policy options are there to decrease police power? Reducing the lethality of police is part of the larger struggle of constraining and ultimately removing the institutional structures of policing. The issue of the militarised prole of the police was clearly brought to the fore during the global protest movements in 2020. For those protesters facing heavily armed police equipped with military hardware, the argument that police have always had a domestic militarised role can seem unhelpful. Certainly, police can kill without weapons, vide George Floyd. However, the ready availability of lethal weapons is also clearly related to killing and maiming by police. Towards the end of 2021, medical journal The Lancet published an editorial on fatal police violence as a public health issue in which it identied strategies to reduce police violence. Of relevance here is that these strategies ‘must include demilitarisation of police forces, but with the broader call to demilitarise society by, for example, restricting access to rearms’.74 As was noted in Chapter 5, we know that in countries where police are not routinely armed such as the UK, Norway, and New Zealand, there are comparatively fewer fatal shootings by police. In contrast, among countries in the global north, the US, Canada, and Australia have much higher rates of fatal shootings. For example, Australia regularly has three to four times more fatal shootings compared to England and Wales, although it has less than half the general population.75 Indeed, the disarming of police has taken on a particular resonance with the rise of the BLM movement. For example, in 2019 after the police shooting of Kumanjayi Walker, senior Aboriginal Elders in the Yuendumu community (NT, Australia) called for the disarming of police.
      Karrinjarla muwajarri meaning we want a ceasere. No
      more guns in our communities. It must never happen

     again. The police must put down their weapons. We
     have been saying this since the beginning. We cannot
     walk around in fear in our own homes anymore. …We
     do not want any police ocers to live and work in our
     communities with guns and other lethal weapons.76
Community Elders also called for an end to ex-military police ocers and asserted that senior elders and Aboriginal community police ‘must be decision-makers in policing matters’: ‘We are the First Nations peoples but we are still being disrespected and ignored. We are all so full of anger and grief. It is a racist system … we are powerful decision-makers. We, as the Warlpiri Nation … demand an end to guns in our communities.’77 Disarming the police is a radical demand, but is completely consistent with the localised control over policing which colonised people have been insisting on for decades. It is also consistent with outcomes sought in public health literature. The introduction of harmreduction policies and strategies must challenge the ‘models of hostile, racialised interactions between civilians and armed agents of the state’.78 Disarming police is an important part of the overall strategy that requires replacing state violence with investment in the types of programmes and services determined by aected communities.

## Conclusion

The answers are clear: we need to dramatically reduce the role of police in addressing a range of social, political, and economic problems, including through decreasing the size of police forces. We need to invest in communities to promote public safety through reallocating money to services that address the issues that impact on community safety, such as homelessness and poverty, and those that improve access to good quality health care, mental health support, education, and economic opportunity. However, divesting from police and investing in community is more than simply a matter of moving money. Divesting has ethical, political, and social dimensions – it signies that we no longer imbue and endow police with legitimacy, authority, and power; that we want an end to institutional violence and racism; that we

## What is to be done?

see community-based approaches as both more eective and more legitimate in responding to social issues; that we no longer see the cult of criminalisation and violence as the best way to help people who are homeless, who have been harmed or who are in some other way in need of assistance. It is also about reversing the years of neo-liberal retraction of government social services while the state happily increased the budgets to service police repression and the iniction of harm on those left abandoned and seen as disposable. As has been underlined in this book, these changes will not happen overnight. They require building alliances across various groups and they require political strategies for change. While the issues of police repression and violence are largely global, the alliances and the strategies they pursue will be determined by specic contexts. Although colonialism has inuenced the nature of policing and its targets across much of the world, the struggles against state violence are also inuenced by local conditions. As shown in Chapter 4, in the past, the opposition to police violence and racism gave rise to new forms of community-based organisations and resistance, and this will no doubt continue to be the case as the contemporary BLM and Defund the Police movements already attest. For many, the longer-term vision is the demise of police power and a horizon which is both abolitionist and decolonised. This book focuses primarily on the institution of police, the reasons for divesting from police, and the alternatives available to achieve that result. However, it also recognises that this is only part of the bigger picture. The logic of policing underpins, is embedded in, or intersects with, multiple state agencies. Thus, we need to challenge the expansion of police and carceral power into our daily lives through a web of social institutions well beyond the police. A fundamental part of any political programme will be the ability to distinguish reforms or options for change which take us closer to an abolitionist future rather than simply reinventing and re-empowering existing institutional frameworks. Further, as has been argued throughout this book, the institution of police is deeply rooted in the exploitation and control that were foundational to colonialism and imperialism, and still today it reveals itself as the most intense and transparent examples of state

## Defund the Police

violence and terror. The ‘re-imaginings’ that are required to move beyond state systems of control must be based on broad solidarity. While liberal reformers might continue with various programmes to reform the police, the abolitionist challenge of removing state policing and carceral systems and re-imagining community safety has been accepted by many diverse groups. They include those working in areas such as public health, radical social workers, critical disability workers, LGBTQIA+ advocates, people from Black, Indigenous and other minoritised communities, activists in the labour movement, and the people in the street demanding an end to police violence.

     ‘cross-fertilisation’ between colonial and ‘British’ models of policing. The
     policing of social protest and industrial disputes in Britain has taken on the
     more militarised prole of what might be regarded as the ‘colonial’ model.

     The use of rearms in a homicide generally results in lower clearances rates
     (Liem et al, 2019: 98). Murder rates vary signicantly in dierent regions,
     from around 10 per million population in Europe, East Asia, and Oceania
     (Australia and New Zealand), to 50 per million in the US, and to 259 and 242

     1,000 deaths, with 927 recorded as at 22 September, 2021. Other public
     non-government databases include Fatal Encounters (www.fatalencount

     The study estimated that over a 40-year period there were 17,100 more
     deaths due to police violence than the 13,700 reported deaths (GBD 2019
     Police Violence US Subnational Collaborators, 2021). An earlier 2018 study
     using CDC data reported that, based on 27 States, more than 92 per cent
     of deaths in law enforcement ‘legal interventions’ were from shootings, and
     the rate of Black male deaths was approximately twice that of White males
     (Jack et al, 2018).

     The Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas found that in Venezuela
     the absolute number of people killed by the State is even higher than in

## Notes

     Brazil, despite having a population – in absolute terms – almost seven times
     less. Civilian death rate through police fatal violence exceeds 15 per 100,000
     inhabitants, a record higher than the general homicide rate in the vast majority
     of countries of the world (2019: 167).

     This is not to suggest that police use of torture is only a problem in these
     South Asian countries, or indeed the global south. We see it in the global
     north as well – for example the Chicago detective and commander Jon
     Burge and his ‘midnight crew’. Between the early 1970s and 1990s he was
     accused of torturing hundreds of people (mostly Black) to extract forced
     confessions. In 2015 the city approved a $5.5 million reparations package for
     the victims. See the Chicago Police Torture Archive and Chicago Torture

     Saskatoon police arrested First Nations young people, drove them out of the
     city and abandoned them during winter months. A number of victims died
     from hyperthermia – 17-year-old Neil Stonechild was one of the deaths.

     investigated the use of tasers and OC spray after First Nations man Kevin
     Spratt was tasered seven times in a little over a minute by two police ocers.
     The Commission found that the tasering was an ‘undue and excessive use
     of force which was unreasonable and unjustied’. Two senior police ocers
     were later found guilty of assault and sentenced to suspended jail terms and

     There are many examples. See for instance in the UK, Her Majesty’s
     Inspectorate of Constabulary (2018b: 3, 8); in Australia, the Royal
     Commission into Victoria’s Mental Health System (2021: 24, 48) and the
     Police Accountability Project (2019: 10); in Canada, the Canadian Mental
     Health Association (2020), the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health
     (2020) and groups such as Doctors for Defunding the Police; and in the
     US, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (2020) and Abolition and
     Disability Justice Coalition (2021).
64
     For example, the Royal Commission into Victoria’s Mental Health System
     (2021: vol 3, 358) disapprovingly compared the $1.8 billion funding for
     expanded prison capacity in the State’s budget to the much smaller allocations
     for community-based mental health services or diversion, rehabilitation, and
     reintegration programmes. Police themselves acknowledged to the Royal
     Commission the impact of inadequate investment in community-based
     mental health services compared to police investment over decades with an
     almost exclusive focus on increasing the number of police.

     We might also add the role of police violence and discrimination during the
     public health responses to COVID-19. In addition to the violent policing
     of COVID-19 public health regulations already referred to in the book, one
     might add the racially discriminatory aspects of policing. In the UK, police
     use of force increased against Black and racially minoritised communities
     during the COVID-19 pandemic, even while crime rates were dropping
     (Harris et al, 2022).

## Notes

     Ray, 2020. Andrew Coyle connects this approach to justice reinvestment
     (JR). He writes,
            the intellectual case for a new approach based on community
            safety and security has been constructed gradually. Initially
            spurred on by urban geographers and other social scientists it
            has been picked up at a practical level in a variety of disparate
            settings and is generally described as JR. Very broadly, this has
            involved assessing the total resources, nancial and other, that
            are expended on the criminal justice system; evaluating what
            benet members of the public and taxpayers get from this
            expenditure; and considering whether there might be other
            ways of distributing these considerable resources at local levels
            to provide a better return on this substantial public investment.

     There is a preference for ‘options’ rather than ‘alternatives’ because the idea
     of alternatives already accepts the centrality of police and policing as the
     point of reference.

     Australia – where around 50 per cent of women in prison are First Nations
     and they are imprisoned at a rate 22 times greater than non-Indigenous
     women. The campaign focused on releasing incarcerated women who
     were imprisoned because they could not pay their nes. It raised hundreds
     of thousands of dollars, released hundreds of women from prison, and was
     largely responsible for a change in legislation.
