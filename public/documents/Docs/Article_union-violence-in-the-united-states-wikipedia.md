## Union violence in the United States is physical force
## intended to harm employers, managers, replacement workers,
                union abstainers, sympathizers of the prior groups, or their
                families. On various occasions violence has been committed by
## unions or union members during labor disputes in the United
## States. When union violence has occurred, it has frequently
                been in the context of industrial unrest.[1] Violence has ranged
## from isolated acts by individuals to wider campaigns of
                organised violence aimed at furthering union goals within an
                industrial dispute.[2][3][4]
                According to labor historians and other scholars, the United
                States has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of
## any industrial nation in the world, and there have been few
                industries which have been immune.[1][5][6] Researchers in
                industrial relations, criminology, and wider cultural studies
## have examined violence by workers or trade unions in the
                context of industrial disputes.[1][7][8][9] The US government
                has examined violence during industrial disputes.[10]

## According to a 1969 study, no major labor organization in
## American history has ever openly advocated violence as a
                policy, although some, in the early part of the 20th century,
## systematically used violence, most notably the Western
## Federation of Miners, and the International Association of
                Bridge Structural Iron Workers.[1] However, violence does
                occur in the context of industrial disputes. When violence has
                been committed by, or in the name of, the union, it has tended
                to be narrowly focused upon targets which are associated with
                the employer.[1] Violence was greater in conflicts in which
## there was a question of whether union recognition would be
                extended.[1]
                Union violence most typically occurs in specific situations, and
## has more frequently been aimed at preventing replacement
                workers from taking jobs during a strike, than at managers or
                employers.[1]

## Protest and verbal abuse are routinely aimed against union
## members or replacement workers who cross picket lines
                ("blacklegs") during industrial disputes. The inherent aim of a
## union is to create a labor monopoly so as to balance the
## monopsony a large employer enjoys as a purchaser of labor.
## Strikebreakers threaten that goal and undermine the union's
                bargaining position, and occasionally this erupts into violent
                confrontation, with violence committed either by, or against,
                strikers.[1] Some who have sought to explain such violence
                observe, if labor disputes are accompanied by violence, it may
                be because labor has no legal redress.[11] In 1894, some
                workers declared:

                ..."the right of employers to manage their own business to suit
                themselves," is fast coming to mean in effect nothing less than
                a right to manage the country to suit themselves.[12]
                A 1969 study of labor conflict violence in the United States
## examined the era following the 1947 passage of the Taft-
## Hartley Act, and concluded that violence had substantially
## abated. In the 16 years from 1947 through 1962, 29 people
                died in labor conflicts, a rate much lower than in previous eras.
## The study noted that attacks on strikers by company guards
## had all but disappeared. They estimated from NLRB records
## that 80 to 100 acts of violence by union members or
                supporters occurred each year, most of the attacks on people
## being unplanned fights with strikebreakers crossing picket
## lines. In the 1960s, the most common complaint of union
## violence was of sabotage during labor disputes. Numerous
## incidents included dynamite explosions, but targeting
                property, and without any dynamite-related injuries.[1]

## Great Railroad Strike of 1877

                [edit]

                Sixth Regiment of the Maryland Militia fighting its way through
## Baltimore, Maryland, 20 July 1877

                The great railroad strike of 1877 saw considerable violence by,
## and against, workers, and occurred before unions were
                widespread. It started on July 14 in Martinsburg, West Virginia,
                in response to the cutting of wages for the second time in a
                year by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O). Striking workers
                would not allow any of the stock to roll until this second wage
## cut was revoked. West Virginia governor Henry M. Mathews
                sent in state militia units to restore train service, but the
## soldiers refused to use force against the strikers and the
## governor called for federal troops.

## Violent street battles occurred in Maryland between the
## striking workers and the Maryland militia. When the
                outnumbered troops of the 6th Regiment fired on an attacking
                crowd, they killed 10 and wounded 25.[13] The rioters injured
## several members of the militia, damaged engines and train
                cars, and burned portions of the train station.[13] On July 21–
                22, the President sent federal troops and Marines to Baltimore
## to restore order.

## In Pittsburgh, strikers threw rocks at militiamen, who
## bayoneted their antagonists, killing twenty people and
## wounding twenty-nine others.

                Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot, Pittsburgh,
4 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## Pennsylvania, 21–22 July 1877

## In Reading, Pennsylvania, workers conducted mass marches,
                blocked rail traffic, committed trainyard arson, and burned a
                bridge. The state militia shot sixteen citizens in the Reading
                Railroad Massacre. The militia responsible for the shootings
## was mobilized by Reading Railroad management, not by local
                public officials.[14]

## Chicago was paralyzed when angry mobs of unemployed
## citizens wreaked havoc in the rail yards. The strike was
## eventually suppressed by thousands of vigilantes, National
## Guard, and federal troops.

## Haymarket affair of 1886

                [edit]

## In 1886 the Haymarket affair (also known as the Haymarket
## massacre or Haymarket riot) was a protest rally and
                subsequent violence on May 4 at the Haymarket Square[15] in
## Chicago. The rally supported striking workers. When police
## began to disperse the public meeting, an unknown person
## threw a dynamite bomb into their midst. The bomb blast and
                ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of eight police officers,
                mostly from friendly fire, and an unknown number of civilians.
                [16] In the internationally publicized legal proceedings that

## followed, eight anarchists were tried for murder. Four men
## were convicted and executed, and one committed suicide in
## prison, although the prosecution conceded none of the
## defendants had thrown the bomb.

                The Haymarket affair is generally considered significant for the
5 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                origin of international May Day observances for workers.[17][18]
                The causes of the Haymarket Affair are still controversial, but
                can be traced in part to an incident the previous day, in which
## police fired into a crowd of agitated workers during shift
## change at the McCormick Works, where the regular work force
                was on strike, and at least two workers were killed.[19] In
                popular literature, the Haymarket Affair inspired the caricature
## of "a bomb-throwing anarchist."

                Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld later pardoned the three
                living survivors of the Haymarket prosecution, concluding (as
## have subsequent scholars) that there had been a serious
                miscarriage of justice in their prosecutions.[20][21]

## Burlington strike of 1888

                [edit]

## During the 1888 strike against the Chicago, Burlington and
                Quincy Railroad, workers were arrested for wrecking a train.
## When one of those arrested turned out to be a detective,
## organized labor argued that the detective had incited the
                others.[22]

## Labor unrest in 1892

                [edit]
                "In the 1890s violent outbreaks occurred in the North, South,
## and West, in small communities and metropolitan cities,
                testifying to the common attitudes of Americans in every part
                of the United States."[1] Workers with different ethnic origins

## who worked under very different conditions in widely
## separated parts of the United States nonetheless responded
                with equal ferocity when unions came under attack.[1] "Serious
## violence erupted in several major strikes of the 1890s, the
                question of union recognition being a factor in all of them."[1]

## 1892 in particular was a year of considerable labor unrest.
                Governors of five states called out the national guard and/or
## the army to quell unrest—against miners in East Tennessee
                and in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, where a shooting war followed the
## discovery of a labor spy, against switchmen in Buffalo, New
                York, against a general strike in New Orleans, Louisiana, and
                against the Homestead, Pennsylvania steel strike.[23]

## Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor strike

                [edit]
                The strike of 1892 in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho erupted in violence
                when a union miner was killed by mine guards,[1] and was
## further inflamed when union miners discovered they had been
## infiltrated by a Pinkerton agent who had routinely provided
## union information to the mine owners.

                On Sunday night, July 10, armed union miners gathered on the
                hills above the Frisco mine. More union miners were arriving
## from surrounding communities. At five in the morning, shots
                rang out, and the firing became continuous. Both sides blamed
                the other for starting the shooting. The union miners, exposed
                on the logged-off hillside, had not positioned themselves for a
                gunfight, while mine guards were able to shelter in buildings.
7 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                The union men circled above the mill, and got into a position
## where they could send a box of black powder down the flume
                into one of the mine buildings. The building exploded, killing
## one company man and injuring several others. The union
                miners fired into a remaining structure where the guards had
                taken shelter. A second company man was killed, and sixty or
## so guards surrendered. Union men marched their prisoners to
## the union hall.

                The violence caused the governor to declare Martial Law,[24]
## and bring in six companies of the Idaho National Guard to
## "suppress insurrection and violence." Federal troops also
## arrived, and they confined six hundred miners in bullpens
                without any hearings or formal charges. Some were later "sent
                up" for violating injunctions, others for obstructing the United
                States mail.[25]

## Homestead Strike, and an assassination attempt

                [edit]

## One of the most notorious incidents of violence against
## management occurred in 1892 during the Homestead Strike—
                one of the most violent industrial disputes in American history
## —when Alexander Berkman attempted to assassinate Henry
## Clay Frick, chairman of the Carnegie Steel Company and
                manager of the mill where the strike occurred. Frick had locked
## out the workers, and later hired three hundred armed guards
## from the Pinkerton Detective Agency to break the union's
                picket lines, resulting in gunfire and flaming barges on the Ohio
                River. There was a consensus of all parties that the presence of
8 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                the Pinkertons inflamed the attitudes of the strikers.[1] The
                strikers defeated the Pinkertons, but could not keep the mills
                from operating after the National Guard was deployed.[1]
                Berkman, an avowed anarchist, had no connection to the union
## involved in the strike, but believed he was acting in the
                workers' interests. He was motivated by newspaper reports of,
                ...Henry Clay Frick, whose attitude toward labor is implacably
## hostile; his secret military preparations while designedly
## prolonging the peace negotiations with the Amalgamated; the
                fortification of the Homestead steel-works; the erection of a
## high board fence, capped by barbed wire and provided with
                loopholes for sharpshooters; the hiring of an army of Pinkerton
                thugs; the attempt to smuggle them, in the dead of night, into
                Homestead; and, finally, the terrible carnage.[26]
                Berkman's attack, called an attentat by the anarchists, injured
                but failed to kill Frick. Having anticipated that his act would
## launch a worker uprising, Berkman was surprised when a
                carpenter hit him with a hammer after he had been restrained.
## The attempted murder alienated the anarchist community
## from much of the labor movement, as well as dividing the
                anarchist community itself.[23] Frick had been widely hated,
                but in at least one analysis, becoming the victim of such an
                attack transformed him into a "folk hero" in the public view.[1]

## During the Homestead strike, Carnegie Steel Company
## employees in Duquesne joined the strike that was occurring
                across the river. A riot broke out, and a number of the workers
## were arrested. It turned out that two of the strikers were

                Pinkerton detectives, and convictions were secured.[27]

## Battle of Virden, 1898

                [edit]

## In 1897, the Pana Coal Company attempted to import AfricanAmerican strikebreakers. A train car was intercepted by armed
## striking miners, and the strikebreakers were sent home
## unharmed.

## The following year, however, another company, the Chicago-
## Virden Coal Company, attempted a similar strike-breaking
                effort, this time with an armed escort on the train car. The
                result was called the Battle of Virden. Guards fired their rifles as
## they disembarked from the train. In the ensuing gun battle,
                fourteen men, including eight strikers, were killed.[1] Governor
## Tanner criticized the company, and called up the National
## Guard, who were able to restore order. The National Guard
## prevented a similar incident by turning away additional
                strikebreakers the day after the riot.[1]

## Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899

                [edit]
                In April 1899, as the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was
## launching an organizing drive of the few locations not yet
## unionized, superintendent Albert Burch declared that the
## company would rather "shut down and remain closed twenty
## years" than to recognize the union. He then fired seventeen
## workers that he believed to be union members and demanded

10 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                that all other union men collect their back pay and quit.[28]

## On April 29, 250 angry union members belonging to the WFM
                seized a train in Burke.[29] At each stop through Burke-Canyon,
## more miners climbed aboard. At Frisco, the train stopped to
## load eighty wooden boxes, each containing fifty pounds of
                dynamite. Nearly a thousand men[30] rode the train to
                Wardner, the site of a $250,000 mill of the Bunker Hill mine.
                After carrying three thousand pounds of dynamite into the mill,
                they set their charges and scattered. Two men were killed,[31]
## one of them a non-union miner, the other a union man
                accidentally shot by other miners. Their mission accomplished,
## the miners once again boarded the "Dynamite Express" and
                left the scene.[32]
                From Kellog to Wallace, ranchers and laboring people lined the
                tracks and, according to one eyewitness, "cheered the [union]
                men lustily as they passed."[33]

## Once again, miners were rounded up and herded into bullpens
                and held there for months.[34]

## Colorado Labor Wars of 1903–04

                [edit]

## During the Western Federation of Miners strike of 1903–04,
                there was considerable violence, including an explosion at the
## Vindicator mine which killed two, and an explosion at the
## Independence Depot which killed thirteen. The Cripple Creek
                Mining District was under occupation by the Colorado National
                Guard, the Citizens' Alliance was active in the district, and
11 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## historians continue to debate who was responsible for each
                incident of violence.[35][36][37] One likely perpetrator was
## convicted assassin Harry Orchard. A major in the National
## Guard later testified that the militia was responsible for
                orchestrated beatings of striking miners.[38][39]

## Assassination of former Idaho governor, 1905

                [edit]

## Former Idaho governor Frank Steunenberg was killed outside
## his house by a bomb placed by Harry Orchard, a former miner
                from the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). Orchard claimed
                he was hired to kill Steunenberg by leadership of the WFM, and
## that he had been involved in at least 17 other deaths.

## International Association of Bridge Structural Iron
## Workers, 1906-1911

                [edit]

## Perhaps the most significant example of a campaign of union
                violence was carried out by the International Association of
## Bridge Structural Iron Workers from 1906 to 1910. With the
                blessing and financial support of high-ranking leadership, the
## union set dynamite and nitroglycerine bombs at about 100
                sites from 1906 to 1911, typically at construction sites using
                non-union workers.[40] These series of attacks has been
                described as the largest domestic terrorism spree in American
                history.[41]

## The bombings were carried out in retaliation against

12 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## workplaces that used open shop policies (allowing non-union
## and union workers side by side, or prohibiting unions
                altogether), rather than closed shops (union only). The bombs
## were purportedly placed with the intention of damaging
                property, not people,[42] but several explosions injured people
                (e.g., "5 or 6" injuries at a Hoboken, New Jersey construction
## site in the early morning of March 31, 1909), and on other
## occasions passersby or night watchmen came within minutes
                of being at the scene of explosions.[43] Approximately one
## hundred structures were damaged or destroyed by dynamite,
                including bridges, viaducts, railroad tracks and loaded rail cars,
                machine shops, office buildings, and warehouses in the states
                of Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin,
                Massachusetts, New Jersey, Missouri, California and Utah.[43]
## Financial damages ran into the hundreds of thousands of
                dollars in contemporary calculation.[43] About a hundred nonunion workers were assaulted. In the Chicago area alone, there
                were 12 dynamite attacks on non-union construction sites from
## 1906 to 1911, six of them taking place in 1910.

                Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, was a
## vocal opponent of labor unions. On 1 October 1910, a union
## dynamite bomb exploded at the Los Angeles Times building.
                The explosion and subsequent fire killed 21 Times workers, and
## injured 100 more.

## The next day, a mysterious suitcase was found outside the
                home of Times publisher Otis; police moved the suitcase away
                from the building. When they opened it, they heard ticking, and
## ran. They were 60 feet away when the dynamite went off,

                creating a crater and rattling windows, but without injuring
## anyone. Another dynamite bomb was discovered and
                disarmed at the Los Angeles home of the president of the antiunion Merchants and Manufacturers Association.[44]
                The southern California crew of Ortie McManigal and James B.
## Macnamara were still not through, and set off eight more
## explosions, including a Christmas Day 1910 explosion at the
## Llewellyn Iron Works in Los Angeles.

## Police found bomb-making equipment, including dynamite, at
                the Ironworkers Union office in San Francisco, and at the union
## headquarters in Indianapolis. Union member Ortie McManigal
                later confessed and testified against the others.[1][45]

## James B. Macnamara pled guilty to placing the Los Angeles
## Times bomb, and his brother John J. Macnamara, secretarytreasurer of the union, pled guilty to planning the bombing of
## the Llewellyn Iron Works. In all, 40 members of the Iron
## Workers Union were convicted in the dynamite campaign,
## including union president Frank Ryan.

## As of 2016, the Ironworkers Union website commented on the
                bombing spree:

## East St Louis Illinois Riot, 1917

                [edit]

## With the migration of African Americans Northward and the
                mixing of White and Black workers in factories, the tension was
## building, largely driven by White workers. The AFL, the
## American Federation of Labor, advocated the separation
## between European Americans and African Americans in the
                workplace. There were non-violent protests such as walk-outs
## in protest of having Blacks and Whites working together. As
                tension was building due to advocating for segregation in the
## workplace, violence soon erupted.

                In 1917, the East St Louis Illinois Riot, known for one of the
                bloodiest workplace riots, had between 40 and 200 killed and
## over 6000 African Americans displaced from their homes. The
## NAACP, National Association for the Advancement of Colored
## People, responded to the violence with a march known as the
## Silent March. Over 10,000 African American men and women
## demonstrated in Harlem, New York. Conflicts continued post
                World War I, as African Americans continued to face conflicts
## and tension while the African American labor activism
                continued. [47]

                Mine Workers union, culminated in the Battle of Blair Mountain
                in 1921.[48] The largest armed insurrection since the American
                Civil War was touched off by the murders of Sid Hatfield and Ed
                Chambers on the courthouse steps of Welch, West Virginia.[49]
                The Battle of Blair Mountain was a spontaneous uprising of ten
## thousand coal miners from throughout West Virginia who
                fought the coal company's hired guns and their allies, the state
                police for three days before federal troops intervened.[49]

## The Herrin Massacre, 1922

                [edit]
                Williamson County, Illinois, a county with a "unique history of
                violence" for a rural county, was the location of the Herrin
                Massacre, one of the most horrific and perplexing incidents of
                union violence.[50] The 1922 incident is considered the most
                notorious of the United Mine Workers' struggles in Illinois.[50]
                [51][52] The massacre was committed by members (and
                possibly at the instruction of local leadership) of the United
                Mine Workers.[52] Three union men died in the exchange of
## gunfire during an afternoon-long armed siege of a non-union
## mine. The next day, the non-union miners surrendered and
                were disarmed in exchange for safe passage out of the county.
                However, union miners killed 20 men of the 50 strikebreakers
## and mine guards who surrendered. The ruthless retaliation
## occurred against the backdrop of broken promises, double
                dealing, and missed opportunities on both sides.[53]

## Theater bombings, 1928

## 1979 Imperial Valley Lettuce Strike

                [edit]

## The United Farm Workers 1979 strike against Imperial Valley
## lettuce growers was organized by Cesar Chavez to dispute
## wages for produce workers. Despite his outspoken calls for
                peaceful protests and the UFW's policy of non-violence, several
## instances of widespread violence and damage occurred during
## the strike. "UFW pickets engaged in rock-throwing, blocking
                access to and from grower facilities or fields, rushing into fields
## towards replacement workers, throwing nail-type devices on
                the ground to cause flat tires in grower vehicles, overturning
                grower vehicles, carrying or using sticks, clubs, sling shots or
## other weapons. There was evidence that the picket captains
## urged strikers to throw rocks and to vandalize grower
## equipment. There was evidence that King and the picket
                captains made threats to kill the replacement workers. There
## was evidence that the UFW could discipline picketers who
                violated strike rules by pulling them off the picket line and

## having them work elsewhere yet the evidence tended to show
## the UFW rarely disciplined picketers. There was testimony
## picket captains encouraged strikers to throw rocks and
                vandalize grower equipment. In particular, there was evidence
                of a "Fantasma" or "Phantom Crew" organized by the strikers to
## intimidate growers and replacement workers. This phantom
                crew was composed of five or six "real strong young men" who
                would use a black van at night to attack replacement workers
## and to vandalize irrigation equipment, vehicles and homes
                belonging to growers and replacement workers.[57]
                In the following years, a judge would later find the actions of
## the UFW were "acts of unlawful picketing" and held them
                financially liable for damages to the growers.[58]

## 1985 Massey Energy strike

                [edit]

## The United Mine Workers Union 1985 strike against Massey
                Energy included attacks on company vehicles with rifle fire.
                Trucks hauling coal from the mines were fired upon with rifles a
## number of times, and three drivers had previously been
                wounded by the rifle fire before June 1985, when another truck
                convoy was hit by rifle fire, killing driver Hayes West when his
                truck was hit by at least 21 rifle rounds, and the driver of
                another truck was wounded.[59]
                State and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in the
## death of Hayes West. Five members of the United Mine
## Workers Union, including Donnie Thornsbury, president of
## UMW Local 2496, were indicted by a federal grand jury,

18 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## arrested, and charged with conspiracy to damage and disable
                motor vehicles used in interstate commerce.[60] After a trial in
                federal court, four out of the five were convicted, including
                union official Thornsbury, and their convictions were upheld on
                appeal.[61][62]

## 1986, Electrical Workers protest

                [edit]
                During protests by the International Brotherhood of Electrical
                Workers Local 1547 against a non-unionized workforce getting
                a contract, picketers threatened and assaulted workers, spat at
                them, sabotaged equipment, and shot guns near workers.[63]
                [64] In 1999, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the union

## had engaged in "ongoing acts of intimidation, violence,
                destruction of property", awarding the plaintiff $212,500 in
                punitive damages.[63][64]

## 1986/1987, Hotel Workers Strike

                [edit]
                Three union workers set fire to the Hotel Dupont Plaza in San
                Juan, Puerto Rico, while other union members staged a fight as
## a distraction. The union, said to be affiliated with the
## Teamsters, was having a labor dispute with management over
                pay and health care. Ninety-seven people were killed, none of
## whom were union members. Most bodies were burned beyond
## recognition.

## 1989 Pittston coal strike

                [edit]

## The 1989 strike by the United Mine Workers of America
                (UMWA) against the Pittston Coal Company's mines in Virginia
                and West Virginia was marked by shots fired at strikebreakers.
                In July 1989, a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of Pittston
                headquarters at Lebanon, Virginia.[65]

## 1990, New York Daily News Strike

                [edit]
                On the first day of The New York Daily News strike, delivery
                trucks were attacked with stones and sticks, and in some cases
                burned, with the drivers beaten.[2][3][4] Strikers then started
                threatening newsstands with arson, or stole all copies of the
                Daily News and burned them in front of the newsstands.[2][3][4]
## James Hoge, publisher of the Daily News, alleged that there
## had been some 700 serious acts of violence. The New York
## Police Department claimed knowledge of 229 incidents of
                violence. Criminal charges under the Hobbs Act were declined,
                however, citing the aforementioned Enmons case.[2][3][4]

## 1993 Arch Mineral Corporation strike

                [edit]
                Eight members of the striking United Mine Workers Union were
                arrested after Eddie York was shot and killed in Logan County,
## West Virginia, as he drove away from the coal mine, through
## the picket line. York, an employee of an environmental
## contractor, was at the mine to perform government-mandated

20 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## maintenance of sedimentation ponds, work unrelated to the
                labor dispute. In the same incident, a truck driven by a mine
                guard was struck by rocks thrown by strikers on the picket line,
## which smashed the windshield. Howard Green, a member of
## the UMW executive board, accused Arch Corporation mine
                guards of murdering York, to give bad publicity to the union.[66]

## State and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in
## York's death. The FBI and Justice Department, citing the
## Enmons case, decided they could not prosecute under the
                Hobbs Act.[67][66] The federal government charged eight of the
                picketers for interfering with interstate transportation. Seven of
## the union members, including the president of the local,
                accepted plea deals in connection with the rock-throwing. The
                eighth, Jerry Dale Lowe, was charged with firing the fatal shot,
                and was tried in federal court for illegal use of a firearm to
## incapacitate a driver involved in interstate commerce (the
## federal government could not charge him with murder,
                because murder is not a federal crime).[68] In 1994, a federal
                jury convicted Jerry Dale Lowe of killing Eddie York, and he was
                sentenced to 11 years in prison.[69] Although all eight of those
## charged had violated various UMWA picket-line rules against
                drinking, masking their faces, rock-throwing, and having guns
                at the picket line, none were subject to any UMWA discipline.
                On the contrary, the union successfully fought to get the seven
                who pled guilty their old jobs back after the strike.[66]

## 1997, Teamsters Union strike against UPS

                [edit]

                In Miami, during a 1997 Teamsters Union strike against UPS, a
## group of men pulled UPS truck driver Rod Carter out of his
                truck, beat him, and stabbed him six times with an ice pick.
                Carter had earlier received a threatening phone call from the
                home of Anthony Cannestro, Sr., president of Teamsters Local
                769.[70][71] Carter sued Teamsters local 769, charging that
## union officials had encouraged violent behavior by its
## members. The Teamsters Union settled with Carter by paying
                an undisclosed sum.[70]

## Laborers Local 91, Niagara, New York, 1995-2001

                [edit]
                For years, officials of Laborers Local 91, in Niagara, New York,
                directed a strongarm squad[72] of union members to make
## death threats and to commit criminal acts against nonunion
                construction workers and work sites. In 1997, the union fire-
## bombed a residence used by non-union workers in Niagara
## Falls, New York, causing permanent injury to one of the
                inhabitants. In 1998, union members attacked four tile-layers
                at a supermarket construction site, beating them so badly that
## they were all hospitalized, one so badly that he had not
## returned to work four years later.

                State and local law enforcement did not charge anyone in the
## beatings. After a four-year federal investigation, the FBI
## arrested 14 union members for the violence, including the
                local's vice president, business manager, assistant business
## manager, and a former president. Andrew Shomers confessed
## to the fire-bombing, and also to the beatings at the

22 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                supermarket site. Another union member, confessed to driving
                the getaway car in the fire bombing.[73] Anthony Cerrone, a
## member of local 91, confessed to involvement in the
                supermarket attack and the fire-bombing.[74] [75][76]

## It was reported on September 9, 2011, that members of the
## International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU)
## frightened security guards, dumped grain, and vandalized
                property belonging to EGT, LLC, over a labor dispute. No one
## was hurt, and no one had been arrested at the time the
## incident was reported. District Judge Ronald Leighton later
                issued a preliminary injunction against the ILWU citing their
                reported behavior.[77]

## 2012, Lansing, Michigan

                [edit]
                Union workers protesting right-to-work legislation in Lansing,
## Michigan destroyed a tent run by Americans for Prosperity.
                People were inside the tent but managed to escape before the
                collapse. Additionally, hot dog stand operator Clinton Tarver, a
## popular vendor around the Capital area who was hired to
## provide catering for AFP, lost his equipment, condiments,
## coolers, and food in the collapse. According to Tarver (an
## African American), union workers, who had incorrectly
## assumed he was supporting AFP, called Tarver an "Uncle Tom
## nigger". A union worker also punched conservative comedian
## and Fox News contributor Steven Crowder, resulting in a
                chipped tooth and a minor cut on the forehead. Another worker
                threatened to kill Crowder with a gun.[78][79][80][81][82][83]

## Ironworkers Local 401, Philadelphia, 2015

                [edit]

## Although the violence, property destruction and arson had
## been going on for years, it intensified after the economic
## downturn of 2020–2021, as construction work became scarcer.
## In 2014, Ironworkers union members caused $500,000 in
## damage to the non-union construction site of a Quaker
                meetinghouse in Chestnut Hill.[84] In another incident,
## Ironworkers beat nonunion workers outside a Toys-R-Us store
                with baseball bats.[85] Some of the violence was directed at
                union construction sites staffed by other craft unions, such as
## the Carpenters Union, in an attempt to get the work for the
## Ironworkers.

## After an FBI investigation, federal prosecutors filed
## racketeering and arson charges against ten officers and
                members of Ironworkers Local 401.[86][87][88] Eleven union
                members pled guilty to property destruction and arson against
## non-union construction sites, including the Chestnut Hill
## Quaker meetinghouse. Some of the repeat perpetrators said
## that they "jokingly" called themselves "'The Helpful Union
                Guys,' or 'T.H.U.G.S.'".[88][89] Those who pled guilty testified
## that their crimes were at the direction of the Ironworkers
## Local's business manager, Joseph Dougherty. Dougherty was
                convicted in July 2018, and sentenced to 19 years in prison by
                a federal judge.[90]

                [edit]

## In 2015, the Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority sued
                the Carpenters Union local in Philadelphia for racketeering,
                under the federal RICO statute. The Authority charged that the
                union had engaged in a pattern of "illegal and disruptive mass
## picketing and protests; physical intimidation, harassment,
## stalking, and assault and battery; verbal intimidation,
                harassment, race-baiting, and threats; and the destruction of
                property." The Carpenters Union denied the charges. [91]

## Union-on-union violence

## Sometimes, unions are accused of violence or threats of
## violence by other unions.

## Railroad Trainmen versus Street Railway Employees,

                [edit]

## In June 1940, a bus driver member of the Amalgamated
                Association of Street Railway & Motor Coach Employees, which
                was not on strike, was killed at the hands of members of the
                Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, which claimed to represent
                the bus drivers. The Railroad Trainmen blamed the bus driver,
                calling him a strikebreaker. The Street Railway & Motor Coach
## Employees union later won an NLRB representation election,
                defeating the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.[92]

## United Mine Workers versus Progressive Mine Workers,

25 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                [edit]
                In 1932, some southern Illinois coal miners dissatisfied with the
## concessions made by the United Mine Workers Union, and
                what they regarded as the autocratic ways of its leader, John L.
## Lewis, broke away and formed the Progressive Miners of
                America (PMA), later renamed the Progressive Mine Workers of
## America. The rival unions clashed violently from the start,
                resulting in numerous deaths on both sides, as well as police
## officers killed trying to prevent the violence.

                The violence was especially intense in southern Illinois in 1932
## and 1933, when PMA picketers tried to stop UMWA members
                from entering the mines. Officers and members of both unions
## were shot on the street and bombed in their homes. In
                addition, PMA members set off bombs to stop rail shipments of
## UMWA-mined coal, trying to force the companies to recognize
## the PMA. In 1937 the federal government charged 36 PMA
                members and officers with racketeering, in connection with 44
## dynamite explosions at mines and rail facilities. The PMA
## maintained that the charges resulted from collusion between
## the FBI, UMWA, and Peabody Coal, and that their methods
## were no different from those of the UMWA. All 36 were
## convicted. Although the prison sentences were no more than
## 16 months, the fines and legal expenses had drained the PMA
## treasury, and the verdicts labelled the PMA as an outlaw
                organization.[93]

## The Progressive Mine Workers union survived, and PMWA-
## UMWA violence flared up occasionally over the years, as one

26 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                union would strike while the other continued to work, and they
## both claimed to represent miners at various coal mines. In
                1946, two miners died in clashes between the rival unions at a
## mine at Benham, Kentucky, which was represented by the
                Progressive Mine Workers.[94] In 1982, the Progressive Mine
## Workers of America represented 4,500 coal miners, compared
## to the UMWA's membership of 160,000. The union dissolved in
## 1999.

## In the United States, union violence often goes unpunished
                because of pro-union sympathies, or political pressure not to
                prosecute.[95] A 1966 study cited numerous examples of local
                and state police failing to interfere with, and state and local
                prosecutors failing to prosecute, union violence. The authors
                concluded:
                A public official sees many votes on the picket line; few in the
                office. Perhaps in 1932 it was true that local officials were
                ignorant of union objectives and brutal in the extreme toward
                peaceful picketers. Nothing could be further from the truth in
                1966.[96]

                Although replacement workers have the legal right to be free
## from violence or intimidation in labor disputes, many law
                enforcement officials will not interfere with union intimidation,
                for fear of being accused of being anti-union. When Democratic
                governor of Arizona Bruce Babbitt sent the national guard to
## prevent threatened violence by strikers in the Phelps Dodge
                copper strike of 1982, a union official charged that he was "in
                the pocket" of Phelps Dodge.[97]

## Legal exceptions for labor unions

                [edit]

## The US Chamber of Commerce has pointed out that a number
                of states have made legal exceptions for labor disputes in their
                criminal laws. For example, California, Pennsylvania, Nevada,
## and Illinois have exempted labor disputes from their laws
                against stalking.[98]
                The Hobbs act makes extortion a federal crime, but under the
## United States Supreme Court's 1973 Enmons decision (United
                States v. Enmons), the actions of union officials in organizing
## strikes and other united acts of workers are exempt from
                Hobbs Act prosecutions, as long as the labor dispute is over
## pay for work performed. This exemption does not confer any
                immunity from state prosecution for violent acts.[99]

## No American labor union currently has a policy of openly
## advocating violence, and some, such as the United Mine
                Workers in the Pittston Coal strike, have publicly emphasized
## peaceful means; the UMWA has striking members watch
                videos about the union's rules to assure peaceful picketing.[66]
                Labor unions have an incentive to keep strikes, and especially
                picket lines, peaceful, because if an activity organized and
## supervised by union officials such as picketing, becomes
                violent, the union itself may be found liable, in addition to the
## individuals.

                Some union sympathizers believe that labor union violence is
                justified, especially when directed at strikebreakers. Some hold
                that the law allowing and protecting strikebreakers is unfair, so
28 of 45 9/7/25, 11:58 AM Union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                that violence and intimidation are the only ways labor unionists
                can stage an effective strike.[100][101] Others believe that,
                although violence is wrong, it should be tolerated as an excess
                done for the greater good. Clarence Darrow voiced this view in
## his courtroom defense of labor leader Big Bill Haywood,
## charged with ordering the assassination of the governor of
                Idaho:

## I don't care how many wrongs they committed, I don't care
## how many crimes these weak, rough, rugged, unlettered men
## who often know no other power but the brute force of their
                strong right arm, who find themselves bound and confined and
## impaired whichever way they turn, who look up and worship
                the god of might as the only god that they know--I don't care
                how often they fail, how many brutalities they are guilty of. I
                know their cause is just.[102]

## Law enforcement sympathies

                [edit]

## Examples of local government inaction before or after union
                violence include the Herrin Massacre, where the county sheriff
## was a member of the United Mine Workers, and did nothing to
                prevent or stop the killing of 21 nonstriking workers, after the
                strikebreakers had given up their weapons on a promise of safe
                passage out of the county.[103][104][105]

## During a nationwide Teamsters Union strike against UPS in
                1987, the president of the Houston policeman's union faxed a
## message to all Houston police stations, urging them to stop
## UPS drivers, and "go into zero tolerance mode, to get the

                nonstriking drivers off the street.[106]
                On 12 October 1898, at Virden, Illinois, a crowd of strikers
## armed with rifles tried to prevent a railroad car of
## strikebreakers from disembarking, and 8 strikers and 6
                strikebreakers died in the gunfight. Governor Tanner of Illinois
                ordered in the National Guard, and on his orders, the following
## day the Guard prevented the companies from bringing in more
## strikebreakers. Unable to continue operating, the companies
                gave in.[107] The governor admitted that he had no legal
## authority for his action in preventing the arrival of
## strikebreakers, but said that he was doing the will of the
                people.[108]

## Employer reluctance to press charges

                [edit]
                When local, state, or federal officials try to prosecute union
                violence, they sometimes find that employers are reluctant to
                cooperate, for fear of union reprisal.[109]

## False flags and frameups

                [edit]
                False flag operations are efforts to turn public opinion against
## an adversary, while pretending to be in the camp of that
## adversary. Historian J. Bernard Hogg observed of such
                operations as practiced in 1888:

## A detective will join the ranks of the strikers and at once
## become an ardent champion of their cause. He is next found

## committing an aggravated assault upon some man or woman
## who has remained at work, thereby bringing down upon the
## heads of the officers and members of the assembly or union
                directly interested, the condemnation of all honest people, and
## aiding very materially to demoralize the organization and
                break their ranks.[110]
                Some labor spy agencies advertised their false flag operations;
## for example, Corporations Auxiliary Company, a labor spy
                agency which boasted 499 corporate clients in the early 1930s,
                [111] told prospective clients,
                In [the event other methods of sabotaging the union fail, our
                operative in the union] turns extremely radical. He asks for
                unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble.
                If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and
                will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result
                will be that the union will be broken up.[112]

## Johnson County, Indiana Deputy Prosecutor Carlos Lam
                suggested in an email that Wisconsin's Governor Walker mount
                a "false flag" operation to make it appear that the union[which?]
                was committing violence in the 2011 Wisconsin protests. After
## initially claiming that his email account was hacked, Lam
                admitted to sending the suggestion and resigned.[113][114]
                Governor Walker's office disclaimed support for the proposal.
                [114]

## During the Colorado Labor Wars, the Colorado National Guard
                had been called into the Cripple Creek Mining District to put
                down a strike, and Colorado National Guard leadership became

## concerned that the Mine Owners Association had not lived up
## to their agreement to cover the payroll of the soldiers. In
                February 1904, General Reardon ordered Major Ellison to shoot
## up one of the mines. When such violence occurred, the blame
                would be placed upon the union.[115] In the dark of night, Major
                Ellison and Sergeant Gordon Walter fired sixty shots from their
                revolvers into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house.[38] The plan
                worked, and the mine owners paid up.[38]
                During the same strike, detectives were accused of attempting
                to frame union leaders for a plot to derail a train. A jury of non-
## union ranchers and timbermen unanimously acquitted three
## accused union men, and some testimony during the trial
                pointed at a plot by the detectives.[116][117][118][119][120]

## Frameups in labor disputes sometimes swung public opinion
## against the perpetrators. During a 1912 strike in Lawrence,
                Massachusetts, police acting on a tip discovered dynamite and
## blamed it on the union. National media echoed an anti-union
## message. Later the police revealed that the dynamite had
## been wrapped in a magazine addressed to the son of the
## former mayor. The man had received an unexplained payment
## from the largest of the employers. Exposed, the plot swung
                public sympathy to the union.[121]
