We got an e-mail saying this book is only half complete. Is this correct? Or were there two different versions published?



This version has 198 pages, whereas the AK Press version has 315

My hardcopy of this book is 197 pages and it's from AK press. So, I think the answer is yes, Steven. Now I'm curious as to what's in the other 118 pages. ;) ```

My Ramparts Press version (1971) has 288 pages... seems to be the same contents as the Black Rose edition.

I have a 2018 AK Press PDF, 252 pages. It would need approving though. ```
