Is renewable energy actually green? Are wind, solar, and storage infrastructure projects a climate and/or environmental solution or are they just feel-good, greenwashing, false "solutions" that either perpetuate the deepening climate and environmental crisis or just represent further extractivism by the capitalist class and the privileged Global North at the expense of front-line communities and the Global South?
This document argues that, while there is no guarantee that renewable energy projects will ultimately be truly "green", there is nothing inherent in the technology itself that precludes them from being so. Ultimately the "green"-ness of the project depends on the level of rank-and-file, democratic, front-line community and working-class grassroots power with the organized leverage to counter the forces that would use renewable energy to perpetuate the capitalist, colonialist, extractivist system that created the climate and environmental crisis in which we find ourselves.
In■ order to do that, we mustn't fall prey to the misconceptions and inaccuracies that paint renewable energy infrastructure projects as inherently anti-green. This series attempts to do
just that. This first Volume, on utility scale wind power addresses several arguments made against it, including (but not limited to) the following misconceptions:
Humanity must abandon electricity completely;
Degrowth is the only solution;
New wind developments only expand overall consumption;
Wind power is unreliable and intermittent;
Wind power is just another form of "green" capitalism;
The extraction of resources necessary to build wind power negates any of their alleged green benefits;
Wind power is an extinction-level event threat to birds, bats, whales, and other wildlife (and possibly humans);
Only locally distributed renewable energy arrayed in microgrids should be built without any--even a small percentage--of utility scale wind developments;
Only nationalized and/or state-owned utility scale renewable energy developments should be built;
No wind power developments will be green unless we first organize a socialist revolution, because everything else represents misplaced faith in capitalist market forces.
In fact, none of the above arguments are automatically true (and the majority are almost completely untrue). However, they're often repeated, sometimes ignorantly, but not too
infrequently in bad faith. This document is offered as an inoculation and antidote to these misconceptions and misinformation.
