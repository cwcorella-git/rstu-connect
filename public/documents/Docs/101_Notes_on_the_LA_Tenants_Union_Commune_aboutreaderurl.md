First of all, there is no housing crisis. 2. Housing is not in crisis. 3. Housing needs no trauma counselors. 4. Housing needs no lawyers. Housing needs no comrades or friends. Housing needs no representatives. Housing needs no organizers. 5. When we call this crisis a housing crisis, it benefits the people who design housing, who build housing, who profit from housing, not the people who live in it. 6. It encourages us to think in abstractions, in numbers, in interchangeable “units,” and not about people, or about power. 7. We don’t have a housing crisis. We have a tenants’ rights crisis. 8. In the LA Tenants Union, the subject of our work is not housing. It’s the tenant. 1 of 13 10/29/25, 11:48 PM ``` -- ## Page 2 ### Complete Page View ![Page 2 Complete](images/page_002_full.png) 101 Notes on the LA Tenants Union | Commune 22. I’m talking about gentrification, whose definition in 2012 seemed to be written by the people it benefited. 23. Together, School of Echoes wanted to redefine gentrification not as a natural process, but as--to use Ursula K. Le Guinn’s phrase--a “human power,” produced by humans, by actors, agents, and targets. 24. So, we spent a few years listening: to STAY in Echo Park, where a gang injunction meant youth of color could be jailed just for sitting together outside; 25. to residents of Frogtown, where a new public park arrived right after half of neighborhood properties had changed hands in three years; 26. to Needle Exchange in Hollywood, whose outreach operations had to keep up with stepped up encampment sweeps; 3 of 13 10/29/25, 11:48 PM ``` -- ## Page 4 ### Complete Page View ![Page 4 Complete](images/page_004_full.png) 101 Notes on the LA Tenants Union | Commune powerful in our movement? 36. We asked: How do we respect tenants by treating them as experts on their own experiences? 37. We asked: How will we make the LA Tenants Union a place where you learn you are not alone? 38. Here are some answers we came up with: 39. LATU operates under the principle of language justice, by which we mean everyone has the right to speak and be understood in the language they are most comfortable with. 40. The language justice committee performs simultaneous interpretation at each of our meetings--interpretation of Spanish for English speakers and interpretation of English for Spanish speakers--meaning our space attempts to privilege bilingual speakers, and no one language over another. 41. LATU is a horizontal movement: we build up from tenants’ associations in buildings, to local chapters in neighborhoods, to our union which spans the city. 42. But we want our members and our leadership to reflect the people most impacted by the tenants’ rights crisis. Which means horizontality can’t just be flat. In other words, horizontality can’t be color-blind, gender-blind, or difference- blind. 43. In LATU, tenants talk, strategize, and deal with individual crises--an eviction notice, a leaking roof, a deportation threat, a landlord with a pickax--but also learn how those individual crises are part of, caused by, and contribute to, a collective one. 5 of 13 10/29/25, 11:48 PM ``` -- ## Page 6 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 6](images/page_006_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 6 Complete](images/page_006_full.png) 101 Notes on the LA Tenants Union | Commune 51. But you have heard it a million times and will hear it a million more: there is a housing crisis, and we will build our way out of it. 52. From Gavin Newsom’s “Marshall Plan” to Ben Carson’s embrace of deregulation, this supply-side, build-baby-build strategy follows what gets promoted as economic common sense. 53. But we understand supply-side policy as an attempt to govern housing without governance, to get people out of politics. To benefit the people who profit from housing, not the people who live in it. 54. We should hear in supply-side policy the echoes of “blight” designations and “slum clearance” projects, through which a focus on buildings rather than people allowed for their mass displacement. 55. There is no a shortage of housing except for poor and working people, which the market has never and will never provide. 56. As public housing advocate Catherine Bauer said in 1935: the situation is permanent. 7 of 13 10/29/25, 11:48 PM ``` -- ## Page 8 ### Complete Page View ![Page 8 Complete](images/page_008_full.png) 101 Notes on the LA Tenants Union | Commune 69. Because from the perspective of tenants’ rights, we don’t just need to control the market, we need to kick it the fuck out of our lives. 70. We need to stop looking to landlords, developers, planners, and economists to solve a problem whose insolubility protects their interests. 71. Instead, we need to look to each other, to respect the expertise gained through struggle. In LATU, the solution looks like: 72. The Exposition Tenants Association from South LA brought their protest to the mansion of their evictor, pointing out there would be enough room for all of them inside. 73. Standing at his door, we remember eviction is personal. When we mobilize, we don’t shy away from making the fight against eviction personal too. 74. As with the transfer of wealth from South LA to Orange County, one neighborhood’s wealth isn’t an accident, but predicated on the subjugation and exploitation of another. 75. Rent is the mortgage on a landlord’s second house, is the guarantor of generational assets, is the corporate income stream, is rolled into a financialized security and offered up to hedge funds as a bond. 9 of 13 10/29/25, 11:48 PM ``` -- ## Page 10 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 10](images/page_010_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 10 Complete](images/page_010_full.png) 101 Notes on the LA Tenants Union | Commune 80. Though they are not supported by City Council members, though they’re discouraged by the Housing Department and limited by court decisions, rent strikes sometimes get the goods. 81. There’s more: 82. The Burlington Unidos Tenants Association, the largest rent strike in LA history. 83. #FuckYourFlips: a viral media campaign that encouraged interventions in the local processes of flipping and predation-- tearing down those “cash for your houses” signs. 84. Monthly general meetings, our education spaces, which have held focused workshops on new techniques of evictions such as Tenants In Common; on the role of policing and ICE in gentrification; on strategies for legal and extralegal direct action. 85. We refuse to see our homes as quantifiable or interchangeable abstractions. We recognize them as interlocking sites of oppression and exploitation, but also of trust, community, and power. 86. We are tenants’ rights organizers not housing activists. 87. In other words, we care more about people than the housing they live in. 88. I’d like you to consider how close we are to winning, to housing as a right. To the basic need of shelter met for all. 89. What things would have to change for us to get there? Perhaps more importantly, where will this work take place? What will the room look like? Who will get a chance to speak? 11 of 13 10/29/25, 11:48 PM ``` -- ## Page 12 ### Complete Page View ![Page 12 Complete](images/page_012_full.png) 101 Notes on the LA Tenants Union | Commune 13 of 13 10/29/25, 11:48 PM ``` --
