               If we speak of communisation and not just communism, it is
               not to invent a new concept which would provide us with the
               ultimate solution to the revolutionary riddle. Communisation
               denotes no less than the content and process of a future
               revolution. For example, only communisation gives meaning to
               our critique of democracy.
               In recent years, communisation has become one of the radical
               in-words, even outside what is known as the “communisers”
               (communisateurs in French).
               As far as we are concerned, we do not regard ourselves any
               more members of this communising current than we feel close
               to – or far from – a number of other communist groups.
               The communisation issue is further complicated by the
               emergence of the commons theory, according to which deep
               social change could come from collective usage and extension
               of what is already treated as common resources and activities
               (for instance, the open field system in still existing traditional
               societies, and free software access in the most modern ones).
               In other words, these “creative commons” would allow us a

               gradual and peaceful passage toward a human community.
               The successive refutation of theories we regard as incomplete
               or wrong would have obscured our central points. As we wish
               to keep away from any war of the words, the following essay
               will try and address the communisation issue as directly as
               possible.
               A few words about the word
               In English, the word has been used for a long while, to convey
               something very different from what we are dealing with here.
               To communise was often a synonym for to sovietize, i.e. to
               implement the full program of the communist party in the
               Leninist (and later Stalinist) sense: “The fundamental task of
               Comintern was to seek opportunities to communise Europe
               and North America.” (R. Service, Trotsky. A Biography,
               Macmillan, 2009, p. 282) This was the Webster’s dictionary
               definition in 1961 and 1993, and roughly the one given by
               Wikipedia in 2010. This is of course not what we are talking
               about.
               More rarely, communisation has been used as a synonym for
               radical collectivisation, with special reference to Spain in
               1936-39, when factories, farms, rural and urban areas were run
               by worker or peasant collectives. Although this is related to
               what we mean by communising, most of these experiences
               invented local currencies or took labour-time as a means of
               barter. These collectives functioned as worker-managed
               enterprises, for the benefit of the people, yet enterprises all the
               same.

               We are dealing with something else.
               It is not sure who first used the word with the meaning this
               essay is interested in. To the best of our knowledge, it was
               Dominique Blanc: orally in the years 1972-74, and in writing in
               Un Monde sans argent (A World Without Money), published in 3
               booklets in 1975-76 by the OJTR (the same group also
               published D. Blanc’s Militancy, the Highest Stage of Alienation).
               Whoever coined the word, the idea was being circulated at the
               time in the small milieu round the bookshop La Vieille Taupe
               (“The Old Mole”, 1965-72). Since the May 68 events, the
               bookseller, Pierre Guillaume, ex-Socialisme ou Barbarie and ex-
               Pouvoir Ouvrier member, but also for a while close to G.
               Debord (who himself was a member of S. ou B. in 1960-61),
               had been consistently putting forward the idea of revolution as
               a communising process, maybe without using the phrase. Yet
               D. Blanc was the first to publicly emphasize its importance. Un
               Monde sans argent said the difference between communist
               revolution and all variants of reformism was not that revolution
               implied insurrection, but that this insurrection would have to
               start communising society… or it would have no communist
               content. In that respect,Un Monde sans argent remains a
               pivotal essay.
               In a nutshell
               The idea is fairly simple, but simplicity is often one of the most
               difficult goals to achieve. It means that a revolution is only
               communist if it changes all social relationships into communist
               relationships, and this can only be done if the process starts in
               the very early days of the revolutionary upheaval. Money,

               wage-labour, the enterprise as a separate unit and a value-
               accumulating pole, work-time as cut off from the rest of our
               life, production for value, private property, State agencies as
               mediators of social life and conflicts, the separation between
               learning and doing, the quest for maximum and fastest
               circulation of everything, all of these have to be done away
               with, and not just be run by collectives or turned over to public
               ownership: they have to be replaced by communal,
               moneyless, profitless, Stateless, forms of life. The process will
               take time to be completed, but it will start at the beginning of
               the revolution, which will not create the preconditions of
               communism: it will create communism.
               Is it a programme ?
               We are not talking about a plan to be fulfilled one day, a project
               adequate to the needs of the proletarians (and ultimately of
               humankind), but one that would be exterior to them, like
               blueprints on the architect’s drawing-board before the house is
               built. Communisation depends on what the proletarian is and
               does.
               The major difference between Marx and utopian socialists is to
               be found in Marx’s main concern: the labour-capital
               exploitation relation. Because the proletarian is the heart and
               body of capital, he or she carries communist potentials within
               himself or herself. When capital stops buying labour power,
               labour is nothing. So every deep social crisis opens the
               possibility for the proletarians to try and invent “something
               else”. Most of the time, nearly all the time in fact, their reaction
               is far from communism, but the possibility of a breakthrough

               does exist, as has been proved by a succession of endeavours
               throughout modern times, from the English Luddites in 1811 to
               the Greek insurgents in 2008.
               This is why it would be pointless to imagine an utterly different
               society if we fail to understand the present society and how we
               could move from one to the other. We must consider what
               communism is, how it could come about, and who would be in
               the best position to implement the historical change.
               “The self-emancipation of the proletariat is the
               collapse of capitalism.”
               The SI once suggested we ought to “go back to a disillusioned
               study of the classical worker movement” (# 7, 1962). Indeed.
               To face up to our past, we must break with the legend of a
               proletariat invariably ready for revolution… and unfortunately
               sidetracked or betrayed. However, blowing myths does not
               mean bending the stick the other way, as if the workers had up
               to now persistently fought only for reforms, had glorified work,
               believed in industrial progress even more than the bourgeois,
               and dreamt of some impossible worker-run capitalism. This
               historical reconstruction replaces one myth by its equally
               misleading symmetrical opposite. The past two hundred years
               of proletarian experience cannot be divided into two totally
               opposed periods, i.e. a first one, closed by the end of the 20th
               century, during which the proletariat would only have been
               able to fight for a social programme which could be qualified as
               “capitalist”, and a second phase (now), when the evolution of
               capitalism itself would render null and void the “labour
               capitalist” option, and the only alternative facing the

               proletariat would become a simple one: communist revolution
               or descent into barbarism.
               The historical evidence offered for this watershed theory is
               unsubstantial.
               Moreover, and more decisively, the mistake lies in the
               question.
               No communist revolution has taken place yet. That obvious
               fact neither proves… nor disproves that such a revolution has
               been up to now impossible.
               In his analysis of The Class Struggles in France (1850), Marx
               first lays down what he believes to be a general historical
               principle :
               “As soon as it has risen up, a class in which the revolutionary
               interests of society are concentrated finds the content and the
               material for its revolutionary activity directly in its own
               situation: foes to be laid low, measures dictated by the needs
               of the struggle to be taken; the consequences of its own deeds
               drive it on. It makes no theoretical inquiries into its own task.”
               Then Marx wonders why, in the democratic revolution of
               February 1848, “The French working class had not attained this
               level; it was still incapable of accomplishing its own revolution.
               The development of the industrial proletariat is, in general,
               conditioned by the development of the industrial bourgeoisie.
               (..) [But in 1848] the industrial bourgeoisie did not rule France.
               (..) The struggle against capital in its developed, modern form –
               in its decisive aspect, the struggle of the industrial wage
               worker against the industrial bourgeois – is in France a partial

               phenomenon (..) Nothing is more understandable, then, than
               that the Paris proletariat sought to secure the advancement of
               its own interests side by side with those of the bourgeoisie (..) ”
               Quotation is no proof, and maybe Marx was wrong, but at least
               let us get his view right. While he regarded full-grown industrial
               capitalism as a necessary condition for a proletarian revolution,
               he did not think that the proletarians could and would only fight
               for reforms for a certain period, until some complete maturity
               or completeness of capitalism left open one and only option:
               revolution.
               Slicing up history into phases is very useful, except when it
               becomes a quest for the “last” phase.
               In the past, “final” or “mortal crisis” theoreticians set out to
               demonstrate (usually with the help of the reproduction schema
               ofCapital’s volume II) that a phase was bound to come when
               capitalism would be structurally unable to reproduce itself. All
               they actually showed was real fundamental contradictions but,
               as Marx wrote, contradiction does not mean impossibility. Now
               the demonstration moves away from schema and figures, and
               sees the impossible reproduction in the capital-labour relation
               itself. In short, up to now, communist revolution (or a real
               attempt to make it) has been out of the question, because the
               domination of capital over society was not complete enough:
               there was some scope for the worker movement to develop
               socialist and Stalinist parties, unions, reformist policies; so the
               working class had to be reformist, and the most it could do was
               to go for a worker-managed capitalism. Now this would be
               over: capital’s completely real domination destroys the
               possibility of anything but a communist endeavour.

               We ought to be a bit wary of the lure of catastrophe theory.
               When 1914 broke out, and even more so after 1917,
               communists said that mankind was entering the epoch of wars
               and revolutions. Since then, we have seen a lot more wars than
               revolutions, and no communist revolution. And we are well
               aware of the traps of the “decadence” theory. Only a
               successful communist revolution one day will allow its
               participants to say: “We’ve seen capitalism’s last days”. Until
               then, the only historical obstacle to the reproduction of the
               present social system will come from the proletarians
               themselves. There is no era when revolution is structurally
               impossible, nor another when revolution becomes structurally
               possible/necessary. All variations of the “ultimate crisis”
               disregard history: they look for a one-way street that could
               block the avenues branching off to non-communist roads. Yet
               history is made of crossroads, revolution being one possibility
               among non-revolutionary options. The schematisation of
               history loses its relevance when it heralds the endpoint of
               evolution – in this case, capitalist evolution – and claims to be
               the theory to end all theories.
               In 1934, as a conclusion to his essay on The theory of the
               collapse of capitalism, and after an in-depth study of the
               inevitability of major crises, Anton Pannekoek wrote:
               “The workers’ movement has not to expect a final catastrophe,
               but many catastrophes, political — like wars, and economic —
               like the crises which repeatedly break out, sometimes
               regularly, sometimes irregularly, but which on the whole, with
               the growing size of capitalism, become more and more
               devastating. (..) And should the present crisis abate, new
8 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               crises and new struggles will arise. In these struggles the
               working class will develop its strength to struggle, will discover
               its aims, will train itself, will make itself independent and learn
               to take into its hands its own destiny, viz., social production
               itself. In this process the destruction of capitalism is achieved.
               The self-emancipation of the proletariat is the collapse of
               capitalism.”
               The concept of communisation is important enough as it is,
               without using it to fuel another variant of the “last phase of
               capitalism” theory. Our problem is not to prove that we have
               entered an entirely new epoch when the proletariat can only
               fight for communism. It is to try and define the concrete
               process of a communist revolution.
               A novelty ?
               The communist movement predates the modern proletariat
               that appeared in England at the end of the 18th century. It was
               active in the days of Spartacus, Thomas Münzer and Gerrard
               Winstanley. Fifty years before Marx, Gracchus Babeuf’s plans
               had little connection with the growth of industry.
               Because of his separation from the means of production (which
               was not the case of the serf or the tenant-farmer, however
               poor they were), the proletarian is separated from the means
               of existence. Such radical dispossession is the condition of his
               being put to profitable work by capital. But it also entails that,
               from the early days, the proletariat is capable of a revolution
               that would do away with property, classes and work as an
               activity separate from the rest of life.

               The theme of communisation is as old as the proletarians’
               struggles when they tried to free themselves. Whenever they
               were on the social offensive, they implicitly and sometimes
               explicitly aimed at a human community which involved a lot
               more than better work conditions, or merely replacing the
               exploitation of man by the exploitation of nature. The logic or
               intention of the 1871 Paris communards, the 1936 Spanish
               insurgents or the 1969 Turin rebel workers was not to “develop
               the productive forces”, nor to manage the same factories
               without the boss. It is their failure that pushed aside
               community and solidarity goals, discarded any plan of man-
               nature reunion, and brought back to the fore what was
               compatible with the needs and possibilities of capitalism. True,
               so far, past struggles have tried to launch few communist
               changes in the real sense of the word, i.e. changes that broke
               with the core capitalist structure. But this limitation was as
               imposed from outside as self-imposed: the proletarians rarely
               went beyond the insurrectionary phase, as most uprisings
               were quickly crushed or stifled. When the insurgents carried
               the day, they did attempt to live and create something very
               different from a worker-led capitalism. The limits of those
               attempts (in Spain, 1936-39, particularly) were not just the
               result of a lack of social programme, but at least as much due
               to the fact of leaving political power in the hands of the State
               and anti-revolutionary forces.
               What Rosa Luxemburg called in 1903 the “progress and
               stagnation of Marxism” can help us understand why a deeply
               entrenched “communising” prospect has waited so long before

               1840s were a time of farseeing communist insights. Marx’s
               1844 Manuscripts probably expressed the sharpest edge of
               social critique, so sharp that the author himself did not think it
               necessary to circulate it (the text was only published in 1932).
               Then, as the worker movement developed against a
               triumphant bourgeoisie, the communist intuition turned into
               demonstration and lost much of its visionary force: the 1848
               Communist Manifesto’s concrete measures were compatible
               with radical bourgeois democracy, communism is only hinted
               at in Capital’s volume I (1967), and it hardly appears in the
               Critique of the Gotha programme (1875). Marx’s concern with
               the “real movement” led him into a search for the “laws of
               history”, and his critique of political economy came close to a
               critical political economy. (He never lost sight of communism,
               though, as is clear from his interest in the Russian mir: “If
               revolution comes at the opportune moment, if it concentrates
               all its forces so as to allow the rural commune full scope, the
               latter will soon develop as an element of regeneration in
               Russian society and an element of superiority over the
               countries enslaved by the capitalist system.” (1881) )
               However, as soon as the proletariat resumed its assault on
               bourgeois society, revolutionary theory retrieved its radical
               momentum: the 1871 Commune showed that State power is
               not an adequate revolutionary instrument.
               Then again, the Paris Commune “lesson” was forgotten until,
               several decades later, the birth of soviets and councils revived
               what Marx had written in 1871.
               In 1975-76, A World Without Money did not evade the issue of
               how Marx stood regarding communisation (a word and concept

               he never used):
               “That Marx and Engels did not talk more about communist
               society was due, without doubt paradoxically, to the fact that
               this society, being less near than it is today, was more difficult
               to envisage, but also to the fact that it was more present in the
               minds of the revolutionaries of their day. When they spoke of
               the abolition of the wages system in the Communist Manifesto
               they were understood by those they were echoing. Today it is
               more difficult to envisage a world freed from the state and
               commodities because these have become omnipresent. But
               having become omnipresent, they have lost their historical
               necessity.
               Marx and Engels perhaps grasped less well than a Fourier the
               nature of communism as the liberation and harmonisation of
               the emotions. Fourier, however, does not get away from the
               wages system, since among other things he still wants doctors
               to be paid, even if according to the health of the community
               rather than the illnesses of their patients.
               Marx and Engels, however, were sufficiently precise to avoid
               responsibility for the bureaucracy and financial system of the
               'communist' countries being attributed to them. According to
               Marx, with the coming of communism money straightaway
               disappears and the producers cease to exchange their
               products. Engels speaks of the disappearance of commodity
               production when socialism comes.”
               The communist movement owes much to its time. In this early
               21st century, we would be naïve to believe that we are wiser
               than our predecessors because we realize how destructive
12 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               productive forces can be. Just as the nature of capitalism is
               invariant, so are the nature and programme of the proletariat.
               This programme, however, cannot escape the concrete needs
               and mind-set of each period.
               At the end of the 18th century, in a country plagued with
               misery, starvation and extreme inequality, and with still very
               few factory workers, Babeuf advocated an egalitarian mainly
               agrarian communism. His prime concern was to have
               everyone fed. It was inevitable, and indeed natural for down-
               trodden men and women to think of themselves as new
               Prometheus and to equate the end of exploitation with a
               conquest over nature.
               About a hundred years later, as industrial growth was creating
               a new type of poverty, joblessness and non-property,
               revolutionaries saw the solution in a worker-run “development
               of the productive forces” that would benefit the masses by
               manufacturing the essentials of life and free humankind from
               the constraints of necessity. The prime concern was not only to
               have everyone fed, housed, nursed, but also in a position to
               enjoy leisure as well as creative activities. As capitalism had
               developed “the means of social disposable time, in order to
               reduce labour-time for the whole society to a diminishing
               minimum”, revolution would be able “to free everyone's time
               for their own development.” (Marx, Grundrisse, 1857-58)
               Another century later, ecology is the buzz word. Nobody
               seriously believes in a factory-induced or a worker-managed
               paradise, new public orthodoxy declares the industrial dream
               to be a nightmare, so there is little merit in debunking the
               techno-cult or advocating renewable energy or green building.

               The idea of communisation as a revolution that creates
               communism - and not the preconditions of communism -
               appears more clearly when capitalism rules over everything,
               extensively in terms of space (the much talked-about
               globalisation), and intensively in terms of its penetration into
               everyday life and behaviour. This helps us grasp revolution as a
               process that from its very beginning would start to undo what it
               wants to get rid of, and at the same time from its early days
               start to create new ways of life (the completion of which would
               of course last a while). That is the best possible answer to the
               inevitable question: “Why talk of communisation now?”
               One might wonder why the notion hardly surfaced in Italy
               1969-77, when that country came closer than any other to
               revolutionary breaking point. Part of the answer is likely to be
               found in the reality of Italian worker autonomy at the time, in
               theory as in practice. Operaism emphasized more the
               revolutionary “subject” or agent than the content of the
               revolution, so the content finally got reduced to autonomy
               itself. That was linked to the limits of operaismo, whose goal
               was to create or stimulate organisation (top-down, party-led, or
               bottom-up, council-based). This may be the reason why a
               wealth of practical communist critiques and endeavours
               resulted in so little synthetic theorization of communisation.
               Apart from such hypotheses, it would be risky to embark on
               sweeping generalizations purporting to explain the
               (mis)adventures of theory in a particular country by the ups
               and downs of class struggle in that country. Unless one enjoys
               being word-drunk, there is little fun in playing the prophet of
               the past.

               Transition ?
               We would have nothing to object to the concept of transition if
               it simply stated the obvious: communism will not be achieved
               in a flash. Yet the concept implies a lot more, and something
               totally different: not simply a transitory moment, but a full-
               fledged transitory society.
               However debatable Marx’s labour vouchers are, at least his
               Critique of the Gotha programme (1875) was trying to describe
               a society without money, therefore without wage-labour. His
               scheme of a time-based currency was supposed to be a
               provisional way of rewarding everyone according to his or her
               contribution to the creation of common wealth. Afterwards,
               when social-democrats and Leninists came to embrace the
               notion of transition, they forgot that objective, and their sole
               concern was the running of a planned economy. (Although
               anarchists usually reject a transitory period, they lay the
               emphasis onmanagement, via worker unions or via a
               confederation of communes: in the best of cases, when the
               suppression of wage-labour remains on the agenda, it is only
               as an effect of the socialisation of production, not as one of its
               causes.)
               It is obvious that such a deep and all-encompassing
               transformation as communism will span decades, perhaps
               several generations before it takes over the world. Until then, it
               will be straddling two eras, and remain vulnerable to internal
               decay and/or destruction from outside, all the more so as
               various countries and continents will not be developing new
               relationships at the same pace. Some areas may lag behind for
15 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               a long time. Others may go through temporary chaos. But the
               main point is that the communising process has to start as
               soon as possible. The closer to Day One the transformation
               begins and the deeper it goes from the beginning, the greater
               the likelihood of its success.
               So there will a “transition” in the sense that communism will
               not be achieved overnight. But there will not be a “transition
               period” in what has become the traditional Marxist sense: a
               period that is no longer capitalist but not yet communist, a
               period in which the working class would still work, but not for
               profit or for the boss any more, only for themselves: they would
               go on developing the “productive forces” (factories, consumer
               goods, etc.) before being able to enjoy the then fully-matured
               fruit of industrialization. This is not the programme of a
               communist revolution. It was not in the past and it is not now.
               There is no need to go on developing industry, especially
               industry as it is now. And we are not stating this because of the
               ecology movement and the anti-industry trend in the radical
               milieu. As someone said forty years ago, half of the factories
               will have to be closed.
               Some areas will lag behind and others may plunge into
               temporary chaos. The abolition of money will result in fraternal,
               non-profit, cooperative relations, but sometimes barter or the
               black market are likely to surface. Nobody knows how we will
               evolve from false capitalist abundance to new ways of life, but
               let us not expect the move to be smooth and peaceful
               everywhere and all the time.
               We will only modify our food habits, for example, as we modify
               our tastes: changing circumstances go along with changing

               minds, as was written in the third Thesis on Feuerbach in 1845.
               Our intention is not to create a new man, virtuous, reasonable,
               always able and willing to master his desires, always respectful
               of sound dietary rules. About a century ago, chestnuts were
               the staple food of some rural areas of the French Central
               Massif. Such a “poor” diet does not compare favourably with
               the variety we have been accustomed to in “rich” countries.
               But the future is written nowhere. We might well enjoy a more
               limited range of dishes than the abundance currently sold in
               the supermarket.
               Violence and the destruction of the State
               As a quick reminder, let us go back in time.
               For reasons we cannot analyse here, the 1871 communards
               did not change much the social fabric: that, plus the
               insurrection being isolated in one city, prevented
               thecommunards from really appealing to the rest of the world,
               in spite of genuine popular support in Paris. Versailles army’s
               superiority was not due to more troops or better guns: its law
               and order, pro-property and anti-worker programme was more
               consistently understood, put forward and fought for by the
               bourgeois politicians than communalism and social
               republicanism were by the Commune leaders.
               In Russia, 1917, contrary to the communards, the Bolsheviks
               clearly knew what they wanted - the seizure of power - and the
               power vacuum enabled them to seize it. The insurgents did
               away with a State machinery which was already dissolving, did
               not attempt or manage to change the social structure, won a

               civil war, and eventually created a new State power.
               In Spain, the July 1936 worker insurrection neutralised the
               State machinery, but within a few weeks gave political power
               back to reformist-conservative forces. Thereafter all social
               transformations were limited by the pressure of a
               reconsolidated State apparatus, which less than a year later
               openly turned its police against the workers.
               In the 1960s, the radical wave opposed the instruments of
               coercion but never dispensed with them. The French general
               strike made the central political organs powerless, until the
               passive attitude of most strikers enabled the State to recover
               its role. The power vacuum could not last more than a few
               weeks, and had to be filled again.
               This brief survey reminds us that if, in the abstract, it is
               necessary to separate social and political spheres, in real life,
               the separation does not exist. Our past failures were not social
               or political: they were both. Bolshevik rule would not have
               turned into power over the proletarians if they had changed
               social relationships, and in Spain after 1936 socialisations
               would not have ended in disaster if the workers had kept the
               power they had conquered in the streets in July 36.
               Communisation means that revolution will not be a succession
               of phases: first the dismantling and destruction of State power,
               then social change afterwards.
               While they are ready to admit this in principle, quite a few
               comrades, “anarchists” or “Marxists”, are reluctant to consider
               the idea of a communisation which they fear would try and
               change the social fabric while not bothering to smash State
18 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               power. These comrades miss the point. Communisation is not
               purely or mainly social and therefore non-political or only
               marginally political. It implies fighting public – as well as private
               – organs of repression. Revolution is violent. (By the way, which
               democratic revolution ever won merely by peaceful means ?)
               Fundamentally, communisation saps counter-revolutionary
               forces by removing their support. Communisers’ propulsive
               force will not come from shooting capitalists, but by depriving
               them of their function and power. Communisers will not target
               enemies, but undermine and change social relations. The
               development of moneyless and profitless relations will ripple
               through the whole of society, and act as power enhancers that
               widen the fault lines between the State and growing sections of
               the population. Our success will ultimately depend on the
               ability of our human community to be socially expansive. Such
               is the bottom line.
               Social relations, however, are incarnated in buildings, in
               objects, and in beings of flesh and blood, and historical change
               is neither instantaneous nor automatic. Some obstacles will
               have to be swept away: not just exposed, but done away with.
               We will need more than civil disobedience: passive resistance
               is not enough. People have to take a stand, some will take sides
               against communisation, and a revolutionary trial of strength
               does not just battle with words. States (dictatorial or
               democratic) are enormous concentrations of armed power.
               When this armed power is unleashed against us, the greater
               the insurgents’ fighting spirit, the more the balance of forces
               will shift away from State power, and the less bloodshed there
               will be.
19 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               An insurrectionary process does not just consist in occupying
               buildings, erecting barricades and firing guns one day, only to
               forget all about them the next. It implies more than mere
               spontaneity and ad hoc ephemeral getting together. Unless
               there is some continuity, our movement will skyrocket today
               and fizzle out tomorrow. A number of insurgents will have to
               remain organized and available as armed groupings. (Besides,
               nobody has talents or desires for everything.) But if these
               groupings functioned as bodies specialized in armed struggle,
               they would develop a monopoly of socially legitimate violence,
               soon we would have a “proletarian” police force, together with
               a “proletarian government”, a “people’s army”, etc. Revolution
               would be short-lived.
               No doubt this will have to be dealt with in very concrete issues,
               such as what to do with police files we happen to find. Though
               revolution may exceptionally use existing police archives and
               security agency data, basically it will do away with them, as
               with all kinds of criminal records.
               Revolution is not a-political. It is anti-political.
               Communisation includes the destruction of the State, and the
               creation of new administrative procedures, whatever forms
               they may take. Each dimension contributes to the other. None
               can succeed without the other. Either the two of them
               combine, or both fail. If the proletarians do not get rid of
               political parties, parliament, police bodies, the army, etc., all
               the socialisations they will achieve, however far-reaching, will
               sooner or later be crushed, or will lose their impetus, as
               happened in Spain after 1936. On the other hand, if the
               necessary armed struggle against the police and army is only a

               military struggle, one front against another, and if the
               insurgents do not also take on the social bases of the State,
               they will only build up a counter-army, before being defeated
               on the battlefield, as happened in Spain after 1936. Only a
               would-be State can out-gun the State.
               Communist revolution does not separate its means from its
               ends. Consequently, it will not firstly take over (or dispense
               with) political power, and then only secondly change society.
               Both will proceed at the same time and reinforce each other, or
               both will be doomed.
               Communisation can only happen in a society torn by mass
               work stoppages, huge street demos, widespread occupation of
               public buildings and workplaces, riots, insurgency attempts, a
               loss of control by the State over more and more groups of
               people and areas, in other words an upheaval powerful enough
               for social transformation to go deeper than an addition of
               piecemeal adjustments. Resisting anti-revolutionary armed
               bodies involves our ability to demoralise and neutralise them,
               and to fight back when they attack. As the momentum of
               communisation grows, it pushes its advantages, raises the
               stakes and resorts less and less to violence, but only a rose-
               tinted view can believe in bloodless major historical change.
               At the Caracas World Social Forum in 2006, John Holloway
               declared: “the problem is not to abolish capitalism, but to stop
               creating it”. This is indeed an aspect of communisation, equally
               well summed up by one of the characters in Ursula Le Guin’s
               fiction The Dispossessed (1974): our purpose is not so much to
               make as to be the revolution. Quite. But J. Holloway’s theory of
               “changing the world without taking power” empties that
21 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               process of any reality by denying its antagonism to the State.
               Like Holloway, we don’t want to take power. But unlike him and
               his many followers, we know that State power will not wither
               away under the mere pressure of a million local collectives: it
               will never die a natural death. On the contrary, it is in its nature
               to mobilize all available resources to defend the existing order.
               Communisation will not leave State power aside: it will have
               todestroy it.
               The Chartists’ motto “Peacefully if we may, forcibly if we must”
               is right only in so far as we understand that we will be forced to
               act “forcibly”.
               In revolutionary times, social violence and social inventiveness
               are inseparable: the capacity of the proletarians to control their
               own violence will depend on the ability of this violence to be as
               creative as destructive. For the destruction of the State (we
               want to destroy power, not to take it) to be more than an
               empty phrase, negative acts must also be positive. But not
               creative of a new police, army, Parliament, etc. Creative of new
               deliberative and administrative bodies, directly dependent on
               social relationships.
               Who ?
               “The proletarian movement is the independent movement of
               the immense majority, in the interests of that vast majority (..)”
               (Communist Manifesto). Both phrases are crucial : independent
               movement and immense majority. That being said, it does not
               follow that nearly everyone is a proletarian, nor that every
               proletarian can play the same part in the communising
22 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               process. Some are more apt than others to initiate the change,
               which does not mean that they would be the “leaders” of the
               revolution. On the contrary, they would succeed only in so far
               as they would gradually lose their specificity. Here we bump
               into the inevitable contradiction the whole argument hinges
               around, but it is not an insurmountable contradiction. .
               We do not live in a society where just about everybody is
               exploited and has the same basic interest in an overall change,
               therefore the same desire and ability to implement what would
               be a rather peaceful process, as nearly everyone would join in:
               only 3 to 5% would object, Castoriadis assured us, but no doubt
               they would soon see the light.
               We live neither in a post-industrial society, nor in a post class
               society, nor therefore in a post working class society. If work
               had become inessential, one might wonder why companies
               would have bothered in the last twenty years to turn hundreds
               of millions of earthlings into assembly line workers, crane
               operators or computer clerks. Work is still central to our
               societies, and those in the world of work – currently employed
               or not – will have better social leverage power, at least in the
               early days or weeks of communisation.
               The contradiction can be solved because, unlike the
               bourgeoisie striving for political power in 1688 (the Glorious
               Revolution that gave birth to what was to become English
               parliamentary democracy) or in 1789, labour is no ruling class
               and has no possibility of becoming one, now or then.
               General strike, mass disorder and rioting break the normal flow
               of social reproduction. This suspension of automatisms and
23 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               beliefs forces proletarians to invent something new that
               implies subjectivity and freedom: options have to be decided
               on. Everyone has to find his or her place, not as an isolated
               individual any more, but in interactions that are productive of a
               collective reality. When only railway workers go on strike, they
               are unlikely to look beyond their own condition: they simply do
               not have to. In a communisation situation, the extension of
               work stoppages opens the possibility for railway personnel to
               move on to a different range of activities decided upon and
               organized by themselves and by others: for instance, instead
               of staying idle, running trains – free of course - to transport
               strikers or demonstrators from one town to another. It also
               means starting to think and act differently about the railway
               system, no longer believing in feats of engineering for
               progress’s sake, and no longer sticking to the view that “high-
               speed trains are super because they’re fast”.
               What to do with high-speed trains and with buses cannot be
               the sole decision of train engineers and bus drivers, yet for a
               while the individual who used to be at the wheel will be more
               expert at handling and repairing them. His or her role will be
               specific and provisional. The success of communisation
               depends on the fading away of former sociological distinctions
               and hierarchies: breaching professional distances will go
               together with dismantling mental blocks regarding personal
               competence and aspiration. The process will be more complex
               than we expect, and more unpredictable: the experience of
               any large social movement (Germany 1918, Spain 1936,
               France 1968, Argentina 2001, to name a few) shows how
               volatile the unprecedented can be, when the situation slips out
24 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               of control and creates both deadlocks and breakthroughs. One
               thing leads to another point of departure for further
               development. That particular example prompts the question of
               the fading of the difference between “public” and “private”
               transport, which in turn brings back the vital issue of where and
               how we live, since today’s means of locomotion are
               conditioned by the urban segmentation of specific areas
               reserved for administration, habitation, work, recreation, etc.
               Revolution of daily life
               The trouble with philosophers, Polish novelist Witold
               Gombrowicz once suggested, is that they do not care about
               trousers and telephones. That remark hardly applied to
               Nietzsche, who was no revolutionary but refused “to treat as
               frivolous all the things about life that deserve to be taken very
               seriously – nutrition, residence, spiritual diet, treatment of the
               sick, cleanliness, weather!” (Ecce Homo, 1888). It is everyday
               life indeed we will change: cooking, eating, travelling, meeting
               people, staying on our own, reading, doing nothing, having and
               bringing up children, debating over our present and future…
               providing we give daily life its fullest meaning. Sadly, since the
               phrase became fashionable in 1968, “everyday life” has been
               usually limited to the out-of-work time-space, as if people gave
               up hope of altering the economy and wage-labour, and were
               contented with altering acts and doings of a lesser kind:
               feelings, body, family, sex, couple, food, leisure, culture,
               friendship, etc.
               On the contrary, communisation will treat the minor facts of
               existence for what they are: a reflection and a manifestation of
25 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               “big” facts. Money, wage-labour, companies as separate units
               and value accumulation centres, work-time cut off from the
               rest of our time, profit-oriented production, obsolescence-
               induced consumption, agencies acting as mediators in social
               life and conflicts, speeded-up maximum circulation of
               everything and everyone… each of these moments, acts and
               places has to be transformed into cooperative, moneyless,
               profitless and non-statist relationships, and not just managed
               by a collective or converted into public ownership.
               The capital-labour relation structures and reproduces society,
               and the abolition of this relation is the prime condition of the
               rest. But we would be foolish to wait for the complete
               disappearance of the company system, of money and the
               profit motive, before starting to change schooling and housing.
               Acting locally will contribute to the whole change.
               For instance, communising also implies transforming our
               personal relation to technique, and our addiction to mediation
               and mediators. A future society where people would feel a
               constant need for psychologists, therapists and healers would
               merely prove its failure at building a human community: we
               would still be incapable of addressing tensions and conflicts by
               the flow and interplay of social relations, since we would want
               these conflicts solved by professionals.
               Communisation is the destruction of repressive (and self-
               repressive) institutions and habits, as well as the creation of
               non-mercantile links which tend to be more and more
               irreversible: “Beyond a certain point, one cannot come back.
               That tipping-point we must reach.” (Kafka)

               Making, circulating and using goods without money includes
               breaking down the wall of a private park for the children to
               play, or planting a vegetable garden in the town centre. It also
               implies doing away with the split between the asphalt jungle
               cityscape and a natural world which is now turned into show
               and leisure places, where the (mild) hardships of a ten-day
               desert trek makes up for the aggravating compulsory Saturday
               drive to a crowded supermarket. It means practising in a social
               relation what has now to be private and paid for.
               Communism is an anthropological revolution in the sense
               that it deals with what Marcel Mauss analysed in The Gift
               (1923): a renewed ability to give, receive and reciprocate. It
               means no longer treating our next-door neighbour as a
               stranger, but also no longer regarding the tree down the road
               as a piece of scenery taken care of by council workers.
               Communisation is the production of a different relation to
               others and with oneself, where solidarity is not born out of a
               moral duty exterior to us, rather out of practical acts and
               interrelations.
               Among other things, communisation will be the withering away
               of systematic distinction between learning and doing. We are
               not saying that ignorance is bliss, or that a few weeks of
               thorough (self-)teaching are enough for anyone to be able to
               translate Arabic into English or to play the harpsichord. Though
               learning can be fun, it often involves long hard work. What
               communism will do away with is the locking up of youth in
               classrooms for years (now 15 to 20 years in so-called advanced
               societies). Actually, modern school is fully aware of the
               shortcomings of such an absurdity, and tries to bridge the gap
27 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               by multiplying out-of-school activities and work experience
               schemes. These remedies have little effect: the rift between
               school and the rest of society depends on another separation,
               which goes deeper and is structural to capitalism: the
               separation between work (i.e. paid and productive labour), and
               what happens outside the work-place and is treated as non-
               work (housework, bringing up children, leisure, etc., which are
               unpaid). Only superseding work as a separate time-space will
               transform the whole learning process.
               Here again, and in contrast to most utopias as well as to
               modern totalitarian regimes, communisation does not pretend
               to promote a “brave new world” full of new (wo)men, each
               equal in talents and in achievements to his or her fellow
               beings, able to master all fields of knowledge from
               Renaissance paintings to astrophysics, and whose own desires
               would always finally merge in harmonious concord with the
               desires of other equally amiable fellow beings.
               Distant futures & “here and now”
               Few people today would agree with what Victor Serge (then a
               Bolshevik living in Moscow) wrote in 1921: “Every revolution
               sacrifices the present to the future.” While it is essential to
               understand how communisation will do the opposite of what
               Serge believed, this understanding does not give us the whole
               picture.
               One of the strong points of the 1960s-70s, or at least one of the
               best remembered, was the rejection of a revolution that would
               postpone its completion to an always receding future.

               In the following years, as the radical wave gradually ebbed, the
               emphasis on the here and now remained, albeit deprived of
               subversive content and purpose, and was reduced to an array
               of piecemeal changes in our daily life. When they are as all-
               powerful as they have become, money and wage-labour are
               compatible with – and sometimes feed on – inoffensive doses
               of relative freedom. Anyone can now claim that a certain
               degree of self-management of his neighbourhood, his body, his
               parenthood, his sexuality, his food, his habitat or his leisure
               time contributes to a genuine transformation of society, more
               genuine in fact than the old- fashioned social revolution of
               yesteryear. Indeed, daily life reformers claim to work for overall
               change by a multiplication of local changes: they argue that
               step by step, people’s empowerment is taking over more and
               more social areas, until finally bourgeois rule is made
               redundant and the State rendered powerless. The ex-
               situationist Raoul Vaneigem perfectly encapsulated this vision
               in a few words (also the title of a book of his in 2010): “The
               State is nothing any more, let’s be everything.”
               In the aftermath of “68”, against Stalinism and Maoist or
               Trotskyst party-building, radical thought had to combat the
               reduction of revolution to a seizure of political power, and the
               postponement of effective change to later days that never
               came.
               Thirty years later, Stalinism is gone, party-building is passé,
               and it is increasingly difficult to differentiate ex-Trots from
               current far leftists. While it pushes dozens of millions in or out
               of work, today’s all-encompassing capitalism wears more often
               a hedonistic than a puritanical mask. It turns Victor Serge’s

               formula upside down: “Do not sacrifice the present… ! Live
               and communicate here and now !”
               Communising will indeed experiment new ways of life, but it
               will be much more and something other than an extension of
               the socially innocuous temporary or permanent “autonomous
               zones” where we are now allowed to play, providing we do not
               trespass their limits, i.e. if we respect the existence of wage-
               labour and recognize the benevolence of the State.
               Commons ?
               The Marxist-progressivist approach has consistently thrown
               scorn on pre-capitalist forms, as if they were incapable of
               contributing to communism: only industrialization was
               supposed to pave the way for proletarian revolution.
               In the past and still in many aspects of the present, quite a few
               things and activities were owned by no-one and enjoyed by
               many. Community-defined rules imposed bounds on private
               property. Plough-sharing, unfenced fields and common pasture
               land used to be frequent in rural life. Village public meetings
               and collective decisions were not unusual, mostly on minor
               topics, sometimes on important matters.
               While they provide us with valuable insights into what a
               possible future world would look like, and indeed often
               contribute to its coming, these habits and practices are unable
               to achieve this coming by themselves. A century ago, the
               Russian mir had neither the strength nor the intention of
               revolutionising society: rural cooperation depended on a social
               system and a political order that was beyond the grasp of the

               village autonomy. Nowadays, millions of co-ops meet their
               match when they attempt to play multinationals – unless they
               turn into big business themselves.
               Our critique of progressivism does not mean supporting
               tradition against modernity. Societal customs have many
               oppressive features (particularly but not only regarding
               women) that are just as anti-communist as the domination of
               money and wage-labour. Communisation will succeed by being
               critical of both modernity and tradition. To mention just two
               recent examples, the protracted rebellion in Kabylia and the
               insurgency in Oaxaca have proved how collective links and
               assemblies can be reborn and strengthen popular resistance.
               Communisation will include the revitalization of old community
               forms, when by resurrecting them people get more than what
               they used to get from these forms in the past. Reviving former
               collective customs will help the communisation process by
               transforming these customs.
               Community
               Countless and varied visions of a future communist world have
               been suggested in modern times, by Sylvain Maréchal and G.
               Babeuf, Marx, even Arthur Rimbaud in 1871, Kropotkin and
               many anarchists, the Dutch council communists in the 1930s,
               etc. Their most common features may be summed up in the
               following equation:
               communism =
               direct democracy =
               fulfilment of needs =
31 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               community + abundance =
               equality
               Since the historical subject of the future is envisioned as a self-
               organised human community, the big question is to know how
               it will organise itself. Who will lead: everybody, a few, or
               nobody? Who will decide: the collectivity, or a wise minority?
               Will the human species delegate responsibilities to a few
               persons, and if so, how?
               We will not go back here to the critique of democracy, which
               we have dealt with in other essays, and we will focus on one
               point: because the vast majority of revolutionaries (Marxists
               and anarchists) regard communism above all as a new way of
               organising society, they are first of all concerned by how to find
               the best possible organisational forms, institutions in other
               words, be they fixed or adaptable, complex or extremely
               simple. (Individual anarchism is but another type of
               organisation: a coexistence of egos who are free and equal
               because each is independent of the others.)
               We start from another standpoint: communism concerns as
               much the activity of human beings as their inter-relations. The
               way they relate to each other depends on what they do
               together. Communism organises production and has no fear of
               institutions, yet it is first of all neither institution nor production:
               it is activity.
               The following sections only give a few elements on how work
               could be transformed into activity.
               No money
32 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Communising is not just making everything available to
               everyone without anyone paying, as if we merely freed
               instruments of production and modes of consumption from
               their commodity form: shopping made easy… without a purse
               or a Visa card.
               The existence of money is often explained by the (sad, alas
               inevitable) need of having a means of distributing items that
               are too scarce to be handed out free: a bottle of Champagne
               has to have a price tag because there is little Champagne
               produced. Well, although millions of junk food items are
               manufactured every day, unless I give $ 1 in exchange for a
               bag of crisps, I am likely to get into trouble with the security
               guard.
               Money is more than an unpleasant yet indispensable
               instrument: it materializes the way activities relate to one
               another, and human beings to one another. We keep
               measuring objects, comparing and exchanging them
               according to the average labour time (really or supposedly)
               necessary to make them, which logically leads to assessing
               acts and people in the same way.
               The duality of use value and exchange value was born out of a
               situation where each activity (and the object resulting from it)
               ceased to be experienced and appreciated for what it
               specifically is, be it bread or a jar. From then on, that loaf of
               bread and that jar existed above all through their ability to be
               exchanged for each other, and were treated on the basis of
               what they had in common: in spite of their different concrete
               natures and uses, both they were comparable results of the
               same practice, labour in general, or abstract labour, liable to be
33 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               reduced to a universal and quantifiable element, the average
               human effort necessary to produce that bread and that jar.
               Activity was turned into work. Money is crystallised labour: it
               gives a material form to that common substance.
               Up to our time included, nearly all societies have found only
               work as a means to organise their life in common, and money
               connects what is separated by the division of labour.
               A few millennia after “abstract labour” was born, capitalism
               has extended worldwide the condition of the proletarian, i.e. of
               the utterly dispossessed who can only live by selling his or her
               labour power on a free market. As the proletarian is the
               commodity upon which the whole commodity system
               depends, he or she has in himself or herself the possibility of
               subverting this system. A proletarian revolution can create a
               new type of social interaction where beings and things will not
               need to be compared and quantified in order to be produced
               and circulated. Money and commodity will no longer be the
               highway to universality.
               Therefore, communisation will not abolish exchange value
               while keeping use value, because one complements the other.
               In quite a few past uprisings, in the Paris Commune or in
               October 1917, permanent armed fighters were paid as soldiers
               of the revolution, which is what they were.
               From the early hours and days of a future communist
               revolution, the participants will neither need, use nor receive
               money to fight or to feed themselves, because goods will not
               be reduced to a quantum of something comparable to another
               quantum. Circulation will be based on the fact that each action
34 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               and person is specific and does not need to be measured to
               another in order to exist.
               Superficial critics of capitalism denounce finance and praise
               what is known as the “real” economy, but today a car or a bag
               of flour only have some use because they are treated (and
               acted upon) according to their cost in money terms, i.e.
               ultimately to the labour time incorporated in them. Nothing
               now seriously exists apart from its cost. It is unthinkable for
               parents who have a son and daughter to buy a car as birthday
               present for her and a T-shirt for him. If they do, everyone will
               measure their love for their two children according to the
               respective amount of money spent on each of them. In today’s
               world, for objects, acts, talents and persons to exist socially,
               they have to be compared, reduced to a substance that is both
               common and quantifiable.
               When building a house, there is a difference between making
               sure the builders will not be short of bricks and mortar (which
               we can safely assume communist builders will care about) and
               budgeting a house plan (which in this present society is a prior
               condition). Communisation will be our getting used to counting
               physical realities without resorting to accountancy. The pen
               and pencil (or possibly the computer) of the bricklayer are not
               the same as the double-entry book of the accounts
               department.
               “In the communist revolution, the productive act will never be
               onlyproductive. One sign of this among others will be the fact
               that the product considered will be particular: it will correspond
               to needs expressed personally (by the direct producers at the
               time or by others) and that the satisfaction of the need won't
35 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               be separated from the productive act itself. Let's think, for
               example, about how the construction of housing will change as
               soon as standardization disappears. Production without
               productivity will mean that any individual engaged in the
               project will be in a position to give his opinion concerning the
               product and the methods. Things will go much slower than in
               today's industrialized building industry. The participants in the
               project may even wish to live there after the building is
               finished. Will it be a total mess? Let's just say that time will not
               count and that cases in which the project isn't completed, in
               which everything is abandoned in midstream - maybe because
               production of the inputs is without productivity too - won't be a
               problem. Again, this is because the activity will have found its
               justification in itself, independently of its productive result.
               In a general way, one can say that communisation replaces
               the circulation of goods between "associated producers" with
               the circulation of people from one activity to another.” (Bruno
               Astarian)
               Critic after dinner
               “In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive
               sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any
               branch he wishes, society regulates the general production
               and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and
               another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the
               afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just
               as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman,
               herdsman or critic.” (Marx, German Ideology, 1845)
36 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               This statement has been ridiculed by bourgeois for its naivety,
               and attacked by radicals for its acceptance of objectionable
               activities, hunting of course, more generally its endorsement of
               man’s domination over animals. An even more critical view
               might ask why Marx reserves philosophy or art for the evening,
               as an afterthought, as if there was no time for it while
               producing food, which seems to take up most of the day in
               Marx’s vision...
               In 1845, Marx was providing no blueprint for the future, and he
               inserted his prejudices and preconceptions of his time. But so
               do we today, and we would be pretentious to think ourselves
               devoid of prejudices.
               The most valid aspect of that statement remains the idea that
               people living in a communist world would not be tied to a trade
               or function for life, which still remains the fate of most of us.
               When this is not the case, mobility is often forced upon us: the
               least skilled usually get the worst jobs, the poorest pay and
               lowest social image, and they are the first to be laid off and
               pressured into a re-training scheme. Besides, “multi-tasking” is
               a way of making workers more productive.
               As long as work exists as such, that is as a time-space reserved
               for production (and earning money), a hierarchy of skills will
               remain. Only the opening-up of productive acts to the rest of
               life will change the situation. Among other things, this implies
               the end of the present work-place as a specific distinct place,
               where only those involved in it are allowed in.
               Scarcity vs. abundance: Prometheus unbound?
37 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               For many a communist (once again, most Marxists and quite a
               few anarchists), the original cause of the exploitation of man by
               man was the emergence of asurplus of production in societies
               still plagued by scarcity. The tenets of the argument could be
               summarized as follows. For thousands of years, a minority was
               able to make the majority work for the benefit of a privileged
               few who kept most of the surplus for themselves. Fortunately,
               despite its past and present horrors, capitalism is now bringing
               about an unheard-of and ever-growing wealth: thereby the
               age-old need (and desire) to exploit and dominate loses its
               former objective cause. The poverty of the masses is no longer
               the condition for education, leisure and art to be enjoyed only
               by economic, political and cultural elites.
               It is therefore logical that the goal (shared by most variants of
               the worker movement) should be to create a society of
               abundance. Against capitalism which forces us to work without
               fulfilling our needs, and distributes its products in most
               unequal fashion, revolution must organise the mass production
               of useful goods beneficial to all. And it can, thanks to the
               celebrated “development of the productive forces”.
               Besides, industrialization organises and unifies the working
               class in such numbers that they will have the means to topple
               the ruling class and make a revolution which Roman slaves or
               late medieval peasants attempted but were incapable of
               achieving.
               Moreover, and this is no minor point, if money is the root of all
               evil, and if scarcity is the ultimate cause of money, such a
               vision believes that reaching a stage of abundance will
               transform humankind. When men and women are properly fed,
38 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               housed, schooled, educated, cared for, “struggle for life”
               antagonisms and attitudes will gradually disappear,
               individualism will give way to altruism, people will behave well
               to each other and have no motive, therefore no desire, for
               greed, domination or violence. So the only real question that
               remains is how to adequately manage this society of
               abundance: in a democratic way, or via leaders? with
               Kropotkin’s moneyless system of helping oneself to goods that
               are plentiful, and democratic rationed sharing-out of goods
               that are not plentiful? or with some labour-time accounting as
               suggested by the Dutch councilists in the 1930s? The answer
               usually given by anarchists and non-Leninist communists is a
               society of “associated producers” run by worker collectives.
               Whatever the details, all these schemes describe a different
               economy, but an economy all the same: they start from the
               assumption that social life is based on the necessity to allocate
               resources in the best possible way to produce goods (in the
               genuine and democratically-decided interests of all, there lies
               the difference with bourgeois economy).
               This is precisely where we beg to differ.
               Women and men must eat (among other necessities)… or die,
               there is no denying it. Basic needs do exist. So, of course we
               are aiming at society which fairly, soundly and ecologically
               matches resources with needs. What we dispute is that human
               life consists primarily in fulfilling needs, and that, logically,
               revolution should primarily consist in creating a society where
               physical needs are fulfilled. Human beings only satisfy – or fail
               to satisfy – all their needs within social interrelations. Only in
               extreme circumstances do we eat just in order not to starve. In
39 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               most cases, we eat in the company of others (or we decide or
               are led or forced to eat on our own, which also is a social
               situation). We follow a diet. We may overeat or voluntarily skip
               a meal. This is true of nearly all other social acts. Contrary to
               widespread popular misbelief, the “materialistic conception of
               history” (as exposed in The German Ideology for example)
               does not say that the economy rules the world. It states
               something quite different: social relations depend on the way
               we produce our material conditions of life, and not, say, on our
               ideas or ideals. And we produce these material conditions in
               relation to other beings (in most societies, these are class
               relations). A plough, a lathe or a computer does not determine
               history by itself. In fact, the “materialistic conception” explains
               the present rule of the economy as a historical phenomenon,
               which did not exist in Athens 500 B.C., and will no longer exist
               after a communist revolution.
               The human Number One question, or the revolution question,
               is not to find how to bridge the gap between resources and
               needs (as economists would have it), nor to turn artificial and
               extravagant needs into natural and reasonable ones (as
               ecologists would like us to). It is to understand basic needs for
               what they are. Communism obviously takes basic needs into
               account, especially in a world where about one billion people
               are underfed. But how will this vital food issue be addressed?
               As Hic Salta explained in 1998, the natural urge to grow food,
               potatoes for instance, will be met through the birth of social
               links which will also result in vegetable gardening.
               Communisers will not say: “Let’s grow potatoes because we
               need to feed ourselves.” Rather, they will imagine and invent a

               way to meet, to get and be together, that will include
               vegetable gardening and be productive of potatoes. Maybe
               potato growing will require more time than under capitalism,
               but that possibility will not be evaluated in terms of labour-time
               cost and saving.
               “When communist artisans associate with one another,
               theory, propaganda, etc., is their first end. But at the same
               time, as a result of this association, they acquire a new need –
               the need for society – and what appears as a means becomes
               an end.” (1844 Manuscripts)
               A typical feature of what we have been used to calling “the
               economy” is to produce goods separately from needs (which
               may be “natural” or “artificial”, authentic or manipulated, that
               matters but is not essential at this point), before offering them
               on a market where they will be bought to be consumed.
               “Socialism” or “communism” has usually been thought of as
               the symmetrical opposite of that economy: it would start from
               people’s needs (real ones, this time, and collectively decided
               upon) to produce accordingly and distribute fairly.
               Communism is not a new “economy”, even a regulated,
               bottom-up, decentralized and self-managed one.
               To use K. Polanyi’s word in The Great Transformation (1944),
               capitalism has disembedded the production of the means of
               existence from both social life and nature. No Marxist and
               certainly not a communist, Polanyi was not opposed to the
               existence of a market, but he analysed the institution of the
               economic process as a distinct system with its own laws of
               motion. The Great Transformation, written in the aftermath of
41 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               the Great Depression, coincided with a capitalist effort to
               regulate market forces. In the last decades, there has been a
               renewed interest in Polanyi’s emphasis on “embeddedness”:
               many reformers would like the economy to be brought under
               social control, in order to create a sustainable relationship with
               nature. Unfortunately, as the liberals are right to point out, we
               cannot have the advantages of capitalism without its defects:
               its regulation is a momentary step before going into overdrive.
               To do away with capitalist illimitation, we must go beyond the
               market itself and the economy as such, i.e. beyond capital and
               wage-labour.
               As we wrote in the section on “the revolution of daily life”,
               communisation will be tantamount to an anthropological
               change, with a re-embedding of organic links that were
               severed when the economy came to dominate both society
               and nature.
               Equality
               There would be no communist movement without our
               spontaneous indignation when we witness a Rolls-Royce
               driving by slums. Sylvain Maréchal, Babeuf’s comrade, wrote in
               the Manifesto of the Equals (1796):
               “No more individual property in land:the land belongs to no
               one. We demand, we want, the common enjoyment of the
               fruits of the land: the fruits belong to all.
               We declare that we can no longer put up with the fact that the
               great majority work and sweat for the smallest of minorities.
               Long enough, and for too long, less than a million individuals
42 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               have disposed of that which belongs to 20 million of their like,
               their equals.”
               S. Maréchal’s statement was asserting the existence of a
               human species whose members are similar and should have a
               fair share of available resources.
               Communisation demands a fraternity that involves, among
               other things, mutual aid as theorized by Kropotkin, and
               equality as expressed in The Internationale lines: “There are no
               supreme saviours/Neither God, nor Caesar, nor tribune”.
               But equality is not to be achieved by book-keeping. As long as
               we measure in order to share out and “equalize”, inequality is
               sure to be present. Communism is not a “fair” distribution of
               riches. Even if, particularly at the beginning and under the
               pressure of circumstances, our priority may sometimes be to
               share goods and resources in the most equitable way (which,
               whether we like it or not, amounts to some form of rationing),
               our prime motive and mover will not be the best and fairest
               way to circulate goods, but our human links and the activities
               that result from them.
               Universality
               Where do capitalism’s powerful drive and resilience come
               from? Undoubtedly from its amazing and always renewed
               capacity to invent advanced ways of exploiting labour, to raise
               productivity, to accumulate and circulate wealth. But also from
               its fluidity, its ability to supersede rigid forms, to remodel
               hierarchy and discard vested interests when it needs to, not
               forgetting its adaptability to the most varied doctrines and
43 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               regimes. This plasticity has no precedent in history. It derives
               from the fact that capitalism has no other motive than to
               create abstract value, to maximize its flow, and eventually to
               set in motion and accumulate more figures than goods.
               That aspect is documented enough for us not to go into details.
               What matters here is that capitalist civilization develops
               extreme individualism, while creating a universality of sorts,
               which is also a form of freedom (of which democracy is the
               political realization): it breeds and favours a new type of
               human being potentially disconnected from the ties of
               tradition, land, birth, family, religion and established creeds. In
               the 21st century, the modern Londoner eats a banana grown in
               the West Indies (where she was holidaying last week), watches
               an Argentinean film, chats up an Australian woman on the
               Internet, rents a Korean car, and from her living-room accesses
               any classical or outrageously avant-garde work of art as well as
               all schools of thought. Capitalism is selling her no less than an
               infinity of possibilities. Fool’s gold, we might object, because it
               is made of passivity and spectacle in the situationist sense,
               instead of truly lived-in experience. Indeed… Yet, however
               specious this feeling of empowerment, it socially “functions” as
               it is able to arouse emotion and even passion.
               We would be wrong to assume that a period when
               communisation is possible and attempted would automatically
               and quickly eliminate the appeal of false riches – material or
               spiritual. Two centuries of modern capitalist evolution have
               taught us how resourceful that system can prove. In troubled
               times, social creativity will not only be on our side: in order to
               ride out the storm, capitalism also will put forward authenticity

               and collectiveness. It will provide the individual with
               opportunities to go beyond his atomized self. It will suggest
               critiques of “formal” democracy, defend planet Earth as a
               shared heritage, oppose cooperation to competition and use to
               appropriation. In short, it will pretend to change everything…
               except capital and wage-labour.
               The communist perspective has always put forward an
               unlimited development of human potentials. Materially
               speaking: everyone should be able to enjoy all the fruits of the
               world. But also in the “behavioural” field, in order to promote,
               harmonize and fulfil talents and desires. The surrealists
               (“absolute freedom”) and the situationists (“to live without
               restraints”) went even further and extolled the subversive
               merits of transgression.
               Today, the most advanced forms of capitalism turn this critique
               back on us. Current Political Correctness and its Empire of Good
               leave ample room for provocation, for verbal and often factual
               transgression. Let us take a look at the many screens that
               surround us: compared to 1950, the boundary is increasingly
               blurred between what is sacred and profane, forbidden and
               allowed, private and public. English readers had to wait until
               1960 to buy the unexpurgated version of Lady Chatterley’s
               Lover: fifty years later, on-line pornography, whatever that
               word covers, is widespread (according to some figures, 12% of
               all sites and 25% of Internet searches deal with pornography).
               Contemporary counter-revolution will appeal much less to
               moral order than it did in the 1920s and 30s, and often have a
               “liberal-libertarian” and permissive-transgressive flavour.
               Communisation, on the other hand, will prevail by giving birth
45 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               to ways of life that will tend to be universal, but not dominated
               by addiction, virtuality and public imagery.
               The inescapable contradiction
               Communisation will be possible because those who make the
               world can also unmake it, because the class of labour (whether
               its members are currently employed or out of a job) is also the
               class of the critique of work. Unlike the exploited in pre-
               capitalist times, wage-earners can put an end to exploitation,
               because commodified (wo)men have the means to abolish the
               realm of commodity. It is the working class /proletariat duality
               we are talking about: a class, as Marx put it in 1844, which is
               not a class while it has the capacity to terminate class
               societies.
               Marxists often turn this definition into formulaic dialectics. Non-
               Marxists make fun of it: the French liberal Raymond Aron used
               to say that the “working class” is worthy of the fine name
               “proletariat” when it acts in a (revolutionary) way that suits
               Marxists. Anyone who takes this definition seriously cannot
               evade the obvious: this duality is contradictory. Those who
               handle the modern means of production and have thereby the
               ability to subvert the world, are also those with a vested
               interest in the “development of the productive forces”,
               including utterly destructive ones, and are often caught up,
               willy-nilly, not just in the defence of their own wages, shop-floor
               conditions and jobs, but also of industry, of the ideology of
               work and the myth of progress.
               We have no other terrain apart from this contradiction. It
46 of 49 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Communisation | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               dramatically exploded in January 1919, when a few thousand
               Spartakist insurgents went to battle amidst the quasi
               indifference of several hundred thousand Berlin workers.
               Communisation will be the positive resolution of the
               contradiction, when the proletarians are able and willing to
               solve the social crisis by superseding capitalism. Therefore
               communisation will also be a settling of scores of the
               proletarian with him/herself.
               Until then, and as a contribution to this resolution, communist
               theory will have to acknowledge the contradiction, and
               proletarians to address it.
