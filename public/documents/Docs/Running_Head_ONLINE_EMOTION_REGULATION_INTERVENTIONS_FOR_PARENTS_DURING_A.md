Introduction Parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in the first half of 2020 was characterized by managing work-family life without regular childcare, leisure activities, or social peer contacts for children. Working parents suddenly had to act as teachers for their children during home schooling without prior experiences. #Stayathome was the global family condition for over 14 weeks after the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March 2020, and strict public protective measures were introduced in many countries (Ghebreyesus, 2020). Most families were affected by some form of lockdown and associated measures, from severe restrictions on meeting other people and travel, to quarantine measures in isolation. This drastic public health measure to reduce the reproduction rate of the coronavirus placed high demands on parents in everyday family life, with manifold psychological impacts. A global survey including data from 27 countries between 30th March and 6th April 2020 revealed that alongside being single and of younger age, being in quarantine with more than one child was especially associated with enhanced levels of stress (Kowal et al., 2020). Likewise, during this time period, an increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms was observed in adults living in Austria and Germany, indicating the strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in these countries (Bäuerle et al., 2020; Petzold et al., 2020; Pieh et al., 2020), comparable to similar findings from other countries (Xiong et al., 2020). According to Lazarus’ transactional model of stress and coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), stress is perceived if individuals consider their current demands (stressors) as threatening, uncontrollable and stable (primary appraisal), while available coping strategies are considered as insufficient (secondary appraisal). Indeed, the pandemic restrictions were uncontrollable and threatened various basic needs (e.g., separation of loved ones, loss of self- 3 ``` -- ## Page 4 ### Complete Page View ![Page 4 Complete](images/page_004_full.png) as key components. In their empirical model, Ostberg and Hagekull (2000) emphasized the moderating influence of the relevance of stressors for the parental role, e.g. an inner working model of a ‘perfect’ parent even during the pandemic, who at the same time quickly feels unappreciated or abandoned by others. Accordingly, these parents might face greater challenges to their functioning as “good parents” and might have more difficulties to cope with pandemic restrictions. Hence, parental stress occurs when current demands exceed coping resources (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), combined with an increasing loss of confidence in one’s parental role (Ostberg & Hagekull, 2000) and additional stressors during the pandemic restrictions such as high workload, e.g. as essential healthcare workers, and childcare hassles.. Moreover, role reversals within the households, e.g. if one working parent, traditionally the mother, is predominantly responsible for home schooling and childcare, could have provoked additional strain on the parental dynamic. Bidirectional relations between individual and parental stress can further mutually reinforce each other’s effects (Holly et al., 2019). This might be reflected in initial findings suggesting that parents who experienced higher stress were at higher risk to abuse their children during COVID-19 lockdown in the western United States (Brown et al., 2020). Spinelli and colleagues (2020) showed that children’s behavioral and emotional problems during quarantine were mediated by parents’ individual and parental stress, with the latter having a stronger effect. Moreover, higher depression levels in parents during the pandemic, further intensified by a pre-existing history of mental illness (Brown et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), might additionally increase parent-child dyadic stress levels. It can be expected that highly stressed parents have more difficulties in responding sensitively to the needs and fears of their quarantined children. As a consequence, the children may feel misunderstood and behave more aggressively in parent-child interactions, which can ultimately increase the risk of developing emotional or behavioral problems in the long term (Spinelli et al., 2020). Early work conducted during April/May 2020 found that especially parents’ perceived negative 5 ``` -- ## Page 6 ### Complete Page View ![Page 6 Complete](images/page_006_full.png) compassionate and reduced uncompassionate self-responding in times of suffering in order to SC as a holistic construct. Contrasting these two ER strategies, SC focuses on a mindfulness- based perception of negative affective states and coping with stress in a self-compassionate way, while CR aims at identifying and modifying dysfunctional thinking patterns by verifying the accuracy and functioning of thoughts that lead to emotional stress (Beck, 1979; Campbell- Sills & Barlow, 2007). However, recent studies challenge the distinction between CR and SC as distinct entities and point to relevant interrelations. Inwood and Ferrari (2018) demonstrated in their review that SC may attenuate stress and depressive symptoms by facilitating ER, for example through an improved tolerance of negative emotions (Diedrich et al., 2017). Bates et al. (2020) found in particular that the influence of compassionate self- responding to social anxiety symptoms in a student sample was mediated by CR. Accordingly, SC might encompass a more holistic emotional attitude towards disliked aspects of the self, including cognitive, affective and attentional components that might relate to all stages of Gross'' emotion regulation cycle. Recently, findings suggest that SC could be equally effective as or even superior to CR, especially for participants with major depressive disorder (Diedrich et al., 2014), but also for formerly and never depressed participants experiencing experimentally induced depressed mood (Ehret et al., 2018). Furthermore, the efficacy of reappraisal techniques in reducing depressed mood might be increased when utilizing SC as a preparatory strategy (Diedrich et al., 2016). Moreover, meta-analytic findings confirmed that SC-related therapies reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms in subclinical and clinical samples, with medium effect sizes (Wilson et al., 2019). Considering that CR or SC are effective coping strategies which may enable a dynamic adjustment to the pandemic restrictions despite the continued uncontrollable and uncertain perspective of the pandemic (Coyne et al., 2020), both ER strategies might have a positive effect on secondary appraisal based on Lazarus’ stress model (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). 7 ``` -- ## Page 8 ### Complete Page View ![Page 8 Complete](images/page_008_full.png) perceived individual and parental stress compared to a wait-list control (WLC) group over the course of eight days. We hypothesized that SC would lead to a stronger reduction of individual and parental stress at posttest II (T2, day 8 after baseline) compared to CR and WLC. We further expected CR to lead to a stronger reduction of individual and parental stress compared to WLC at T2. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Participants Participants were recruited through announcements on social media channels addressing the impact of pandemic management on parenthood (e.g., #ParentsInCrisis and #PandemicParenting). The study was advertised as aiming to reduce stress in highly strained parents during the global pandemic. Inclusion criteria were (1) age 18 years or older, (2) taking care of at least one child aged 3 to 18 years who had attended a kindergarten or school prior to the pandemic outbreak, (3) having a device with an internet connection and speakers or headphones, and (4) German-language fluency. No exclusion criteria were defined. 2.2. Study procedure and randomization After providing informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions using a block-wise randomization procedure (block sizes of three or six): CR, SC or WLC (see Figure 1 for study flow). The randomization allocation list was implemented in REDCap (Harris et al., 2019) by the first author and concealed to the second author who enrolled participants. The complete study was conducted within REDCap. Due to the nature and contents of the intervention, participants were not blinded. Participants received two online video interventions (main session on day 0 and booster session on day 3) in the treatment groups via smartphone, tablets or computers. The online videos (day 0: 20 mins, day 3: 10 mins) explained in depth how to practice either CR or SC as a parent affected by the pandemic restrictions. Furthermore, participants in the treatment groups received email 9 ``` -- ## Page 10 ### Complete Page View ![Page 10 Complete](images/page_010_full.png) asked to select one personally relevant thought and adapt it to their own family situation during the pandemic. In the third phase, the participants were instructed to empathize with the physical and emotional experiences while imagining the specific family situation triggered by the selected negative thought. Next, they were guided to practice either CR or SC while addressing themselves in the first person. The aim of the CR intervention was to identify and modify cognitive distortion via three different restructuring techniques by Beck (1979) adapted to the specific conditions of parents during pandemic restrictions. First, participants were asked to seek evidence and counterevidence for the selected thought during and before the pandemic. Next, they were instructed to check the short- and long-term functions of this thought to manage the current restrictions. Finally, they were guided to take a more realistic perspective by generating an alternative, more adaptive interpretation (e.g. “My child is allowed to be angry when I restrict him/her during the pandemic, but this does not change our relationship”). The SC intervention was based on the self-compassion break by Neff and Germer (2018), practicing mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness adapted to the specific conditions of parents during pandemic restrictions. Therefore, common humanity was modified into a concept of common parenthood. First, participants were supported to practice mindfulness by naming their burdening emotions and acknowledging their suffering and distress during the pandemic-related family situation triggered by the selected thought. They were then guided to internalize this stressful family moment as a shared human experience of suffering during the pandemic, in order to establish a felt connection with other parents. Finally, participants were instructed to practice self-kindness by expressing a kind, warm and soothing self-talk while strengthening their self-esteem in the parental role during pandemic restrictions (e.g. “I wish to be kind to myself because this situation is difficult right now and compassion is the only thing that makes sense now. I am a good mother or father, even though I restrict my child during the pandemic”). 11 ``` -- ## Page 12 ### Complete Page View ![Page 12 Complete](images/page_012_full.png) negative associations with life satisfaction have been demonstrated (Klein et al., 2016; Reis et al., 2019). The internal consistency of the global score in the present study was good, with Cronbach''s α = .89. Parental stress. Perceived parental stress was measured using the parental stress subscale of the Parental Stress Questionnaire (PSQ; Domsch & Lohaus, 2010), a reliable 38-item instrument to assess four facets of stress in parenting. The subscale Parental Stress (PSQ-PS) measures parents’ perceived parenting competence (e.g. “There are always days when I feel insecure about raising my child”), stress in interaction with the child (e.g. “I often have conflicts with my child”), and everyday problems caused by parenthood (e.g. “I have to help my child with everyday things (like dressing, brushing teeth, cleaning rooms) more than I would like”). All 17 items of the subscale are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (does not apply) to 3 (applies completely). A version for preschool children and a version for school children exist. The latter version is only standardized for grades 1-6, but was also used for older school children in our study due to a lack of alternative instruments. Cronbach’s α in the present study ranged from α = .90 (school version) to α = .93 (preschool version), indicating high internal consistencies. The test-retest reliabilities were similarly high in the original study, ranging from .89 (preschool version) to .91 (school version, grades 5-6) after a six-week interval (Domsch & Lohaus, 2010). Both primary outcome variables were assessed at T0 (baseline), T1 (day 3) and T2 (day 7). Negative affective symptoms. As secondary outcomes, depressive, anxiety and stress- related symptoms at T0 were measured with the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21, Antony et al., 1998), the short form of the original DASS with 42 items (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). Each scale consists of seven items, asking about symptoms over the past week on a rating scale from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much, or most of the time). All three subscales were shown to be highly correlated with other depression and anxiety self-report scales, demonstrating convergent validity (Nilges & 13 ``` -- ## Page 14 ### Complete Page View ![Page 14 Complete](images/page_014_full.png) generalization of a repeated measures ANOVA which permits the inclusion of participants with missing values at T1 and T2 without imputations. Tukey’s correction was used for post- hoc tests, and Cohen’s d was reported in the case of significance. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of all participants who were randomized and completed T0 measurements. Completer analyses were conducted for the purpose of comparison (per protocol, PP). All participants who completed the primary outcomes at all time points and watched both videos in their entirety were defined as completers. Video watching was checked by comparing time stamps before and after the video interventions (min. 18 mins for the main session and 8 mins for the booster session). Robustness checks were conducted by post-hoc adjusting all models for age of the index child (continuous) and baseline ER traits (ERQ reappraisal, SCS-SF) and by comparing effect estimates and model fit indices. Secondary outcomes were analyzed similarly to primary outcomes on an exploratory basis. As exploratory analyses, cross-sectional mediation analyses were performed for completers with PROCESS for SPSS (Hayes, 2013) in order to analyze whether the relationship between group and parental stress was mediated by individual stress at both time points. Group was used as a multi-categorical predictor of PSS-10 (mediating variable), and group and PSS-10 as predictors of PSQ-PS. In line with Preacher and Hayes (2004), indirect effects were evaluated with 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals based on 10000 bootstrap samples. If the confidence interval did not contain zero, the indirect effect was considered statistically significant. For the exploratory analyses, no correction for multiple testing was applied. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level for all analyses (two-tailed). [Insert figure 2 about here] 3. Results 3.1. Enrollment and participant characteristics 15 ``` -- ## Page 16 ### Complete Page View ![Page 16 Complete](images/page_016_full.png) and a higher successful application compared to the CR group, t(60.66) = -2.78, p = .007, d = 0.71 (see Supplement Table S1). [Insert Table 2 about here] 3.3. ITT analyses: Changes in parents’ individual and parental stress Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) analyses of individual stress revealed a significant main effect of time, but no main effect of group (see Table 2). Moreover, a significant interaction effect of time × group was found (see Figure 2). Post-hoc paired t-tests showed a significant decrease in individual stress levels from T0 to T1 in the CR group, t(273) = 6.27, p ˂ .001, d = 0.68, and in the SC group, t(273) = 4.22, p ˂ .001, d = 0.48, but not in the WLC group. Moreover, significant changes emerged from T0 to T2 in both treatment groups, t(273) = 7.95, p ˂ .001, d = 0.87 (CR), and t(273) = 4.59, p ˂ .001, d = 0.51 (SC) respectively, but not from T1 to T2 (see Supplement Table S2). Group comparisons only revealed significantly lower individual stress at T2 in the CR group compared to the WLC group, t(214) = 2.90, p = .011, d = 0.54, but not in the SC group compared to the WLC group, t(214) = 1.65, p = .228, d =
  0.31. The CR and the SC group did not differ significantly in their decrease of
individual stress at T2, t(214) = -1.22, p = .443, d = 0.23. [Insert Table 3 about here] Regarding parental stress, only a significant main effect of time emerged (see Table 2). Post-hoc comparisons revealed significant differences between all time points, all t(246)s ≥ 5.64, all ps ≤ .003, 0.19 ≤ d ≤ 0.49, with the largest difference between baseline and booster session (posttest I, M = 2.87, SE = 0.51, p <.001). Although there was no significant interaction effect, exploratory group-separated post-hoc analysis revealed that the change between time points was mainly driven by T0 to T1 across all groups. Interestingly, only in the SC group emerged a significant difference between T1 and T2, which was similar in size to the change between baseline and booster, with t(246) = 3.18, p = .005, d = 0.31 (see Supplement Tables S3 and S4 for all post-hoc comparisons). Means for the primary stress 17 ``` -- ## Page 18 ### Complete Page View ![Page 18 Complete](images/page_018_full.png) At the request of the reviewers, we conducted exploratory analyses to test whether the differential efficacy of SC and CR might be moderated by initial stress levels. Following Diedrich et al. (2014), we used median splits to create groups of low (M = 23.65, SD = 4.08) and high (M = 34.66, SD = 4.03) individual stress levels (PSS-10) at baseline and low (M = 18.16, SD = 6.13) and high (M = 33.92, SD = 5.25) parental stress, respectively. Although model fit was improved with the inclusion of high vs. low baseline stress levels (L-Ratio > 207.99, p ≤ .001), the relevant three-way interaction (time × treatment group × stress level group) did not reach statistical significance for individual , F(4,267) = 1.17, p = .323, or parental stress, F(4,267) = 1.01, p = .405. However, when directly inspecting relevant post-hoc comparisons, parents experiencing higher individual stress at baseline displayed a significantly greater reduction of individual stress at T2 in the CR group compared to the WLC, t(211) = 3.73, p ˂ .001, d = 1.02, and in the SC group compared to the WLC, t(211) = 2.87, p = .012, d = 0.84. In contrast, parents with lower individual stress at baseline displayed a greater reduction of individual stress at T2 in the CR group compared to WLC, t(211) = 3.07, p = .007, d = 0.85, and in the CR group compared to the SC group, t(211) = -2.76, p = .017, d = .76. Similarly, significantly greater reductions of parental stress at T2 were found in parents with high baseline levels of parental stress in the CR group, t(205) = 2.71, p = .020, d = 0.72, and the SC group, t(205) = 2.41, p = .043, d = 0.64, compared to WLC. No difference emerged between CR and SC groups of parents with high levels of parental stress and between any group of parents with low levels of initial parental stress, t(205) ≤ 1.91, p ≥ .138. Additionally, we tested whether including baseline trait CR (ERQ) as a random slope significantly improves the model fit for individual stress, but no model improvement was found, L-Ratio = 5.32, p = .070. By contrast, including baseline trait SC (SCS-SF) as a random slope significantly improved the model fit, L-Ratio = 8.58, p = .013. However, effect sizes and statistical significance of the post-hoc comparisons were only marginally affected 19 ``` -- ## Page 20 ### Complete Page View ![Page 20 Complete](images/page_020_full.png) driven by changes due to the main session. However, only CR reduced parents’ stress levels remarkably compared to the WLC without any treatment, with a medium effect size. Additionally, more severely stressed parents appeared to have also benefited from SC, whereas less stressed parents benefited more from CR than from SC interventions, at least for individual stress. Contrary to our expectations, parents did not report a higher stress reduction from SC compared to CR and no intervention, either for individual stress or for parental stress. Interestingly, mediation analyses revealed that reduced individual stress decreased the likelihood of engaging in dysfunctional parent-child interactions and ultimately mitigated parental stress. Due to statistical limitations, this mediating effect was only found for parents who received the CR intervention as allocated, and must be interpreted with caution. The hypothesis that SC with common parenthood, as a potentially especially helpful component in a global pandemic, exceeds the efficacy of CR was not supported by our data. There are several possible explanations for this finding: First, SC might be less effective in reducing stress than in reducing depressed mood (Diedrich et al., 2014, 2016, and Ehret et al., 2018). Second, it is conceivable that the implementation of the SC intervention in the current study was not sufficiently powerful to transfer to daily family practice. Speaking against this argument, however, the SC group reported a more successful application after the booster session compared to the other treatment group. The self-compassion break that was instructed in our intervention is a relatively compact and rather complex intervention, that does not involve practicing the single components individually beforehand, even though we provided psychoeducational contents about SC in the first part of the intervention. Dreisoerner et al. (2021) demonstrated spill-over effects insofar as improvements in mindfulness (and also to a lesser degree in common humanity), but not in self-kindness, were accompanied by improvements in other components of SC. If, even for a predominantly student sample, a detailed writing exercise to practice self-kindness might not be effective without having practiced mindfulness before (see Dreisoerner et al., 2021), it is quite possible that the parents 21 ``` -- ## Page 22 ### Complete Page View ![Page 22 Complete](images/page_022_full.png) patient-therapist interactions and a high level of self-reflection to apply self-kindness in times of great distress and suffering. This is further supported by the fact that the main findings were not moderated by including a trait measure of SC in our statistical models. Next to intensive training, direct therapist support, for example via webcam, is worthy of consideration in the application of SC as recommended by Neff et al. (2018), possibly requiring some form of blended therapy approach. In addition, although we used classical mood induction procedures, for which validity references exist (Westermann et al., 1996), the experimentally induced emotional activation by pictures and dysfunctional thoughts concerning impacts of pandemic restrictions for the parent role might not be adequate to elicit a sufficiently marked emotional response, especially in an online format. Based on Gross’ model (2002), SC might be effective when emotions of helplessness, fear, and sadness are fully activated. This is also supported by the fact that the higher stressed parents in our sample might be better able to benefit from SC. An explanation for the unexpected superior efficacy of CR may be that in a highly demanding phase of a pandemic, cognitive-based and antecedent-focused ER strategies that foster adaptive problem coping are easier to adopt than a more emotion-based ER such as SC. The latter can be overwhelming and thus perhaps inappropriate in an acute crisis, as we know from trauma research (Stanisławski, 2019). By contrast, CR is strongly associated with avoidance of elicited aversive emotions (Wolgast et al., 2011), which might predict difficulty in processing stressful events in the long term. Accordingly, college students with higher clinical distress and lower experiential avoidance reported the greatest post-traumatic personal growth after traumatic events (Kashdan & Kane, 2011). Therefore, it would be worthwhile to examine the additional benefit of a stepped-care approach: CR is presumably an effective ER strategy for all stressed parents during an acute stage of pandemic stress. SC might be a second intervention step within blended care especially for those parents with increased 23 ``` -- ## Page 24 ### Complete Page View ![Page 24 Complete](images/page_024_full.png) did not implement in the respective interventions. To conclude, a more holistic training, combining the teaching of ER strategies with education skills adapted to the specific needs of parents during pandemic restrictions, could be a useful extension in further studies. A number of limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of the present study. We did not measure either the frequency of application of the ER intervention in everyday life or personal feedback on the therapeutic process during study course. Further studies should focus in detail which types of personally relevant thoughts the participants chose to use in adapting CR and SC and how these ER strategies could be incorporated for the sake of engaging in the family routine. Moreover, as we did not objectively verify the extent of emotional activation (for instance by using a physiological measure), it is possible that emotions were not fully activated, which would be a basic requirement to maximize the stress-reducing effects of SC. In addition, it is questionable whether SC can be compared to CR as a stand-alone ER strategy in terms of its impact on distress, given its broader construct which might work through ER strategies, such as CR (Bates et al., 2020; Inwood & Ferrari, 2018). ER application frequency in daily life and emotional activation should be addressed more thoroughly in future research in order to examine how SC-related interventions could be optimized to mitigate parental stress. Moreover, a longer follow-up interval of at least several weeks would be required to assess the long-term efficacy of the interventions. With respect to our mediation analyses, we did not make full use of our longitudinal design due to a lack of prior hypothesis definition and insufficient power. Therefore, our cross-sectional finding regarding the indirect effect of individual stress on parental stress in the CR group should be replicated in longitudinal mediation analyses with an appropriate sample size to detect the postulated effects. Nevertheless, several strengths of the study should be noted, including a WLC without treatment and high-quality online ER interventions adapted to the specific requirements of parents during pandemic restrictions. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first 25 ``` -- ## Page 26 ### Complete Page View ![Page 26 Complete](images/page_026_full.png) The authors declare no competing interests.

Introduction Parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in the first half of 2020 was characterized by managing work-family life without regular childcare, leisure activities, or social peer contacts for children. Working parents suddenly had to act as teachers for their children during home schooling without prior experiences. #Stayathome was the global family condition for over 14 weeks after the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March 2020, and strict public protective measures were introduced in many countries (Ghebreyesus, 2020). Most families were affected by some form of lockdown and associated measures, from severe restrictions on meeting other people and travel, to quarantine measures in isolation. This drastic public health measure to reduce the reproduction rate of the coronavirus placed high demands on parents in everyday family life, with manifold psychological impacts. A global survey including data from 27 countries between 30th March and 6th April 2020 revealed that alongside being single and of younger age, being in quarantine with more than one child was especially associated with enhanced levels of stress (Kowal et al., 2020). Likewise, during this time period, an increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms was observed in adults living in Austria and Germany, indicating the strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in these countries (Bäuerle et al., 2020; Petzold et al., 2020; Pieh et al., 2020), comparable to similar findings from other countries (Xiong et al., 2020). According to Lazarus’ transactional model of stress and coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), stress is perceived if individuals consider their current demands (stressors) as threatening, uncontrollable and stable (primary appraisal), while available coping strategies are considered as insufficient (secondary appraisal). Indeed, the pandemic restrictions were uncontrollable and threatened various basic needs (e.g., separation of loved ones, loss of self- 3 ``` -- ## Page 4 ### Complete Page View ![Page 4 Complete](images/page_004_full.png) as key components. In their empirical model, Ostberg and Hagekull (2000) emphasized the moderating influence of the relevance of stressors for the parental role, e.g. an inner working model of a ‘perfect’ parent even during the pandemic, who at the same time quickly feels unappreciated or abandoned by others. Accordingly, these parents might face greater challenges to their functioning as “good parents” and might have more difficulties to cope with pandemic restrictions. Hence, parental stress occurs when current demands exceed coping resources (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), combined with an increasing loss of confidence in one’s parental role (Ostberg & Hagekull, 2000) and additional stressors during the pandemic restrictions such as high workload, e.g. as essential healthcare workers, and childcare hassles.. Moreover, role reversals within the households, e.g. if one working parent, traditionally the mother, is predominantly responsible for home schooling and childcare, could have provoked additional strain on the parental dynamic. Bidirectional relations between individual and parental stress can further mutually reinforce each other’s effects (Holly et al., 2019). This might be reflected in initial findings suggesting that parents who experienced higher stress were at higher risk to abuse their children during COVID-19 lockdown in the western United States (Brown et al., 2020). Spinelli and colleagues (2020) showed that children’s behavioral and emotional problems during quarantine were mediated by parents’ individual and parental stress, with the latter having a stronger effect. Moreover, higher depression levels in parents during the pandemic, further intensified by a pre-existing history of mental illness (Brown et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), might additionally increase parent-child dyadic stress levels. It can be expected that highly stressed parents have more difficulties in responding sensitively to the needs and fears of their quarantined children. As a consequence, the children may feel misunderstood and behave more aggressively in parent-child interactions, which can ultimately increase the risk of developing emotional or behavioral problems in the long term (Spinelli et al., 2020). Early work conducted during April/May 2020 found that especially parents’ perceived negative 5 ``` -- ## Page 6 ### Complete Page View ![Page 6 Complete](images/page_006_full.png) compassionate and reduced uncompassionate self-responding in times of suffering in order to SC as a holistic construct. Contrasting these two ER strategies, SC focuses on a mindfulness- based perception of negative affective states and coping with stress in a self-compassionate way, while CR aims at identifying and modifying dysfunctional thinking patterns by verifying the accuracy and functioning of thoughts that lead to emotional stress (Beck, 1979; Campbell- Sills & Barlow, 2007). However, recent studies challenge the distinction between CR and SC as distinct entities and point to relevant interrelations. Inwood and Ferrari (2018) demonstrated in their review that SC may attenuate stress and depressive symptoms by facilitating ER, for example through an improved tolerance of negative emotions (Diedrich et al., 2017). Bates et al. (2020) found in particular that the influence of compassionate self- responding to social anxiety symptoms in a student sample was mediated by CR. Accordingly, SC might encompass a more holistic emotional attitude towards disliked aspects of the self, including cognitive, affective and attentional components that might relate to all stages of Gross' emotion regulation cycle. Recently, findings suggest that SC could be equally effective as or even superior to CR, especially for participants with major depressive disorder (Diedrich et al., 2014), but also for formerly and never depressed participants experiencing experimentally induced depressed mood (Ehret et al., 2018). Furthermore, the efficacy of reappraisal techniques in reducing depressed mood might be increased when utilizing SC as a preparatory strategy (Diedrich et al., 2016). Moreover, meta-analytic findings confirmed that SC-related therapies reduced depressive and anxiety symptoms in subclinical and clinical samples, with medium effect sizes (Wilson et al., 2019). Considering that CR or SC are effective coping strategies which may enable a dynamic adjustment to the pandemic restrictions despite the continued uncontrollable and uncertain perspective of the pandemic (Coyne et al., 2020), both ER strategies might have a positive effect on secondary appraisal based on Lazarus’ stress model (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). 7 ``` -- ## Page 8 ### Complete Page View ![Page 8 Complete](images/page_008_full.png) perceived individual and parental stress compared to a wait-list control (WLC) group over the course of eight days. We hypothesized that SC would lead to a stronger reduction of individual and parental stress at posttest II (T2, day 8 after baseline) compared to CR and WLC. We further expected CR to lead to a stronger reduction of individual and parental stress compared to WLC at T2. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Participants Participants were recruited through announcements on social media channels addressing the impact of pandemic management on parenthood (e.g., #ParentsInCrisis and #PandemicParenting). The study was advertised as aiming to reduce stress in highly strained parents during the global pandemic. Inclusion criteria were (1) age 18 years or older, (2) taking care of at least one child aged 3 to 18 years who had attended a kindergarten or school prior to the pandemic outbreak, (3) having a device with an internet connection and speakers or headphones, and (4) German-language fluency. No exclusion criteria were defined. 2.2. Study procedure and randomization After providing informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions using a block-wise randomization procedure (block sizes of three or six): CR, SC or WLC (see Figure 1 for study flow). The randomization allocation list was implemented in REDCap (Harris et al., 2019) by the first author and concealed to the second author who enrolled participants. The complete study was conducted within REDCap. Due to the nature and contents of the intervention, participants were not blinded. Participants received two online video interventions (main session on day 0 and booster session on day 3) in the treatment groups via smartphone, tablets or computers. The online videos (day 0: 20 mins, day 3: 10 mins) explained in depth how to practice either CR or SC as a parent affected by the pandemic restrictions. Furthermore, participants in the treatment groups received email 9 ``` -- ## Page 10 ### Complete Page View ![Page 10 Complete](images/page_010_full.png) asked to select one personally relevant thought and adapt it to their own family situation during the pandemic. In the third phase, the participants were instructed to empathize with the physical and emotional experiences while imagining the specific family situation triggered by the selected negative thought. Next, they were guided to practice either CR or SC while addressing themselves in the first person. The aim of the CR intervention was to identify and modify cognitive distortion via three different restructuring techniques by Beck (1979) adapted to the specific conditions of parents during pandemic restrictions. First, participants were asked to seek evidence and counterevidence for the selected thought during and before the pandemic. Next, they were instructed to check the short- and long-term functions of this thought to manage the current restrictions. Finally, they were guided to take a more realistic perspective by generating an alternative, more adaptive interpretation (e.g. “My child is allowed to be angry when I restrict him/her during the pandemic, but this does not change our relationship”). The SC intervention was based on the self-compassion break by Neff and Germer (2018), practicing mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness adapted to the specific conditions of parents during pandemic restrictions. Therefore, common humanity was modified into a concept of common parenthood. First, participants were supported to practice mindfulness by naming their burdening emotions and acknowledging their suffering and distress during the pandemic-related family situation triggered by the selected thought. They were then guided to internalize this stressful family moment as a shared human experience of suffering during the pandemic, in order to establish a felt connection with other parents. Finally, participants were instructed to practice self-kindness by expressing a kind, warm and soothing self-talk while strengthening their self-esteem in the parental role during pandemic restrictions (e.g. “I wish to be kind to myself because this situation is difficult right now and compassion is the only thing that makes sense now. I am a good mother or father, even though I restrict my child during the pandemic”). 11 ``` -- ## Page 12 ### Complete Page View ![Page 12 Complete](images/page_012_full.png) negative associations with life satisfaction have been demonstrated (Klein et al., 2016; Reis et al., 2019). The internal consistency of the global score in the present study was good, with Cronbach's α = .89. Parental stress. Perceived parental stress was measured using the parental stress subscale of the Parental Stress Questionnaire (PSQ; Domsch & Lohaus, 2010), a reliable 38-item instrument to assess four facets of stress in parenting. The subscale Parental Stress (PSQ-PS) measures parents’ perceived parenting competence (e.g. “There are always days when I feel insecure about raising my child”), stress in interaction with the child (e.g. “I often have conflicts with my child”), and everyday problems caused by parenthood (e.g. “I have to help my child with everyday things (like dressing, brushing teeth, cleaning rooms) more than I would like”). All 17 items of the subscale are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (does not apply) to 3 (applies completely). A version for preschool children and a version for school children exist. The latter version is only standardized for grades 1-6, but was also used for older school children in our study due to a lack of alternative instruments. Cronbach’s α in the present study ranged from α = .90 (school version) to α = .93 (preschool version), indicating high internal consistencies. The test-retest reliabilities were similarly high in the original study, ranging from .89 (preschool version) to .91 (school version, grades 5-6) after a six-week interval (Domsch & Lohaus, 2010). Both primary outcome variables were assessed at T0 (baseline), T1 (day 3) and T2 (day 7). Negative affective symptoms. As secondary outcomes, depressive, anxiety and stress- related symptoms at T0 were measured with the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21, Antony et al., 1998), the short form of the original DASS with 42 items (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). Each scale consists of seven items, asking about symptoms over the past week on a rating scale from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much, or most of the time). All three subscales were shown to be highly correlated with other depression and anxiety self-report scales, demonstrating convergent validity (Nilges & 13 ``` -- ## Page 14 ### Complete Page View ![Page 14 Complete](images/page_014_full.png) generalization of a repeated measures ANOVA which permits the inclusion of participants with missing values at T1 and T2 without imputations. Tukey’s correction was used for post- hoc tests, and Cohen’s d was reported in the case of significance. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of all participants who were randomized and completed T0 measurements. Completer analyses were conducted for the purpose of comparison (per protocol, PP). All participants who completed the primary outcomes at all time points and watched both videos in their entirety were defined as completers. Video watching was checked by comparing time stamps before and after the video interventions (min. 18 mins for the main session and 8 mins for the booster session). Robustness checks were conducted by post-hoc adjusting all models for age of the index child (continuous) and baseline ER traits (ERQ reappraisal, SCS-SF) and by comparing effect estimates and model fit indices. Secondary outcomes were analyzed similarly to primary outcomes on an exploratory basis. As exploratory analyses, cross-sectional mediation analyses were performed for completers with PROCESS for SPSS (Hayes, 2013) in order to analyze whether the relationship between group and parental stress was mediated by individual stress at both time points. Group was used as a multi-categorical predictor of PSS-10 (mediating variable), and group and PSS-10 as predictors of PSQ-PS. In line with Preacher and Hayes (2004), indirect effects were evaluated with 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals based on 10000 bootstrap samples. If the confidence interval did not contain zero, the indirect effect was considered statistically significant. For the exploratory analyses, no correction for multiple testing was applied. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level for all analyses (two-tailed). [Insert figure 2 about here] 3. Results 3.1.

[Insert Table 2 about here] 3.3. ITT analyses: Changes in parents’ individual and parental stress Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) analyses of individual stress revealed a significant main effect of time, but no main effect of group (see Table 2). Moreover, a significant interaction effect of time × group was found (see Figure 2). Post-hoc paired t-tests showed a significant decrease in individual stress levels from T0 to T1 in the CR group, t(273) = 6.27, p ˂ .001, d = 0.68, and in the SC group, t(273) = 4.22, p ˂ .001, d = 0.48, but not in the WLC group. Moreover, significant changes emerged from T0 to T2 in both treatment groups, t(273) = 7.95, p ˂ .001, d = 0.87 (CR), and t(273) = 4.59, p ˂ .001, d = 0.51 (SC) respectively, but not from T1 to T2 (see Supplement Table S2). Group comparisons only revealed significantly lower individual stress at T2 in the CR group compared to the WLC group, t(214) = 2.90, p = .011, d = 0.54, but not in the SC group compared to the WLC group, t(214) = 1.65, p = .228, d = 0.31. The CR and the SC group did not differ significantly in their decrease of individual stress at T2, t(214) = -1.22, p = .443, d = 0.23. [Insert Table 3 about here] Regarding parental stress, only a significant main effect of time emerged (see Table 2). Post-hoc comparisons revealed significant differences between all time points, all t(246)s ≥ 5.64, all ps ≤ .003, 0.19 ≤ d ≤ 0.49, with the largest difference between baseline and booster session (posttest I, M = 2.87, SE = 0.51, p <.001). Although there was no significant interaction effect, exploratory group-separated post-hoc analysis revealed that the change between time points was mainly driven by T0 to T1 across all groups. Interestingly, only in the SC group emerged a significant difference between T1 and T2, which was similar in size to the change between baseline and booster, with t(246) = 3.18, p = .005, d = 0.31 (see Supplement Tables S3 and S4 for all post-hoc comparisons). Means for the primary stress 17 ``` -- ## Page 18 ### Complete Page View ![Page 18 Complete](images/page_018_full.png) At the request of the reviewers, we conducted exploratory analyses to test whether the differential efficacy of SC and CR might be moderated by initial stress levels. Following Diedrich et al. (2014), we used median splits to create groups of low (M = 23.65, SD = 4.08) and high (M = 34.66, SD = 4.03) individual stress levels (PSS-10) at baseline and low (M = 18.16, SD = 6.13) and high (M = 33.92, SD = 5.25) parental stress, respectively. Although model fit was improved with the inclusion of high vs. low baseline stress levels (L-Ratio > 207.99, p ≤ .001), the relevant three-way interaction (time × treatment group × stress level group) did not reach statistical significance for individual , F(4,267) = 1.17, p = .323, or parental stress, F(4,267) = 1.01, p = .405. However, when directly inspecting relevant post-hoc comparisons, parents experiencing higher individual stress at baseline displayed a significantly greater reduction of individual stress at T2 in the CR group compared to the WLC, t(211) = 3.73, p ˂ .001, d = 1.02, and in the SC group compared to the WLC, t(211) = 2.87, p = .012, d = 0.84. In contrast, parents with lower individual stress at baseline displayed a greater reduction of individual stress at T2 in the CR group compared to WLC, t(211) = 3.07, p = .007, d = 0.85, and in the CR group compared to the SC group, t(211) = -2.76, p = .017, d = .76. Similarly, significantly greater reductions of parental stress at T2 were found in parents with high baseline levels of parental stress in the CR group, t(205) = 2.71, p = .020, d = 0.72, and the SC group, t(205) = 2.41, p = .043, d = 0.64, compared to WLC. No difference emerged between CR and SC groups of parents with high levels of parental stress and between any group of parents with low levels of initial parental stress, t(205) ≤ 1.91, p ≥ .138. Additionally, we tested whether including baseline trait CR (ERQ) as a random slope significantly improves the model fit for individual stress, but no model improvement was found, L-Ratio = 5.32, p = .070. By contrast, including baseline trait SC (SCS-SF) as a random slope significantly improved the model fit, L-Ratio = 8.58, p = .013. However, effect sizes and statistical significance of the post-hoc comparisons were only marginally affected 19 ``` -- ## Page 20 ### Complete Page View ![Page 20 Complete](images/page_020_full.png) driven by changes due to the main session. However, only CR reduced parents’ stress levels remarkably compared to the WLC without any treatment, with a medium effect size. Additionally, more severely stressed parents appeared to have also benefited from SC, whereas less stressed parents benefited more from CR than from SC interventions, at least for individual stress. Contrary to our expectations, parents did not report a higher stress reduction from SC compared to CR and no intervention, either for individual stress or for parental stress. Interestingly, mediation analyses revealed that reduced individual stress decreased the likelihood of engaging in dysfunctional parent-child interactions and ultimately mitigated parental stress. Due to statistical limitations, this mediating effect was only found for parents who received the CR intervention as allocated, and must be interpreted with caution. The hypothesis that SC with common parenthood, as a potentially especially helpful component in a global pandemic, exceeds the efficacy of CR was not supported by our data. There are several possible explanations for this finding: First, SC might be less effective in reducing stress than in reducing depressed mood (Diedrich et al., 2014, 2016, and Ehret et al., 2018). Second, it is conceivable that the implementation of the SC intervention in the current study was not sufficiently powerful to transfer to daily family practice. Speaking against this argument, however, the SC group reported a more successful application after the booster session compared to the other treatment group. The self-compassion break that was instructed in our intervention is a relatively compact and rather complex intervention, that does not involve practicing the single components individually beforehand, even though we provided psychoeducational contents about SC in the first part of the intervention. Dreisoerner et al. (2021) demonstrated spill-over effects insofar as improvements in mindfulness (and also to a lesser degree in common humanity), but not in self-kindness, were accompanied by improvements in other components of SC. If, even for a predominantly student sample, a detailed writing exercise to practice self-kindness might not be effective without having practiced mindfulness before (see Dreisoerner et al., 2021), it is quite possible that the parents 21 ``` -- ## Page 22 ### Complete Page View ![Page 22 Complete](images/page_022_full.png) patient-therapist interactions and a high level of self-reflection to apply self-kindness in times of great distress and suffering. This is further supported by the fact that the main findings were not moderated by including a trait measure of SC in our statistical models. Next to intensive training, direct therapist support, for example via webcam, is worthy of consideration in the application of SC as recommended by Neff et al. (2018), possibly requiring some form of blended therapy approach. In addition, although we used classical mood induction procedures, for which validity references exist (Westermann et al., 1996), the experimentally induced emotional activation by pictures and dysfunctional thoughts concerning impacts of pandemic restrictions for the parent role might not be adequate to elicit a sufficiently marked emotional response, especially in an online format. Based on Gross’ model (2002), SC might be effective when emotions of helplessness, fear, and sadness are fully activated. This is also supported by the fact that the higher stressed parents in our sample might be better able to benefit from SC. An explanation for the unexpected superior efficacy of CR may be that in a highly demanding phase of a pandemic, cognitive-based and antecedent-focused ER strategies that foster adaptive problem coping are easier to adopt than a more emotion-based ER such as SC. The latter can be overwhelming and thus perhaps inappropriate in an acute crisis, as we know from trauma research (Stanisławski, 2019). By contrast, CR is strongly associated with avoidance of elicited aversive emotions (Wolgast et al., 2011), which might predict difficulty in processing stressful events in the long term. Accordingly, college students with higher clinical distress and lower experiential avoidance reported the greatest post-traumatic personal growth after traumatic events (Kashdan & Kane, 2011). Therefore, it would be worthwhile to examine the additional benefit of a stepped-care approach: CR is presumably an effective ER strategy for all stressed parents during an acute stage of pandemic stress. SC might be a second intervention step within blended care especially for those parents with increased 23 ``` -- ## Page 24 ### Complete Page View ![Page 24 Complete](images/page_024_full.png) did not implement in the respective interventions. To conclude, a more holistic training, combining the teaching of ER strategies with education skills adapted to the specific needs of parents during pandemic restrictions, could be a useful extension in further studies. A number of limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of the present study. We did not measure either the frequency of application of the ER intervention in everyday life or personal feedback on the therapeutic process during study course. Further studies should focus in detail which types of personally relevant thoughts the participants chose to use in adapting CR and SC and how these ER strategies could be incorporated for the sake of engaging in the family routine. Moreover, as we did not objectively verify the extent of emotional activation (for instance by using a physiological measure), it is possible that emotions were not fully activated, which would be a basic requirement to maximize the stress-reducing effects of SC. In addition, it is questionable whether SC can be compared to CR as a stand-alone ER strategy in terms of its impact on distress, given its broader construct which might work through ER strategies, such as CR (Bates et al., 2020; Inwood & Ferrari, 2018). ER application frequency in daily life and emotional activation should be addressed more thoroughly in future research in order to examine how SC-related interventions could be optimized to mitigate parental stress. Moreover, a longer follow-up interval of at least several weeks would be required to assess the long-term efficacy of the interventions. With respect to our mediation analyses, we did not make full use of our longitudinal design due to a lack of prior hypothesis definition and insufficient power. Therefore, our cross-sectional finding regarding the indirect effect of individual stress on parental stress in the CR group should be replicated in longitudinal mediation analyses with an appropriate sample size to detect the postulated effects. Nevertheless, several strengths of the study should be noted, including a WLC without treatment and high-quality online ER interventions adapted to the specific requirements of parents during pandemic restrictions. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first 25 ``` -- ## Page 26 ### Complete Page View ![Page 26 Complete](images/page_026_full.png) The authors declare no competing interests.
