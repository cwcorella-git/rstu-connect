The first is a look at the success of the network form of organisation and why it came to the fore in the current period. It then looks at the limitations of that form or organisation. The second article looks at the organisational practise of the first anarchists and in partic-

1. This casualty figure is the maximum estimate for actual war deaths I have seen.
It is a sign of the continued acceptance of the rationale behind the war in the West that no-one actually seems to either know or care how many died on the Iraqi side, or that perhaps 500,000 Iraqi children have died since the end of the war due to the combined effects of destruction at the time of the war and sanctions since.

Bakunin in Program and Object of the Secret Revolutionary Organisation of the people whom they had never met. This tended to bypass existing organisations International Brotherhood (1868) as published in God and the State, No Gods, No many of whom tended to see the internet as a threat rather than an opportunity. For Masters, Vol 1, p. 156 a time it also threw the various state spying and police forces into disarray as they were used to a model where infiltration of one or a small number of centralised organisations could give them a very accurate picture of how many would attend something and what they were likely to do. Simply put these new methods initially allowed activists to seemingly appear from nowhere and either shut down summits as in Seattle and Prague or, as in Quebec, force the state to imprison itself behind high walls and fences. It was suddenly pos- sible for a small and poorly resourced group to communicate with and seek aid from people all over their continent. It was possible for those thinking of travelling to a protest to get quite detailed local information in advance through web sites and email lists. After a decade where the only thing of significance happening on the left was the Zapatistas, the initial success of the summit protests seemed to represent an enormous leap forward. M The Advantages of this Form of Organisation The major advantage of this form of organisation is that it allowed the rapid devel- opment and growth of a movement of tens of thousands from a tiny base without sig- nificant resources. Almost without exception groups formed spontaneously, copying what they perceived as the success of what others were doing elsewhere. Their knowledge of the process was obtained not from individual contact or even books but from what people were writing on a multitude of web sites and email lists. In the first years it was also possible for network organised summit protests to have a real impact on the various global capitalist summits. The business of both the 1999 World Trade Organisation (WTO) summit in Seattle and the 2000 World Bank summit in Prague was disrupted, in the case of Prague leading to the aban- doning of the entire event as delegates fled the city. This was possible because ini- tially the various state security forces who are used to dealing with top down, cen- tralized organisations didn’t know who to watch and what to take seriously. On a more local level the initial Reclaim the Streets events that were held in many cities around the globe also caused confusion amongst police forces unused to such organising methods. Of course the state has enormous resources at its disposal and after some pretty

Network methods of organisation have proved to be very effective at organising one-off summit protests. They have also played a vital role in building international solidarity, in particular with the Zapatista struggle in Chiapas in the mid-1990’s. But the experience of those organising the summit protests suggests that in the after- math the networks proved fragile and were unable to sustain a local impact. In Argentina, network forms of organisation proved capable of getting several pres- idents out of power and were able to help organise the occupations of dozens of fac- tories but appear not to have made much progress towards overthrowing capitalism. The slogan was ‘they all must go’ but the reality was that there was always another candidate in the wings to fill the president’s chair when it became vacant. This does not prove that the network form or organisation is useless, nor that there is an alternative form of organisation that is better in all circumstances. But it does suggest a need to look at models of organisation beyond networks. Or rather at models intended to complement the network form of organisation and address those areas where it is weak. The old left often took the attitude that there was one ideal form of organisation that could be scaled down to fill all needs and all circumstances. For the Leninists that was often democratic centralism, the idea that putting a smart leadership in charge was the way forward. For some anarcho-syndicalists it was syndicalism but most anarchists have always favoured a plurality of organisational forms. From the late 19th century, anarchists have advocated a number of forms of organisation. Sometimes given the nature of the debate these were put forward as polarised alternatives to each other. But some, like Bakunin, argued that all these forms of organisation should exist side by side and that anarchists should be involved in all of them. What is needed is that committed anarchists also organise in anarchist political organisations that seek to provide the continuity, theoretical depth and tactical unity that networks, because of their advantages, lack. The main goal of networks is to organise lots and lots of people around a limited project (e.g. a single day’s protest). Trying to develop any agreed theoretical depth in such a project would just limit the This article was originally published in Red & Black Revolution No. 3 in 1997 number of people who can be involved. as Organising Against Capitalism

The first and most important of these is that we have an equal say in how these decisions are reached. In the anarchist organisation all have an equal say and vote in defining the organisation’s position through conference discussions or mandated delegates. In the Leninist organisation the closest you get to this is getting some sort of vote on which party leader tells you what to do.21 Secondly, in the anarchist organisation the nature of this discipline is voluntary in the sense that members should be free to leave organ-

Let us stop for a moment and consider what level of organisation we’re talking of. Bakunin’s political ideology at the time was fairly unformed but is usually described We mean not only activists on every street and in every workplace but social centres as ‘Pan-Slavist’. Many commentators since have had problems putting this in any in every neighbourhood, weekly or even daily papers with circulations in the tens or sensible context.

It does confirm one common criticism of Bakunin, that he did not confine his revolutionary subject to the industrial working class, but looked as much, if not more so, to the artisans and the peasants. However while this criticism M The Struggle Goes On might make some sense in modern Europe or North America today, in the 1870’s any revolution which only mobilised the urban workers would have been doomed to In recent years a host of grassroots movements have demonstrated not only that defeat. At that time urban workers were a tiny minority of society. the class struggle is very much alive but, on single issues at least, capitalism can be For instance, in advocating a similar strategy for revolutionaries in Italy, Bakunin defeated.

Where revolutionaries of one form or another have been seen to be a threat, from the Black Panthers, to the Irish civil rights movement, to 1970’s Italy, the gloves have come off and the full array of state oppression, including infiltration and provocation have been deployed against them. At the moment the relatively trivial threat of the Black Bloc’s on the globalisation demonstrations is seeing an increasing array of state oppression being deployed, including now a fatal shooting. Bakunin’s writings provide us with one starting point for looking at the apparent contradiction between wanting to create a libertarian society and needing to overthrow a powerful and authoritarian state to do so.
