Huggins1*, Isobel M. Cameron2 and Justin H. G. Williams1 1 Translational Neuroscience, School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, Institute of Medical Science, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom, 2Medical Education, School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom Emotion is inherently embodied, formulated through bodily sensation, as well as expressed and regulated through action. Both expressing one’s own emotions and understanding the emotional actions of others are common areas of difficulty in autism. Moreover, reduced emotional awareness is also thought to be problematic in autism, and such difficulties may be mediated by impaired motor cognition. We aimed to examine how intensity of emotional experience and ability to differentiate between one’s own emotions relates to Edited by: motor empathy and autistic traits. We hypothesized that greater motor cognition would Anthony P. Atkinson, be associated with greater emotional intensity and more refined emotion differentiation. Durham University, United Kingdom Participants from the general population (N = 160) completed the Actions and Feelings Reviewed by: Rory Allen, Questionnaire (AFQ), a self-report measure assessing motor cognition, alongside the Goldsmiths University of London, Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire and an emotion elicitation task.

All other participants few studies have examined motor empathy in conjunction with were offered £10 cash to thank them for their time. Eleven emotional self-awareness and autism. One potential reason is participants were excluded from final analyses. Five participants that measurement of motor empathy is usually challenging, had missing PED-task data due to a technical error, 5 did not requiring methods such as facial electromyography or visual complete the AFQ, and 1 had significant amounts of missing data. action coding. Furthermore, motor empathy is often not explicitly Following exclusions, there was a final sample of 160 measured in self-report measures of empathy (e.g., the Interpersonal participants (132 females and 28 males), with a median age Reactivity Index; Davis, 1980). Potentially, the creation of a self- of 20 (IQR = 3; range = 17-59). Of these 160 participants, report measure of motor empathy and cognition may allow for 148 were undergraduate students, 3 were post-graduate students, more diverse research in this field. and 9 were non-students. To address this gap in the literature, Williams et al. (2016) developed the Actions and Feelings Questionnaire (AFQ), a Emotional Intensity and Differentiation self-report questionnaire intended to measure self-awareness of Emotional intensity and differentiation were measured with sensorimotor involvement in social and emotional behavior. The an image-rating paradigm based on Erbas et al.’s (2014) Photo AFQ measures awareness of the emotional actions of others, Emotion Differentiation Task (PED task). In the PED task, one’s own use of imagery, and how frequently one uses gesture. participants view emotional images paired with different emotion AFQ scores are significantly lower in autistic than neurotypical terms, rating how strongly the image evokes each discrete adults (Williams and Cameron, 2017), demonstrating potential emotional state. While Erbas and colleagues’ original paradigm discriminative validity and aligning with the wider findings of exclusively used negative images and words, the current PED diminished mimicry and imitation in autism. task also included positive images and terms. Moreover, AFQ scores correlate with somatosensory cortex It should be noted that the PED task does not assess how activation during facial imitation tasks (Williams et al., 2016). accurately participants identify the emotional expressions of Based on this, the authors argued that the AFQ assesses self- others. Instead, participants are asked to rate their own subjective awareness of emotional actions, and this awareness may predict emotional responses to the stimuli. This differentiates the task emotional awareness. There is a commonsense logic to this from popular tasks such the Reading the Mind in the Eyes proposal. If awareness of bodily sensations, as measured through test (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001), which focuses on ability to interoception, predicts emotional awareness, it would follow identify the emotions of others. The fact that participants are that awareness of bodily actions may similarly facilitate more expected to rate their own emotional responses, rather than refined emotional awareness. If that is the case, higher AFQ the emotional qualities of the images, is stressed multiple times scores may be associated with less intense and more poorly in both the oral and written instructions. differentiated experience of one’s own emotional experiences, Emotional stimuli were taken from the Nencki Affective which would subsequently predict greater difficulty understanding Picture System (NAPS; Marchewka et al., 2014), 10 due to the emotions of others.
