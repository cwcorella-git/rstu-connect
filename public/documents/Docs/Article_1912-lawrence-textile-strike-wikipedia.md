## The Lawrence Textile Strike, also known as the Bread and
                Roses Strike, was a strike of immigrant workers in Lawrence,

## Massachusetts, in 1912 led by the Industrial Workers of the
                World (IWW). Prompted by a two-hour pay cut corresponding to
## a new law shortening the workweek for women, the strike
                spread rapidly through the town, growing to more than twenty
                thousand workers and involving nearly every mill in Lawrence.
                [3] On January 1, 1912, the Massachusetts government
                enforced a law that cut mill workers' hours in a single work
                week from 56 hours, to 54 hours. Ten days later, they found out
                that pay had been reduced along with the cut in hours.[4]

## The strike united workers from more than 51 different
                nationalities.[5] A large portion of the striking workers,
## including many of the leaders of the strike, were Italian
                immigrants. Carried on throughout a brutally cold winter, the
## strike lasted more than two months, from January to March,
## defying the assumptions of conservative trade unions within
                the American Federation of Labor (AFL) that immigrant, largely
                female and ethnically divided workers could not be organized.
                In late January, when a striker, Anna LoPizzo, was killed by
                police during a protest, IWW organizers Joseph Ettor and Arturo
## Giovannitti were framed and arrested on charges of being
                accessories to the murder.[6] IWW leaders Bill Haywood and
## Elizabeth Gurley Flynn came to Lawrence to run the strike.
## Together they masterminded its signature move, sending
## hundreds of the strikers' hungry children to sympathetic
                families in New York, New Jersey, and Vermont. The move drew
                widespread sympathy, especially after police stopped a further
                exodus, leading to violence at the Lawrence train station.[6]
## Congressional hearings followed, resulting in exposure of

## shocking conditions in the Lawrence mills and calls for
                investigation of the "wool trust." Mill owners soon decided to
                settle the strike, giving workers in Lawrence and throughout
## New England raises of up to 20 percent. Within a year,
                however, the IWW had largely collapsed in Lawrence.[6]

## The Lawrence strike is often referred to as the "Bread and
                Roses" strike. It has also been called the "strike for three
                loaves".[7] The phrase "bread and roses" actually preceded the
## strike, appearing in a poem by James Oppenheim published in
                The American Magazine in December 1911.[8] A 1915 labor
                anthology, The Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of
                Social Protest by Upton Sinclair, attributed the phrase to the
                Lawrence strike, and the association stuck.[9][10] A popular
                rallying cry from the poem was interwoven with the memory of
                the strike: "Hearts starve as well as bodies; give us bread, but
                give us roses!"[4]

## Founded in 1845, Lawrence was a flourishing but deeplytroubled textile city. By 1900, mechanization and the deskilling
## of labor in the textile industry enabled factory owners to
## eliminate skilled workers and to employ large numbers of
                unskilled immigrant workers, mostly women. Work in a textile
                mill took place at a grueling pace, and the labor was repetitive

## and dangerous. About one third of workers in the Lawrence
                textile mills died before the age of 25.[11] In addition, a number
                of children under 14 worked in the mills.[12] Half of the workers
## in the four Lawrence mills of the American Woolen Company,
## the leading employer in the industry and the town, were
                females between 14 and 18. Falsification of birth certificates,
## allowing for girls younger than 14 to work, was common
                practice at the time.[13] Lawrence had the 5th highest child
                mortality rate of any city in the country at the time, behind four
## other mill towns in Massachusetts (Lowell, Fall River,
                Worcester, and Holyoke).[1]

## By 1912, the Lawrence mills at maximum capacity employed
                about 32,000 men, women, and children.[14] Conditions had
## worsened even more in the decade before the strike. The
                introduction of the two-loom system in the woolen mills led to a
                dramatic increase in the pace of work. The greater production
                enabled the factory owners to lay off large numbers of workers.
## Those who kept their jobs earned, on average, $8.76 for 56
                hours of work and $9.00 for 60 hours of work.[4][15][16]

## hours per week they were cut, even though the company had
## made a profit of $3,000,000 (~$71.4 million in 2023) in
                1911[citation needed].

## The workers in Lawrence lived in crowded and dangerous
## apartment buildings, often with many families sharing each
## apartment. Many families survived on bread, molasses, and
## beans; as one worker testified before the March 1912
                congressional investigation of the Lawrence strike, "When we
                eat meat it seems like a holiday, especially for the children."
## Half of children died before they were six, and 36% of the
## adults who worked in the mill died before they were 25. The
                average life expectancy was 39.[17][18][19][12]
                The mills and the community were divided along ethnic lines:
                most of the skilled jobs were held by native-born workers of
                English, Irish, and German descent, whereas French-Canadian,
## Italian, Jewish, Slavic, Hungarian, Portuguese, and Syrian
                immigrants made up most of the unskilled workforce.[citation
                needed] Several thousand skilled workers belonged, in theory at
                least, to the American Federation of Labor-affiliated United
## Textile Workers, but only a few hundred paid dues. The
                Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) had also been organizing
                for five years among workers in Lawrence but also had only a
                few hundred actual members.[6]

## Workers picket the textile mill at the start of the strike.

## On January 1, 1912, a new labor law took effect in
## Massachusetts reducing the working week of 56 hours to 54
## hours for women and children. Workers opposed the reduction
                if it reduced their weekly take-home pay. The first two weeks of
## 1912, the unions tried to learn how the owners of the mills
                would deal with the new law.[6] On January 11, a group of Polish
## women textile workers in Lawrence discovered that their
## employer at the Everett Mill had reduced about $0.32 from
                their total wages and walked out.[20]
                On January 12, workers in the Washington Mill of the American
## Woolen Company also found that their wages had been cut.
## Prepared for the events by weeks of discussion, they walked
                out, calling "short pay, all out."[21]

## Joseph Ettor of the IWW had been organizing in Lawrence for
                some time before the strike; he and Arturo Giovannitti of the
                Italian Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party of America
                quickly assumed leadership of the strike by forming a strike
## committee of 56 people, four representatives of fourteen
                nationalities, which took responsibility for all major decisions.
                [22] The committee, which arranged for its strike meetings to
                be translated into 25 different languages, put forward a set of
                demands: a 15% increase in wages for a 54-hour work week,
## double pay for overtime work, and no discrimination against
                workers for their strike activity.[23]

                The Massachusetts National Guard mounted on horses during the
## strike.

                The city responded to the strike by ringing the city's alarm bell
                for the first time in its history; the mayor ordered a company of
                the local militia to patrol the streets. When mill owners turned
                fire hoses on the picketers gathered in front of the mills,[24]
## they responded by throwing ice at the plants, breaking a
## number of windows. The court sentenced 24 workers to a year
                in jail for throwing ice; as the judge stated, "The only way we
                can teach them is to deal out the severest sentences."[25]
## Governor Eugene Foss then ordered out the state militia and
                state police. Mass arrests followed.[26][27]
                At the same time, the United Textile Workers (UTW) attempted
## to break the strike by claiming to speak for the workers of
## Lawrence. The striking operatives ignored the UTW, as the
## IWW had successfully united the operatives behind ethnic-
## based leaders, who were members of the strike committee and
## able to communicate Ettor's message to avoid violence at
                demonstrations. Ettor did not consider intimidating operatives
## who were trying to enter the mills as breaking the peace.

                The IWW was successful, even with AFL-affiliated operatives,
                as it defended the grievances of all operatives from all the
## mills. Conversely, the AFL and the mill owners preferred to
## keep negotiations between separate mills and their own
                operatives. However, in a move that frustrated the UTW, Oliver
                Christian, the national secretary of the Loomfixers Association
                and an AFL affiliate itself, said he believed John Golden, the
## Massachusetts-based UTW president, was a detriment to the
                cause of labor.[citation needed] That statement and missteps by
                William Madison Wood quickly shifted public sentiment to favor
                the strikers.[28]
                A local undertaker and a member of the Lawrence school board
                attempted to frame the strike leadership by planting dynamite
                in several locations in town a week after the strike began. He
                was fined $500 and released without jail time. Later, William M.
## Wood, the president of the American Woolen Company, was
## shown to have made an unexplained large payment to the
                defendant shortly before the dynamite was found.[29][30][31]

## The authorities later charged Ettor and Giovannitti as
                accomplices to murder for the death of striker Anna LoPizzo,
                [32] who was likely shot by the police. Ettor and Giovannitti had

## been 3 mi (4.8 km) away, where they spoke to another group
## of workers. They and a third defendant, who had not even
                heard of either Ettor or Giovannitti at the time of his arrest,
                were held in jail for the duration of the strike and several
                months thereafter.[33] The authorities declared martial law,[34]
## banned all public meetings, and called out 22 more militia
## companies to patrol the streets. Harvard students were even

                given exemptions from their final exams if they agreed to go
## and try to break up the strike.

                Political cartoon The Lawrence Way by Art Young with the caption: "On
                February 24 and 25, soldiers and policemen forcibly prevented
                parents from sending their children away from Lawrence to cities
## which offered food and shelter."

## The IWW responded by sending Bill Haywood, Elizabeth Gurley
## Flynn, and a number of other organizers to Lawrence.
                Haywood participated little in the daily affairs of the strike.
                Instead, he set out for other New England textile towns in an
                effort to raise funds for the strikers in Lawrence, which proved
                very successful. Other tactics established were an efficient
## system of relief committees, soup kitchens, and food
                distribution stations, and volunteer doctors provided medical
## care. The IWW raised funds on a nationwide basis to provide
                weekly benefits for strikers and dramatized the strikers' needs
                by arranging for several hundred children to go to supporters'
                homes in New York City for the duration of the strike. When city
                authorities tried to prevent another 100 children from going to
                Philadelphia on February 24 by sending police and the militia to
                the station to detain the children and arrest their parents, the
                police began clubbing both the children and their mothers and
## dragged them off to be taken away by truck; one pregnant
                mother miscarried. The press, there to photograph the event,
## reported extensively on the attack. Moreover, when the

10 of 25 9/7/25, 12:07 PM 1912 Lawrence textile strike - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## women and children were taken to the Police Court, most of
                them refused to pay the fines levied and opted for a jail cell,
                some with babies in arms.[35]
                Parents sending their children to live with supporters in other cities.
                The police action against the mothers and children of Lawrence
                attracted the attention of the nation, in particular that of first
                lady Helen Herron Taft, wife of President William Howard Taft.
                Soon, both the House and the Senate set out to investigate the
                strike. In the early days of March, a special House Committee
                heard testimony from some of the strikers' children, as well as
## various city, state and union officials. In the end, both
## chambers published reports detailing the conditions at
                Lawrence.[36][16]

## The children involved in the police riot were not only the
                children of striking workers, they were also striking workers
## themselves. Most of the workers at the mill were women and
                children. Families were suffering not only from the lost income
                of adult workers, but also the lost wages of children.[citation
                needed] Children were used several times during the strike to
                attract attention to the cause. On February 10, 119 children
                were sent to Manhattan to live with relatives, or strangers, who
                were able to feed them to alleviate the financial strain on the

                striking families.[37] The children were welcomed in NY by
## cheering crowds that drew national attention. When another
                group of children were sent to NY, they were paraded down 5th
## Avenue, drawing even more attention. Embarrassed by the
                bad publicity, the city marshal tried to deter the next group of
                children that were being sent to Philadelphia on February 24,
                with disastrous results.[37] Police attempted to stop the
                children from boarding the train and as mothers tried to force
## their children on board, police intervened with clubs and
                arrested parents and children, the latter being ferried out of the
                town to an orphanage.[37] The next role that children played in
                the result of the strike was the testimony they gave about the
                working conditions in the factories. Most notable was that of
                Carmela Teoli, a 14-year-old mill worker who testified in front of
                a Congressional hearing. Teoli had been hospitalized for seven
## months after the cotton-twisting machine she operated had
                pulled her scalp off. The company paid her hospital bills, but
                did not provide her with sick pay.[38] The national sympathy
## that children elicited changed the outcome of the strike.

## Children of the mill workers were brought to homes of
## supporters of the Lawrence textile strike. With the aid of
                Haywood and Flynn, these two individuals organized a way for

                donations for the children of strikers. In addition, the children
                began to form strike rallies to demonstrate the hardship and
## struggle occurring in the Lawrence mill factories. Strikes
## happened from Vermont all the way to New York City; those
                children fought to be seen and heard where they went.[39]
                The national attention had an effect: the owners offered a 5%
## pay raise on March 1, but the workers rejected it. American
## Woolen Company agreed to most of the strikers' demands on
## March 12, 1912. The strikers had demanded an end to the
## Premium System in which a portion of their earnings were
## subject to month-long production and attendance standards.
## The mill owners' concession was to change the award of the
## premium from once every four weeks to once every two
## weeks. The rest of the manufacturers followed by the end of
## the month; other textile companies throughout New England,
                anxious to avoid a similar confrontation, then followed suit.

## Ettor and Giovanniti, both members of IWW, remained in
                prison for months after the strike was over.[4] Haywood
                threatened a general strike to demand their freedom, with the
                cry "Open the jail gates or we will close the mill gates." The
                IWW raised $60,000 for their defense and held demonstrations
## and mass meetings throughout the country in their support;
                the Boston authorities arrested all of the members of the Ettor
## and Giovannitti Defense Committee. On March 10, 1912, an
## estimated 10,000 protestors gathered in Lawrence demanding
                the release of Ettor and Giovannitti.[40] Then, 15,000 Lawrence
## workers went on strike for one day on September 30 to
## demand the release of Ettor and Giovannitti. Swedish and
## French workers proposed a boycott of woolen goods from the
## US and a refusal to load ships going there, and Italian
                supporters of the Giovannitti men rallied in front of the US
                consulate in Rome.[41]

## In the meantime, Ernest Pitman, a Lawrence building
## contractor who had done extensive work for the American
                Woolen Company, confessed to a district attorney that he had
                attended a meeting in the Boston offices of Lawrence textile
## companies, where the plan to frame the union by planting
## dynamite had been made. Pitman committed suicide shortly
## thereafter when he was subpoenaed to testify. Wood, the
## American Woolen Company owner, was formally exonerated.

                Ettor and Giovannitti both delivered closing statements at the
                end of the two-month trial. In Ettor's closing statement, he
                turned and faced the District Attorney:
                Does Mr. Ateill believe for a moment that... the cross or the
                gallows or the guillotine, the hangman's noose, ever settled an
                idea? It never did. If an idea can live, it lives because history
## adjudges it right. And what has been considered an idea
## constituting a social crime in one age has in the next age
## become the religion of humanity. Whatever my social views
## are, they are what they are. They cannot be tried in this
                courtroom.[44]

## All three defendants were acquitted on November 26, 1912.

                The strikers, however, lost nearly all of the gains they had won
                in the next few years. The IWW, disdaining written contracts as
                encouraging workers to abandon the daily class struggle, thus
## left the mill owners to chisel away at the improvements in
                wages and working conditions, to fire union activists, and to
## install labor spies to keep an eye on workers. The more
## persistent owners laid off further employees during a
                depression in the industry.[41]
                By then, the IWW had turned its attention to supporting the silk
## industry workers in Paterson, New Jersey. The Paterson Silk
                Strike of 1913 was defeated.[citation needed]
                English Wikisource has original text related to this article:
                The strike had at least three casualties:[46]

             - Anna LoPizzo, an Italian immigrant, who was shot in the chest
                during a clash between strikers and police[47][48]

             - John Ramey, a Syrian youth who was bayoneted to death in the
                back by the militia[49][50][51]

             - Jonas Smolskas, a Lithuanian immigrant who was beaten to
                death several months after the strike ended for wearing a prolabor pin on his lapel[52][53]

## Conclusion and legacy

                [edit]

## After the strike concluded, workers received a few of the

## demands established between mill workers and owners. Some
## workers went back to work at the mills and "others came and
                went, trying to find other jobs, failing, returning again to the
                music of the power loom".[54] Even after the strike was
                finished, there were many other strikes that occurred in other
                states involving various mill factories. "On January 12, 1913,
                the IWW held anniversary celebration in Lawrence"[55] which
## was one of the last celebrations for a couple of years.

                Eugene Debs said of the strike, "The Victory at Lawrence was
## the most decisive and far-reaching ever won by organized
                labor."[56] Author Peter Carlson saw this strike conducted by
                the militant Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) as a turning
                point. He wrote, "Wary of [a war with the anti-capitalist IWW],
                some mill owners swallowed their hatred of unions and actually
                invited the AFL to organize their workers.[56]

## On February 9, 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren officially
                announced her candidacy for President of the United States at
                the site of the strike.[57][58]
