                Housing as the Infrastructure of Racial Capitalism

                Today’s housing market is a catastrophic failure, shaped by the
                relentless prioritization of those who profit from our basic need
                for a home. Millions of tenants are forced to make the choice
                between paying the rent and feeding their kids. Two years of a
                pandemic and economic turmoil have inflicted more pain as
                tenants accrued rental debts, struggled to access inadequate
                federal assistance, and were evicted from their homes. Rents
                were up 17.5 percent over the course of 2021, squeezing Black
                and brown tenants the most.

                If it is our goal to solve this crisis, then we have to understand
                the system that creates it: racial capitalism. Under this system,
                wealthy people, who are overwhelmingly white, gain profit and
                power from the exploitation and oppression of working-class
                and poor people of all colors. Our housing system was
                designed around an accumulation of capital that depends on
                severe inequality and, more specifically, on the subjugation of
                Black tenants.

                Housing is the infrastructure of American racial capitalism.
                America, as we know it today, was built through land theft and
                chattel slavery. Every level of government was, to some
                degree, established by white land-owning men for whom the
                protection of private property was the priority. Property laws,
                written to favor those who wrote them, maximized their
                wealth, often at a direct cost to Native communities and Black
                laborers. This violent legacy shapes our conditions today.

                In more recent history, the practice of housing segregation has
                been a central feature of racial capitalism. For example, an
                early version of the Federal Housing Administration’s
                Underwriting Manual determined that the presence of
                “inharmonious racial groups” should be considered an
                “adverse influence” on the total mortgage score, limiting the
                flow of capital to non-white communities. Among many other
                racist lending practices, this type of policy, bureaucratic but
                pernicious, meant that FHA would not insure mortgages in
                Black neighborhoods.

                From redlining to blockbusting to exclusionary zoning, housing
                policies and lending practices have created and maintained
                racialized hierarchies. The modern housing market, marrying

                public and private supports to secure mortgages, protects a
                pathway to wealth-building for those who have been able to
                access it. As a result, Black incomes are 60 percent of white
                incomes, but Black families hold just 10 percent as much
                wealth as white families. Almost every innovation in our
                housing market has followed principles that deepen this racial
                wealth gap, disenfranchising one side and enriching the other.

                In the past forty years, and especially in the decade since the
                last financial crisis, profiteers have focused on privatization
                and deregulation, further intensifying the trappings of racial
                capitalism that are intrinsic to the American housing system.
                Institutional investors, many aided by government-backed
                financing and abetted by a web of state and local subsidies,
                have bought up the market, inventing financial tools to treat
                our homes like speculative commodities. In so doing, they
                have manufactured an economy of precarity for tenants.

                On a community-level, this precarity takes shape as
                gentrification, the process of economic and cultural change in
                a neighborhood, often the direct result of policies and practices
                that benefit white, wealthy individuals and communities. The
                impacts of gentrification tend to include the displacement of
                long-time residents, which can lead to the erasure of cultural
                and social networks, as well as the loss of housing and access
                to essential resources like healthcare and education. When a
                new coffee shop and a luxury housing development replace
                the old corner store and a few three-flats, neighbors know
                what’s coming: rent hikes, evictions, a community replaced.
                There goes the neighborhood.

                Displacement and exploitation have become rampant

                expressions of racial capitalism, often driven by the interests of
                developers and investors, and at a disproportionate cost to
                Black and brown communities. Displacement takes many
                forms: formal evictions through the court system, informal
                evictions (like when landlords remove doors or turn off
                appliances or allow conditions to deteriorate in order to force
                tenants out), rent increases, and lease non-renewals.
                Exploitation can look like predatory lending practices, unfair
                rental agreements, tenant rights violations, poor housing
                conditions, and intimidation. These practices create cycles of
                debt and desperation for tenants, who are more likely to be
                non-white, and these outcomes are not incidental to the
                property owner’s business models, but rather central to them.

                In today’s society, public resources are routinely leveraged to
                protect private capital, often in direct conflict with the public
                interest. Eviction normalizes the idea that a person should lose
                their home because they can’t afford it, and a state-sponsored
                tangle of courts, clerks, judges, and sheriffs reinforce it,
                protecting private property by putting poor people out. We
                accept these conditions as normal, and even cast aspersions
                on tenants who “fail” to meet their legal obligation to pay the
                rent. Homelessness persists, and cities criminalize unhoused
                people through laws against panhandling, loitering, and
                camping. Elected leaders deploy public resources to sweep
                encampments, moving the homeless out of sight, often at the
                encouragement of nearby property owners.

                On an individual level, the economy of precarity is particularly
                acute. Today, housing costs are Americans’ biggest monthly
                expense. The majority of poor tenant households spend at

                least half their income on housing. Our rent therefore becomes
                the most significant determinant of our families’ economic
                security, and the stability of our communities. Whether we can
                keep our jobs, sustain our connections to our neighbors, send
                our kids to school consistently— all of this becomes a question
                of whether we can pay our rent.

                Housing is the infrastructure of racial capitalism, and the
                landlord-tenant contradiction is where we must locate our
                efforts to combat it. When we say “landlord-tenant
                contradiction,” we are referring to the inherent conflict of
                interests between tenants and the individuals or institutions
                that own their homes. The tenant’s primary interest is for a
                safe and secure home, a roof over their head; the landlord’s
                primary interest is their bottom line. In the contemporary
                economy, these interests are misaligned more often than not.
                The landlord-tenant contradiction is not about the goodness or
                badness of the parties involved, but rather about a system that
                allows one of our most fundamental needs to become an
                investment vehicle. And, ultimately, it is about power.

                The Promise of the Tenant Union

                The tenant union is the necessary intervention in the landlord-
                tenant contradiction. The basic premise of the union is that
                there are more of us than there are of them. “Us” represents
                the tenants, and “them” represents our landlords. But the
                tenant union cannot be reduced to a simplistic power- in-
                numbers analysis or practice; the tenant union lives and dies
                by its ability, not just to build power, but to wield power.

                The tenant union is not a new concept. In fact, the union is one

                of the most intuitive arrangements. Knowing our neighbors,
                sharing resources with them— this has been a means of
                survival, across cultures and through time. A tenant union is
                not quite as basic as knocking on the neighbor’s door for a few
                eggs, or saying hello to one another from the stoop, but it’s not
                too much more complicated. The difference is in recognizing
                our connections to one another, simple as they may be, as the
                locus of a latent power, the best chance we’ve got to exist in
                the world on our own terms.

                Tenants primarily organize building-level unions, perhaps the
                most common form, to address material conditions in their
                homes or on their property. Say the landlord has neglected the
                common areas, units are infested with bugs, the front door
                won’t lock, or the property manager refuses to answer the
                phone— these are issues that tenants might organize to
                address through a building-level union. This level of organizing
                also lends itself to the most powerful expression of the union:
                the rent strike. Should the landlord ignore the tenants’
                demands, or should they respond in an unsatisfactory way, the
                tenants can escalate pressure, eventually deciding together to
                withhold their rent payments, disrupting the flow of money to
                the landlord.

                The necessary fights can’t always be fought building-by-
                building; tenants organize neighborhood-level and citywide
                unions to contest against the bigger forces of capital that
                shape the places where we live. For example, in Kansas City,
                leaders in KC Tenants, the citywide tenant union, formed a
                neighborhood chapter, the Midtown Tenant Union, in 2021.
                This union meets every Tuesday evening in a church

                basement, centrally located in the neighborhood. Members of
                the union—including elders and youth, longtime residents and
                new Midtowners—carpool together, facilitate the meeting
                agendas, and watch each other’s kids. Mac Properties, a
                Chicago-based developer, is their neighborhood’s most
                notorious gentrifier, charging high rents for shoddy units,
                marketing to a yuppie crowd through pool parties and
                hashtags. In early 2022, the Midtown Tenant Union fought a
                Mac Properties incentive deal for a luxury apartment building,
                ultimately snatching $10.5 million from the developer and
                reallocating it to the City’s Housing Trust Fund. The developer
                tried to sneak by with a different kind of public subsidy for the
                same project in 2023. Midtown Tenant Union threw down,
                organizing testimony at public hearings and toxifying the
                proposal among decision makers, eventually defeating the
                proposal once more. Between these campaigns, the union has
                held public teach-ins on development and tax abatements,
                flyered the neighborhood with critical news, showed solidarity
                on the strike line with local workers, and conducted internal
                trainings on organizing skills, like how to have a “one on one,” a
                conversation to learn about someone’s values, vision, life, and
                motivations.

                Some tenant unions raise money and hire staff. Others function
                autonomously and without paid organizers. The specific
                structure of the union matters less than whether it is
                determined by its members. Preciousness about process can
                preclude power; tenant organizers must remain diligent about
                creating structures that allow for democratic decision-making,
                while also nimble enough to assess, rearrange, discard when

                something isn’t quite right, or it’s getting in the way of the
                union exercising power.

                The activities of a tenant union should meet the needs of its
                members. This means that the work of the union is not always
                about picking a fight at all. Sometimes the union serves its
                members by creating spaces for the community to gather, to
                celebrate, to mourn. Tenant unions can provide mutual aid—
                no-strings-attached material support—to its members. Regular
                tenant meetings create space for strategy and coherence
                across the union; they also become venues for forging
                relationships among members, building skills among the
                membership, and establishing agreements for how the union
                will function. No matter the project at hand, the work of the
                union should be collectively decided and held; no one person
                calls the shots, no small cohort carries the union on their backs.

                Tenants’ ability to wield power as a union is rooted in
                relationships, to each other and to the places where we live.
                This introduces one of the biggest challenges of tenant
                organizing today: capital keeps us moving. Our instability is
                engineered by institutions that profit from it. When the system
                traps tenants in survival mode, demanding the majority of
                their incomes for rents they cannot afford, in housing
                conditions they cannot endure, organizing seems like a luxury.
                Who has time to know their neighbors, to attend meetings?
                Why care about a place when you expect your existence there
                to be temporary? Poor and working class people are
                conditioned to put their heads down, keep to themselves.
                Subverting that conditioning can feel impossible, but it is non-
                negotiable if tenants stand a chance in the face of their

                The tenant union can combat that alienation, uniting people
                who were previously strangers around common cause. Take
                the Louisville Tenant Union in Kentucky. LTU organizes tenants,
                trailer park dwellers, public housing residents, and Black
                homeowners. The union creates complex relationships among
                its members, inviting debate, accountability, appreciation, and
                joy. Some members are from Louisville and others have arrived
                more recently, displaced from places like Appalachia, Brooklyn,
                and Palestine. No matter if they are lifelong residents or
                newcomers, members share an experience of estrangement
                from the places where they grew up, places they can’t return,
                places that don’t exist anymore, at least not as they once did.
                For some, building relationships with other union members has
                forged a meaningful connection to Louisville itself. They know a
                better Louisville is possible, if they are willing to fight for it, and
                they are willing to fight for it because the union brought them
                together. A Jay Rock song plays, and the people chant: “You
                either with me or against me, h*e… Win. Win, win, win, win.
                F*ck everything else, just win, win, win, win.”

                A second major challenge in organizing a tenant union is that,
                initially, people have no idea what you’re asking them to do:
                first of all, what is a tenant? And, second, what is the point of a
                union? People don’t tend to be politicized around their identity
                as tenants, nor around their biggest bill: the rent. Consider the
                other ways people relate to each other and to their own
                political identities—as parents, workers—these identities are
                usually a source of pride, or at least a primary way of
                understanding oneself in the world. On the other hand, some

                people are ashamed to be tenants rather than owners, the
                product of internalized racial capitalism, and others just don’t
                think of themselves in terms of where they live and how they
                live there. When knocking doors to recruit people into a union,
                an organizer must ask tenants to consider their tenancy— how
                it has configured their life, what they love about it, what about
                it makes them angry, what power they have, and what power
                they could have if they united with their neighbors.

                The next project is inviting someone into the tenant union. Very
                few tenants have experienced collective power, through a
                union or otherwise. Poor and working class people have been
                burned by political campaigns and nonprofits, whose
                approaches tend to be opportunistic, seasonal, transactional,
                powerless, or all of the above. While some sectors have seen a
                boom of worker unionization in recent years, these days just 10
                percent of Americans are members of a labor union, the lowest
                rates on record, largely a reflection of concerted attacks
                against union power through Right to Work laws and more. And
                those who have been labor union members don’t always view
                the experience favorably; some workers perceive those
                structures to be overly bureaucratic, and others see union
                organizers as more aligned with the bosses than the rank and
                file. So tenant organizers have some explaining to do.

                Or, more compelling than explanation, action; in taking action
                with the union, people learn the potential of the collective to
                engage in political struggle, and to improve their material
                conditions. Imagine losing heat in your home during a freezing
                weekend. Now imagine that neighbors come by, door-to-door,
                to distribute warming supplies and collect signatures on a list

                of demands. Together you escalate on the landlord through
                public calls-to-action, your citywide union drives hundreds of
                calls to the landlord’s office line, local media picks up the story,
                and then the landlord is forced to fix the issue. Tenants feel the
                power of union in their warm homes. It’s not just a win, it’s a
                win together, impossible alone. The tenants’ conditions feel
                within their control, maybe for the first time ever. There is no
                more compelling case for the tenant union than that.

                Today’s tenant struggle is more fraught than ever before, and
                tenants are up against more potent forces. The level of real
                estate capital flowing through investment trusts and across
                oceans has reached a historic scale. The landlord-tenant
                contradiction is high-pitched and painful. These days, most
                tenants don’t know their landlords, nameless and faceless,
                shielded by LLCs and registered agents, only engaging with
                their tenants through property management companies or,
                sometimes, just a web portal. The government is in business
                with our slumlords. When we consider it all together, when we
                think about what it would take to contend against all this, it’s
                difficult to avoid despair.

                There are actually more of us than there are of them. But that
                only matters if we are connected to one another, if we break
                convention to forge deep relationships across the lines that
                capital uses to divide us, if we contest for democratic control of
                our homes and the economy. Tenant unions in today’s context
                must operate with a clear-eyed discipline, committed to a
                complicated practice of experimentation and refinement. To
                take on organized capital, the moment calls on us to take big
                and small actions, and to build durable infrastructure to sustain

                this struggle through time.

                The union invites critical intervention into the landlord-tenant
                contradiction, a key feature of American racial capitalism. The
                promise of the union is profound: cross-race, cross-class,
                collective power. As Olúfémi Táíwò offers in a recent essay on
                racial capitalism: “If it is true that racism and capitalism are in a
                mutually supporting relationship, then we should expect that
                any potentially effective anti-racist and anti-capitalist struggles
                will also be mutually supporting.” It is not a given that the
                people will prevail against today’s odds, but if we have a
                chance, the chance lives in the tenant union.
