Low-income communities of color across the city are facing systematic displacement due to gentrification. Skyrocketing housing costs have created a homelessness epidemic that has left almost 60,000 people living on the streets. And now, the city is undergoing its largest rent strike in recent history. In three buildings on South Burlington Avenue in the rapidly gentrifying Westlake neighborhood, an estimated 200 families in about 80 units are currently refusing to pay rent.

Lisa Ehrlich, a lawyer and part-owner of the buildings, has been facing off in court against Elena Popp of the Eviction Defense Network, who is representing the Burlington tenants.

The tenants hope the ongoing strike will force Ehrlich to negotiate an agreement that could save their homes. They’re asking for long-term leases and repairs of all habitability issues in exchange for a reasonable rent increase. With their recent successes in court, the momentum may finally be on their side. 3 of 3 10/29/25, 11:48 PM ``` --'
