           And to Ditch Representative Government at All levels (group, organization, city, state, nation, world)
           By ‘Direct Democracy’ I mean decision-making in assemblies through face-to-face discussion, deliberation, and
           voting, and an association of such assemblies built up through negotiated agreements (pacts, treaties), not
           through federation (or confederation) using delegates. The term has also been widely used in recent years to
           refer to referendums and recalls, which is an unfortunate restriction and weakening of the concept, which
           originally referred to direct participatory democracy, as in a town meeting. I stick to the original meaning of the
           term.
           On the Ground
           1. All activists who are in a position to do so (and are interested in direct democracy) should attempt to
           establish either a neighborhood assembly, a workplace assembly, or an extended household assembly (that is,
           the merging of small households, families, and individuals in a neighborhood to form larger units of 50-100
           people). These are the social forms through which we will be able to defeat capitalists and build a new social
           world. This should take priority over other more common activities like setting up infoshops, protesting in the
           streets, feeding the poor, and even over building organizations of anarchists for the purposes of propaganda
           and agitation.
           In the Movement
           2. The split in the movement over neighborhood versus workplace organizing must be overcome. Direct
           democracy activists need to launch a campaign to convince anarcho-syndicalists that under anarchy all
           cooperative projects will come under community control (for allocation of resources, or for decisions to start up,
           or shut down, for example). Libertarian municipalists need to be convinced that struggles at the workplace are
           an integral part of defeating capitalists. If this campaign of persuasion fails, a new wing of the movement needs
           to be built which integrates the two tactics (and adds struggles for self-governing, expanded households).

           3. So-called ‘individualist anarchists’ need to be convinced that individual freedom is a social achievement, and
           that anarchy is not merely "an aggregate of autonomous individuals" but new social forms through which
           genuine self-government can be achieved. Failing in this, which seems likely, a movement for direct democracy

           (i.e., anarchy, communism) must simply bypass, and sideline, as far as possible, the individualists, who
           represent the greatest threat, within the movement, to the revolutionary struggle for freedom.

           4. A campaign needs to be launched to try to persuade nongovernmental organizations, almost all of which are
           based on hierarchical, managerial structures, to convert to direct democracy. Similarly, all the organizations
           which we ourselves create, whether publishing projects, bookstores, media projects, or single-purpose
           initiatives, need to operate on the basis of direct democracy, not through the typical practice of electing officers.
           Many, perhaps most, of the existing worker co-ops have reverted to managerial structures, although many of
           them started out as directly democratic projects. This needs to be reversed. A campaign might even be
           launched to convince the twenty thousand small towns left in the United States with a population of 10,000 or
           less to ditch representative government (mayors, city councils), in favor of direct democracy. Nothing is
           stopping them, and it would be easy to do, if they only wanted to.

           5. Direct Democracy should be practiced in regional associations. A common structural form in many radical
           organizations (e.g., Students for a Democratic Society in the ‘60s, and Northeastern Federation of AnarchoCommunists today) is to have local member collectives or chapters which are bound together through an
           annual general assembly, which sets policy for the whole organization. I believe this structure should be
           abandoned. Instead, proposals should be discussed and voted on in each local collective, but with the votes
           being tallied across all collectives. Nefac has in fact invented a procedure for doing this, but they use it only for
           minor things. There could still be an annual general meeting. It’s just that it wouldn’t be a decision-making body.

           6. An effort should be made by anarchist groups and organizations to link up with the existing networks of
           worker and consumer co-ops.
           In the Media
           7. A magazine is badly need which will ferret out and publicize actual experiments in direct democracy taking
           place all over the world. It would be a project to help the movement for direct democracy (if in fact there is one)
           become conscious of itself, something similar to what the Grassroots Economic Organizing newsletter has
           done for the movement for self-managing worker co-ops.

           8. Beyond this there is simply a need for more propaganda work, to try to get the concept of direct democracy
           back into the air, and to get reports on experiments into as many media outlets as possible.
           In Theory
           9. As far as I know, there is not a single, adequate, full-scale, scholarly book which defends direct democracy in
           opposition to representative government. This shortcoming ought to be overcome as soon as possible.

           10. The concept of Federation (or confederation) needs to be scuttled. It compromises the movement for direct
           democracy, and prevents us from inventing procedures for building territorial associations of directly democratic
           assemblies, through either negotiated agreements or territory wide vote tallying.
