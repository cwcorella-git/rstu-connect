                On a cold night in late 2017, a group of Boyle Heights tenants
## and their supporters showed up at their landlord’s home —a
## modernist mini McMansion adorned with seasonal Christmas
## decorations—in the wealthy Westside neighborhood of Rancho
## Park, some 14 miles away from their own neighborhood.

## Some of the tenants brought hot chocolate. Several of the
## protesters—including members of the L.A. Tenants’ Union and
## the L.A. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America,
## where, full disclosure, I’m a member—camped overnight in
## front of the house. They yelled at the landlord, Frank “BJ”
                Turner, to do the right thing and meet with them. They called
                him immoral for forcing poor people out of their homes while
## he lived in a mansion. When neighbors came out to gawk, ask
                questions or complain, it became clear that none of Turner’s
## neighbors knew him, or even each other.

## Exactly one year earlier, six of the tenants—including
                mariachis renting in a building on 2nd Street in Boyle Heights,
## a few blocks away from Mariachi Plaza—had been served with
                a rent increase notice from Turner. He proposed an 80 percent
## rent increase in an attempt to evict the tenants and their
                families. None of the six tenants, some of whom had lived in
## the building for decades, could afford the new rate.

## Turner had made some superficial changes, adding a
## horizontal slatted fence (known as “flipper fences”) and a
                couple of potted succulents, but did none of the renovations
                the actual tenants needed for their units. Actions were held in
                front of the 2nd Street building, and the mariachis who lived in
## the building showed up to each one in full costume, playing
## music to begin and end the rallies.

                Posters explaining the situation were put up in the windows of
                the building. One poster had a cartoon drawing of Turner, the
                giant blonde landlord, trying to stomp on several small cute
                mariachis cowering in fear. After a couple of events staged in
                front of the apartment building, Turner still refused to meet.
                Eventually, the tenants and their supporters decided to bring
                the issue to his own turf. He’d gotten wind of an earlier attempt
                to protest in front of his home and evacuated, but this second
## surprise protest caught him off guard.

                Jose Sanchez has lived in the 2nd Second Street building for 22
## years and works as a handyman at another apartment building
## nearby. Although he was not one of the tenants originally
                served with the rent increase or threatened with eviction over
                it, he chose to join the rent strike because he felt it was the
                right thing to do. He knew nothing was stopping the landlord
## from serving them all rent increases and eviction notices
## eventually.

                “I was talking to my wife,” Sanchez recalls. “I said, ‘You know I
                think it’s better if we can join them, you know, because sooner
                or later we’re gonna receive the same increase.’” I ask him if
                he thinks the landlord was hoping to divide the tenants by only
                serving six of them with the original rent increase. “Of course!
## That’s his goal. That was his goal. He say I’m gonna divide
                them, gonna try to maybe get rid of six or seven and I’m gonna
## give another few months and then boom, there you go. That
                was his plan. Because he just wanted to get rid of us here, one
## way or the other.”

                In response to the Christmastime action, Turner filed a SLAPP
                injunction—a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation—

                aiming to block the protesters from protesting and force the
## rent strike to end. Two days after Christmas, the Mariachis
## packed the Stanley Mosk courthouse in downtown Los Angeles
                with supporters from DSA, LATU and the building, all of whom
                wore red. The injunction was meant as an intimidation tactic,
## but the lawyered-up mariachis were prepared to fight.

                With an outdoor temperature of almost 80 degrees, the overly
## warm courtroom was a reminder that it had not rained since
## that March. The Thomas Fire, tearing through Ventura and
                Santa Barbara Counties, was still burning, as it had all month
                long. At the time, it had been declared the largest wildfire in
                modern California history. Last winter’s Camp Fire in Northern
## California now holds that title.

                Two hours into the day’s docket, the lawyers for the tenants of
## 1812 E. 2nd Street and Turner’s Crescent Canyon Management
## were called up. The tenants and their league of supporters
## stood up when the case was called. Judge Lisa K. Sepe-
## Wiesenfeld, who resembles Heather Locklear, listened as
                lawyers made the case that a rent strike is a free speech issue.
## Whether the mariachis are forced out of Boyle Heights is an
                issue of public concern, the lawyers argued, as demonstrated
## by the 60 people who showed up in court to support them.

                “Is the expression of unwillingness to pay rent an expression of
                free speech?” one lawyer said. The landlord, the tenants’ legal
## team argued, was attempting to punish his tenants for
                protesting. Turner served them first with the rent increase, but
                when they started protesting, he directly upped it to a threeday eviction notice. Judge Sepe-Wiesenfeld called it a “complex
## issue” and then heard the opposition. Ultimately, she said
                there would need to be another hearing, and picked a holding
## day.

                Mariachi Plaza is the entryway to Boyle Heights, over a bridge
## from downtown Los Angeles. It’s a small version of Mexico
## City’s Plaza Garibaldi, where mariachi musicians gather
                seeking work. Since the 1930s, L.A.’s mariachi musicians have
## gathered at the pedestrian plaza and old timey bandstand
## plying their freelance trade. Vans park around the square
## advertising mariachis with phone numbers taped on the side.
## The mariachis signify their trade by wearing the costumes
## modeled after traditional Mexican charro horsemen outfits,
## with embroidered suits and matching sombreros.

                Mariachi music is a cultural fusion, but one mostly forcibly
                shaped by European colonialism. Spanish colonizers in Mexico
                introduced the European instruments that replaced traditional
                native ones. The folk music style called “son” (meaning sound)
## is the result of the introduction of Spanish baroque string
                instruments into Mexican music, which was fused with African
                musical elements and indigenous Huastecan musical traditions
## like percussive dancing. Sones vary widely from region to
                region, but are broadly defined by its syncopated meter vocal
## harmonies and generally major chords. “La Bamba,” the folk
                song adapted into a rock ‘n roll hit by Ritchie Valens in 1958, is
## an example of the Veracruz iteration, son jarocho.

                But it was a variety called son jalisciense that developed into
## modern mariachi when brass horns were added to the
## traditional string instrument ensemble. The Spanish also

## pushed the idea of musical ensembles organized like formal
## orchestras, and the sounds of European musical forms like
## opera, polka and the waltz.

## Originally on retainer at haciendas as in house orchestras,
## mariachis became traveling musicians after the Mexican
                Revolution. In Los Angeles, mariachis are part of the inherited
## Mexican culture that predates the American annexation of
## California. On weekends, the sound of mariachi music floats
## through the city, from public parks and backyard parties.
                Mariachis stroll the aisles of vinyl- boothed family restaurants,
## proffering serenades.

## Stores around Mariachi Plaza sell costumes and instruments.
                It’s a gig economy; a customer hires mariachis for the day to
## play a party or gathering, building a band of whatever size
## suits their needs and budget. Some bands come together as a
## package deal, or a mix-and-match combo can be constructed
                out of the traditional mariachi elements: violins, guitar-like
                string instruments, trumpets, accordion and vocalists. For the
                mariachis, whose profession is both creative and commercial,
                to choose the life of a musician is to give up certain stabilities in
## favor of art. A stable place to live is vital.

## After the Mexican-American War, Irish immigrant Andrew
                Boyle, who fought for Mexico in the Texas Army, moved to Los
## Angeles and purchased land east of downtown. Then known as
                Paredon Blanco, or white bluff, it was redubbed Boyle Heights
## in the late 1800s and came to define the neighborhood. A
## diverse ethnic enclave, Boyle Heights housed a large Jewish
## population and immigrants from Japan, Mexico and Eastern
                Europe. A shared tradition of leftist politics connected the

                Jewish and Mexican American residents of Boyle Heights in the
                ‘40s and ‘50s, until the Jews assimilated into whiteness enough
                that they were allowed to move into previously forbidden-to-
## them L.A. neighborhoods like Fairfax, which has since been
## gentrified by skate brands and sneaker shops. Freeway
## building and forced “redevelopment” during the mid- century
## uncoincidentally targeted L.A.’s poorest and most diverse
## communities, including Boyle Heights.

                Los Angeles is governed by a web of inconsistent restrictions
                on rent control. Any building built after 1978 is not subject to
                rent stabilization, and landlords can increase the rent at any
## time for no real reason. Because the building where the
                mariachis live was built in 1983, there was no rent control. Six
                tenants of the building, several of them mariachis, were given
## the rent increase. Rather than move out, they organized and
## protested. Knowing they would eventually be served with the
                same rent increase, the other tenants in the building agreed to
                stand with the six, and together they all went on a rent strike,
## one of a half- dozen in L.A. over the last two years.

## Proposition 10, which was defeated in the November midterm,
## would have ended a state law known as the Costa-Hawkins
## Rental Housing Act that prevents rent control in cities and
                counties for buildings constructed after 1995; While it earned
                nearly 50 percent of the vote in L.A. County, a region plagued
                by a rent crisis, it lost statewide. Rent strikes like the mariachis’
                are a more radical way of demanding rent control in the city,
## and one that may become increasingly popular in the wake of
## Proposition 10’s defeat.

## The cost of renting in L.A. has gone up each year, as wages
                have stagnated. At 54 percent, the proportion of renters in L.A.
                is the largest of any major city, according to U.S. census data.
                L.A.’s is also one of the most expensive rental markets in the
## country. A 2017 Harvard University study showed that the
                majority of renters in Los Angeles pay at least 30 percent of
                their income towards rent, and black and Latinx residents are
## hit the hardest. Meanwhile, homelessness in L.A. County has
## spiked 42 percent since 2010.

                Boyle Heights is ground zero for these issues in Los Angeles:
## Like many other neighborhoods east of downtown, it has seen
## an influx of art galleries and coffee shops, businesses
## considered to be harbingers of coming gentrification by
## residents who have already seen it play out that way in

                surrounding neighborhoods such as Silver Lake, Echo Park and
                Highland Park, where working-class residents were priced out
## as property values skyrocketed.

## Knowing Boyle Heights would be the next neighborhood hit by
                gentrification due to its close proximity to downtown, a group
                of young residents in late 2015 formed Defend Boyle Heights, a
## community activism group whose mission is to preserve Boyle
## Heights for its lifelong residents. The movement comes as
                landlords increasingly price out long-term tenants and dangle
## hastily redone apartment complexes towards a rich,
## predominantly white “hipster” clientele. The artists have
                themselves been priced out of other formerly artist-friendly
## neighborhoods, like downtown’s Arts District, which is now
## wildly unaffordable for most artists.

## Even artists are prone to looking at living breathing
                neighborhoods as a blank canvas for their fantasies of live/
## work lofts and home ownership. Neighborhoods are
## whitewashed, but first they are “artwashed.” Galleries that
## open in supposedly fringey neighborhoods tend to legitimize
## those neighborhoods as “safe” and “desirable” for white
                colonizers testing the waters. Silver Lake and downtown L.A.
## have employed this strategy, using events like monthly art
## walks to market these neighborhoods to outsiders. Often,
                 what gentrifiers think of as good for the neighborhood is at
                odds with what actually serves locals, especially in the era of
## ICE raids.

                Defend Boyle Heights’ militant brand of activism is the only
                tactic that has proven successful in resisting the gentrification
## that has already swept and whitewashed other Eastside

                neighborhoods. The saga of the 2nd Street tenants is the story
                of what kind of city Los Angeles is becoming at a crucial point
                when it has one of the highest concentrations of billionaires of
                any city and some of the most inhumane poverty conditions in
## the world.

## The history of Los Angeles is that of land being cut up
                repeatedly, of developers and politicians attempting to pave
## over entire communities and those communities’ cultural
## memories always somehow managing to persist. Famously,
## the Mexican-American neighborhood of Chavez Ravine was
## razed to build Dodger Stadium, which opened in 1962. Around
## the same time, East Los Angeles and surrounding
## neighborhoods became the setting for the blossoming of the
## Chicano civil rights movement. It culminated in 1968’s high
## school walkouts—where students demanded bilingual
                education and better conditions—and the Chicano Moratorium:
                anti-Vietnam War protests that took place from 1969 to 1971.
## During a 1970 march down Whittier Boulevard, one of East
                L.A.’s major arteries, cops raided the march and murdered four
                civilians including Rubén Salazar, the first journalist to cover
## the Chicano movement in the Los Angeles Times.

## For decades, East L.A. and the East Side have been the
                heartland of L.A.’s Latinx population. But in the past 15 years, it
                has seen the creeping spread of gentrification, a new wave of
                colonialism that threatens to displace the working-class Latinx
## population. A larger pattern emerges whereby upper- middle
## class artists move into poor neighborhoods and price out
                existing residents. The textbook example is New York’s Lower
                East Side, where in the 1970s and ‘80s artists forced out the
11 of 20 8/28/25, 10:24 AM A Boyle Heights Rent Strike Forged a Path for Other Te... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthelandmag.com...

## existing Puerto Rican residents of the neighborhood. What
                began with artists squatting in warehouses, turning abandoned
## buildings into artist lofts, ended in a wave of real estate
                speculation fueled by the cultural cachet of the gallery scene
                that helped price the artists themselves—as well as the greater
## working class—out of Manhattan forever.

                Gentrification is directly the result of the development process
                that starts with art galleries and coffee shops and turns into
## displacement. The new residents of working-class
                neighborhoods of color across the country also tend to call the
                cops on any kind of public activity, reporting innocuous events
                like block parties. In New York, there is tension around the West
## Indian Day parade in Brooklyn neighborhoods; in Oakland
## there’s the woman who called the cops last May because she
                objected to black men having a barbecue in a park. Gentrifiers
## do not move into neighborhoods and respect the way the
                neighborhood already exists. They move into it and force their
                will. A larger police presence in a neighborhood may comfort
                the privileged, but it terrifies marginalized people—people who
                are at risk of eviction, deportation, criminalization or violence—
## when the police arrive.

## When artists moved to Boyle Heights, some claimed it was
## because they’d been forced out of other cheap L.A.
## neighborhoods. Gentrifiers often do not come into
                communities and participate by frequenting local businesses.
## Instead, they open new businesses with higher prices, which
                drive local, lower-priced shops out of business. When Defend
## Boyle Heights protested a third-wave minimalist coffee shop
## called Weird Wave Coffee last summer, the white male owner

## Now, generations of tenants, including mariachis, who have
## lived in modest L.A. apartments and homes are being forced
                out in favor of wealthier, and primarily whiter, tenants. It’s part
## of the whitewashing of many large American cities that has
                been occurring over the past few decades due to gentrification,
                which privileges wealthy developers and upper-class potential
                tenants over the working class. In New York, San Francisco and
## Chicago, cities have “improved” at direct cost to longtime
                residents. Often, public projects are proposed as beneficial to
## residents, only to end up displacing them by making their

## neighborhoods newly desirable to a wealthier clientele.

## The L.A. Metro is a particularly egregious example of how
                supposedly useful development leads directly to working class
## displacement. The subway line expansions put in place by
                former mayor Antonio Villaraigosa led directly to developers
## buying up land around neighborhoods they expected to
                become desirable. After the Mariachi Plaza Metro stop opened
## in 2009, land owners seized the opportunity to raise rents,
                anticipating a gold rush of new tenants who would be willing to
## pay more for the same units. As journeymen workers who
## depend on a close proximity to their place of work, the
## mariachis cannot afford to move.

                It’s often been said that L.A. is the place where they cut down
## the trees and name the place after the trees (a la Thousand
                Oaks or Woodland Hills), but it is jarringly literal in the case of
## the mariachis, whose very livelihoods and traditions are
## threatened by the development of Mariachi Plaza into an
                extension of the now gentrified core of downtown Los Angeles.
                Tellingly, the real estate vision for the future of Mariachi Plaza
## does not include the mariachis for whom the plaza is named;
## The Crescent Canyon-owned building on 2nd Street was
## advertised to new potential renters as “Mariachi Crossing,”
                despite that this rebrand would force the very mariachis who
## lived there to vacate.

                A glimmer of hope came at the beginning of 2018. After over a
                year of avoiding meeting his tenants in person, of threatening
## them with eviction, of going through the management
## company instead of directly communicating with them, Turner

                agreed to meet and settle. The two parties negotiated a deal
## that amounted to a sort of self-imposed rent control, with
## another guaranteed opportunity to meet after a few years.

## The deal was a landmark victory for grassroots tenants
                organizing in L.A., providing a potential template for other
                tenants to organize and win. The agreement is as follows: a
## three-and-a-half year contract, which LA Tenants Union
## spokesperson Elizabeth Blaney says “is pretty good for a
                building that’s not under rent control. You don’t get contracts
                that long.” And a rent increase that tops out at 15 percent,
                rather than 70 percent in the first year and 5 percent in the two
                years following that. The tenants are allowed to use the owed
                rent from the rent strike to pay for the new rent increase, and
## they don’t have to pay back rent. Turner also made a
                commitment to fix repairs to the building, and to meet with the
                tenants after three-and-a-half years to discuss any future rent
## increases.

                Though residents get evicted from buildings like this all the
                time in L.A., the mariachis’ eviction battle proved unique:
## Because they fought it in innovative ways (protesting in
                wealthy neighborhoods as well as their own, holding backyard
                fundraisers in Boyle Heights) and because the eviction battle
                involved the mariachis, whose presence or absence in Mariachi
## Plaza says everything about the direction of L.A.

                The fear that landlords work to instill in tenants, and the larger
## culture of fear around neighborhoods with immigrant
## populations, can feel insurmountable. But the story of the
                mariachis proves there are possibilities beyond the big blonde
                boot of capitalism attempting to crush culture and history in

                Los Angeles, a place that so often attempts to roll over its own
                culture and history, to create an illusion of no history at all.
                L.A.’s revolutionary political traditions still hum underneath the
## city like fault lines.

## Blaney says she hopes the message will transmit to other
                landlords who are forcing tenants out in identical situations in
                other gentrifying neighborhoods like Westlake, South Central,
## and Exposition Park. I press Blaney on what she thinks made
                the landlord cave on meeting and then agree to bargain. Was it
## showing up at his house? The day in court? The social media
                blitz? Blaney thinks it was probably a combination of all of
                those factors, and the realization that the tenants would not
## back down and had people behind them. She also suggested
## the appeal to Turner’s morality may have worked.

## “Maybe after the initial meeting that he had with us, he
                realized that the tenants are not so scary,” she says. “He had
                kind of I think been afraid to meet with the tenants before and
## when he realized they’re just people looking for housing,
## wanting to stay in their homes, and I think when he heard
## some of their stories, that dialogue then happened.”

                On Avenue 64 in Highland Park, a rent strike directly inspired by
## the mariachi strike’s victory has been underway since July
## 2018. Organizer Julian Smith-Newman says the 2nd Street
                tenants “did something that attracted a lot of attention for
## others to see the possibility of actually pushing back.” He
                thinks “there are victories in every one of these cases that
## have in one way or another used the Mariachis as a model.”
                Several of the oldest tenants in the buildings have successfully
                negotiated to stay in their homes without a rent increase as the

                Smith-Newman points out that L.A.’s real estate crisis is not
## really one of supply and demand, but speculative investment
## gone insane. The Avenue 64 building was bought by a Silicon
## Valley firm because it was “below-market rate,” meaning
## affordable. “The post-Prop 10 moment forces us to get more
## militant,” says Smith-Newman. “Rent strikes are one obvious
                way that that’s gonna continue to happen, and I do think the
## mariachis are a blueprint for that.”

## Sanchez, the longtime 2nd Street tenant, isn’t sure what
## exactly might have changed Turner’s mind about meeting with
                the tenants, whether it’s even possible to chalk it up to any one
## specific tactic or whether it’s necessarily because so many

## tactics were combined in innovative ways. Or maybe it’s
## because he realized the court battle was going to cost him
## more than he wanted to spend. A face to face conversation
## could have happened at any time, or he could have kept
                battling the tenants for years. Why would he come to the table
                now? I ask Sanchez if he thinks it was the protest coming to the
## landlord’s front door that freaked him out.

## “I think he got scared,” he says.

## “Do you think he got scared cause you guys were naming him
## publicly?”

                “Yes. That’s the key to it. He was so embarrassed at the end.
## Because people know him now in the neighborhood…That’s
                why he got afraid. Because his image is he’s a good guy, he’s a
                good Christian, you see? So his face is like ‘They discovered me
## now. Neighbors know me that I’m abusing these tenants.’ You
## know?”

## I ask Sanchez if he felt anxiety about striking, whether he
## worried they wouldn’t win.

## “Yes. Of course we were afraid. Because we don’t know.
                Nobody can guarantee you that you’re going to win this battle.
                Not even in court. You know the court might just say, ‘This guy
                has the right to increase whatever he wants.’ That’s the law.
                Yeah it might be right for them, but it’s immoral. This is not
                right. I’m talking about ‘How about us?’ You know? That’s why
## we were scared all the time, believe me. Sometimes you want
                to go to sleep and you feel like, ‘Jeez, am I doing the right
## thing? Why did I have to do this? Maybe I should look for
                another place? Maybe I should look for a better…’ But where?

## Everywhere is expensive because slumlords, you know, they
                have them everywhere. Why should [we] have to be kicked out
                this place? You know? This is my home. This is where I’ve lived
                for so many years. My daughter was here until she got married.
                I said ‘Why? Why should we give him the pleasure of saying ‘I
                wanna kick you out.’ No, we’re gonna stand up and give him a
## fight. A legal fight.”

                It seems important that the face-to-face meeting changed the
## dynamic, finally. It showed the necessary minimum level of
                respect. “That’s the word that was missing, respect. Cause he
                had no respect. So that’s the feeling we get from him, like he
                don’t care. He don’t have to like us but at least give us a fair
## deal,” Sanchez says. He also agrees with something Blaney
                said earlier –; that the tenants in the building didn’t really know
                each other before the rent strike, and now feel like a family.
                Sanchez also successfully organized his own workplace, where
                he was underpaid, using the skills he learned organizing as a
## tenant.

                I ask Sanchez if he thinks the landlord’s weakness was that he
## so grossly underestimated the tenants. “Yeah. They never
## thought for a moment, you know, he never believed that we
## were gonna get to the others and fight…And let me tell you,
## we’re gonna send the message to the real estate
## developers,‘You can find another place, maybe go to Alaska
## somewhere, ‘cause Boyle Heights is not for sale!’ You gonna
## plan to invest money here we’re gonna give you hell.”

                Sanchez is relaxed for the first time in months. “I’m telling you
## man, I’m going to sleep like a baby tonight.”

                We go downstairs for the party. The sun starts to set on 2nd
                 Street as the mariachis start playing out front, parading inside
                the building. Turner is invited, but he doesn’t show. He sends
## flowers and pizzas to the tenants, who hold a party in the
                central court that functions as an open-air garage and hangout
                spot. The mood is fizzy with excitement. All the tenants, kids
## and grown-ups, are hanging out in the building they are now
## safely staying in. The mariachis are warming up on their
## instruments.

                They will all remain in Mariachi Plaza, at least for now. The
## organizers will hold similar actions at other buildings in
                gentrifying neighborhoods, attempting to push back on forces
## that may seem insurmountable but are just unchallenged. As
                per the agreement, the protest posters are torn down from the
                windows of the building and ripped up in a central pile, mostly
                by the building’s kids. The sunset is orange and purple as the
## mariachis launch into a jubilant “Cielito Lindo.”
