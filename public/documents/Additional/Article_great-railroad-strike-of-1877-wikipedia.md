## The Great Railroad Strike of 1877, sometimes referred to
                as the Great Upheaval, began on July 14 in Martinsburg, West
                Virginia, after the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) cut wages
                for the third time in a year. The Great Railroad Strike of 1877
                was the first strike that spread across multiple states in the U.S.
## The strike ended 52 days later, after it was put down by
                unofficial militias, the National Guard, and federal troops.
## Because of economic problems and pressure on wages by the
## railroads, workers in numerous other states, from New York,
## Pennsylvania, Maryland, Illinois and Missouri, also went on
                strike. An estimated 100 people were killed in the unrest across
                the country. In Martinsburg, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and other
## cities, workers burned down and destroyed both physical
                facilities and the rolling stock of the railroads—engines and
                railroad cars. Some locals feared that workers were rising in
                revolution, similar to the Paris Commune of 1871, while others
## joined their efforts against the railroads.

                At the time, the workers were not represented by trade unions.
## The city and state governments were aided by unofficial
                militias, the National Guard, federal troops and private militias
                organized by the railroads, who all fought against the workers.
                Disruption was widespread and at its height, the strikes were
                supported by about 100,000 workers. With the intervention of
                federal troops in several locations, most of the strikes were

## suppressed by early August 1877. Labor continued to work to
                organize into unions to work for better wages and conditions.
                Fearing future social disruption, many cities built armories to
                support local National Guard units; these defensive buildings
                still stand as symbols of the effort to suppress the labor unrest
## of this period.

## With public attention on workers' wages and conditions, the
## B&O in 1880 founded an Employee Relief Association to
## provide death benefits and some health care. In 1884, it
## established a worker pension plan. Other improvements were
## implemented later.

## Panic of 1873 and the Long Depression

                [edit]

## The Long Depression, which began in the United States with
## the financial Panic of 1873 and lasted 65 months, was the
## longest economic contraction in American history, including
                the later more famous, 45-month-long Great Depression of the
                1930s.[1][2] The failure of the Jay Cooke bank in New York was
                followed quickly by that of Henry Clews, and this set off a chain
## reaction of bank failures, which temporarily closed the New
                York stock market.[3]

## Unemployment rose dramatically, reaching 14 percent by
## 1876, with many more severely underemployed, and wages
                overall dropping to 45% of their previous level.[4] Thousands of
## American businesses failed, which defaulted on more than a
                billion dollars of debt.[5] One in four laborers in New York were
                out of work in the winter of 1873–1874.[5]:167 National
                construction of new rail lines dropped from 7,500 miles of track
                in 1872 to just 1,600 miles in 1875,[6] and production in iron
                and steel alone dropped as much as 45%.[7][5]:167
                Agricultural communities were also hit hard by the depression,
                as falling crop prices and rising debt pushed many farmers into
## financial ruin. The economic downturn led to an increase in
                foreclosures and farm bankruptcies, particularly in the Midwest
                and South, where reliance on credit was high. This financial
## strain fueled political movements such as the rise of the
## Greenback Party, which advocated for the issuance of paper
## money not backed by gold to stimulate economic growth and
## ease debt burdens. The Long Depression also contributed to
## growing labor unrest, as striking workers demanded better
## wages and working conditions in the face of widespread
## economic hardship.

## When the Civil War ended, a boom in railroad construction
                ensued; roughly 35,000 miles (55,000 kilometers) of new track
## was laid from coast to coast between 1866 and 1873. The
## railroads, then the second-largest employer outside of
                agriculture, required large amounts of capital investment, and
## thus entailed massive financial risk. Speculators fed large
## amounts of money into the industry, causing abnormal growth

                and over-expansion. Jay Cooke's firm, like many other banking
                firms, invested a disproportionate share of depositors' funds in
                the railroads, thus laying the track for the ensuing collapse.
                [citation needed]

## In addition to Cooke's direct infusion of capital into the
## railroads, the firm had become a federal agent for the
## government's direct financing of railroad construction. As
## building new track in areas where land had not yet been
                cleared or settled required land grants and loans that only the
## government could provide, the use of Jay Cooke's firm as a
                conduit for federal funding worsened the effects that Cooke's
                bankruptcy had on the nation's economy.[8]
                In the wake of the Panic of 1873, a bitter antagonism between
## workers and the leaders of industry developed. Immigration
## from Europe was underway, as was migration of rural workers
                into the cities, increasing competition for jobs and enabling
                companies to drive down wages and easily lay off workers. By
                1877, 10 percent wage cuts, distrust of capitalists and poor
## working conditions led workers to conduct numerous railroad
                strikes that prevented the trains from moving, with spiraling
## effects in other parts of the economy. Workers continued to
## organize to try to improve their conditions. Employers and
                liberals feared the spread of communism, particularly through
                organizations like the Workingmen's Party recently founded in
## Chicago, and often drew comparisons between such
## movements in the United States and the recent Paris
                Commune of 1871.[9]

## Many of the new immigrant workers were Catholics, and their

                church had forbidden participation in secret societies since
                1743, partially as a reaction against the anti-Catholicism of
                Freemasonry. But by the late 19th century, the Knights of Labor
                (KOL), a national and predominately European and Catholic
## organization, had 700,000 members seeking to represent all
## workers. In 1888, Archbishop James Cardinal Gibbons of
                Baltimore sympathized with the workers and collaborated with
                other bishops to lift the prohibition against workers joining the
## KOL. Other workers also took actions, and unrest marked the
## following decades. In 1886, Samuel Gompers founded the
## American Federation of Labor for the skilled craft trades,
## attracting skilled workers from other groups. Other labor
                organizing followed.[10]

## The strike began when Baltimore & Ohio (B&O) Railroad
                president John W. Garrett cut wages by ten percent to increase
## dividends by the same percentage. By July 14, 1877, it had
                spread to the Martinsburg, West Virginia station where strikers
                refused to let freight trains pass.[11] A crowd had gathered in

## support of the railroad workers. Due to violence against
                workers who refused to take part in the strike, and since the
## police proved ineffective in stopping such violence, West
                Virginia Governor Henry M. Matthews sent in militia forces to
                move the trains. This resulted in one militiaman who was shot
                by a striker while trying to operate a switch; the militiaman
                returned fire. Both were wounded, and the striker died. In the
## end, the militia failed to get the trains moving again, as
                strikebreakers were unwilling to operate them. Matthews then
## requested federal troops, which newly elected President
## Rutherford Hayes reluctantly agreed to send. The B&O billed
## the federal government for transporting the troops into
                Martinsburg, and the strike moved on to Baltimore and then to
                Pittsburgh.[12]
                Meanwhile, the strike also spread into western Maryland to the
                major railroad hub of Cumberland and county seat of Allegany
## County where railway workers stopped freight and passenger
## traffic.

## In Baltimore, the famous Fifth ("Dandy Fifth") and Sixth
                Regiments of the former state militia, reorganized after the
## Civil War as the Maryland National Guard, were called up by
                Maryland Governor John Lee Carroll, at the request of powerful
## B&O President John Work Garrett. The Fifth marched down
## North Howard Street from its armory above the old Richmond
                Market (at present North Howard and West Read Streets) in the
## Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood. It was generally
## unopposed as it headed south for the B&O's general
## headquarters and main depot at the Camden Street Station to
## board waiting westward trains to Hagerstown and

                Cumberland. The Sixth assembled at its armory at East Fayette
                and North Front Streets (by the old Phoenix Shot Tower) in the
## Old Town /Jonestown area and headed to Camden. It had to
## fight its way west through sympathetic Baltimore citizens,
                rioters and striking workers. The march erupted into bloodshed
## along Baltimore Street, the main downtown commercial
                thoroughfare and the way to Camden. It was a horrible scene,
                reminiscent of the worst of the bloody "Pratt Street Riots" of
                the Civil War era in April 1861, over 15 years earlier. When the
                outnumbered troops of the 6th Regiment finally fired volleys on
                an attacking crowd, they killed 10 civilians and wounded 25.
                [13] The rioters injured several members of the National Guard,

## damaged B&O engines and train cars, and burned portions of
## the train station at South Howard and West Camden Streets.
## The National Guard was trapped in the Camden Yards and
                besieged by armed rioters. President Hayes sent 2,000 federal
                troops and 600 U.S. Marines to Baltimore to restore order.[13]

## There were further strike actions to the north in Albany,
                Syracuse and Buffalo, New York, on other railroad lines. On July
                25, 1877, workers gathered on Van Woert Street Rail Crossing
                in Albany, New York. The workers waited for a train arrival then
                proceeded to barrage the train with projectiles. The arrival of
                militiamen caused the crowd to rouse and throw the projectiles
                at the militia. A second night proceeded of attacks on the rail
                line. After the second night, the mayor rescinded the militia
                and ordered local police to protect the rail.[14] Workers in
                industries other than railroads still attacked them because the
## rails cut through the cities and dominated city life. Their
                resentment of the railroads' economic power was expressed in

## physical attacks against them at a time when many workers'
                wages were lowered. Protestors "included cross-class elements
## from other work sites, small businesses, and commercial
                establishments. Some protestors acted out of solidarity with
## the strikers, but many more vented militant displeasure
## against dangerous railroad traffic that crisscrossed urban
                centers in that area."[15]
                Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became the site of the worst violence
## of the related strikes. Thomas Alexander Scott of the
## Pennsylvania Railroad, described as one of the first robber
                barons, suggested that the strikers should be given "a rifle diet
                for a few days and see how they like that kind of bread".[16] As
                in some other cities and towns, local law enforcement officers,
                such as sheriffs, deputies and police, refused to fire on the
## strikers. Several Pennsylvania National Guard units were
                ordered into service by Governor John Hartranft, including the
## 3rd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment under the command of
                Colonel George R. Snowden.[17]

## On July 21, National Guard members bayoneted and fired on
                rock-throwing strikers, killing 20 people and wounding 29.[18]
                Instead of calming the strikers, these actions made them even
                angrier, which led them to fight back and force the National
                Guard to retreat into a railroad roundhouse. The strikers then
## set fires that burned down 39 buildings and destroyed
## equipment, including 104 locomotives and 1,245 freight and
## passenger cars. On July 22, the National Guard mounted an
## assault on the strikers, shooting their way out of the
                roundhouse and killing 20 more people on their way out of the
## city. After more than a month of rioting and bloodshed in
## Pittsburgh, President Rutherford B. Hayes sent in federal
## troops, as he did in West Virginia and Maryland, to end the
## strikes.

                Three hundred miles to the east, Philadelphia strikers battled
                local National Guard units. They set fire to much of downtown
## and caused widespread destruction. As violence escalated,
## Pennsylvania Governor John Hartranft gained assistance and
                federal troops from President Hayes to put down the uprising.
                The troops quickly suppressed the strike, as they did in other
## cities, leaving over 100 dead nationwide. Though the strike
## failed, it highlighted rising tensions between workers and
                business owners, paving the way for the growth of labor unions
## and future labor rights movements.

## Workers in Reading, Pennsylvania—the state's third-largest
                industrial city at the time—also went on strike. This city was

## home of the engine works and shops of the Philadelphia and
## Reading Railway, against which engineers struck since April
## 1877. The National Guard shot 16 citizens. Preludes to the
## massacre included fresh work stoppage by all classes of the
                railroad's local workforce, mass marches, blocking of rail traffic,
## and trainyard arson. Workers burned down the only railroad
                bridge offering connections to the west, in order to prevent
## local National Guard companies from being mustered to
## actions in the state capital of Harrisburg or Pittsburgh.
                Authorities used the National Guard, Coal and Iron Police, and
                Pinkerton detectives in an attempt to break the strike.[19]
## Philadelphia and Reading Railway management mobilized a
                private militia, the members of which committed the shootings
                in the city.[20]
                On July 25, a group of 1,000 men and boys, many of them coal
## miners, marched to the Reading Railroad Depot in Shamokin,
                located east of Sunbury in the Susquehanna River valley. They
## looted the depot when the town announced it would pay them
## only $1/day for emergency public employment. The mayor,
                who owned the coal mines, organized an unofficial militia. It
## committed 14 civilian shooting casualties, resulting in the
                deaths of two persons.[citation needed]

                Pennsylvania state historical marker for the events in Scranton
                On August 1, 1877, in Scranton, in northeast Pennsylvania, one
                day after railroad workers commenced a strike, a city posse of
## 51 men armed with new rifles and under the command of
## William Walker Scranton, general manager of the Lackawanna
                Iron & Coal Company,[21] returned fire on a group of rioters,
                strikers, and, most likely, bystanders. The posse immediately
## killed or fatally wounded four and wounded an undetermined
                number of others, estimated at 20 to 50, according to different
                sources.[22][23]

## Pennsylvania Governor Hartranft declared Scranton to be
                under martial law; it was occupied by state and federal troops
                armed with Gatling guns. Later the posse leader and about 20
## of his men were charged with assault and murder. They were
## all acquitted. Under military occupation, and suffering the
                effects of protracted violence against them, the miners ended
                their strike without achieving any of their demands.[22][24]
                On July 24, rail traffic in Chicago was paralyzed when angry
                mobs of unemployed citizens wreaked havoc in the rail yards,
                by shutting down both the Baltimore and Ohio and the Illinois
                Central railroads. Soon, other railroads throughout the state
                were brought to a standstill, with demonstrators shutting down
                railroad traffic in Bloomington, Aurora, Peoria, Decatur, Urbana
                and other rail centers throughout Illinois. In sympathy, coal
## miners in the pits at Braidwood, LaSalle, Springfield, and
## Carbondale went on strike as well. In Chicago, the

## Workingmen's Party organized demonstrations that drew
## crowds of 20,000 people.

## Judge Thomas Drummond of the United States Court of
                Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, who was overseeing numerous
                railroads that declared bankruptcy in the wake of the earlier
                financial Panic of 1873, ruled that, "A strike or other unlawful
                interference with the trains will be a violation of the United
                States law, and the court will be bound to take notice of it and
                enforce the penalty."[25] Drummond told the U.S. Marshals to
                protect the railroads and asked for federal troops to enforce his
                decision; he subsequently had strikers arrested and tried them
                for contempt of court.[25]

## The Mayor of Chicago, Monroe Heath, recruited 5,000 men as
                an unofficial militia, asking for help in restoring order. They
## were partially successful, and shortly thereafter were
                reinforced by the arrival of the Illinois National Guard and U.S.
                Army troops, mobilized by the governor. On July 25, violence
## between police and the mob erupted, with events reaching a
## peak the following day. These blood-soaked confrontations
## between police and enraged mobs are known as the Battle of
                the Viaduct, as they took place near the Halsted Street viaduct,
                although confrontations also took place at nearby 16th Street,
## on 12th, and on Canal Street. The headline of the Chicago
                Times screamed, "Terrors Reign, The Streets of Chicago Given
                Over to Howling Mobs of Thieves and Cutthroats".[18] Order
                was finally restored. An estimated 20 men and boys died, none
## of whom were law enforcement or troops; scores more were
                wounded, and the loss of property was valued in the millions of

## dollars.

                On July 21, workers in the industrial rail hub of East St. Louis,
                Illinois, halted all freight traffic, while the city remained in the
## control of the strikers for almost a week. The St. Louis
## Workingman's Party led a group of approximately 500 men
                across the Mississippi River in an act of solidarity with the
                nearly 1,000 workers on strike. It was the catalyst for labor
## unrest, which resulted in thousands of workers in several
                industries to strike for the eight-hour day and a ban on child
                labor. This was the first such general strike in the United States.

## The strike on both sides of the river was ended after the
## governor appealed for help and gained the intervention of
                some 3,000 federal troops and 5,000 deputized special police.
## These armed forces killed at least eighteen people in
                skirmishes around the city. On July 28, 1877, they took control
                of the Relay Depot, the command center for the uprising, and
## arrested approximately seventy strikers.

                When news of the strikes reached the west coast, the Central
                Pacific Railroad rescinded its 10 percent wage cut, but this did
                not prevent the type of worker unrest seen in the east. In San
                Francisco, the Workingmen's Party called for a rally on July 23,
## which was attended by eight to ten thousand people. Despite
                attempts by the organizers to focus the crowd's energy against
                the railroad monopolies, the rally soon turned to a riot against
                the local Chinese population. This led to new alliances between
## workers and small business owners aimed at refusing to hire
                Chinese laborers and boycotting Chinese goods.[27]

## Police Role in the Strike

                [edit]

## Police during the great strike of 1877

                During the 1877 railroad strike, the police played a crucial role
                in suppressing the protests and maintaining order on behalf of
                business interests. As the strike spread across various cities,
                local police were the first to confront the workers, using force to
## try and break up the demonstrations. When the protests
                escalated, particularly in cities like Pittsburgh and Chicago, the
## state and federal governments called in military support,
                including federal troops and National Guard units, to support
                the police in quelling the unrest. In Pittsburgh, for example,
## after violent clashes between protesters and the militia,
## strikers set fire to railroad yards, destroying over 100
## locomotives and thousands of railcars in one of the most
## destructive episodes of the strike. Police used aggressive
                tactics, including arresting and beating protesters, to restore
                control. The state’s reliance on police and military intervention
                demonstrated their commitment to protecting the interests of
                the railroad companies and their investors, showing how police
## were instrumental in upholding the existing power dynamics
                during labor unrest. This marked a shift in how the government
                would respond to labor strikes, with law enforcement playing

                an increasingly central role in managing such conflicts.[28]

## The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 began to lose momentum
## when President Rutherford B. Hayes sent federal troops from
                city to city. This was a prime example of the U.S. military being
                used against industrial action. General Phillip Sheridan and his
                troops were sent from the Great Plains to Chicago to break up
                the strike.[29] Federal troops from the South previously used in
                the Reconstruction after the Civil War were also sent to the
                striking cities to disperse the crowds. These troops from the
## South had just been guarding the statehouse in Louisiana a
                few weeks earlier. They were sent to stop the riots of both the
                railroad laborers and the residents of the striking cities. Many
                residents in the cities of Buffalo, Syracuse, and Albany, New
                York, joined the railroad workers in the strike because they
                were tired of their urban streets being used by the railroad
## companies. The railroads that ran through these cities were
## often very dangerous and caused plenty of issues for urban
## businesses and city dwellers alike. Even with the combined
                efforts of the railroad strikers and upset citizens, the troops
                stood their ground against the strikers and obeyed the orders
## received from their commanders. This, combined with the
                strikers' sporadic and unorganized revolts, ultimately led to the
## downfall of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. These troops
                broke strike after strike, until approximately 45 days after it
                had started, the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 was over. The
                lack of a political leader or party's support of the revolt caused
                the strike's power to dissipate as well.[30][31][32]

## Aftermath and legacy

16 of 29 9/7/25, 12:06 PM Great Railroad Strike of 1877 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                [edit]

## In total, there were likely over 100,000 people that were
                involved in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. Of those involved,
                nearly 1,000 people were jailed and about 100 were killed. The
                strike caused over 50% of the United States' freight from being
                carried on the railroads for some time.[33]
                In the end, the strikers were unable to meaningfully resist the
                organized violence coordinated against them by local, state,
                and federal governments. However, the high cost of organizing
                such violence in both fiscal and political terms was not lost on
                the corporate and government leaders behind it. Robert Harris
                of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad was quoted as
                saying: "A reduction of pay to employes [sic] may be as
                expensive to the Co. as an increase of pay." Despite the strike
## not resulting in an immediate acceptance of worker demands,
                over the next several years many railroads restored all or part
                of the initial pay cuts and were reluctant to put any further
                pressure on wages.[34]
                The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 led to the rise of certain
                political parties including the Workingmen's Party of the United
                States, the Greenback-Labor Party, and the Populist Party. The
                strike ultimately led to increased membership in the Knights of
                Labor as well. Labor rights became a major national issue for
                both the Republican and Democratic Parties due to the strike.
                The Bureau of Labor was also formed by Congress in 1884 after
                the national call for labor rights and the aftermath of the Great
                Railroad Strike of 1877.[35][36]
                Strikers in Pittsburgh burned in total 39 buildings, 104 engines,

                46–66 passenger cars, and 1,200–1,383 freight cars.[37][38]
                Damage estimates ranged from five to 10 million dollars.[39]
                [40]:118

## After the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, union organizers
                planned for their next battles while politicians and business
                leaders took steps to prevent a repetition of this chaos. Many
## states enacted conspiracy statutes. States formed new
## National Guard units and constructed armories in numerous
                industrial cities. For workers and employers alike, the strikes
                had shown the power of workers to challenge the status quo. A
## National Guard member in Pittsburgh, ordered to break the
                1877 strike, pointed out that the workers were driven by "one
                spirit and one purpose among them – that they were justified in
## resorting to any means to break down the power of the
                corporations."[41]

## Unions became better organized as well as more competent,
## and the number of strikes increased. The tumultuous Knights
                of Labor grew to be a national organization of predominately
## white Catholic workers, numbering 700,000 by the early
                1880s. In the 1880s nearly 10,000 strike actions and lockouts
## took place. In 1886 nearly 700,000 workers went on strike.
                Business leaders strengthened their opposition to the unions,
## often firing men who tried to organize or join them.
## Nonetheless, the labor movement continued to grow.

                One result of the strike was increased public awareness of the
## grievances of railroad workers. On May 1, 1880, the B&O
                Railroad, which had the lowest wage rate of any major railroad,
## established the Baltimore and Ohio Employees' Relief

18 of 29 9/7/25, 12:06 PM Great Railroad Strike of 1877 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                Association, which provided coverage for sickness, injury from
                accidents, and a death benefit.[42][43] In 1884, the B&O
                became the first major employer to offer a pension plan.[42]

## Militias had almost completely disappeared in the Midwest
                after the Civil War, leaving many cities defenseless to civil
                unrest.[44] In response to the Great Strike, West Virginia
## Governor Henry M. Mathews was the first state commander-inchief to call up militia units to restore peace. This action has
                been viewed in retrospect as a catalyst that would transform
                the National Guard.[45] In the years to come, the Guard would
                quell strikers and double their forces; in the years 1886–1895,
                the Guard put down 328 civil disorders, mostly in the industrial
                states of Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York; workers
                came to see the guardsmen as tools of their employers.[46]
## Attempts to utilize the National Guard to quell violent
                outbreaks in 1877 highlighted its ineffectiveness, and, in some
## cases, its propensity to side with strikers and rioters. In
                response, as earlier riots in the mid-1800s had prompted the
                modernization of police forces, the violence of 1877 provided
## the impetus for modernizing the National Guard, "to aid the
                civil officers, to suppress or prevent riot or insurrections".[47]:
                118[48]:30

## In 2003 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Martinsburg Shops,
## where the strike began, were declared a National Historic
                Landmark.[49][50]

## In 2013 a historical marker commemorating the event was
                placed in Baltimore, Maryland, by the Maryland Historical Trust

## and Maryland State Highway Administration. Its inscription
                reads:
                The first national strike began July 16, 1877, with Baltimore
                and Ohio Railroad workers in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and
                Baltimore, Maryland. It spread across the nation halting rail
                traffic and closing factories in reaction to widespread worker
## discontent over wage cuts and conditions during a national
                depression. Broken by Federal troops in early August, the strike
## energized the labor movement and was precursor to labor
                unrest in the 1880s and 1890s.[51]

## Another was placed in 1978 in Martinsburg, West Virginia by
                the West Virginia Department of Culture and History.[52]

## Posse Comitatus Act

                [edit]
                The use of federal troops prompted bipartisan support for the
                1878 Posse Comitatus Act, limiting the power of the president
## to use federal troops for domestic law enforcement.
