                This strike, also known as the Minneapolis Teamsters' Strike
                was one of the most violent in the state's history, and a major
                battle in Minnesota's "civil war" of the 1930s between business
                and labor. A non-union city, Minneapolis business leaders had
## successfully kept unions at bay but by 1934, unions were
## gaining strength as advocates of workers for improved wages
                and better working conditions. By early May 1934, one of the

                trucks the Citizens Alliance activated the local militia. To inform
                the public of the strike's aims, and to keep workers informed of
## developments, strike leaders published a daily newspaper.
## Conflict escalated daily throughout May and reached a peak
                late in the month, at the city market, where strikers clashed
                with police, who were trying to open it for farm produce to be
                brought in. Hundreds of strikers were arrested and the battle
                raged on violently for two days. The strike ended on May 25,
## 1934 when the union was recognized and their demands
                settled.The Truckers' Strike marked a turning point in state and
                national labor history and legislation. The strike opened the
## way for enactment of laws acknowledging and protecting
## workers' rights.
