          Winnipeg general strike
          The Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 was one
          of the most famous and inﬂuential strikes in Winnipeg General Strike
          Canadian history.[1] For six weeks, May 15 to June Part of the Canadian Labour Revolt
          26, more than 30,000 strikers brought economic
          activity to a standstill in Winnipeg, Manitoba,
          which at the time was Canada's third largest city.
          In the short term, the strike ended in arrests,
          bloodshed and defeat, but in the long run it
          contributed to the development of a stronger
          labour movement and the tradition of social
          democratic politics in Canada.

          They also called for the establishment of a new
          union centre, the One Big Union, to promote class solidarity by
          uniting workers from all trades and industries in one organization.
          The idea that the OBU instigated the general strike is misleading,
          as the OBU was not formed until June 1919. However, the "one
          big union" idea contributed to the atmosphere of unrest.[3]
          Similar volatile conditions existed elsewhere in Canada, and in
          other countries around the world, at the end of World War I, but
          the combination of circumstances in Winnipeg proved to be 1:25
          explosive.[4]
## Newsreel footage of the Winnipeg
          The most immediate cause of the strike involved support for general strike of 1919
          collective bargaining in the metal trades and building trades,
          where workers were attempting to negotiate contracts through
          their trades councils. When the Metal Trades Council and the Building Trades Council had both failed to
          secure contracts with employers by the end of April, they went on strike, the building trades on May 1 and
          the metal trades on May 2. Shortly afterwards, the situation was discussed at meetings of the Winnipeg
          Trades and Labour Council, the umbrella body for the city's unions. The Labour Council decided to call on
          their 12,000 aﬃliated members to vote on a proposal for a general strike.[5] On a smaller scale, this tactic had
          achieved success for striking city workers a year earlier in 1918.[6] Preliminary results of the vote among the
          Labour Council's member unions were announced on May 13. The outcome showed overwhelming support
          for a general strike, 8,667 to 645.[7] Ernest Robinson, secretary of the Labour Council, issued a statement that
          "every organization but one has voted in favour of the general strike" and that "all public utilities will be tiedup in order to enforce the principle of collective bargaining".[8] A Strike Committee was established, with
          delegates elected by the city's unions. The leadership included both moderate trade unionists, such as James
          Winning, a bricklayer who was president of the Trades and Labour Council, and socialists such as R. B.
          Russell, a machinist who favoured the OBU.
          1919 general strike
          Organization
          At 11 am on Thursday, May 15, 1919, virtually the entire working population of Winnipeg went on strike.
          Somewhere around 30,000 workers in the public and private sectors walked oﬀ their jobs, and the city
          experienced a sudden cessation of many normal activities. The Strike Committee requested the police force,
          who had voted in favour of the strike, to remain on duty. Workers at the city waterworks also remained on the
          job to provide service at reduced pressure. Union membership had increased substantially during the spring
          of 1919, but most of the people who came out in support of the general strike were not union members. For
          instance, the ﬁrst to leave work, at 7:00 a.m., were the telephone operators, the so-called "hello girls" at the
          city telephone exchanges, who were not at this time union members. Also on the ﬁrst day of the strike, the
          major organizations of returned soldiers announced their support and were active throughout the six weeks of
          the strike.[9]

          In the early days of the strike, according to historian David Bercuson, "The atmosphere was almost festive,
          the belief in ultimate victory strong."[10] Participants assembled in city parks to listen to speakers report on
          the progress of the strike and discuss the many related social reform issues of the time. To ensure that strikers
          were kept informed of developments, the Strike Committee also published a daily Strike Bulletin. This
          newspaper urged the strikers to remain peaceable as well as idle: "The only thing the workers have to do to
          win this strike is to do nothing. Just eat, sleep, play, love, laugh, and look at the sun ... Our ﬁght consists of
          doing no ﬁghting."[11]
          Women leaders played an important part in the strike. They encouraged female workers to go on strike,
          encouraged strikers in their strike eﬀorts and built solidarity among strikers. Helen "Ma" Armstrong was one
          of two women on the Strike Committee. She encouraged young working women to join the strike and often
          spoke on street corners and at public meetings and was arrested multiple times.[12] The Women's Labour
          League raised money to help women workers pay rent. Women also set up a kitchen where hundreds of meals
          were served every day.[13] On June 12 a "ladies day" was held at Victoria Park, where women occupied seats
          of honour to hear a speech by J.S. Woodsworth promoting the emancipation of women and need for equality
          of the genders.[14]
          Working-class activist Edith Hancox is the only woman reported as a speaker at the huge outdoor gatherings
          at Victoria Park. She became a notable defender of the city's dispossessed during the 1920s.[15]
          Negotiations between members of the Strike Committee, city council and local businesses produced an
          arrangement to continue milk and bread deliveries. To make it clear that the delivery men were not
          strikebreakers, a small poster was printed for display on their wagons reading "PERMITTED BY
          AUTHORITY OF STRIKE COMMITTEE." Although management had suggested the cards, some said they
          showed the Strike Committee was trying to take control of the city.[16]
          Opposition
          In a city divided on class lines, opposition to the strike was led
          by a group of local businessmen and professionals who described
          themselves as the Citizens' Committee of One Thousand. From
          their headquarters in the Board of Trade building, they
          encouraged employers not to give in to the strikers and attempted
          to stir up resentment of "alien" immigrants, who, they charged,
          were the principal leaders of the strike. They also put pressure on
          governments to take action against the strike. They published a
          newspaper, The Winnipeg Citizen, that claimed that "the so-called
          general strike is in reality revolution – or a daring attempt to
          overthrow the present industrial and governmental system."[17]
          At the end of the ﬁrst week of the strike, two federal cabinet Anti-strike banner used in loyalist
          ministers arrived in Winnipeg to assess the situation, acting veterans parade during the 1919
          Minister of Justice Arthur Meighen and Minister of Labour Winnipeg general strike
          Gideon Robertson. They refused to meet with the Strike
          Committee, but consulted with the Citizens' Committee, who greatly inﬂuenced their conclusions. Meighen

          issued a statement that the strike was "a cloak for something far
          deeper—an eﬀort to 'overturn' the proper authority". Robertson
          reported back to Ottawa that "the motive behind this strike
          undoubtedly was the overthrow of Constitutional
          Government." [18] They warned striking postal workers, who were
          federal employees, to return to work or lose their jobs. At this
          time, they also authorized the local government to use the armed
          forces and the Royal Northwest Mounted Police as needed. In
          preparation for arrests, at the beginning of June, and on the
          advice of one of the leaders of the Citizens' Committee, A.J.
          Andrews, the federal government amended the Immigration Act
          to allow for the deportation without trial of any British citizens
          not born in Canada who were charged with seditious activity.[19]
          The municipal government also took action. As large numbers of
          veterans were holding marches in the streets in support of the Winnipeg Telegram Front Cover June
          strike, on June 5 Mayor Charles F. Gray announced a ban on 9, 1919
          public demonstrations.[20] On June 9 the city also dismissed
          almost the entire police force for refusing to sign a pledge promising to neither belong to a union nor
          participate in a sympathetic strike. With the assistance of the Citizens' Committee, the city police were
          replaced with a large body of untrained but better paid special constables who patrolled the streets with clubs.
          Within hours, one of the special constables, a much-medalled World War I veteran Frederick Coppins,
          charged into a gathering of strikers and was dragged oﬀ his horse and severely pummelled. This led to claims
          that he was attacked by "enemy ruﬃans".[21]
          The local newspapers, the Winnipeg Free Press and Winnipeg Tribune, had lost the majority of their
          employees due to the strike, but once they were able to resume publication, they took a decidedly anti-strike
          stance. The Winnipeg Free Press called the strikers "bohunks", "aliens", and "anarchists" and ran cartoons
          depicting radicals throwing bombs. These anti-strike views inﬂuenced the opinions of some Winnipeg
          residents and contributed to the deepening atmosphere of crisis.[22]
          A plan to oﬀer a modiﬁed form of collective bargaining to the Metal Trades Council was in the works at the
          middle of the month, but any eﬀorts at compromise were ended by a series of arrests on charges of seditious
          conspiracy. In the early morning hours of June 17, the RNWMP apprehended several prominent leaders of
          the strike, including George Armstrong, Roger Bray, Abraham Heaps, William Ivens, R.B. Russell and city
          councillor John Queen. In addition, union organizer Bill Pritchard was arrested in Calgary on his way home
          from Winnipeg to Vancouver. R. J. Johns, of Winnipeg, was in Montreal and not arrested at this time. With
          the exception of Armstrong, who was Canadian-born, they were all British immigrants.
          Several other foreign-born socialists, including Sam Blumenberg, Max Charitonoﬀ and Solomon Almazoﬀ
          were also arrested.Oscar Schoppelrei (sometimes spelled Schappellri),[23] an American-born Canadian
          resident and WWI veteran of German ethnic origin, was also arrested.[24]
          Bloody Saturday

          The climax of the strike came a few days later, on Saturday, June
          21, which was soon known as Bloody Saturday. To protest
          against the arrest of the strike leaders, the returned soldiers had
          announced a demonstration in the form of a "silent parade" on
          Main Street for Saturday afternoon. Crowds assembled in the
          thousands in the streets around City Hall. When the soldiers
          refused to call oﬀ the demonstration, Mayor Gray requested
          assistance from the RNWMP, who entered into the crowds on
          horseback, wielding clubs in an attempt to disperse the assembly.
          A streetcar operated by a strikebreaker attempted to travel south
          on Main Street towards Portage Avenue but was stopped and RNWMP action in Winnipeg during
          tipped oﬀ the tracks and brieﬂy set on ﬁre.[25] the strike
          After the Mayor read the Riot Act, the Mounties entered the fray
          again, this time discharging their .45 revolvers in three separate
          volleys. About 120 shots were ﬁred. One man, Mike Sokolowski,
          was killed on the spot. Another, Steve Szczerbanowicz, died later
          from his wounds. Hospitals reported about 30 injuries, mainly
          from police gunﬁre. Friends and family tended others with
          injuries. The crowds were chased into side streets and broken up.
          The "specials" arrested some 80 people, and military patrols took
          over the downtown area.[25]
          When the Strike Bulletin published its account of Bloody
## Winnipeg general strike turns into a
          Saturday, police arrested its editor, Fred J. Dixon. J.S. riot.
          Woodsworth replaced him. They had published articles with
          headings such as "Kaiserism in Canada" and "The British Way".
          The charges against Woodsworth included his quotation of a
          verse from the Bible, "Woe unto them that decree unrighteous
          decrees." Woodsworth was arrested and charged with seditious
          libel. Police stopped further publication of the newspaper.[26]
          These events broke the conﬁdence of the Strike Committee. On
          June 25, they announced the end of the strike for 11:00 a.m. the
          next day. After six weeks, the strikers drifted back to their jobs.
          Many were blacklisted or otherwise punished for participating in
          the strike.[27]
## Crowds on the street

          Role in the labour revolt
          In May and June 1919, general strikes broke out in as many as thirty other cities, from Amherst, Nova Scotia,
          to Victoria, British Columbia. Some of these strikes were protests against local conditions; some were in
          solidarity with the Winnipeg strikers; some arose from both causes.[28]

          Aftermath
          "State trials" and deportations
          Eight of the strike leaders were brought to trial for seditious conspiracy - Heaps, Armstrong, Bray, Ivens,
          Johns, Pritchard, Russell and Queen. The evidence against them focused less on their actions than on their
          socialist ideas, which were seen as the root cause of the unrest that led to the general strike. Under
          arrangements accepted (and paid for) by the federal government, Andrews and other "legal gentlemen" who
          were active in the Citizens' Committee during the strike conducted the prosecution.[29]: 13
          The largely rural juries selected for the trials found guilty seven of the accused (Armstrong, Bray, Ivens,
          Johns, Pritchard, Russell and Queen). Most were sentenced to one-year sentences. Russell was sentenced to
          two years. Bray was convicted on a lesser charge and was sentenced to six months. (As well, John Farnell,
          who had replaced Bray after his arrest as leader of pro-strike returned soldiers, was sentenced to nine months
          in prison. He was released three months early, due to his wife's illness.)[30]
          Heaps conducted his own defence. A jury acquitted him on all charges.
          Dixon, who was charged with seditious libel, delivered a strong defence of the right to free speech as an
          essential element of the British tradition. After forty hours of deliberation, the largely urban jury acquitted
          him. This result caused the prosecution to abandon the similar charges against Woodsworth.[31]
          In the case of the "foreigners" arrested on June 17, there were no criminal proceedings. The attempt to deport
          Almazoﬀ failed, and Charitonoﬀ appealed successfully against a deportation order. Blumenberg and
          Schoppelrei were deported on technical grounds related to their original entry into the country.[32]
          Blumenberg found his feet in the U.S., organizing workers in the Duluth area and even running for municipal
          oﬃce there on the socialist platform.[33]
          During the trial, a large protest demonstration was held on September 2 in which 7000 attended.[34]
          Political impact
          A provincial royal commission headed by H.A. Robson investigated the strike. The report deplored
          sympathetic strikes but concluded that the Winnipeg strike was not a criminal conspiracy by foreigners and
          stated that "if Capital does not provide enough to assure Labour a contented existence ... then the
          Government might ﬁnd it necessary to step in and let the state do these things at the expense of Capital."[35]
          The impact of the strike was evident in subsequent elections. Labour had elected some representatives prior
          to the strike but the number signiﬁcantly increased afterwards at all three levels of government. Partly this
          was due to the adoption of proportional representation (STV) to elect Winnipeg city councillors and MLAs.
          While awaiting trial, Queen was re-elected to the Winnipeg City council.[36] While serving out their
          sentences in prison, Armstrong, Ivens and Queen were elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920
          provincial election. Queen later served seven terms as mayor of Winnipeg.[37] However for a period of 25
6 of 12 9/7/25, 2:52 AM Winnipeg general strike - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_general_strike
          years after the general strike, the business-supported Citizens League never lost dominance in city hall. And
          the polarity of the general strike was transmuted to city politics for that entire period, at least on the issues of
          social welfare and working conditions.[38]
          Woodsworth was elected as a Labour Member of Parliament for the Winnipeg Centre riding in 1921 and was
          repeatedly re-elected to the House of Commons until his death in 1942. In 1932 he helped found and became
          leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, a forerunner of the New Democratic Party. That party
          was elected to provincial government in Saskatchewan in 1944, governing from 1944 to 1961 and as the NDP,
          in Manitoba 1969–77 and in BC 1972–1975.[39] Heaps was elected as the Labour Member of Parliament for
          Winnipeg North in 1925 and re-elected until 1940.[40]
          Strike's impact on unions
          Organized labour built on the legacy of the strike to strengthen the union movement and to pursue formal
          collective bargaining rights. The One Big Union ﬂourished brieﬂy, achieving its greatest popularity in 1920.
          This was followed by the rise of new industrial unions in the 1930s. The renewed poverty and insecurity of
          the Great Depression led to a long period of labour militancy across Canada in the 1940s, when union
          membership increased substantially. By the end of that decade, a formal industrial relations regime was
          established in Canadian law that provided some security for unions and their members but also threatened to
          limit the scope of their activity.[41]
          Historiography
          Discussion of the Winnipeg General Strike often begins with
          whether it was a conspiracy to overthrow the government or a
          ﬁght for union recognition and a living wage. Given the scale of
          the strike and its political impact, it was diﬃcult to consider it
          only an ordinary collective bargaining dispute.[42] This led some
          historians to study local labour relations in detail,[43] while
          others examined the nature of labour reform and radical activism
          in western Canada.[44] Churches, immigrants, women, soldiers,
          and municipal politics have also been the subject of study.[2] The
          "red scare" promoted by business and government spokesmen
## Partially overturned streetcar during
          attracted attention, as did the legal manoeuvres that led to the
## the strike
          arrest and conviction of prominent strike supporters on charges
          of sedition.[45]
          While some historians regarded the strike as a western labour revolt rooted in unique conditions in western
          Canada, others have pointed to widespread labour unrest across Canada, both in 1919 itself [46] and also
          during the years from 1917 to 1925.[47] Recent accounts of the strike have also noted that most strikers were
          not union members, suggesting that the events might be described as an urban rebellion against the failings of
          the capitalist social order as it existed at the end of World War I.[48]

          Commemorations in popular culture
          Shortly after the strike, two novels, Ralph Connor's To Him that Hath (Toronto, 1921) and Douglas Durkin 's
          The Magpie (Toronto, 1923), explored some of the labour and social themes raised by the strike. Fox, a 1991
          novel by author Margaret Sweatman, is a work of historical ﬁction about the events leading up to and
          following the strike. In 2019, Fernwood Publishing released Papergirl, a young adult novel by Melinda
          McCracken about a girl who distributes the strikers' newspaper.[49][50] In the same year, 1919 A Graphic
          History of the Winnipeg General Strike was published by the Graphic History Collective.[51]
          Among remembrances of this event in Canadian popular culture are the songs "In Winnipeg" by musician
          Mike Ford, included in the album Canada Needs You Volume Two, and "Winnipeg 1919"[52] by songwriter
          Joe Jencks. In 2005, Danny Schur created a musical called Strike! based on the event.[53] A ﬁlm version
          called Stand! was scheduled for release in 2019 and premiered on September 10, 2019.[54] Many of the
          famous photographs of the strike were by Winnipeg photographer L. B. Foote.[55] In Winnipeg, there are
          several memorials and monuments commemorating the strike.[56]
