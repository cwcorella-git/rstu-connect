               Social Justice is a quarterly journal that was founded in 1974. It
               seeks to promote human dignity, equality, peace, and genuine
               security. Its early focus on crime, police repression, social
## control, and the penal system has expanded to encompass
               globalization, human and civil rights, border, citizenship, and
## immigration issues, environmental victims and health and
## safety concerns, social policies affecting welfare and
               education, ethnic and gender relations, and persistent global
               inequalities. The journal has framed its vision of social justice
## with an understanding of the international dimensions of
## power, inequality, and injustice. It presents divergent
               viewpoints in a readable fashion for concerned citizens with an
               interest in current affairs, while including ample notes and
## references to satisfy the academic reader.

## Publisher Information
## Social Justice is a project of Global Options, a tax-exempt
## educational and research organization. Crime and Social
               Justice (the journal’s original title) merged with Issues in
## Criminology in 1976.
