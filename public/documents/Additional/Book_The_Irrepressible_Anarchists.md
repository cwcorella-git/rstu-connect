## Our Strategy from Here

## The beast has been awakened—snarling—and wants to bite
                  someone soon. We fear, not without reason, that it may be us. At this
## moment the Underground Armies of Barbarian Anarchists are
                  getting scant attention. Still, we are on a very short list. We have
                  recently been considered a genuine threat to national security. We
                  have yet to be linked in any manner to the hijackers and their
                  supporters, despite the obvious advantages that the reactionaries
                  stand to gain by doing so. This will not last forever. We are being
                  given a grace period, to rally around the ﬂag and return to the fold,
                  or else. They will connect the dots or create the dots to connect, and
                  just because many of us are Americans does not mean we are safe.
              Thus speculated the CrimethInc. Warbringer cell in After the Fall, an
            analysis published in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001. Granted,
            the FBI has not seriously attempted to link the domestic anarchist movement
            to actual Islamic terror organizations—that would be too much of a stretch,
            even for the geniuses who testiﬁed at Daniel McGowan’s detention hearing
            that CrimethInc. had published a book about Emma Goldman—but they have
            taken advantage of the climate of fear to equate sabotage with terrorism,
            initiating a new campaign against environmental and animal-rights activists.
            The grace period is over—in May, 2005, the FBI announced that it considers
            the Earth Liberation Front domestic terror threat number one—and the
            government hopes to use this opportunity to settle scores with the anarchist

            movement in general.
              This has been coming all along, of course. Every generation that has
            succeeded in pushing its resistance past rhetoric into eﬀective action has
            borne the brunt of state repression. There was no way the FBI was going to
            let the statute of limitations elapse on the old ELF arsons without charging
            someone with them [1]. Anyone who thought there could be eco-defense
            without eco-defendants hadn’t thought social struggle all the way through yet.
              The ﬁrst thing we must do in coming to grips with this assault on our
            community is recognize that it is not an aberration, but something totally
            predictable and normal—at least, normal in the context of the current absurd
            social order. Any eﬀective struggle against the system of domination is going
            to involve arrests, investigations, and prison terms, not to mention violent
            attacks from both state forces and vigilantes. These are an intrinsic part of
            our job description as revolutionary anarchists, whatever tactics we employ
            on an individual basis. Just as it didn’t serve us to throw up our hands in
            dismay when the global context changed on September 11, alarmism can only
            hurt us now. Let’s calmly familiarize ourselves with the possibility that some
            of us are going to spend time in court and prison, while doing everything we
            can to prevent this and maintaining a realistic sense of the extent of the
            current threat.
            The Story Thus Far
              It is impossible to provide thorough or timely coverage of every aspect of
            this subject here, so we urge readers to consult these websites:
            ecoprisoners.org, greenscare.org, fbiwitchhunt.org, and especially
            portland.indymedia.org. For basic context, we’ll present a short summary as
            of this writing, but please don’t stop here.
              Most activists date the latest wave of repression, popularly termed the
            “green scare,” from December 7, 2005, when the FBI carried out a series of
            raids around the US. Further arrests and indictments followed until a total of
            fourteen people were charged with various counts of arson, destruction of
            property, and conspiracy in the oddly-named “Operation Backﬁre[2].” Of these,
            Joseph Dibee, Josephine Overaker, and Rebecca Rubin are thought to be in
            hiding outside the US, while William Rodgers allegedly committed suicide in
            his jail cell on the winter solstice. Stanislas Meyerhoﬀ, Kevin Tubbs, Chelsea
            Dawn Gerlach, Suzanne Savoie, and Kendall Tankersley are believed to be
            cooperating with the government—i.e., oﬀering to testify against others in
            hopes of receiving lighter sentences. The entire case of the FBI seems to have
            initially been based on the testimony of one heroin addict, Jacob Ferguson, so
            the decision of others to cooperate with the state is particularly troubling.
            Daniel McGowan, Jonathan Paul, and Briana Waters are currently free on
            outrageously high bail[3], while Joyanna Zacher and Nathan Block have been
            denied bail as a result of the testimony of informants. The trial is cartoonishly
            scheduled for Halloween, October 31, 2006.
              The following month, Zachary Jenson, Lauren Weiner and Eric McDavid
            were arrested in Auburn, California for allegedly conspiring to commit actions
            on behalf of the ELF. They were set up by an FBI agent provocateur, “Anna,”
2 of 10 11/11/25, 2:51 AM The Irrepressible Anarchists https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/crimethinc-the-...
            who was sleeping with one of them; apparently she bought bomb-making
            materials and rented a bugged house for them. Apparently “Anna” had been
            traveling in anarchist circles since summer of 2004, attending two
            CrimethInc. convergences and a host of other events[4] (in the muddled words
            of FBI ﬂunky Nasson Walker, “The s/he has provided information that has
            been utilized in at least twelve separate anarchist cases.”). Lauren was
            released into house arrest on $1.2 million bail, and subsequently pleaded
            guilty and agreed to testify against the others—an infuriating development
            when her codefendants were starving in isolation cells. Two months later, the
            very night this article was ﬁnished, Zachary was reported to have just done
            the same thing.
               In March, six activists associated with the animal rights group Stop
            Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, which has driven an animal testing corporation to
            the brink of bankruptcy, were found guilty on charges of using their website
            to incite attacks on Huntingdon Life Sciences and their business partners.
            Some of them face up to eleven years in prison for making use of their
            supposed right to free speech.
               All the while, grand juries—secretive government interrogation organs
            established to gather information about alleged crimes—have been convened
            around the country, indicting anyone with connections to activist
            communities, jailing those who won’t speak, and nosing around for further
            leads in the war on dissent. FBI agents have announced that anarchist groups
            such as Food Not Bombs and Indymedia are near the top of their terror watch
            list. Whether or not anarchists are ready for it, we are now being targeted as
            public enemy number one.
               Together, these various cases spell out a cohesive message: Don’t act, you
            will be caught. Don’t associate with dissidents, you will be framed. Don’t trust
            your comrades, you will be inﬁltrated. Don’t speak about others’ actions, you
            will be imprisoned.
               This message is the most important part of the FBI campaign. Even with all
            the anti-terror funding in the world, they can’t inﬁltrate every anarchist circle
            and pin charges on every prominent activist. They hope that, by staging this
            massive display of force, they can intimidate the rest of us into silence and
            passivity, just as the excessive and unsustainable police presence at the FTAA
            protests in Miami November 2003 was calculated to put an end to the era of
            anarchist mass mobilizations by giving an inﬂated impression of the power of
            the state.
            The Radical Response
              The responses of the anarchist media can be divided into two basic camps.
            The ﬁrst camp, exempliﬁed by the more theoretical journals such as Fifth
            Estate, reacted by printing news about the arrests and charges followed by
            vague afterthoughts to the eﬀect that one must not lose hope. It could be
            argued that publicizing repression without oﬀering concrete proposals for
            how to respond assists the FBI in their work. To their eternal discredit,
            Anarchy: A so-called Journal of Desire Armed set the low-water mark for this
            sort of thing in implying that the current situation is simply the result of a
3 of 10 11/11/25, 2:51 AM The Irrepressible Anarchists https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/crimethinc-the-...
            “fetishization of security culture” in anarchist circles. Thankfully, more actionoriented publications and websites such as No Compromise and The New York
            Rat have provided practical information on how to support targeted activists
            through letter-writing, fund-raising, and solidarity actions. Sad to say, the
            current issue of Rolling Thunder falls into the former category, but we hope to
            remedy that next issue by sharing all the skills for prisoner and defendant
            support that are being honed in our community right now.
              Participation in anarchist legal aid and prisoner support projects has
            increased over the past months, though not yet enough to exert a great
            inﬂuence over the course of events. This increase is ironic, given that a year
            ago some of those now targeted by the state were trying to ﬁgure out how to
            reinvigorate prisoner support in North America. The pivotal question now is
            whether or not anarchist organizers, so used to working in the limited context
            of their own communities, will be able to muster widespread public outrage
            over this witch hunt. Without that, this round may end badly for the accused,
            and that will encourage the authorities to initiate another roundup.
            What Does It All Mean?
              It is of the utmost importance that those currently being targeted receive
            the funding and community support necessary for the best possible legal
            defense. As on every other front, every inch should cost our persecutors as
            much as possible, whether or not we win individual battles. Good legal
            support has proven indispensable in keeping mass actions viable; for example,
            the legal defense and countersuits following the protests against the IMF
            meeting in Washington, D.C. in 2002 not only cleared hundreds of protesters
            of charges, but also tied the hands of the D.C. police for several protests to
            come. The struggle in the courtroom is not the postscript to the struggle in
            the street, but that struggle conducted by diﬀerent means; it is not the end of
            the story unless we give up and make it so. The same goes for the struggle in
            prison, for those serving sentences: a community cannot foster long-term
            commitment to militant struggle unless it supports its prisoners of war;
            conversely, those prisoners have power to the extent to which their comrades
            outside maintain enough momentum to exert social and political leverage.
              While we’re at it, let’s postulate a few other lessons from the initial phase of
            this wave of repression. First, every activist group should be prepared to be
            targeted, with resources (a lawyer, money, a network of potential supporters)
            and a game plan ready. Second, in times of increased surveillance and
            repression, we must be cautious without letting fear immobilize us. We’re
            powerful because we act, and because we’re connected to others; being
            frightened into passivity and isolation can only weaken and endanger us.
            Third, now more than ever solidarity means constructive criticism, not
            speculations (“That arson? I bet that was Alphonse—he’s into macho tactics”)
            or accusations (“She never does anything—she’s just a lot of talk”). You never
            know what situation a person is in: she might be a wanted fugitive who can’t
            respond to your thoughtless words without endangering herself. Likewise,
            “innocent” activists may be accused of others’ actions, and even go to prison
            for them; but this is the fault of the government, not on the ones who act, so
4 of 10 11/11/25, 2:51 AM The Irrepressible Anarchists https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/crimethinc-the-...
            long as they don’t stupidly put others at risk. Finally, much of the evidence in
            recent cases is based on informants wearing microphones into conversations.
            Activists should consider the possibility that even trusted companions could
            be wired; don’t ever reminisce needlessly over past illegal actions, don’t
            assume old cases are closed even after a decade of silence, don’t work with
            people you’re not sure you’ll trust ten years from now. Meet a person’s family
            and friends before joining in illegal activity.
               And above all, DON’T TALK TO POLICE OR THE FBI. No matter what, it can
            never help you. They wouldn’t ask you in the ﬁrst place if they didn’t need
            your help to ruin your life. Remember: “I am going to remain silent. I would
            like to speak with an attorney.”
            The Enemy Within
                  “They can’t get inside you,” she had said. But they could get inside
                  you. There were things, your own acts, from which you could not
                  recover. Something was killed in your breast; burnt out, cauterized
## out…

## “Sometimes,” she said, “they threaten you with something—
                  something you can’t stand up to, can’t even think about. And then
                  you say, ‘Don’t do it to me, to it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so.’
                  And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick
                  and that you just said it to make them stop and didn’t really mean it.
                  But that isn’t true. At the time when it happens you do mean it. You
                  think there’s no other way of saving yourself and you’re quite ready
                  to save yourself that way. You want it to happen to the other person.
                  You don’t give a damn what they suﬀer. All you care about is
## yourself.”

## “All you care about is yourself,” he echoed.

                  He was not running or cheering any longer. He was back in the
                  Ministry of Love, with everything forgiven, his soul white as snow.
                  He was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicating
                  everybody. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the
                  feeling of walking in the sunlight, and an armed guard at his back.
## The long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain.

                  But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was
                  ﬁnished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.

## — George Orwell at the bitter end of 1984

              Brutal assaults from the state should come as no surprise. The most
            troubling aspect of this story is that some of those arrested—and even some
            who were not arrested, who are not even facing the threat of life in prison—
            have agreed to speak to the authorities, putting others at grievous risk.
              Imagine the situation of an activist who has agreed to testify against her
5 of 10 11/11/25, 2:51 AM The Irrepressible Anarchists https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/crimethinc-the-...
            former comrades. All the experiences that made her an anarchist, from
            childhood on, come back to haunt her as she betrays her own values and
            commitments, siding with the bullies, the rapists, the snide executives and
            sadistic police. Whatever tremendous feats she has accomplished, whatever
            personal qualities she took pride in, now she will be remembered as a
            informant and must live with the knowledge that she is one.
              In return for the potential of one day rejoining the defeated herd she fought
            so hard to escape, she must tell herself the same lies that once outraged her:
            that people are essentially selﬁsh and untrustworthy, that complicity in
            injustice is inevitable and acceptable, that one can simply look out for number
            one in a disastrously unsustainable world. She does not even know how much
            leniency she can expect; the government can hardly let her oﬀ the hook when
            they’ve worked so hard to ﬁnd her. On the other hand, as a snitch, she can be
            sure that if she goes to prison her fellow inmates will terrorize her. This gives
            the state even more power over her. Perhaps she considers breaking oﬀ
            collaboration, but to do so would only leave her isolated from all directions;
            the die is already cast. One can hardly imagine a worse position to be in.
              Let us phase out the masked ﬁgure lobbing a molotov cocktail as the
            idealized image of revolt; there is a time for that, and the sooner it comes
            back around the better, but it is not the ultimate stage of struggle.
            Henceforth, when we think of resistance at its most courageous and romantic,
            let us picture someone like ourselves in an interrogation chamber, not masked
            but handcuﬀed, being threatened with life and death in captivity and still
            refusing to render herself and her fellows into her enemies’ hands.
              Facing the threat of incarceration, we must redeﬁne freedom and safety as
            factors under our control, not external circumstances. Freedom is not a
            matter of how many fences happen to be around you, but of following the
            dictates of your conscience no matter what. Safety is not the condition of
            being temporarily outside the grasp of your enemies, but of trusting yourself
            enough to know that your friends will never come to harm because of you and
            you will never become something you despise.
            We Can Win: Success Stories from the Struggle
            against Repression
              Not only is it critical to ﬁght in the courtrooms as well as the streets—it’s
            also possible to win those ﬁghts. A brief look at our own recent history shows
            countless cases in which activists have beaten charges and even come out
            ahead in counter-suits. Such victories not only discourage our enemies from
            taking us to court, they can also provide needed resources for further
            organizing. Throwing up one’s hands in panic as soon as someone gets
            arrested is not only counterproductive, it’s also needlessly pessimistic. To
            oﬀset the doomsaying of the inexperienced and easily demoralized, let’s
            reﬂect on a couple recent victories won by activists forced to ﬁght within the
            legal system.
              At the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia summer of 2000,
            Camilo Viveiros and two others were beaten and arrested by a group of police
            that included John Timoney, then Police Commissioner of Philadelphia.

            Charged with numerous felonies (as a rule, you always get charged by the
            police for whatever they do to you) and demonized as violent extremists, the
            activists came to be known as the Timoney Three; Camilo himself faced more
            than thirty-seven years in prison and $55,000 in ﬁnes. They awaited trial for
            four years, while Timoney jet-setted around the world giving presentations on
            how to repress protesters and serving as Chief of Police in Miami during the
            FTAA ministerial in 2003. It seemed certain that anyone charged with
            assaulting someone in such a position of power was doomed to go to prison.
            Yet when the trial ﬁnally came, Timoney and the other oﬀicers made fools of
            themselves, oﬀering wildly conﬂicting testimonies; after the defense
            presented a videotape that revealed the testimony of the police to be mere
            fabrication, the three were declared innocent of all charges. In an excellent
            article the March-April 2006 issue of the Earth First! journal, Camilo outlined
            the lessons of that trial for those currently facing government repression.
              One of the most important trials of the preceding generation of
            environmental activism ended in an unconditional victory over the
            mendacious, murderous authorities. In 1990, Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney
            were nearly killed by a car bomb while on a speaking tour to promote
            resistance to corporate logging. Rather than investigating the bombing, the
            FBI charged the two with making and transporting bombs. They also took
            advantage of the opportunity to carry out a nationwide smear campaign
            against Earth First!, and sent agents to create dossiers on over ﬁve hundred
            activists associated with the organization. To this day, it remains unclear
            whether the bombing was the work of freelance vigilantes or of the FBI
            themselves—in the weeks before it, FBI agents instructed the local police on
            how to make bombs exactly like the one that nearly killed Judi and Darryl. The
            charges failed to hold up in court, and the two initiated a counter-suit against
            the FBI and Oakland Police Department. Although the FBI managed to delay
            the trial for almost eleven years, during which Judi, who was crippled by the
            bombing, died of cancer, Darryl and others continued pressing the suit.
            Finally, in 2002, a jury found the FBI and Oakland Police guilty and ordered
            them to pay $4.4 million in damages.
              When the struggle in the courtroom fails, there are always other means of
            resistance. On November 2, 1979, after giving birth in prison only to have her
            daughter taken away in less than a week, Black freedom ﬁghter Assata
            Shakur managed one of the most impressive jailbreaks of the era. After
            almost a year in a West Virginia federal prison for women, surrounded by
            white supremacists from the Aryan Sisterhood prison gang, Shakur was
            transferred to the maximum security wing of the Clinton Correctional Center
            in New Jersey. There she was one of only eight maximum security prisoners
            held in a small, well-fenced cellblock of their own. The rest of Clinton,
            including its visiting area, was medium security and not fenced in.
              According to news reports, Shakur’s escape proceeded as follows: Three
            men—two black, one white—using bogus driver’s licenses and Social Security
            cards requested visits with Assata four weeks in advance, as was prison
            policy. Apparently, prison oﬀicials never did the requisite background checks.
            On the day of the escape, the three met in the waiting room at the prison
            entrance, where they were processed through registration and shuttled in a
            van to the visiting room in South Hall. One member of the team went ahead of

            the others. Although there was a sign stating that all visitors would be
            searched with a hand-held metal detector, he made it through registration
            without even a pat-down. Meanwhile, the other two men were processed
            without a search. As these two were being let through the chain-link fences
            and locked metal doors at the visiting center one of them drew a gun and took
            the guard hostage. Simultaneously, the man visiting Shakur rushed the
            control booth, put two pistols to the glass wall, and ordered the oﬀicer to
            open the room’s metal door. She obliged.
              From there, Shakur and her companions took a third guard hostage and
            made it to the parked van. Because only the maximum security section of the
            prison was fully fenced in, the escape team was able to speed across a grassy
            meadow to the parking lot of the Hunterdon State School, where they meet
            two more female accomplices, and split up into a “two-tone blue sedan” and a
            Ford Maverick. All the guards were released unharmed and the FBI
            immediately launched a massive hunt. But Shakur disappeared without a
            trace. For the next ﬁve years authorities hunted in vain. Shakur had vanished.
            Numerous other alleged BLA cadre were busted during those years, including
            Tupac’s step-father, Mutula Shakur.
              In 1984, word came from ninety miles oﬀ the coast of Florida: the FBI’s
            most wanted female fugitive was living in Cuba, working on a masters degree
            in political science, writing her autobiography, and raising her daughter. She
            still lives there today.
            Our Strategy from Here
              This is a somewhat quiet phase of resistance in this country, as everyone
            waits out the end of the Bush presidency; we can aﬀord to focus a lot of
            energy on beneﬁt events, prisoner support groups, and public outreach. When
            things heat up again, we’ll beneﬁt from having done this work, and in the
            meantime it oﬀers us a rallying point.
              In addition to supporting our targeted comrades, we have to protect the
            infrastructure of our community. In Italy, where the brutal state repression of
            the past decade has succeeded in paralyzing many of those who bottomlined
            anarchist projects, police and fascists have been able to shut down some of
            the social centers, publications, and protest campaigns that formed the life’s
            blood of a vibrant anarchist movement. We must not allow that to happen
            here. The government will target those who are most active and visible; when
            one of us is immobilized by legal problems, it’s up to the rest of us to take up
            the slack. Our infrastructure is not just made up of formally organized groups;
            it also consists of and depends on our social networks and culture of
            resistance. If people cease to come together at politicized entertainment
            events and community potlucks, or cease to work through conﬂicts and share
            emotional support, that will be just as devastating as the loss of an infoshop
            or Food Not Bombs.
              As for our proactive tactics, how should we adjust them in the light of this
            oﬀensive? It’s worth pointing out that, with the exception of Rob Thaxton[5],
            no anarchist in recent memory has served more than a couple years in prison
            for participation in mass actions—this is impressive, given the high level of
8 of 10 11/11/25, 2:51 AM The Irrepressible Anarchists https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/crimethinc-the-...
            confrontation these have sometimes reached. It seems to be harder to make
            charges stick in mass action scenarios, perhaps because they involve so many
            suspects and so much chaos, and also because investigating them at great
            length would overextend the resources of the state. The police are forced to
            grab whomever they can—usually not people who had any major role in the
            actions—and charge them with crimes for which there is little evidence.
              Ironically, in the wake of September 11th, anarchists backed oﬀ militant
            mass actions in fear that they would meet stiﬀer repression. Consequently, we
            have less leverage and morale—and we are still being targeted as domestic
            enemy number one! The FBI and the whole apparatus of repression are after
            us whether or not we skulk around in the shadows, so we may as well
            organize openly. If we’re all headed for court anyway, we have little to lose,
            and we stand to gain much-needed visibility and momentum. If enough of us
            stick our necks out, they can’t target us all, and the more people of all walks
            of life are familiar with our struggle the more allies we can hope to ﬁnd. Now
            is the time to form accessible anarchist structures, to speak publicly about
            our opposition to capitalism and domination, to organize large-scale anarchist
            actions. Far from endangering us, this may actually make us safer.
              As for those who prefer more covert tactics such as arson and sabotage, the
            clearest lesson of the current phase of repression is that the government is
            interested above all in mapping networks of resistance[6]. If you are not
            connected to the current pool of suspects, doing as your conscience dictates
            is no more dangerous now than it was a decade ago, provided you practice
            ﬂawless security culture and pick prudent comrades who will never buckle
            under pressure. Indeed, as the trials of the current defendants play out over
            the coming months, we will be given valuable insight into how the FBI
            investigates crimes of this nature. This should, if anything, make it easier for
            activists to engage safely in militant direct action.
              Our enemies are wrong to hypothesize that we can be frightened into
            passivity. If the prospect of living in a world of domination and despair was
            bad enough to catalyze us into action, think how much less appealing it is to
            be silent knowing our comrades can be taken from us at any time. As they
            escalate this conﬂict, we can only respond in kind.
              [1] In fact, the great majority of environmentalist direct action cases still remain unsolved. The
            FBI alleges that there have been over 1200 criminal acts carried out by underground activists
            since 1990, and 150 “eco-terror” investigations are still open.
               [2] According to the Oxford American Dictionary, a backﬁre is “a ﬁre set intentionally to arrest
            the progress of an approaching ﬁre by creating a burned area in its path, thus depriving the ﬁre
            of fuel.” This seems to conﬁrm that the FBI strategy to suppress dissent is based on the use of
            agents provocateurs and false allegations, as were COINTELPRO and other programs that ended
            up backﬁring on them.
               [3] Daniel McGowan, for example, was released into house arrest on $1.6 million bail. Before his
            arrest, Daniel worked for a non-proﬁt organization that helps women in domestic abuse situations
            navigate the legal system. In the rare circumstances in which abusers are arrested and charged
            (see the article on domestic violence elsewhere in this issue), how high do you think their bail is
            set? This is a classic example of the way the capitalist system works: violence against individuals
            is practically accepted, while alleged destruction of property is met with the stiﬀest possible
            penalties before even being brought to trial.
               [4] University of Miami sociology professor Linda Belgrave reports that “Anna” was in Florida
            posing as a medic at a protest on June 6, 2005; when an elderly woman who was apparently
            suﬀering from heat exhaustion approached her for aid, “Anna” oﬀered her a sip of Gatorade, then
            declined to assist her further. The woman collapsed and an ambulance was called. If any doubt
            lingered as to whether the FBI is concerned about human life, their insertion of incompetent

            frauds into medic teams serving law-abiding protestors should settle the matter.
              [5] Rob just ﬁnished serving a seven year sentence for throwing a rock at a police oﬀicer during
            a Reclaim the Streets in Eugene, Oregon, June 18th, 1999.
              [6] In January 2006, a ﬁfty-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of damaging over a dozen
            cars and two buildings at an automobile dealership in Newport, Oregon. The buildings were spray
            painted with the letters “ELF,” and two local news stations had received calls claiming the action
            in the name of the ELF. However, as reported by the Newport News Times, “Police could not
            establish any connection between MacMurdo and the ELF organization. It is believed his actions
            were retaliatory in nature and not any kind of political statement.” He was charged with criminal
            mischief and his bail was set at $32,500, a miniscule amount by eco-terror standards. What does
            a guy have to do these days to get charged as an eco-terrorist? Obviously, he has to have the right
            friends.
