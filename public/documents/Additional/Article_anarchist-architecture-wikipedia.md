         Anarchist architecture
         Anarchist architecture, also known as anarchitecture, is a
         term used to describe architecture with anarchist intentions, or
         architecture by people who unconsciously follow anarchist
         principles such as decentralization and self-organization.
         According to anarchist theorists, anarchitecture should be done
         for the needs of individuals or small communities instead of
         power structures, such as capitalism or the state, like
         conventional architecture. Examples include housing projects and
         conceptual art by anarchist architects, self-built houses in
         informal settlements and squatted buildings modiﬁed by the
         inhabitants.

         Anarchist architecture starts from the premise that architecture is Copenhagen.
         a political act and its main concern should be to fulﬁll the needs
         of a person or a small community instead of a power structure.[1]
         [2] It criticizes capitalist architecture, which is "increasingly commodiﬁed, sterile and elitist - part of a global
         capitalist system where urban space is equated with proﬁt for a tiny few".[3]
         It diﬀers from communist theories of housing distribution by giving responsibility to the individual instead of
         the government and by applying solutions readily available in the present, instead of making longer-term
         plans.[1][2] While marxist architecture tried to overcome the division between the bourgeoisie class and the
         proletariat, architecture academic P. G. Raman argues, for anarchists each stratum of society, because of its
         peculiar history, develops diﬀerent traditions of cooperation.[4]
         The book Architecture and Anarchism, by Paul Dobraszczyk, catalogued 60 projects with "forms of design
         and building that embrace the core values of traditional anarchist political theory". Those values are,
         according to Dobraszczyk, autonomy, voluntary association, mutual aid and self-organisation through direct
         democracy.[3] On his book Housing: An Anarchist Approach, Colin Ward also cites the importance of
         informal economy and Local Exchange Trading Systems for the anarchist architecture to work out.

         Anarchist architecture is deeply tied with the DIY culture. The structures often borrow elements from avantgarde architecture and art.[1]
         While anarchist architecture can be performed with explicit anarchist intentions, it can also be carried out
         unconsciously, as a community will simply react to their living conditions without the knowledge of anarchist
         theory.[6]

         History
         The Italian anarchist architect Giancarlo De Carlo was an important ﬁgure in the development of anarchist
         architecture. De Carlo, who opened his oﬃce in 1950, was active in the Italian anti-fascist resistance and in
         the post-war anarchist movement.[7] He saw libertarian socialism as the underlying force of his design and
         considered non-hierarchical participation of inhabitants as an important factor in his architecture. During the
         design of a housing project in the early 1970s for workers at the steel factory in Terni, De Carlo insisted that
         the workers were involved during the design process during working time, and that management should not
         be allowed to attend.[8]
         De Carlo's participatory design was opposed to the modernist
         architecture of his time. He heavily criticized the functionalism
         of modernism, which he viewed as "too simple and
         unsophisticated compared with the complexity of reality".[4] De
         Carlo viewed, according to architecture professor John McKean,
         that modernism "had succumbed to rigid bureaucratization and
         become formalist and prescriptive of aesthetic codes". He
         accused the architectural profession of surrendering to the
         interest of people without any principles: "The expert exploiter
         of building areas, the manipulator of building codes, the cultural
         legitimator for the sacking of the city organized by ﬁnanciers,
         politicians and bureaucrats".[9] He wrote in 1970 that
         "architecture is too important to leave to the architects" and saw
         participation as a process of transforming "architectural planning
         from the authoritarian act which it has been up to now, into a
         process".[4]
         The term "anarchitecture" was coined in 1974 as the title of an
         art exhibition by The Anarchitecture Group led by Gordon
## Interior of a house from New
         Matta-Clark, who was schooled as an architect and criticized

         modernist architects such as Le Corbusier. The exhibition
         "challenged the conventional role of architecture in society, and
         explored the ways in which architecture collaborates with capitalism".[10] It attacked architecture as the
         symbol of modernist contempary culture's worst excesses and drawbacks. Group member and sculptor
         Richard Nonas described architecture as a "hard shell", or resistance to change.[11] The short-lived group
         discussed and debated spatiality, sculpture and resistance. It was described by member and avant-garde artist
         Laurie Anderson as "a completely literary thing".[12]
         The meaning of the term anarchitecture is "elusive, appearing to shift depending on its user", according to
         writer James Attlee.[13] Matta-Clark "used the word in diﬀerent contexts both before and after the show, in
         interviews and in his notebooks", Attlee writes. "Since his death it has become closely associated with his
         wider ideas about art and architecture; indeed, some would probably argue that it has been hi-jacked by those
         seeking to foreground their own agenda."

         The term has also been used by Lebbeus Woods, whose architecture was deliberately inspired by anarchistic
         ideas and was made to inspire people to reinvent their way of living.[10] Woods abandoned conventional
         architecture in the 1970s and devoted himself to experimental and conceptual art. While he also designed
         practical structures, the majority of these were never realized physically. One of his projects, the Berlin FreeZone, designed shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, explored the intersection of architecture and violence.
         A The New York Times article described the project as "aggressive machinelike structures" of which "the
         interiors were designed to be diﬃcult to inhabit – a strategy for screening out the typical bourgeois".[14]
         Examples
         The housing project Nuovo Villaggio Matteotti for steelworkers in the Italian town Terni was designed by
         architect Giancarlo De Carlo according to his anarchist principles. De Carlo included future inhabitants
         during the design process of the project, which was realized between 1969 and 1974. Some of the principles
         that characterize the design was that the buildings “must be neither fragmented nor a single block” and his
         conviction that “pedestrian walkways [should be] built in a scale proportioned to the individual’s
         psychological needs: spaces that can be immediately perceived, walkways that are both variable and inspiring,
         the presence of greenery, carefully chosen details”.[4]
         Squatting is considered a form of anarchist architecture, as people occupy an empty construction and modify
         it for their own needs. One of the best known examples is Freetown Christiania, a commune in Copenhagen
         that was built in 1971 in and around abandoned military buildings. Inhabitants of Christiania modiﬁed
         existing barracks and built their own structures in an "extraordinary diversity of styles and materials that
         survive to this day".[15]
         Self built houses in informal settlements in the Global South,
         such as barriadas or favelas in Latin America, have been
         described as anarchitecture. These buildings are an illegal
         alternative to housing provided by governments and private
         companies. British anarchist architect John Turner saw such
         communities as an example of self reliance of workers. Turner
         described informal settlements as "architecture that worked" and
         advocated that the inhabitants of such settlements should be free
         to produce homes and social spaces for themselves.[16]
         Another example of anarchist architecture is the tents and Favela da Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro.
         makeshift buildings during activist occupations, such as during
         the Occupy movement. Activists across the world built camps to occupy public spaces and protest against
         economic injustice. Refugees or displaced people who are forced to build improvised housing in semipermanent camps could also be described as anarchitecture.[3]
         Building cooperatives where people work together to construct houses could be considered as anarchitecture.
         British-Asian and West-African communities in the United Kingdom created housing cooperatives during the
         1960s, where individuals would pay to join, take a loan from a fund and pay it back with no interest as a way
         to fund the construction of their houses.[17]

         Some associations, such as the South London Housing Association (SOLON), were created with the
         objective of remodeling pre-existing houses. They became more active after the Housing Act (1974), that
         raised the funding for housing cooperatives in London. SOLON "was run on worker co-operative collectivist
         principles", where even the tenants were part of the association. In SOLON's case, even though the tenant
         had a lot to say about the reformations, the ﬁnal decisions were made by the architect and the owner of the
         property.[17]
         In some cases, associations were created to disrupt government building eﬀorts, such as the Architects'
         Revolutionary Council (ARC), created in 1974. Leaded by Brian Anson, it had the objective of destroying the
         architectural establishment from England, specially RIBA, and invited architects to work directly for the
         population. ARC constantly interfered with RIBA's demolishing activities.[17]
