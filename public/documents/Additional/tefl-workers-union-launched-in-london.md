IWW members in London are building a union for all workers in the TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) industry. If you work in a language school anywhere in the UK and would like to get involved, please contact us at[email protected]or throughour facebook page.
Reposted fromthe IWW website.
We are teachers, receptionists, admin staff and interns who are tired of bad contracts and insecure employment. We’re tired of being treated like we’re disposable.
As members of the IWW union, we’ve decided to launch a union in the TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) industry. But we're not just a union for teachers. All language school workers deserve permanent contracts, paid sick days, and paid meetings and trainings. Teachers deserve paid prep time.
Cleaners, teachers, admins staff and interns - we all deserve a wage we can live on. None us should struggle to get by month to month. We work hard, we should earn enough to pay a mortgage or start a family.

## Background to the campaign

The campaign began off the back of some successful actions in a Central London school where the majority of teaching staff joined the IWW. In the following year, they won a much-improved pay offer, back pay for a number of teachers, and paid staff meetings and CPD sessions. More importantly, the workers learned how to stand up for themselves and
each other and to build a sense of solidarity and confidence at work.
At schools across London, the IWW has:
We’ve launched the campaign by distributing leaflets and speaking to many workers at several schools across Central London. The response has been overwhelmingly positive, reinforcing our belief that a union has been a long time coming in this industry where exploitation and abuse is rife.
We’ve also been holding a series of events, including a Union Representative training tailored specifically to language school workers and a “Know Your Rights” training on zero-hour contracts. We also run an Organiser Training which gives language school workers the tools to tackle workplace issues.

## Our plans for the future

At the moment, our focus is letting language school workers in London know there's a union for them. In the process, we're helping to connect workers from different schools to share stories and support each other. As a union, we're here to offer training and support.
Our ultimate goal is to establish a ‘TEFL charter’ that outlines a minimum standard of pay and conditions. With it, we can demand that all London schools finally provide decent working conditions to all staff.
We are already in contact and sharing experiences with language school workers in a number of cities in the UK and Ireland.

## Get involved

By joining the IWW, we have taken the first steps to improve our conditions on the job. Even in these early stages of the campaign, we've shown that by sticking together and taking action we can force language schools to begin treating us with the dignity and respect we deserve.
For too long, language schools have gotten away with lousy contracts, poor working conditions and shameful employment practices. The industry needs to change - and that won’t happen unless we make our voices heard. We have to stand up and stand together. We need solidarity and organisation. We need a union.
If you feel the same way, get in touch.
