Strategy: The Big Picture “Got Your Back Pledge” AKA “Strike Pledge” ❏ The basic idea: You plus any number of other tenants can’t or won’t pay rent. You get your fellow tenants to sign onto a “Got Your Back Pledge” letter that is then sent to the landlord. The letter notifies that landlord of the following: ➔ There is now an established tenants council; ➔ All issues relevant to COVID will take place through the tenant council, as a collective, rather than as individuals; ➔ Certain tenants cannot pay rent during the COVID-19 crisis; ➔ Tenants who cannot pay are asking for rent suspension due to COVID-19 crisis; ➔ If the landlord retaliates, the tenants council is prepared to defend their colleagues; ➔ The maximum tactic on the table is a rent strike, though other actions may be taken. Remember that a full-on rent strike can be risky. You want to know the risks before actually engaging in it. ★ Why we recommend this plan: ➔ It automatically gives you some legal protection against retaliation by forming a tenants council; ➔ It produces solidarity with those who cannot/will not pay without asking immediate action; ➔ It forces the landlord to go on the record about their position in this diﬃcult time; ➔ It opens up new possible actions later on, and puts tenants in a better position for the long term. ``` -- ## Page 4 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 4](images/page_004_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 4 Complete](images/page_004_full.png) 4. How To Organize (detailed) Step 0: Join TANC. TANC--Tenant And Neighborhood Councils--is a tenant’s union operating in the Bay Area. We think you should join because together we can build the power necessary to win. We also think struggling against landlords and preventing eviction is best when we are all together. Here are some quick features: ❏ For and by tenants. ↳ TANC is a member-run organization, with neighborhood chapters (current chapters are: West Oakland, East of Lake Merritt, North Oakland, Berkeley). ❏ Organizing support. ↳ If you are a TANC member, we’ll more easily help you move through this organizing guide. We have an organizer committee, and a COVID-19 working group. Both will be helpful and accessible through our WhatsApp chat. ❏ Join! It’s Free for the unemployed and houseless. ↳ Joining will take about 3 minutes: ↳ Either way, please contact us with any questions as you move through the organizing guide: onboarding@baytanc.com Step 1: Plan and Prepare. To know the best way to begin, you need to have a clear idea of what your situation is. Your situation will determine the kind of organizing you need to do ❏ Consider who you already know. ↳ If you have a good friend or a solid contact in your building, you’ll want to start with them. If they get on board, you’ll have extra help out the door. It’s great to go into things with an ally. Sample text message: “Hey, hope you’re feeling alright. So, I don’t think I can pay rent this month because of the pandemic. I’m going to tell the landlord that I will not be paying this month, but I want to have support from other tenants before I do. Have time to talk about this?” ❏ Gather outreach materials. ↳ Download this generic flyer for sending to other tenants. It’s best to text or email these to people, since COVID-19 can be transmitted through paper materials. ``` -- ## Page 6 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 6](images/page_006_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 6 Complete](images/page_006_full.png) ↳ Let the conversation flow, ask questions, and try to let them do most of the talking, if possible. You’ve got to understand what they care about and what their concerns are. If they seem very antagonistic, politely end the conversation, and move on. ↳ Talk about your own experience and why you think organizing is necessary. Talk about how the issues everyone’s experiencing can best be addressed collectively, as a tenant council. ↳ No matter what, collect their contact information. Getting people’s contact information is the most essential thing you can do. Phone numbers are the most important. Even if someone appears indiﬀerent, try to get their contact. An indiﬀerent tenant can become enthusiastic overnight. Things can change, especially today, so always ask! ↳ If you don’t think they seem ready the first time, that’s ok. You can always give them a call later or come back again. Getting contact info from anyone: “Either way, I think it’s important for us to be able to stay in touch, especially with the pandemic. It’s good to build some community and have each other's backs, you never know what will happen. Think I can get your email and phone number?” ❏ Keep track of who you can’t reach and circle back. ↳If someone isn’t available, try them again later. ↳If someone speaks a language you don’t speak, find a friend who does or let TANC know and we may be able to help. Step 3: Building a Communication Method and Scheduling a Meeting. Meetings are useful only inasmuch as there is a purpose for them. Remember what your purpose is (see strategy section above). ❏ Set up a communication channel for tenants. ↳ Use what is comfortable for the largest number of tenants, everyone should be able to speak with each other. Communication method can be a mass text thread or email. Google groups works as an email list. WhatsApp can work well if everyone has the app or is willing to download it. Signal can work well if you are especially security minded. A Facebook group can work, too. A simple mass text thread will work if there are few tenants. ❏ Be multilingual if your group is multilingual. ↳ If you speak multiple languages, make sure that everyone that is monolingual can understand the most important things people are saying. ↳ If you are not multilingual, involve your friend or your TANC comrade who helped make the connection in the first place. ↳Practice this in everything, it may be hard or sometimes slow down conversation, but it keeps everyone together, and feels powerful to overcome this everyday barrier. ``` -- ## Page 8 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 8](images/page_008_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 8 Complete](images/page_008_full.png) ↳ Send the letter once you have a critical mass of tenants sign on. Telling tenants that you won’t send it unless many others do too will encourage people to sign on. ↳ One example is for the landlord to suspend rent while people are out of work. The reason it’s important to announce that you’re a tenant council and put your demands in writing is that, in addition to the strength of collective activity, this gives you better legal protections. Going forward, if your landlord tries to respond with harassment, a sudden rent increase, or refuses to perform repairs, you can argue that this is retaliation against you exercising your right to organize, which is illegal, and your landlord can be subject to fines (California Civil Code 1942.5). If you never express your rights, or can’t prove that you did, it’s pretty diﬃcult to claim your landlord is retaliating against you. ❏ Onward: Find out how many other properties your landlord owns. ↳ You’ll want as many tenants on your side as possible. TANC can help you learn what other buildings your landlord owns and where they are, so you can talk to all the other tenants. To get that info, fill out this form. ``` -- ## Page 10 ### Figures and Images (2 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 10](images/page_010_content/img-000.png) #### Figure: img-001.png ![Figure from page 10](images/page_010_content/img-001.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 10 Complete](images/page_010_full.png)
