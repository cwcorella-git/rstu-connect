Tenants'' unions are building, neighborhood or city-based organizations made up of and led by renters themselves to fight for our collective interests and rights. Building-based tenants unions are generally made up of tenants who live in the same building and/or have the same landlord. Neighborhood and city-based tenant unions are networks of tenants who often have similar issues and stand in solidarity with each other, but may live in different buildings or have different landlords. Tenants Together/Homes For All tenant unions share a common vision and principles (see bottom), and unite with other tenant unions across our cities, states and country to build a movement of millions that is powerful enough to win rent control for all and tenant and community control of our housing and land. 3 of 11 10/29/25, 11:36 PM ``` -- ## Page 4 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 4](images/page_004_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 4 Complete](images/page_004_full.png) Form a Tenants'' Union! | Tenants Together unions in their buildings and communities and beginning to pass new rent control ordinances for the first time in over 30 years. Landlord lobbyists, corporate developers, and realtors oppose rent control and have a lot of power in the state, so passing rent control isn’t easy. Despite this challenge, we know we must fight to keep our homes. Believe it or not, tenants are close to half of the population of the state of California, 17 million and counting. The California Apartment Association (the statewide landlord lobbyist group) claims 15,000 members statewide. They have money, but we have power in numbers, if we organize ourselves. How did we get here/Roots of the Housing Crisis The current crisis we are facing didn’t come out of nowhere: it is a result of intentional, racist and classist housing policy dating back to the New Deal era and even colonial times.

At Tenants Together, we believe that housing is a human right, not a commodity. We advance policy that is driven from tenant experience. To resist displacement, we must organize renters and other allied groups to make strong and bold demands of those in power.

We are continually revising and updating them as we try them out and learn more. Many of the steps are not something we do and then move on from, they are steps we strive to weave into everything we do. We often do multiple steps at the same time, and sometimes revisit an earlier step.

With your organizing team talk about your vision of what you want to do together and how you want to do it. The more unified you can be, the stronger your seed will grow. Step 2: WATER THE SEEDS - Start Reaching Out To Others In Your Community Set a time to go canvassing (door to door knocking) to connect with other residents. This might be in your apartment complex,on your block or in your neighbors kitchen. It’s really important to share with others why you are organizing and listen to their concerns.
