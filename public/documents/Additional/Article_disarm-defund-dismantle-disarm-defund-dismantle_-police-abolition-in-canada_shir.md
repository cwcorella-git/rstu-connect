“All across the globe, poor communities are struggling against police power and for something radically different, but most abolitionist literature remains U.S.– centric. Disarm, Defund, Dismantle corrects this deficit by fusing abolition to decolonization, bringing together the diagnosis, strategy, and on-the-ground experiences needed to dismantle Canada’s settler-police state.”
—Geo Maher, author of A World Without Police: How Strong Communities
## Make Cops Obsolete

“Both a powerful indictment of a criminal legal system that was never meant to protect us and a vision for safety rooted in empowerment, care, and solidarity.”

## —Alex S. Vitale, author of The End of Policing

“The essays collected here clearly demonstrate how abolition as a political project requires we pay attention to our local scenes, because carceral practices are configured for their specific geo-political impact. These essays bring Canada forcefully into the international debate, conversation, scholarship, and activism on abolition politics today.”
—Rinaldo Walcott, author of On Property: Policing, Prisons, and the Call
## for Abolition

“This timely and important volume of essays pulls together a thrilling range of scholars and activists to interrogate the interconnection of various mechanisms of control, containment, and colonialism in the country known as Canada. Disarm, Defund, Dismantle catalyzes a series of urgent questions and debates, never losing sight of the lived stakes of these issues, nor of the transformational imperatives of abolitionist visioning and organizing.”
—Brett Story, documentary filmmaker and director of The Prison in Twelve
## Landscapes

“Disarm, Defund, Dismantle confronts the power of police head-on. The editors of this brilliant collection introduce us to a new generation of Canadian and Indigenous artists, scholars, and organizers who, in chapter after beautiful chapter, teach us that police abolition is a practice. Think of it like a roadmap, one that leads us beyond police to a just and caring world.”
                              —David Correia, author of Police: A Field Guide
“Disarm, Defund, Dismantle offers an expansive view of police abolitionist thought and practice, pooling together powerful writers with clear perspectives. The examples and real-life descriptions capture the spirit of a generation of people seeking a new world.”
—Luis Fernandez, author of Policing Dissent, Shutting Down the Streets,
## and Alternatives to Policing

“Disarm, Defund, Dismantle is a crucial resource for our perilous times. This powerful collection illuminates the structuring forces of police violence and carceral regimes. From centuries of resistance to enslavement and colonial erasure, it also affirms abolition’s long sweep and broad scope. The essays elevate the voices of Indigenous, Black, queer, trans, undocumented, disabled, migrant, poor, and working-class communities to demonstrate how networks of care are being built. Such expansive and intimate scales of solidarity, the authors argue, are necessary for actualizing global abolitionist futures.”
—Christina Heatherton, co-editor of Policing the Planet: Why the Policing
## Crisis Led to Black Lives Matter

“In this important volume we learn that the struggle to abolish police power is militant, international, and intimately connected to Black- and Indigenous-led struggles for freedom. This contribution is vital to our collective effort to build a world free from relations of domination. Read it; share it; use it!”

## —Meghan G. McDowell, abolitionist educator and organizer

“What worlds might we build in the ashes of the racial settler police order? This collection doesn’t just dare to imagine answers; it is already building them. These stunning essays are salves and weapons; they dance and they rage, showing us roadmaps towards abolitionist visions rooted in radical study, deep care, and joyful revolt.”
       —Charmaine Chua, assistant professor, department of global studies,

## A Year of Collective Struggle

The long year of 2020 was characterized by profound suffering, loss, disease, and death. It was also animated by collective struggle and mobilization, including the tremendous movement against police in the United States, Canada, and worldwide. Calls to defund and abolish the police rose in chorus in the weeks following the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, 2020. That killing was not an anomaly. Canadians, however, were quick to cast it as an American tragedy, distancing “racial tension” in policing from the Canadian experience. In tragic validation of those who pushed back against the narrative of Canadian exceptionalism—the mantra of “not here, not us”—a series of police killings followed across the country.
On April 8, sixteen-year-old Eishia Hudson was killed during a pursuit by Winnipeg police while driving a stolen jeep. She was a young Ojibwe teen. On May 27, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, an Afro-Indigenous woman, fell to her death from a high-rise balcony as she struggled to escape from officers on a “wellness check.” Fatally shot by the local police force on June 4, Chantel Moore died in another wellness check, this one in Edmundston, New Brunswick. She was a member of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation. Days later in the same province, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) shot and killed Rodney Levi, a Mi’kmaq man and member of the Metepenagiag First Nation, during another wellness check. The list keeps going—in June, Ejaz Ahmed Choudry, sixty-two, was killed in Malton, Ontario, by Peel Regional Police, who were called to the scene for yet another fatal wellness check. None of the officers in any of these cases were held criminally responsible or faced any professional reprimand.
In response to these atrocities, waves of protest roiled the continent. But while the spring and summer of 2020 witnessed the rise of a broad, active abolitionist movement, calls for defunding and dismantling the police should not be seen as new. Rather, they must be recognized as grounded in the experiences of Black and Indigenous peoples—as well as (and living in intersecting identities with) people of colour, migrants, disabled, poor, mad, and queer people. These calls are also founded in a basic struggle for survival in the face of ongoing police and state violence. This volume brings together activists and academics from the country currently known as Canada¹ who have insights to offer on policing, violence, safety, and community. The authors advance arguments for abolition and share experiences that are living proof of their analyses. It is our hope that these works will contribute to the movement, and that we can centre these perspectives in our collective understanding of the role of police in society. For every person in the country currently known as Canada who may feel that the police keep them safe, there are more who experience police as a key driver of distress and harm in their communities.
Certainly, the police—and the larger carceral system in which they are embedded, including courts, prisons, social workers, the non-profit industrial complex, and educational institutions—continue to be normalized. They are made to seem natural, inevitable, and necessary: What would happen without them? Every year, Canadian governments spend millions of dollars (in 2020–21, the federal government alone was projected to spend $3.33 billion on the RCMP²) to sustain and expand their police forces—unconscionable expenditures justified as “necessary” to public safety, while disinvesting in social safety nets and essential services. As the authors here emphasize, the police do not keep everyone safe; they serve the interests of the state, multinational corporations, and white property owners at the expense of Indigenous lands and the lives of Indigenous, Black, working-class, mad, immigrant, poor, and disabled people and communities of colour. A series of well-entrenched myths work to obscure this truth and reinforce the legitimacy of the police: Canadian laws are just, the police uphold the rule of law and treat everyone equally, and without the police, communities would descend into chaos and disorder. These myths are cover for a specific control mechanism, rooted in the exploitative labour market, colonial territorial ambitions, white possessiveness, and a deep structural racism that takes time and effort to unpack for those without first-hand experience of where and when the police act.
While “police reform” is sometimes proffered as a solution—more cultural
awareness, anti-racist training, body-worn cameras (BWCs) for officers—the authors in this volume critique the very idea of the system as “failed,” “broken,” or in need of reform. They point, instead, to how the system is working as designed to criminalize, control, and contain those communities whose very existence threatens the settler colonial status quo. Reforms have not worked; in fact, they serve only to entrench the system that causes harm in the first place. We cannot reform our way out of the violence of a system that is inherently so. The more we police our neighbourhoods and communities, the more fragmented they will be. That is what police achieve: a breakdown of neighbourhoods through violence, intimidation, surveillance, and criminalization.
We must, instead, “imagine otherwise.”³ This collection suggests that it is possible to imagine and enact safety differently; it is possible to respond to distress and harm with care. It is possible to respond with concern and assistance, situated within a framework of relational accountability. To do so, police power must be eroded and dissolved. Contributors offer specific ideas for how this can be done. Their words are rooted in experience and solidarity with those putting their bodies and their lives on the line to fight for a better world.

## Not New, Not a Fad

Grounded in the lived realities of their communities and neighbourhoods, Black feminist organizers and scholars in the United States have long called for the defunding and abolition of police. Intellectual expressions, visions, and practices of abolition are theorized in the works of Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Beth E. Richie, Dereka Purnell, Mariame Kaba, Andrea Ritchie, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, Angela Y. Davis, and many others. Their work and local organizing, which have become a model for other communities, are in large part the reason that calls for police abolition and defunding became intelligible so quickly and so widely during the summer of 2020.
Across the continent, Indigenous activists and academics, such as Patricia Monture-Angus and Luana Ross, have similarly drawn attention to police mythologies and the violence of the penal system. The Idle No More and Indigenous resurgence movements point to police as a form of violence and
containment that exists to maintain the prevailing economic and political order. Tasha Hubbard’s feature films, Two Worlds Colliding (2004) and nîpawistamâsowin: We Will Stand Up (2019), have highlighted, respectively, the police violence of “Starlight Tours” in Saskatchewan—the abandonment of Indigenous people on the outskirts of town on freezing winter nights—and the trial and police treatment of the family of Colten Boushie following his killing by a white farmer in the same province. Indigenous peoples have resisted policing in Canada since its inception in the nineteenth century, when the NorthWest Mounted Police (NWMP, now the RCMP) was established as a paramilitary organization to clear the plains for white settlement. The police have been a lynchpin in colonization and continue to maintain this violence through their constant surveillance of urban neighbourhoods and the artillery they bring to resource conflicts across the country.
Black intellectuals have also pushed back against the myth of Canadian benevolence in the founding of the nation. Robyn Maynard’s crucial book, Policing Black Lives (2017), brings to light the role of police in maintaining the legacy of Black enslavement, as well as ensuring the cheap labouring class of Black people continues to underpin the nation’s white wealth. Desmond Cole’s book, The Skin We’re In (2020), provides a harrowing and detailed account of a year of police violence in southern Ontario and the deep racism that underpinned it. The edited collection Until We Are Free (2020) provides a national picture of Black Lives Matter in Canada and how Black liberation movements are confronting issues like police and prison abolition, often through solidarity with Indigenous peoples.
In this present volume, the authors echo, amplify, and add to those important contributions and voices that came before us and from whom we have learned so much. From the outside, though, in the wake of the weekly demonstrations against police violence following George Floyd’s murder, it may have seemed like the movement popped up out of nowhere. In a viral tweet, one Twitter poster commented, “I personally think it’s really cool how we all went from learning how to make banana bread to learning how to abolish the police in a matter of weeks.”⁴ On the one hand, this tongue-in-cheek post points to how quickly and convincingly people could switch gears from isolation baking to insurrection. But more deeply, it gets at how seamless the transition to collective learning and action can be when the moment is ripe. COVID-19 was like a powerful flashlight casting about and revealing every pre-existing injustice in our society: prisoners were denied personal protective equipment (PPE) and spent months in
lockdown; encampments sprang up across the country to keep unhoused people safe from shelter outbreaks and inadequate space to physically distance; women —Black women, Indigenous women, and women of colour, in particular— experienced massive unemployment; and racialized communities bore the infectious brunt of the virus as working classes were forced by labour out of their homes, in every neighbourhood, in every city in North America. Police violence and killing was the last straw. It was the moment in the pandemic when people found a collective voice to fight back.
In this context, the police became the focus of a trenchant structural critique against a white supremacist, class-based, settler colonial, heteropatriarchal society. Data in support of police abolition flew around the internet, across social media, along with social scientific and community accounts of the decades of failure at police reform. The more people took to the streets, the more violent the police suppression became; state governors in, for example, Minnesota and Washington, DC, called in the National Guard to quell mobilizations. The more people defended the police, the more clearly they exposed the ideologies of “safety” underpinning their massive budgets and criminal impunity.
North of the medicine line, in this country, people had just “Shut Down Canada” in national solidarity blockades to protest the February 2020 RCMP invasions of Wet’suwet’en territory, protecting the Coastal GasLink pipeline and state investments in the deal. Then Desmond Cole’s The Skin We’re In surged onto the bestseller list for a second run. The book, which chronicles the incredible activism of Black Lives Matter–Toronto and other organizers, added intellectual and historical acuity to the movement for police abolition. Momentum grew throughout the spring and summer of 2020, and a proliferation of grassroots efforts ensued—toolkits, public education resources, mutual aid projects— designed to raise collective consciousness and support the communities and individuals most affected by the penal system. It was as part of this groundswell of community action that the impetus for this collection was born.
“We Keep Us Safe”: Community as Abolitionist Praxis
As Black community organizer Mariame Kaba reminds us, “When something
can’t be fixed, then the question is: What can we build instead?”⁵ Abolition is a horizon, a desire for the future, but it is also a series of actions in the present. What are some of the tangible ways people keep each other safe—from the police and from interpersonal harm? While critics decry the “naivety” of the movement and its supposed disconnection from reality, the authors in this collection show how they have put abolition into action, drawing on their experiences and knowledge as activists, harm reduction workers, community development advocates, and academics. Some have intimate knowledge of the violence of the penal system and decades of experience attending to its effects and enacting alternatives; some have spent years studying policing, the myth that police keep people safe, and the actuality that police perpetrate violence, creating cycles of harm that, in fact, make neighbourhoods and communities less safe over time. All of the authors have visions for what we can build instead. These are ideas and lessons that we think all people in the country currently known as Canada—and beyond—can learn from as well.
Building community, connection, and care is the centrepiece of this work. Abolitionists experience community in organizing and we experience togetherness in mobilizing. At its best, the movement is a model for how to enact solidarity and mutual aid: “The police don’t keep us safe, we keep us safe,” say organizers. Abolitionist understandings of relational accountability are lessons deeply informed by Black feminist and Indigenous communities, who have long been organizing in this regard. The model of mutual aid at the centre of the movement is not just a means of mobilizing; it is a way of providing protection and support for one another. It is a model of a more just world in miniature.
In contrast with the punitive logics of the police, which thrive on criminalization, removal, and isolation, abolitionists value community care and relationality. The movement continues to connect neighbourhoods, communities, and social groups in ways that police violence and state neglect will never do. Some say abolition is a fad, but the movement is deep-seated; it is not going anywhere. The call to disarm, defund, and dismantle the police is here to stay; the authors in this volume explain why. The collective struggle of 2020 has brought new energy to an enduring vision. That energy is good: it propels us to continue to imagine otherwise and to create a more just world together.

## Chapter Summaries

We hope you will find the chapters in this volume inspiring. Some of the authors write from an academic standpoint and make theoretical arguments. Others write from experience in organizing, harm reduction, and community and social development work. We hope that the mix is a good one, and that the ideas and experiences reach you in a good place.
Chapter one by Jeffrey Monaghan explores police, conservatism, and white supremacy, describing overlapping social networks between police and far-right groups and their convergence in “thin blue line” symbols and thinking. Tracing the development of this network in Canada back to the North-West Mounted Police, Monaghan breaks down the policing myth that public police are apolitical or non-biased, showing the opposite to be true.
In chapter two, Ruth Nortey elaborates on the history of activism against antiBlackness in Toronto. Nortey looks at the rise of the Black Action Defense Committee and at waves of contention and organizing, culminating in the contributions of Black Lives Matter–Toronto to a national movement for Black lives in Canada.
In chapter three, Julius Haag examines quantitative material on trends with police use of force, focusing on police violence and profiling against Black Canadians. Haag provides an empirical basis for claims about police violence and the need to defund police in Canada.
In chapter four, the Montreal Defund the Police Coalition trace out the group’s emergence and its engagement with communities targeted by police in Montreal and Quebec. They explore the police’s anti-Indigenous and anti-Black tendencies and bring forth specific demands—to defund, disarm, and demilitarize the police, reinvest in communities, and decriminalize sex work, drug use, and migration.
In chapter five, Kevin Walby makes four arguments for police abolition: that academics should learn from and participate in social movements; that police budgets are unreasonable municipal expenditures; that the growth of public policing is disproportionate in the age of austerity; and that public policing foreseeably creates more harm in society than it will ever remedy.
In chapter six, Ryan Hayes writes about the need for labour unions to break ties
with police organizations. Hayes argues that police have never been favourable to labour and have often been antagonistic to unions, while also noting the politically conservative and regressive aspects of police associations in Canada.
In chapter seven, Jessica Evans, Alannah Fricker, and Rajean Hoilett reflect on organizing for prison abolition during a pandemic and explore the links between calls for prison abolition and for police abolition. Both movements argue against criminalization and promote harm reduction and the need for real safety instead.
In chapter eight, Shiri Pasternak argues that public police were created to protect the exchange and flow of capital in society and to control and contain Indigenous peoples in the land we now call Canada. Pasternak critiques the use of injunctions to remove Indigenous peoples from their lands through criminalization, arguing that the lines between private capital and public police are not dividers, but merely divisions of labour toward a common goal of dispossession.
In chapter nine, the Free Lands Free Peoples collective draws attention to the need to abolish not just prisons and jails, but also the broader carceral apparatus that supports those institutions. The authors examine police as agents of a settler colonial state. Criminal justice institutions are colonial in their origins and operations; resistance, struggle, and mobilization is justice.
In chapter ten, Vicki Chartrand draws lessons from Indigenous communities that have been organizing to address the issue of murdered, missing, and disappeared Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit+ people. She describes searches and community patrols, marches, memorials, and vigils to do the work that the state refuses to do and that criminal justice agencies cannot. Chartrand explores the weaving of communities together through walking, storytelling, and sharing, forms of community development and creation of social bonds.
In chapter eleven, Linda Mussell writes about the experiences that Tami Starlight, Moka Dawkins, and Anonymous shared with the P4W Memorial Collective on Prisoners’ Justice Day 2020. They describe first-hand the abuse and negligence faced in the carceral justice system, which includes police, prisons, probation, parole, and the court system. This testimony shines a powerful light on a system that provides no hope and no healing.
In chapter twelve, Ellie Ade Kur and Jenny Duffy, on behalf of Maggie’s
Toronto Sex Workers Action Project, reflect on the carceral violence of police who monitor and criminalize sex workers. They describe the community mobilization and search for Alloura Wells, a young Black and Indigenous trans woman, to show how the policing of sex work is an example of the failure of police to keep people safe and alive. Sex workers, the authors suggest, should be at the centre of organizing for defunding and abolition, yet are too often excluded even from progressive movement spaces.
In chapter thirteen, the Sex Workers of Winnipeg Action Coalition analyze the experiences sex workers face when confronted by policing and the criminal justice system. The authors describe an example of community action for defunding the police, arguing for the importance of cross-movement solidarity in grassroots organizing.
In chapter fourteen, Elene Lam and Chanelle Gallant reflect on the work of defending migrant sex workers from policing. They explore an amalgam of agencies that monitor, surveil, and criminalize these migrants. Public police work in tandem with provincial and federal agencies—and with community organizations caught up in an “anti-trafficking” framework that conflates sex work and trafficking. The authors highlight “policing beyond the police” and call for defunding and abolition to be applied broadly, to agencies that include notably the Canadian Border Services Agency, intelligence agencies, and antitrafficking social service organizations with anti–sex work agendas.
In chapter fifteen, nicole marie burton and Hugh Goldring use a comic to depict how police respond to drug use and even harm reduction practices. Burton and Goldring show how police approach these issues and events through a crimefighting lens that fails to keep people safe and ends up causing more harm, suffering, and fear.
In chapter sixteen, Ann De Shalit, Adrian Guta, Camisha Sibblis, Emily van der Meulen, and Jijian Voronka compare police and social work as oppressive institutions. Social work, like policing, relies on racialized categories and settler notions. The authors challenge the idea that simply removing money from policing and putting it into social work will improve racial justice. Instead, social work needs to be transformed as policing is abolished, as part of a broader movement toward economic, social, and racial justice.
In chapter seventeen, Edward Hon-Sing Wong, MJ Rwigema, Nicole Penak, and
Craig Fortier similarly make arguments for abolishing carceral social work. They argue that social work is colonial in its origins in Canada, and that it has long been used to suppress and monitor Indigenous communities. Social work education needs to adopt a decolonizing and abolitionist framework to transform that institution.
In chapter eighteen, Kikélola Roach provides a view and a voice from the summer of 2020, capturing the energy and enumerating the claims made at the countless rallies against police across Canada.
Finally, in chapter nineteen, Robyn Maynard gives a short account of the history of police and state repression of Black people in Canada, as well as Black resistance. Maynard makes an important argument for defunding and abolition of police in Canada, calling for the dismantling of colonial, racist, and violent institutions.

## “Uphold the Right”

Police, Conservatism, and White Supremacy

## Jeffrey Monaghan

Within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s coat of arms lies the official motto of the national police force: Maintiens le droit . While the coat of arms appears with only the French-language motto, the established English translation contains a revealing double entendre: Uphold the Right. ¹ One interpretation would suggest police are the guardians of law and order—perhaps the most sacred myth of policing—while another reading of the motto suggests police function to protect and reproduce a right-wing, conservative social order. Policing agencies would certainly prefer the interpretation that celebrates their work as protectors of law and society in general; however, the latter interpretation is far more accurate: police and police cultures are deeply aligned with conservative politics and function to reproduce conservative social structures in society.
Small-c conservatism is defined by several core characteristics. Among them, opposition to social change, a worldview that assumes a violent state of nature, an assumption that violence is necessary to uphold social order against threats of chaos, and hostility toward outsider groups, who are treated as signs of social change or disruptions to traditional social and power structures. In theory, conservatism can animate the ideas of any political community. Yet in a settler state such as Canada, conservatism is expressed in defence of a racial hierarchy
in which the culture, values, behaviours, and wealth associated with whiteness shape the normative milieu that is under threat (and must therefore be defended).
The defence (or reproduction) of these values shares another name: white supremacy. While many associate the term with neo-Nazis and the far right, white supremacy is better understood as the mainstream, normative system where expressions of “the normal” are, in fact, derived predominantly from the experiences of white, settler, consumer classes. Conservative politics provide the most structured grammar for upholding the right to white supremacy, but white supremacy is not limited to one or two political parties: it is the dominant political mode of social understanding in Canada. White supremacy embeds a series of values associated with individualism, processes of civilization and progress, perceptions around work ethic and personal responsibility, and notions of acceptable types of bodies and embodiments—all of which shape a system of epistemic racism where bodily hierarchies structure the social. As products of European, white social structures, these values are recirculated in Canada as “normal” forms of being. And these norms are a powerful social force: they define good and bad citizenship and inform how those who are lower on the social hierarchy of white supremacy are subject to various tactics of control. Notably, the violence of policing.
Not surprisingly, research on police culture has pointed out that police organizations have deeply embedded conservative cultures and police officers hold conservative values. Robert Reiner’s The Politics of the Police is well regarded as providing one of the first systemic typologies of police culture research. Reiner outlines seven core features of police culture: mission, suspicion, isolation/solidarity, police conservativism, machismo, racial prejudice, and pragmatism.² Although Reiner’s typology was built largely on police ethnography research from the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, the typology remains relevant both for understanding research on police and interpreting the actions of police officers and agencies.
Perhaps the most notable characteristic, in the context of defunding or abolishing police, is that of isolation/solidarity. Policing research demonstrates a fascinating duality in which police officers consider themselves social outsiders, but that feeling of isolation then produces intense in-group solidarity within policing cultures. According to Reiner, this duality leaves police often feeling misunderstood, attacked, and underappreciated by the broader public (a theme that has proliferated in contemporary claims that police are victims), while
creating greater solidarity among police (and other violence workers like prison guards) who regard their in-group as the only people who truly understand their noble cause.
This theme of isolation/solidarity is perhaps becoming ever more relevant with what has been called the “new visibility” of policing: the use of cell phones and social media to shed light on practices of police violence that have traditionally gone unrecorded.³ Police now regularly complain about the impacts of public scrutiny associated with violence caught on camera, even fuelling what has been called a “Ferguson effect” by which police claim to no longer respond to calls when they feel the risk of being recorded.⁴ These police efforts to cast themselves as victims of an unsympathetic public demonstrate the core idea of the isolation characteristic: police feel that nobody understands their work, their struggles, their victimization.
In perhaps the most iconic form of white fragility, the state’s marshals of violence regularly attempt to challenge the public response to specific events of police brutality as violent attacks against their institution. An illustrative performance of these tactics is a viral video of NYPD police union leader Mike O’Meara’s rant at the height of the 2020 mobilizations in New York, when police violence was being widely discussed on social media and in mainstream media. O’Meara celebrates the noble work of police officers by denying the existence of racial violence, goes on to blame media, saying “everybody is trying to shame us” by “treating us like animals and thugs,” and then concludes that police are the real victims of violence because “nobody talks about all the police officers who were killed last week.”⁵ Similar expressions of police victimhood are all too common; they represent an effective tactic to deflect attention away from police violence and its impacts on the communities targeted by policing.
In step with the defunding and abolitionist movements, during the wave of mobilizations that took place during the spring and summer of 2020, police also made extensive use of social media in order to circulate claims of attacks on police, looting, and alleged criminality. As strategic interventions, these efforts are representative of a long-standing practice of police organizations to frame public knowledge and opinions around crime and—given the rise of social media—part of a larger effort to re-establish control over policing and crime narratives. Some policing scholars have described these strategies as forms of “image work”: the performative strategies used by police that are seamlessly recirculated by sympathetic media platforms to reproduce favourable imagery of
the police as “guardians of symbolic order.”
In their classic text Policing the Crisis, Stuart Hall and his co-authors describe police acting as the “primary definer” of media representations about criminality during the 1960s and ’70s.⁷ Showing the racialized character of these representations, the authors argue that police image work functions to strategically direct attention away from issues of injustice—like economic inequality, colonialism, racism, or corruption—by promoting visions of disorder and, in particular, the threat of Black criminality that political and media elites associated with radical US social movements of those decades.
By twinning social movements with the threat of criminality, the institution of policing functions as an “ideological conductor” for a range of conservative politics associated with the early iterations of a “tough on crime” stance. Policing the crisis did not merely include the police violence and brutality directed toward progressive movements, but also the ideational control of the public (and in particular the white consumer class) expressed through the threat of crime and the nobility of the police. More than forty years after the analysis offered in Policing the Crisis, these conservative values have become widely normalized through the popularity of mass incarceration and racial capitalism.
As the movement for defunding grows, so do claims of police victimization and the articulation of police as the “thin blue line.” Tyler Wall has described how the “thin blue line” represents an assemblage of ideas and associations that convey—explicitly and esoterically—how contemporary capitalist society would be impossible to maintain without the police.⁸ A deeply conservative worldview that is nonetheless prolific among liberal political circles, the notion presents the police as the only social instrument that protects deserving citizens—itself a racialized construction based on the norms of whiteness—against violent and predatory others. While politicians and police agencies in Canada are astute enough to (mostly) stay clear of official Blue Lives Matter rhetoric and the banner of the “thin blue line,” their representations of crime and social disorder are implicit mechanisms to recirculate the same conservative values of the police as essential and noble social guardians. Even self-identifying progressive organizations recirculate the ideational values of the “thin blue line” and balk at concrete actions that disrupt the institutional power of police.
The police suppression of social movements in Canada especially illustrates the active function of police in upholding conservative politics while simultaneously
delegitimizing and demobilizing movements that seek to challenge and replace that order. Scholars in Canada, likewise, have demonstrated how police organizations have a history of targeting Indigenous people, Black people, and people of colour, queer and trans communities, and a broad array of leftist groups. While police often make public claims to be neutral or merely enforcing laws, research using Access to Information requests has documented the extensive ties between policing and extractive agencies.¹ Policing in Canada has always functioned, as Shiri Pasternak notes in this collection, to advance the settler colonial “ideology of conquest, removal, and dispossession.” A contemporary iteration of colonial practices to support extractive companies and other corporations includes police agencies explicitly rationalizing the need for interventions in the name of progress, economic development, and protection against criminality and “extremism.”¹¹ Antifa, Black Lives Matter, decolonial movements, and other initiatives are emerging targets of police suppression, likely due to their effectiveness at reaching a broader public and mobilizing specifically against police power.
It is precisely the ability of Indigenous communities and the Black Lives Matter movement to articulate alternatives to existing models of policing and white supremacy that fuels police suppression of these groups. The work of reimagining policing (in both its specific and ideational forms) that is necessary for the success of the defunding and abolitionist movements cannot be advanced without first acknowledging the settler colonial roots of policing. In Canada, the most visible and tenacious form of settler colonial policing remains the RCMP. Regrettably, a large population of residents in Canada are heavily invested in what Eva Mackay calls the “benevolent Mountie myth” of the RCMP (and their predecessor the North-West Mounted Police) as gentle, reasonable providers of law and order.
This myth is central to the endurance of the RCMP through decades of illegalities and controversies. Moreover, the myth distorts the explicit function of law and policing as a tool of settler colonialism. This function was clearly expressed by John A. MacDonald in a letter to Indian Commissioner Edgar Dewdney following the North-West Resistance in 1885 in which the prime minister justified the need for the public execution of eight Indigenous men on the grounds that the hangings would “convince the Red Man that the White Man governs.”¹²
Blair Stonechild and Bill Waiser have demonstrated that the NWMP/RCMP
cracked down on Indigenous movements before and after the resistance specifically because they presented a pan-Indigenous movement that threatened the stability of the newly imposed apartheid regime concocted through the numbered treaties and the Indian Act.¹³ The punitive response to the resistance provided the genesis of the NWMP/RCMP as Canada’s “thin blue line”—police as the only solution to protecting and developing white settler society while suppressing Indigenous title and lifeworlds. When the RCMP claims to Uphold the Right, it is precisely these historically embedded contemporary relations of white supremacy and the conservative worldview that the police uphold and reproduce.
Now that the defunding movement and the conversation about police abolition have become mainstream, we have an important opportunity to challenge police power, police representations of victimization, and the idea of the “thin blue line,” as well as the white supremacy that dominates politics in a settler state. In many ways, challenging the police must be at the centre of transforming our politics, not only because policing is at the front line of criminalization and social control, but also because it is the ideological conductor that maintains the social inequality and structural violence of settler society. It is difficult to work in our communities and more broadly to challenge these entrenched social forces. Yet the current moment builds on decades of work from Indigenous, queer, and racialized people, and sex worker activists, all with many other allies and communities, who have built alternative infrastructures of resonance.
As other contributors to this volume also note, abolishing police requires us to address a broad array of social conflicts and/or harms that will always exist in complex communities through mechanisms that transcend the narrowly retributive notions of “justice” that dominate contemporary politics—a politics produced and upheld by police organizations and conservative values. The practicalities afforded in mobilizing to displace and defund police are immediate actions that can be taken to upend the right while also providing avenues to express and demonstrate new possibilities. Calls for defunding and abolition should contest police control over narratives of crime and justice, while also communicating how alternatives can create more safe and more egalitarian societies. After all, as anti-fascist agitator Bertolt Brecht noted, you can’t write poems about trees when the woods are full of policemen.

A History of Toronto Activism against Anti-Blackness

## Ruth Nortey

## A Movement Is Sparked

In Toronto, acts of resistance toward anti-Black racism in the Toronto Police Service (TPS) have been reported in the media for approximately forty years. The first stories traced through news databases note that the killings of both Andrew “Buddy” Evans in 1978 and Albert Johnson in 1979 by the Toronto police incited mass demonstrations and protests by activists against police brutality. They sparked a movement that would grow over the next four decades to challenge systemic racism and anti-Blackness in the TPS.
The death of Buddy Evans ignited the fight against anti-Black racism in Toronto and began to mobilize the Black community. As reported in the Globe and Mail, on August 9, 1978, Evans, a twenty-four-year-old Black man, was killed in a confrontation with the police outside of a tavern at the intersection of King Street West and Bathurst in downtown Toronto.¹ Although the police claimed that the death of Evans was in protection of Constable John Clark, Black community members expressed dissenting views. Many Black community members believed that his death came as a result of the harassment of Black people. Common entertainment hubs that Black people would frequent would often be disrupted by the police for no other reason than being Black spaces. Following Evans’s death, forty demonstrators marched to Old City Hall to demand that Clark be held accountable for killing this man.²
Shortly after the death of Evans, the death of Albert Johnson sparked outrage among Toronto’s Black community members again. Johnson, a Jamaican immigrant, was killed by two Toronto police officers in his apartment. Both officers who were charged with the murder of Johnson were later acquitted of all charges. Toronto’s Black community members, numbered around 175,000, expressed deep concern that members of the police force were racist.³
These concerns rose into action, and two weeks after Johnson’s death, on September 1, 1979, around two thousand Black community members marched from the intersection of Vaughan and Oakwood to 13 Division headquarters to protest his death. The demonstration was organized by thirty-two coalition groups that ranged from the Jamaican Nationals League to the New Democratic Party (NDP).⁴ Activists demanded that the officers who shot Johnson be charged with murder and not manslaughter. They also demanded that financial compensation be given to Johnson’s wife and four children for his death. Finally, they wanted the City of Toronto and Ontario Attorney-General Roy McMurtry to implement an independent civilian review board for complaints against the police.⁵ The police investigation into Johnson’s death raised concerns about the police’s ability to investigate themselves without showing favourable bias. These grievances suggested it was necessary for the police to be monitored by another separate agency.

## Black Action Defense and the SIU

Despite the criticisms of Black activists and community members concerning the deaths of Evans and Johnson, Black people continued to be killed by police. For instance, Lester Donaldson, a young Black man, was shot and killed in a confrontation with the police in his home in 1988.⁷ The Black Action Defense Committee (BADC) was established as a response to the continued killing of Black community members in Toronto. It was founded by Dudley Laws, a Jamaican Canadian civil rights activist, the year Donaldson was killed, and staffed by Charles Roach, Sherona Hall, and Lennox Farrell. The BADC protested acts of police brutality toward Black community members. It also served as a form of support for the families of victims and a systemic response to the police and news media outlets. Dudley Laws publicly expressed harsh
criticisms of the Toronto police and was cited as calling Canada a racist state. For this, fellow Black community members viewed him as both extreme and outrageous in his approach to fighting anti-Blackness, even though many shared similar beliefs about the Toronto police. Despite the controversy, the BADC became a powerful force in the struggle against police brutality. The group rallied support from people of all races by demonstrating and demanding equal rights and justice for Black community members on the streets of Toronto.⁸
One successful call to action of the BADC led to the creation of what is now known as Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), a civilian police oversight agency. The SIU was created in 1990 to increase police accountability in the investigation of civilian deaths. The first of its kind in Canada, this agency’s development can be accredited to the many years of activists demonstrating on Toronto streets. The SIU was developed as “public concern grew about the process in which police officers investigated other police officers, in particular in incidents of police shootings where a member of the public had been wounded or killed.”¹ The implementation of the SIU served as a small victory for the Black community in Toronto, because it acknowledged that anti-Black racism and police brutality were a systemic problem that required institutional reform.
Although there was some form of acknowledgement that anti-Black racism was present in the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force (as it was then known), Black men continued to be the victims of fatal encounters with the police. In April 1992, two white Peel Region Police officers were acquitted by an all-white jury of killing seventeen-year-old Michael Wade Lawson.¹¹ Shortly thereafter, news of the death of Raymond Lawrence, another young Black man who was shot by the police, came just two days before what has become known as the Yonge
## Street Riot (or Uprising).¹²

It Took a Riot: The Promises and Failures of Reform
In a live video recording captured by CityPulse, protestors marched to the US embassy on May 4, 1992, in solidarity with protestors of the Rodney King beating that happened in Los Angeles. Many people in the crowd were chanting “No Justice, No Peace.” Youths of different races smashed storefronts with
bricks and baseball bats, overturned hotdog stands, and pelted the police with eggs and rocks. CityPulse reported that it was evident that those who had taken part in the looting were not a part of the earlier demonstration and had no political ties to this movement.¹³ In the film entitled It Takes A Riot: Race, Rebellion and Reform, a member of the BADC, Grace-Edward Galabuzi, recounted his experience at the riot. He explained, “We had a commitment to non-violence, but I identified with the kind of rage that was being expressed by people. They had to hear us. They had to respond somehow.”¹⁴
Although the riot drew national attention to the concerns of Black community members, not all political leaders felt that these concerns were legitimate. Black community members were not considered to be completely justified in their fight against systemic racism because they were considered responsible for crimes that occurred in the community. In a Toronto Star article, the Premier of Ontario, Bob Rae, agreed that racism was in fact present in Ontario and that it was evident that those who participated in the protest were not responsible for the aftermath of events. However, Progressive Conservative member of provincial parliament Bob Runciman refuted the premier’s claim, saying Rae was legitimizing baseless concerns of racism and that he had failed to take into account the negative effects of drug dealing in Toronto communities and the dangers that police officers were daily exposed to.¹⁵ The events that transpired on Yonge Street were not enough to convince other politicians of the existence of systemic racism; however, they led to an inquiry that would confirm the beliefs of so many Black community members in Toronto.
Shortly after the Yonge Street Riot, Stephen Lewis, a former politician and UN ambassador, was appointed by Bob Rae to investigate the state of race relations in Ontario. In June 1992, as Lewis conducted his review, he observed that fear and anxiety were extremely common emotions among Black community members. In his report, he provided fourteen recommendations to assist in combating systemic racism. Among them, that the Race Relations and Policing Task Force should be reconstituted to ensure that previous recommendations made by Clare Lewis, the task force chair, were being implemented.¹ In his 1989 report, Clare Lewis had found that Black community members felt as though they were policed very differently than other races of people and made fifty-seven recommendations about the police and community relations. In particular, he recommended police training programs that would require all officers to participate in basic race relations training. He also recommended the integration of race relations into all aspects of police training.¹⁷ However,
because some of these past recommendations were left neglected, Stephen Lewis requested an update to these recommendations to assess the status of implementation.
In response to Stephen Lewis’s report, coupled with the persistence of the BADC and anti-racism activists inside the government, the NDP developed and implemented anti-racism policies. Ontario increased its funding for existing community programs that focused on Black youth and devoted millions of dollars in grants to community groups engaged in anti-racism programming and education. It also appointed a three-year inquiry into racial bias and systemic racism within Ontario’s criminal justice system.¹⁸

## More Killings and the Role of BLM-TO

Between the years of 2004 and 2015, the deaths of O’Brien Christopher-Reid, Duane Christian, Michael Eligon, Ian Pryce, Jermaine Carby, and Andrew Loku have continued to reignite conversations about anti-Black racism in relation to the Toronto police.¹ Following its independent investigation into the death of Loku, the SIU issued a statement concluding that the police officer who shot Loku did not exceed “the ambit of justifiable force in the circumstances” and that no criminal charge would be laid against him.²
Demonstrators from Black Lives Matter–Toronto protested outside of City Hall and police headquarters in response to this judgment. On the list of activists’ demands was that the SIU release anonymous but detailed data of its cases, including information about racial background. Although the SIU was initially developed in response to concerns surrounding police shootings of Black men, the SIU does not collect information about race or mental health issues. Statistics Canada also does not have race-based statistics about fatal police encounters.²¹
Without formal data, it is difficult to concretely consider the effects of race on interactions with the police. However, Black community members appear to have fallen victim to fatal encounters with the police with alarming frequency. In his report on Police Use of Force in Ontario, research conducted on behalf of the African Canadian Legal Clinic for submission to the Ipperwash Inquiry, Scot Wortley, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Toronto,
explains that race data collection would be valuable in determining whether or not racial bias exists within policing. Collecting such data would show the public that the police are transparent in their operations. Finally, Wortley argues, the official monitoring of the police may reduce or eliminate racial profiling and racial bias.²²

## A National Movement

In previous years, demands for police reform have been at the centre of national discussions; however, they have continued to fall short in the protection of Black lives. The deaths of D’Andre Campbell and Regis Korchinski-Paquet in 2020 have caused a national outcry for the Toronto police to be defunded.²³ In Toronto, demonstrations have been held in response to the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black and Indigenous woman, who fell from the balcony following an interaction with the police. It was reported that Korchinski-Paquet was suffering from a mental health crisis when she encountered the police. Her death has once again prompted many activists and protestors to demand justice against the use of excessive force against members of the Black community. Current movements such as Black Lives Matter–Toronto and Not Another Black Life have taken on a similar mission, and for the same reasons, as the BADC did in years prior.
As it stands, the Toronto Police Service budget is approximately $1.08 billion dollars.²⁴ Sandy Hudson, co-founder of Black Lives Matter–Toronto, outlined that “defunding the police means that funds would be allocated to creating better services or that are currently in existence to provide safety and security for our community in a better way, one that does not result in a ridiculous amount of police killings of Black and Indigenous people.”²⁵ Councillors Josh Matlow and Kristyn Wong-Tam put forth a motion in June 2020 to defund the police by 10 percent.²
In particular, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto is a leading facility that is in support of removing police officers from the front line, especially for those in mental health emergencies.²⁷ In the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, what was meant to be a wellness check by the police ended
up as a fatal encounter that ended her life. As well, the deaths of D’Andre Campbell, O’Brien Christopher-Reid, Andrew Loku, Michael Eligon, and Ian Pryce have all raised concerns into the role that mental illness has on fatal encounters with the police.²⁸ National calls to defund the police have made more visible the fact that the police are often assigned to respond to emergency calls that go beyond the scope of their training. As such, policing institutions cannot be relied on to adequately respond to systemic racism or to the mental health care system. For far too long the police have been the central authority figures that respond to a wide range of community issues. Instead, it is more beneficial to use some of the financial resources that are allotted to the TPS and put them toward community programs and agencies that are better equipped to deal with those crises.

## An Uncertain Future

As of June 2020, Toronto City Council voted against defunding the police and instead offered numerous different police reforms. Mayor John Tory proposed changes to policing that would include developing alternative ways for the police to respond to calls that don’t involve weapons, the implementation of antiracist policies, and body-worn cameras for all police officers.²
Although these police reforms are being implemented in the name of protecting Black lives, how can they? Our own history has shown that time and time again, while police reform is implemented by the government, Black community members continue to be killed by the Toronto police. It is also increasingly difficult to ensure that these reforms are being evenly implemented across all policing organizations in Toronto and to assess whether or not these reforms are actually working. Systemic racism cannot be uprooted by police reform. That would requires structural change within policing institutions and our community. But first, it requires that political leaders and leaders in policing organizations recognize that systemic racism is in fact present in Ontario. With Toronto City Council voting against the motion to defund the Toronto police and in favour of police reform, we will more than likely continue to see Black community members being killed in fatal encounters with the police in years to come.
Moving forward, it is unclear how the current round of reforms will work to eradicate anti-Blackness and systemic racism in the Toronto Police Service or how they will be any different from failed attempts to reform the police in years prior. However, what is very clear is that systems of policing have never been adequate in helping to protect the lives of all people, especially Black people.

## Police Use of Force in Canada

## Dispelling the Myth of Difference

## Julius Haag

The 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer has contributed to renewed uprisings against issues of systemic racism and police brutality in the United States, Canada, and abroad. The tragedy of Floyd’s killing represented a high-profile example of the long-standing crisis of police violence against Black people in the United States. This violence’s pervasive and widespread nature has served to further perpetuate the Canadian myth that these issues are primarily an American problem, rooted in a deeply ingrained systemic and structural racism that is not found in our own policing systems. This narrative’s persistence is central to Canada’s rhetoric of national exceptionalism and the systemic denial of difference when it comes to the treatment of Black and Indigenous people in our criminal justice system. ¹ However, the recent deaths of numerous Black and Indigenous people at the hands of police in Canada—including, among many others, D’Andre Campbell, Eishia Hudson, Andrew Loku, and Regis Korchinski-Paquet—have served to refocus public attention on police violence, the mounting scope and intensity of policing in Canada, and the resultant harms this has caused to Black and Indigenous communities.
Over the past four decades, Canada has witnessed exponential growth in policing expenditures, despite an overall declining crime rate.² Among the factors
contributing to this growth has been the punitive policy turn associated with the so-called war on drugs.³ These policies have done immeasurable harm to Black and Indigenous communities in Canada, including criminalization, excessive police surveillance, and mass incarceration. Nonetheless, despite a growing body of evidence suggesting that Black and Indigenous people face discriminatory treatment at various stages of Canada’s criminal justice system, a lack of systematic, race-based data has hampered efforts to assess the extent of these disparities fully.⁴ Nowhere perhaps is this lack of data more troubling than in tracking police use of force and the number of people who die at the hands of police in Canada.
Much like in the United States, there is no national database in Canada that tracks police killings or other use of force incidents. Further, despite longstanding demands from advocates, community members, and academics, Canadian police agencies do not regularly release official data on use of force cases. Given this lack of data, it should come as no surprise that there is also little in the way of available academic research.⁵ In this regard, the lack of available data serves to support the discursive practices of Canadian police leaders, who have historically countered claims of racial profiling, police brutality, and other forms of misconduct through outright denials of the issue. However, by drawing on a mixture of media accounts, data collected by police oversight agencies, and police reports, researchers have developed a limited body of evidence on use of force, with some disturbing results.
Beginning in 2017, researchers at the CBC began to track information on the deaths of individuals at the hands of police in Canada. Their findings suggest that the number of deaths has grown over the past twenty years and that Black and Indigenous people are disproportionately represented in interactions involving deadly force.⁷ In a 2006 report, University of Toronto criminologist Scot Wortley examined cases conducted between 2000 and 2006 by the Ontario Special Investigations Unit (SIU), finding significant overrepresentation of both Black and Indigenous residents.⁸ In a particularly concerning finding, when compared to white people, the rate of police violence against Black and Indigenous people was 5.4 and 6.2 times higher, respectively. Importantly, these disparities were even more pronounced when examining civilian injuries, including shootings, and deaths at the hands of the police. In a more recent analysis, Wortley and his colleagues analyzed data collected concerning the Toronto Police Service between 2013 and 2017. The authors found that Black people remained overrepresented in all use of force cases investigated by the
SIU as well as in lower-level incidents that did not meet the SIU threshold. Again, white people and other racialized minorities remained under-represented. Further, the overrepresentation of Black people in the data increased in police shootings and use of force cases involving civilian deaths. For example, Black people in Toronto were nearly twenty times more likely than white people to be shot and killed by the police.¹
Police in Canada are increasingly acting as front-line responders to calls involving persons in distress or affected by mental illness.¹¹ The growing reliance on police as the first point of contact in this capacity poses particular risks to racialized persons. While again there is a lack of official, race-based data on this issue, research suggests that, between 2000 and 2020, 68 percent of police encounters in Canada resulting in deadly force involved persons affected by mental illness, addiction, or both.¹² This finding is of particular concern, as commonly held racial biases associating race with dangerousness may contribute to officers’ use of force decisions, thus furthering the risk to persons already in distress.¹³ Further, persons in distress may exhibit behaviours that police officers find threatening, confusing, or otherwise unpredictable, which, when coupled with stereotypical assumptions of dangerousness, heightens the risk of the encounter escalating and resulting in police use of force.¹⁴
There can be little doubt that excessive police surveillance and frequent police contacts increase the risk to racialized people of becoming victims of police violence. For example, as Wortley and his colleagues describe in their analysis of Black overrepresentation in Toronto police use of force statistics: “use of force cases involving Black people were more likely to result from proactive policing efforts (traffic stops, street checks, etc.) than reactive policing efforts (calls for service). This finding suggests that racial bias with respect to police surveillance tactics (racial profiling) may increase the probability of violent confrontations between the police and Black people.”¹⁵ The dramatic overrepresentation of Black people in these practices, then, cannot be explained solely by their involvement in crime and other forms of deviance.¹ Rather, it is a product of racially biased policing tactics, stemming from the racialization of crime, whereby certain forms of criminality are intrinsically linked with racialized communities.
Both the enduring legacy of colonialism and contemporary forms of structural inequality have contributed to the economic, social, and political marginalization faced by Black and Indigenous peoples in Canada. To this end, the racial
stratification of Canadian society perpetuates and legitimates the conditions that contribute to racialized police violence. As described by Frances Henry and Carol Tator, groundbreaking scholars on racism in Canada, “Canadian society is hierarchically stratified along a number of dimensions, including ascribed attributes such as skin colour, ethnicity, sex, and religion, as well as along such lines as economic and political power,” and the criminal justice system both “reflects and promotes the interests of the more powerful members of society.”¹⁷
Central to the promotion of this racialized order is the dehumanization of the racialized other. Through dehumanization, racialized people are robbed of their fundamental humanity and denied the full protection of the law, thus making them worthy of police suspicion and more vulnerable to violence.¹⁸ In this regard, it is crucial to consider the wider social, structural, and political context in which the police operate and the role these forces play in determining police tactics and priorities, and in shaping police discretion. Hence, while there is limited evidence to suggest that Black and Indigenous people are more involved than white people and other racialized groups in some offence types,¹ it is the overpolicing of these groups that has contributed to their dramatic overrepresentation in Canada’s criminal justice system and to the disproportionate rates of police violence they continue to endure.
The current climate of police violence, and the resultant protests and uprisings, have contributed to calls for a range of policy interventions, from reforming and restructuring the police to defunding the police, disarming the police, and police abolition. While these calls now include unprecedented levels of public recognition and support from a broad coalition of allies, they are by no means new demands. However, amid this current crisis, police leaders and policymakers continue to fall back on policy responses that prioritize reinvestments in policing’s existing structures. In practice, such measures serve to broaden the scope of policing, while also contributing to rising police expenditures. These efforts have included attempts at implicit bias and de-escalation training, increasing officer diversity, community relations strategies, police oversight bodies, and technologies such as body-worn cameras.
While we cannot examine the efficacy of each of these interventions here, it should be noted that some have yielded positive outcomes. However, they are generally not supported by a strong body of empirical evidence, and none have proven effective in stemming the tide of lethal police violence.² Rather, the expansion of the police apparatus has disproportionately affected racialized
communities, who now face increased police surveillance, a greater likelihood of involuntary police contacts, and the accompanying risk of bodily harm.
Indeed, as discussed, the number of known fatal police encounters in Canada has increased steadily between 2000 and 2020, even when accounting for population growth.²¹ It is in this regard that a growing coalition of voices has spoken out against these reform-centred responses that, as author and scholar Robyn Maynard describes, “have served only to uphold the status quo of racial violence and maintain, extend and even expand the scope of the institution [of policing].”²² This status quo is now being challenged through calls for defunding, disarmament, and abolition, as a growing movement seeks alternatives to state protection, and reinvestment in individuals and communities to address the complex social and structural root causes of harm.²³

## Chapter 4

## Defund to Abolish

A 400-Year Struggle against Policing in Montreal

## Defund the Police Coalition (Montreal)

Policing in Montreal has always been a problem, even before the creation of a formal police department. Known as Tiohtià:ke by the Kanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) people, the island of Montreal is located at the junction of Kanien’kehá:ka and Algonquin territories. In 1640, the island was bequeathed by the French Crown to a band of settlers known as the Compagnie des associés pour la conversion des sauvages, who began to settle the area two years later. Over the next century, the settlers expanded in number (from 50 in 1642 to 3,500 in 1750) and gradually established a rigidly hierarchical society. At the top of the social order stood government representatives, the Catholic bishop and clergy, gentleman-soldiers, merchants, and their families. At the bottom stood soldiers, artisans, workers, sailors, indentured servants, and their families. Beyond this social order entirely were African captives held as slaves by the political, religious, and business elite, as well as various Indigenous peoples. The latter, when they inhabited the city, were either held as slaves or subject to coerced religious conversion in missions. ¹
An early form of policing emerged in this context, a form tailored to the hierarchical social order. Certain laws, such as those outlawing public drunkenness and sex work, implicitly criminalized the lives of the lower classes. Other laws were more explicit in this respect. The sale of liquor to Africans,
Indigenous people, and indentured servants was outlawed. Enslaved people and indentured servants, though they could be charged in a criminal or civil case, could not bring charges against another person or appear as a witness in a criminal case. For both categories of captive, moreover, it was a crime to leave their master’s home without permission and, of course, to escape captivity. In this context, the role of policing was played by many people. Prosecution for a crime could originate in a complaint filed with a magistrate by any white (nonindentured) person, but military detachments also patrolled the city every night after 9 p.m., scanning the streets and taverns for vagrants, sex workers or women who could be profiled as such, and drunken individuals. When enslaved people escaped, all white citizens were effectively deputized to capture and return the freedom-seeker to their owner. Magistrates interrogated the accused, heard witnesses, and decided on criminal and civil cases.²
When a formal police department was created in 1865, it incorporated these existing logics of criminalization. There is little information about the policing of Black and Indigenous people in this period, as the Black population had dwindled to 72 in 1871 (likely due to out-migration to Ontario) and the last Indigenous community had been pushed off the island in 1721.³ Early targets of the Montreal police department were striking workers, frequently repressed with violence, as well as vagrants, sex workers, and working-class people in general. Between 1836 and 1913, 96 percent of people serving time in the Montreal jail were skilled or unskilled workers, and “disorderly conduct” (usually drunkenness) accounted for 66 percent of convictions.⁴
Political repression was another constant. In the 1960s, the police arrested and brutalized Québécois activists at numerous demonstrations, including “le samedi de la matraque” in 1964 (34 arrests), “la lundi de la matraque” in 1968 (292 arrests, 123 injured), and the October Crisis in 1970 (497 activists, artists, union members, and community workers arrested in their homes).⁵ Targeting the Black community, the police arrested Marcus Garvey on a visit to Montreal in 1928, violently repressed the Black-led computer lab occupation at Sir George Williams University in 1969 (killing Coralee Hutchison), and frequently raided Black community spaces and the homes of Black activists in the 1970s. Targeting sexual “deviance,” the police brutally raided cruising spots and gay clubs in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, arresting over 800 people in four raids alone.⁷ In the 1960s and ’70s, an unofficial policy of opening fire on bank robbers, usually working-class Québécois and Irish people, created what one author has called a police “death squad” that resulted in dozens of killings.⁸
Since the founding of the department, the Montreal police have adapted their mandates, funding, priorities, and policies in ways that target people who are seen as less worthy, less deserving, or less than human—people whose lives or behaviours seem to depart from or disrupt the lives, norms, and interests of the dominant class. The actions of the police, while shaped by the society’s structures of domination, also reinforce and help to produce such structures of domination, as they create ideas about who is criminal and who is innocent that mirror and reinforce ideas about human value in general. As Black and Indigenous scholars and activists have made clear, settler colonies on Turtle Island are founded on a distinction between the human and less than human, a racial distinction that casts Black and Indigenous peoples outside the sphere of human belonging. This distinction, however, also provides a terrain for the relative dehumanization of many other groups, including other racial groups and non-normative people of all racial backgrounds (e.g., LGBTQ2S+ people, sex workers, people experiencing mental illness and/or homelessness). This structure of domination has made policing a death-dealing institution from its origins to the present.
For these reasons, policing has also been a target of resistance throughout its history. Some of this resistance has involved tacit, everyday acts of refusal and rebellion; some has involved more visible resistance, such as organized protest, direct action, and advocacy. Resistance to policing became more visible and well organized in Montreal in the late 1970s. The first major Montreal protest against police racism occurred in 1979, after the police attacked a group of Haitian soccer players in the east-side neighbourhood of Rosemont. Further large-scale protests against police racism and violence occurred after the 1987 killing of Anthony Griffin, a Black teenager, and the 1991 killing of Marcellus François, another Black teenager. Significant protests also followed the police raids of gay clubs in 1977 and 1990, and annual protests against police abuse and violence have occurred since 1995.
These protests, along with broader community organizing efforts, have resulted in a series of police reforms that mirror those implemented in other North American cities. Cultural sensitivity training has been integrated into police education since 1987, minority hiring targets were established in 1991, new venues of police-community dialogue have continually appeared, and modest reforms to police discipline were introduced in 1990 and 2013. These reforms responded to some activist demands, but sidestepped many others. More transformational demands, never implemented, included the replacement of
police with community self-defence in certain neighbourhoods, the disarming of front-line officers, full civilian control of police discipline, and the decriminalization of many offences.¹
The implemented reforms have done little, if anything, to alter the operation of policing. The introduction of sensitivity training, for example, coincided with a sharp increase in the killing of Black Montrealers, leading some (civilian) trainers to quit in protest in 1991. Reforms to police discipline were similarly ineffective. In the first five years of the new discipline system (1990–95), only
1.5 percent of complaints against an officer resulted in disciplinary action. The
2013 reform, the creation of an “independent” body to investigate police killings and significant acts of violence, has yet to result in a single charge against an officer.¹¹ Racial profiling continues to be a problem. A study in 2009 found that 38 to 40 percent of Black residents of two Montreal neighbourhoods had been stopped in the previous year, compared to only 4 to 6 percent of white residents. A 2019 study found that Black men and Indigenous men were four times more likely to be stopped than white men, while Indigenous women were twelve times more likely to be stopped than white women.¹²
In spite of four decades of protest and reform, then, policing in Montreal continues to operate as it always has. And for good reason: the implemented reforms have failed to dismantle the structure or imperatives of policing. They have sought cosmetic changes to policing, but not less policing—or none. As a result, policing continues to reflect, reinforce, and help to produce structures of domination. It continues to criminalize lives and behaviours perceived to fall outside dominant norms, and therefore upholds through surveillance and various forms of violence the dominant structures of the society: capitalism, white supremacy, ableism, and cisheteropatriarchy. Oppressed populations are criminalized both through the codification of laws (which turns ordinary, nonharmful behaviours into infractions) and overpolicing (which results in arrests for infractions that go unpoliced among more privileged groups).
The police are the primary public institution responsible for public safety, but their work has little to do with this mission. It targets non-normative behaviours or entire communities, not harm. From a safety perspective, most of what the police do is unnecessary. It is either unrelated to safety, directly injurious to safety, or both. Police work that is not unnecessary, meanwhile, could be performed better by other agencies, existing and yet-to-be-created services oriented toward care, preventing and stopping harm as defined by those who
experience it, and holding people accountable when harms are committed. There is a whole realm of harms that exist in society, finally, that the police do not even purport to address and often cause or contribute to.
The Montreal Defund the Police Coalition emerged from the recognition that mere reforms will not address the problem of policing. Reforms will not make communities targeted by policing safer, because the role of policing is to make them unsafe. What is required instead is an entirely different approach to public safety and well-being and, to make this possible, a transfer of public money from the police to community-based initiatives centred on care, harm prevention, and transformative justice. The coalition was formed in June 2020 in the midst of the worldwide uprising against police racism and violence that followed the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor (killed in her home by Louisville, Kentucky, police), as well as Regis Korchinski-Paquet (Toronto) and Chantal Moore (Edmunston). It began with a small number of groups already engaged in efforts to defund and disempower the police. Together, these groups developed a list of demands (appended to this chapter) and asked groups across Montreal to support the demands and join the coalition. By September, over sixty groups had joined and six committees had been created to address particular tasks: popular education, communications, direct action, analysis of the police budget, reinvestment, and ending police involvement with youth.
A strong and central representation of women involved in fighting against gender-based violence has been essential to the coalition’s work. In Montreal, as elsewhere, many of the dominant voices in the discussion of sexual violence or intimate partner violence advocate for punitive approaches, but most marginalized women have a more nuanced view of violence and the best ways of addressing it. Dominant voices—playing the role of pundit, troll, or devil’s advocate—love to point out what defunding the police would supposedly mean for survivors of sexual and domestic violence. But members of the coalition live with these realities every day and have elaborated demands that are coherent with their needs and the intersecting forms of oppression that exist in their communities. The primary concern of many women who are experiencing intimate partner violence might be to ensure they don’t lose custody of their children in family court or at the hands of social workers; to not be murdered once their partner is out of police custody; to get psychological, social, and financial support; or to heal and prevent intergenerational trauma within their community. Police do not provide any of those services; indeed, they often work in direct opposition to those needs. For one thing, the women who are most at
risk of being victims of violence are often the same women who are the most at risk of being arrested or brutalized by police. Defunding the police provides a path to untangling those connections and mobilizing for a better approach to violence.
Since its creation, much of the Defund the Police Coalition’s work has involved engaging with communities, especially those most targeted by police, to develop a concrete and prioritized plan for defunding and reinvestment. What aspects of policing should be the first to go? What community-based initiatives should be the first to be funded with the money freed up? Other tasks include direct action (usually protests) and public outreach (press conferences, interviews with media, video capsules). This work, along with the work of activists around the world, has begun to shift public opinion and force open political opportunities. An Environics poll in July 2020 found that 54 percent of Quebeckers supported reduced funding for the police, a positive result given the newness of the idea of defunding to many people. In a pre-budget public consultation in August 2020, moreover, 73 percent of Montrealers called for a reduction in the police budget. Despite the coalition’s organizing and strong popular support, the ruling Projet Montreal government chose to increase the police budget by $14.7 million for
2021.¹³ The struggle will continue, then, into the next budget-making season—
and beyond.
Beyond the objective of actually defunding the police and reinvesting in our communities, the coalition’s work and its ripple effects have also created opportunities for popular education and bringing together many groups who often feel left out of conversations about policing or who don’t always work closely together. The Defund the Police Coalition positions itself clearly in solidarity with everyone who experiences unwanted contacts with police, regardless of whether their behaviours are considered crimes or not, and has made solidarity with other impacted communities mandatory. Not everyone in the coalition needs to fully understand the needs of, for example, trans women, sex workers, people living with HIV, or undocumented migrants, but they must agree to the inclusion of their needs in the coalition’s demands. Similarly, groups and individuals who have been fighting against some police practices and unjust laws without including a robust racial analysis are expected to use their membership in the coalition as an opportunity to address racism in meaningful ways. Bringing people together around the shared goal of defunding the police unites various struggles, from ending the overdose crisis to making our streets safe for Black youth, from ending the disappearances and murders of Indigenous
and trans women to making sure everyone has food to eat and a comfortable place to sleep.
Policing in Montreal has been a problem since the beginning of the city’s existence as a settler colonial outpost. This problem was merely professionalized with the creation of a formal police department in 1865, and it has endured through over four decades of effort to reform this institution. The struggle to defund the police emerges from a long history of resistance to policing and the increasing recognition that the problem is not too little reform, but too much policing. The struggle to defund the police creates new solidarities among the communities who are harmed at once by the police and the hierarchical, oppressive social order that the police abet and help to create.
Defunding the police creates a point of convergence and solidarity between communities that have, until recently, been left to combat the police on their own or in smaller coalitions. It provides a language and a vision for a different kind of world and a different meaning of safety. The struggle to defund the police has made it clear that everyone but the elite will benefit from defunding the police and reinvesting care, harm prevention, and transformative justice. This truth will carry forward the movement and allow it to grow, flourish, and win.
         Ten Demands of the Defund the Police Coalition (Montreal)

## Defund

Immediately cut at least 50 percent from the $665 million Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM) budget and redirect these funds to the programs and services, managed by and for affected communities, outlined in the demands below.

## Disarm and Demilitarize

Withdraw all weapons from police officers, including tasers, batons, firearms, rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper spray, and sound cannons; disband militarized police units, including SWAT teams and other units using military grade weapons and surveillance equipment.

## Decolonize

Invest in Indigenous models of justice and empower Indigenous communities to address through these models all harms committed by Indigenous people; empower other oppressed communities, especially Black communities, to develop and run similar approaches to justice.

## Reinvest

Invest in programs created and run by communities to prevent harm (including harms related to violence, mental illness, and drug use) and support transformative justice; empower communities to develop and manage programs that work for them, with the understanding that communities are not monolithic, experience multiple intersecting axes of oppression, and require leadership and programs that integrate and utilize an intersectional approach (e.g., LBGTQ2S+, disability, sex work, drug use).
Create and fund unarmed service teams outside the police to address mental health and drug related crises, traffic violations, gender-based violence, juvenile “summary” offences, and missing persons cases.
Invest in programs and services, including youth programs, recreation programs, and social housing, in presently criminalized communities; empower communities to develop and manage programs that work for them.

## Decriminalize

Decriminalize all drugs, sex work, and HIV status, eliminate the SPVM drug squad, morality squad, Eclipse squad, and all other units targeting marginalized communities, as well as all proactive surveillance programs, and release and expunge criminal records for drug and sex work charges.
Eliminate social control bylaws related to “incivilities,” and release and expunge all records related to these bylaws (including unpaid bylaw fines), including surveillance and enforcement in public transit.
Permanently withdraw police from schools and sports programs, and cease police patrols of public parks, community events, and other spaces in which youth congregate.
End the criminalization and surveillance of migration by eliminating all collaboration between the police and Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) agents and any other form of involvement of the SPVM in immigration matters.

## Against the Social Harms of Policing

## Kevin Walby

Since the killing of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the world has seen protests and social movement mobilizations in solidarity with Black Americans on a scale unprecedented since the 1960s. Waves of protests changed public views of policing that summer. In Canada, police killed several Indigenous people in the spring and summer of 2020. Three Indigenous people —Eishia Hudson, Jason Collins, and Stewart Andrews—were shot dead by Winnipeg police at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Across the continent, groups emerged calling for the abolition or at least significant defunding of police. The police abolition movement is calling for the funds to be spent instead on housing, mental health and addictions treatment, harm reduction, street nurses, and other alternatives to policing and prisons.
Police abolition is an ethic for diminishing reliance on police by using community development to reduce the conflicts and harms that exist in our neighbourhoods.¹ Police abolitionists advocate decriminalizing harms, expanding community groups that keep people safe, and creating networks to decrease reliance on police intervention. The many injustices created by police (including violence, racism, wrongful arrest, and corruption, to name only a few) make a discussion of police abolition critical to social justice movements and to a discussion of the future of state power.² I will examine four grounds for police abolition: the first is social movement–based; the second, budget-based; the third, organizationally based; and the last, harms-based. But first, let’s look at some important recent work on the topic.

## Police Abolition: Some Context

A growing number of writers draw attention to the idea of police abolition. Public health critiques of policing have argued that public policing is so harmful that it should be considered a health problem. Andrew Dilts argues that criminal justice is too narrowly defined as legal justice. Micol Seigel likewise draws attention to police racism and the need for police abolition as well as prison abolition. Allegra McLeod suggests police abolition does not entail eliminating police overnight but instead calls for harm and violence to be addressed in ways that do not involve police or punitive sanction. Meghan McDowell and Luis Fernandez argue that the focus of social movements and critique should be on disarming, disempowering, and disbanding public police.³
In his 2017 book The End of Policing, Alex Vitale suggests the necessity of police is a myth, as it is based on the idea that police officers can be accountable and that policing as an institution can change.⁴ Other policing myths include the idea that police provide safety, that police fight crime, that police are community-based, and that police malfeasance and violence is the result of a few bad apples. In this context, police abolition is a movement to increase the capacity of community organizations to decrease reliance on criminalization and to respond differently to trangression and conflict.

## Social Movement Mobilizations

Social movements that make claims for police abolition are crucial to learn from, support, and participate in. Black Lives Matter has claimed that public police in the United States grow out of the institution of slavery. Black Lives Matter calls for radical changes to criminal justice institutions and has critiqued traditional civil rights organizations for embracing liberal police reform.⁵ Even if police become more diverse, they will always be configured to oppress African American (and Latino) persons and protect elites.
There is a parallel in Canada, insofar as Idle No More claims that public police in Canada represent a colonial state enterprise that persists into the present day. Public police are a colonial entity created to occupy the lands now called Canada that are Indigenous territories taken through force and criminalization. Police played a crucial role in that process, notably the North-West Mounted Police, which later morphed into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The pass and permit system and the reservation system enforced by Indian agents criminalized Indigenous peoples who sought to engage in economic activity, who sought to move freely without a pass, and who engaged in dance and worship. Criminalization played a central part in colonialism, and public police continue to repress Indigenous struggles over land and self-determination.⁷
The liberal myth of a benevolent police is unmasked when historicized, as the origin of most police services is one of colonialism and imperialism. From the NWMP and the so-called Great March West in Canada to slave patrols and proslavery militias in the United States, public police have been fundamental to the colonization of Turtle Island. Police in the United States kill a staggering number of people every year, and racial profiling is pervasive. First Nations, Inuit, and Métis people, Black Canadians, Indo Canadians and other groups are racially profiled in Canada in ways that parallel US practices. In this way, police abolition is a movement to decrease police violence against Black people, Indigenous people, and people of colour (BIPOC).
Radical empowerment movements such Critical Resistance and Incite!, and community groups in Oakland, Chicago, and elsewhere, are organizing for police abolition. Some train communities not to call the police for fear of shootings and criminalization; others argue for divestment from police. Inspired by these groups, new mobilizations have emerged across Canada. In Surrey, BC, Anti-Police Power Surrey has organized a campaign against police funding and police interventions. Anti-Police Power Surrey calls for police to be disarmed in the short term and to be disbanded in the long term. The group has organized mobilizations in public places to raise awareness about police abolition. Winnipeg Police Cause Harm, in Manitoba, uses social media to advance claims for police abolition. Winnipeg Police Cause Harm has focused on racial profiling, police brutality, ballooning police budgets, and alternatives to calling the police.
Movement groups emerge from the experience of oppression and deprivation; they make the link between policing, capitalism, and racism clear. It will take a
co-ordinated international movement to advance the notion of police abolition. The efforts of Black Lives Matter, Idle No More, Anti-Police Power Surrey, Winnipeg Police Cause Harm, and groups across Turtle Island are starting to make these connections tangible. Social movement groups offer their own experiential arguments for why police are unlikely to remedy conflict and are more likely to enforce neo-colonial racism and protect upper-class colonizers.

## Police Budgets and Fiscal Drain

The second ground to make a claim for police abolition is the issue of police budgets. In municipal budgets across Canada, money for police continues to increase as police budgets often account for nearly 30 percent of spending.⁸ A decade from now, spending on police could make up 40 percent of municipal budgets in Canada, as police budgets continue to grow. Policing consumes an irrational amount of resources in our cities, states, and provinces, and these costs of public policing are neither sustainable nor justifiable. The costs are mainly salaries, although a significant amount of funds go to cars, guns, and gear. All of these costs need to be drastically scaled back. Police unions fight aggressively to keep salaries on the rise, no matter the consequences for municipal budgets. The funds given to police also vanish, because officers typically live outside the jurisdiction in which they work and pay taxes elsewhere and because the funds are not used to enhance the public good locally by expanding community development. Unlike investments in social and community development, housing, and food security, police budgets do not directly create value.
This budget-based argument is problematic, though, because it reflects a kind of cranky taxpayer posture that is about trying to maximize return on tax dollars. Such a posture is susceptible to co-option. I am not suggesting that if we found the right number—say, 12 percent of a city budget—then there would be no reason to pursue police abolition arguments. Nor am I suggesting that corporatized private security—another danger of this budget-based position—is a suitable solution. I am attempting to make clear the fact that police budgets are pushing cities to bankruptcy to show that this is a fiscal problem that drains funding for social and community development initiatives.

## Disproportionate Police Growth

A third argument for police abolition contends that police organizations have grown disproportionately to other organizations that people depend on to survive. Police have grown faster than social welfare organizations, social services, and community development, which have all been defunded. It should be the other way around. Police have also expanded disproportionately to socioeconomic problems they can reasonably be expected to address.
In most jurisdictions, police have expanded vastly since the 1970s. The same cannot be said for social service and community development agencies. Those latter entities have withered while the footprint of police has continued to expand. Without much public discussion or debate, police have come to occupy a central role in society. Yet it cannot be convincingly argued that police are required for most people’s survival. Police intervene in conflicts, yet otherwise they do not keep people alive or improve quality of life. Police do not feed people, house people, or create healthy communities. We have shrunk the organizations necessary for survival while extending the organizations that do the least to feed, heal, and care for us.
The second way police have grown disproportionately is in relation to socioeconomic problems they can reasonably be expected to address. Police can only address a limited number of social issues. But they cannot address social and economic problems that are the source of most conflict and harm. The real questions to address are: Do people have access to resources to feed themselves? Do they feel like they are a member of a community? Are neighbourhoods places where people feel safe? Are people struggling with poor physical and mental health? Do people have a way of providing for themselves and their families? The only way to address these issues is through community and social development; meanwhile, governments have slashed community and social development budgets and capacity in the past three decades.¹

## Erosion of Community

The final reason to argue for police abolition is that police cause harm. Most obviously, police cause harm when they kill people. However, in addition to death, police cause many social harms. While social harm is not always immediately identifiable or sensational, it is pervasive in scope and over time. Those who write about social harm argue that institutions and social trends that are preventable and will foreseeably cause harm should be reduced or abolished.¹¹ Literature on social harm has advanced similar claims about cars, cigarette smoking, workplace accidents, and air pollution. Like these social harms, policing is a disintegrating force that pulls neighbourhoods apart. The hidden work and effects of criminalization are even more harmful and destructive in the long term than police killings. Criminalization hurts communities and is not a rational or effective way of decreasing transgression.¹²
There are many collateral consequences of imprisonment and the array of punitive sanctions that comprise the criminal justice system, and not just for the people who go to prison or jail. This process always begins with police. Police create social harm that is foreseeable and preventable. Contrary to police rhetoric, policing and criminalization actually create conditions that advance the possibility of harm and law-breaking activity over time.
A criminalized person loses their capacity to contribute to their family. That person loses capacity to continue their education and to maintain employment. Even if they only go to jail for a few days and they plead out or otherwise return to their community on probation, the process of going to jail has an impact on that person and on their community. The social harm of public policing disintegrates and destabilizes community relations. In fact, over time, it may create conditions for even more transgression to occur, which leads to a selfperpetuating cycle of police intervention and further criminalization. This cycle needs to be broken.

## A Future without Public Police

I have not mentioned police corruption, and I have not commented on police violence much either. Both corruption and police violence are further grounds
for police abolition. What I have done is advance four arguments for police abolition. Social movements have made arguments for police abolition that are historically grounded in grievances regarding colonialism as well as neo-colonial forms of control. Public police budgets are bankrupting cities. Public police have grown in a way that is disproportionate to socially necessary institutions and disproportionate to issues police can address. Police use harm in a way that erodes communities and destabilizes families, the exact opposite of real safety.
There is a need to ready our communities to be self-sufficient and empowered. Meghan McDowell advances the idea of insurgent safety based on anarchist mutual aid and communities of interdependence as a means of reimagining the world in a way devoid of police.¹³ This creation of insurgent safety capacity needs to be achieved in a way that addresses the inequalities and injustices created by racism and patriarchy that undergird the apparatus of criminal justice and the carceral system. McDowell contends that carceral safety, which depends on continued use of police and prisons, has been normalized, and that capacity to address conflict in autonomous ways outside of policing and the carceral system has declined or been stripped away from neighbourhoods. The idea of insurgent safety speaks to a core conundrum that most people have with the idea of police abolition, which is the question of how to meet immediate safety needs.
Police abolitionists want to grow community by taking the funds that police use and putting them into social and community development. Anti-racist and anticapitalist work is essential too, to ensure that micro-aggressions and forms of discrimination outside of criminal justice are still diminished. Police abolitionists take harm seriously by suggesting that we need some way to deal with the transgressions that damage people that happen in our communities. This needs to be done in a manner that does not harm future generations by removing family members from their community. Abolitionists encourage people to think longer term, which requires putting emphasis on the immediate aftermath of conflict and how to deal with conflict in ways that do not simply create more harm by criminalizing people.

## Chapter 6

## Let’s Talk about Police in Our Unions

## An Abolitionist Approach to Decent Work for All

## Ryan Hayes

In the spring of 2020, protests erupted across the United States and Canada and around the world in response to police killings of Black and Indigenous people. For their part, Canadian labour unions released a series of strong statements against anti-Black racism, racial injustice, and police violence. ¹ However, we also need to have an urgent conversation about police in the labour movement. If we are seriously committed to protecting Black and Indigenous lives, policing can’t just be tweaked; it must be abolished and replaced with a new approach to community safety. The role of the police in our society is fundamentally antiBlack, anti-Indigenous, and anti-worker. As trade unionists, our efforts to dismantle systemic racism must include abolishing police unions and the police from our own unions.
Shouldn’t all workers have the right to unionize?
It’s true that all workers should have the right to organize a union, but many do not because under current labour laws it is illegal or impractical. For example,
migrant farm workers and domestic workers in Ontario are denied the right to form a union. We organize against these racist exclusions because they are unfair, divide workers, and weaken the labour movement.
But police are not workers, not in the way that matters most. Workers are members of the working class, while the police were founded to serve and protect the interests of the ruling class: putting down strikes, capturing runaway slaves, pushing Indigenous peoples off their lands.² Police perform the same functions today. Black and Indigenous people continue to be killed by the police at extremely disproportionate rates. A 2018 study by the Ontario Human Rights Commission found that a Black person in Toronto is twenty times more likely to be fatally shot by the police than a white person.³ According to an analysis by CTV News of data from 2017 to 2020, an Indigenous person in Canada is more than ten times more likely to have been shot and killed by a police officer than a white person.⁴
RCMP officers raided Wet’suwet’en territory in February 2020 to arrest Indigenous land defenders for protecting their unceded land from Coastal GasLink’s pipeline project. Even after being exposed in a 2017 investigation published by the National Observer, the RCMP continues to collude with the energy sector to surveil Indigenous activists.⁵ When the Co-op Refinery Complex obtained an injunction to prevent striking members of Unifor Local 594 from picketing in Regina, Saskatchewan, the Regina Police Service were sent in to enforce the ruling by fining and arresting workers. Outside of Regina, the RCMP enforced the injunction with such gusto that they even threatened to arrest picketers at locations not included in the order.
Up until 2015, the RCMP were ineligible to unionize, unlike the rest of their police counterparts in Canada, who are able to form unions and collectively bargain but not go on strike. The Canadian Police Association, along with the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) and Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), intervened in a Supreme Court of Canada case to argue in favour of
## RCMP officers gaining the right to form a union.⁷

The Government of Canada argued that having the right to unionize could impair the RCMP’s “stability” and “neutrality.”⁸ In its ruling, the Supreme Court found no merit in the government’s argument that the right to unionize would weaken the police’s allegiance to the ruling class. If the Supreme Court could see this, we have to ask: What did the CLC and PSAC think the labour movement stood
to gain from Mounties winning the right to unionize?
Why do we need to abolish the police in our unions?
As a result of the Supreme Court’s January 2015 decision, 20,000 RCMP officers and 10,000 civilian employees became eligible to unionize. In 2018, the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) announced that the union had successfully organized a unit of nearly 1,300 RCMP telecom operators and intercept monitor analysts in an effort that had begun in 2016.¹
This organizing “victory” prompted a backlash from within CUPE’s existing membership. A group called Cops Out of CUPE formed and brought motions to the union’s provincial conventions in 2018 and 2019, and to its national convention in 2019, asking CUPE to reject the inclusion of state security forces in the Canadian labour movement. The national motion asserted that CUPE’s unionization of state security forces was at odds with the union’s opposition to recent federal bills that expanded the reach of Canada’s spy and security agencies and its solidarity statements with the Wet’suwet’en Nation and Movement for Black Lives. It also noted that these forces “have surveilled and repressed worker and justice movements including but not limited to current and
## previous members of CUPE.”¹¹

This grassroots effort by rank-and-file activists forced an important conversation about the ethics of organizing the RCMP. Cops Out of CUPE, started by Indigenous CUPE members, gathered endorsements from a number of locals, the Ontario Young Workers Committee, and the Ottawa CUPE District Council. So far, their motions have received a cool response from the leadership and have not garnered enough support to pass.
Gizem Çakmak attended the national convention as a delegate with CUPE 3903, one of the locals that endorsed the campaign. She recalled a member of CUPE’s national executive speaking against the motion by emphasizing that “all workers have the right to unionize” and making an emotional appeal to the sexual violence faced by women workers in state security forces. But Çakmak asks what organizing the RCMP means for people like herself who come to unions as a refuge from state violence and a site for organizing against it. “As an
immigrant worker from Turkey, I’m not Black and I don’t experience anti-Black racism in the way that other CUPE members do, but my family and I have experienced a lot of harm at the hands of the police,” she told me. “We can’t let this issue go. The statements by our unions need to be complemented by concrete action.”¹²
Now is the time to renew the call to remove police and all state security forces from the labour movement—but doing so will require a groundswell of pressure from below. In the United States, amid brave acts of solidarity with protestors by unionized bus drivers and dockworkers, the leadership of America’s largest federation of unions is resisting calls to expel police unions from their ranks.¹³ In Canada, police unions—which typically refer to themselves as “associations”— are not part of our central labour body, the CLC, but unions affiliated with the CLC have members involved in many aspects of policing and the prison industrial complex—from the RCMP to jail guards, immigration enforcement agents, and transit cops.
Union members deserve to have a say in the organizing priorities of their unions. Bold statements about our commitment to racial justice must be put into action. Cops Out of CUPE provides a helpful starting point for this conversation with its call to revoke the charter of the RCMP local and to discontinue organizing efforts with any civilian or non-civilian elements of state security forces.
On June 10, 2020, the Canadian Labour Congress hosted a webinar called What Are Unions Doing about Anti-Black Racism? The CLC representatives did not raise the topic of police unions or police in unions, but guest speaker Sandy Hudson, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter–Toronto, called on unions with police in their memberships to rethink their approach. “If labour unions want to be in solidarity with Black people, they can’t be working with state security forces, which are constructed at their very core to be anti-Black,” she said.
I asked Hudson after the webinar for her thoughts on the argument that it’s better to keep state security forces in our unions so we can educate them. “No amount of education is going to change the fundamental function of policing: to watch, control, and attack Black and Indigenous lives and other people undervalued in our society, including union members,” she said.¹⁴
Indeed, the reason “teaching out” racism doesn’t work in police forces isn’t because we haven’t thrown enough time or money at the problem; it’s because
anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism is a structural feature of policing in Canadian society. As Black Lives Matter activists have said time and time again: the system isn’t broken—it was built this way.
Why must we defund the police and police unions?
Hudson also urged trade unionists to support the growing movement to defund the police.¹⁵ Making such a transformative shift in the allocation of social spending will obviously be met with resistance from some quarters, not least from police associations.
Police associations have an inordinate amount of power, and they wield it to help shield their members from accountability measures, to deny the existence of systemic racism, portray themselves as victims, and keep their political opponents in check.¹ In Toronto, the police association has enough sway to influence who is chosen as police chief, spiking a more reform-minded candidate in the last hiring process in 2015.¹⁷
The charge of “overpowered” unions is a familiar one, as it is often disingenuously levelled against real workers’ organizations. It is true that we can build power when we organize collectively—in fact, it is the only real power that we have—but workers fight asymmetrical battles against opponents with far greater wealth and militarized police forces to back them. Rather than fighting for the common good, police associations are narrowly focused on protecting their own ability to operate with impunity.
It is not enough to simply denounce and maintain critical distance from police unions. In order to defend our communities, we must challenge their base of power. In the United States, along with the call to expel police unions from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFLCIO), policy analysts have made the case for barring police associations from the right to collectively bargain.¹⁸ Others have called for limiting the scope of their bargaining to strictly wages and benefits.
The first problem with these approaches is that they aim to reform police associations when it is clear that the institution of policing cannot be fixed. The
second issue is that they require getting the state to strengthen, rather than dismantle, existing constraints within its labour laws in order to protect us from the state’s own security forces.
Instead, we should adopt the same direct approach advocated by the broader Movement for Black Lives: defund the police. Every successful effort to redirect funding from the police reduces their ranks, and in turn, the resources of police associations.
How can we prioritize life and decent work for all?
To be clear, the call to defund the police is a radical demand, in the sense articulated by Angela Y. Davis: “Radical simply means grasping things at the root.” Defunding is not a call to reform or scale down policing, which only authorizes further Black and Indigenous death at police hands, but to replace it with a completely different approach.¹
Well-meaning reformists in the labour movement argue that some members of state security forces—such as prison guards who are working-class people of colour—are also marginalized and deserve representation, even though they are complicit in perpetuating harm. Yes, prison guards do face difficult working conditions, and prisoners feel the repercussions. An abolitionist approach to “decent work for all” ensures that work is socially meaningful and life-affirming, rather than being contingent on suffering and premature death at home or abroad.
The money for a just transition is already on the table, including $15 billion per year for policing in Canada.² Right-wing governments have normalized the defunding of public services for decades while police budgets have ballooned. Unions shouldn’t be pushing to build new jails.²¹ We need to redirect our money from police, prisons, and pipelines to people and communities. As Rinaldo Walcott writes, we can invest in “communities in distress, giving them access to better housing, health care and transportation, and ownership over how conflict is managed in their communities.”²² Correctional Service Canada is the largest employer of Indigenous people in the federal public service.²³ Is that a win for employment equity or a tragic waste of human potential? Abolition is a framework that advances better futures for Black and Indigenous people than
guarding jail cells or residing in them.
At its heart, trade unionism is an emancipatory working-class movement that is necessarily anti-racist, just as it is feminist, queer, anti-ableist, anti-colonial, antiwar, and anti-capitalist. We can’t justify our collusion with state security forces by uncritically parroting the slogan “all workers have the right to organize.” This blurring of lines depoliticizes what it means to be a worker. Rather than drooling over employment growth within the prison industrial complex, our job is to end it. We must imagine, organize, and build alternatives in a spirit of abolition that will make our labour movement ancestors and descendants proud. Say it with me: Organize workers, not cops. Build communities, not prisons. Defund the police, invest in people.

## We Keep Each Other Safe

## Organizing for Prison Abolition during a Pandemic

Jessica Evans, Alannah Fricker, and Rajean Hoilett
The spring and summer of 2020 was a period of mass upheaval against criminal (in)justice systems across North America. On May 25, 2020, the public execution of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked outrage leading to weeks of mass public protest in streets across North America. In Canada, similar movements emerged in response to the police killings of Rodney Levi, Ejaz Choudry, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, D’Andre Campbell, and Chantel Moore. ¹ Led by Black and Indigenous people, these movements have generated an unprecedented challenge to police forces’ power and legitimacy, with the language of police defunding and abolition even appearing in popular media and conventional news outlets.
During this same period, given the serious potential for transmission of COVID19 in jails and prisons, discussion of decarceration (letting people serve community sentences instead of being behind bars) began to emerge.² During April and May of 2020, one-quarter of Ontario’s jail population had been released as a means of reducing the risks posed by outbreaks in carceral settings. Mass decarceration—normally claimed to be a threat to public safety—was now being undertaken in the name of community safety.³ The heightened attention to prisoners’ health and safety during this period has been unprecedented, given that prisons and jails function precisely to dehumanize those that they cage. By
rehumanizing prisoners, the pandemic has given us the tools to rethink the use of prisons in our society. The unprecedented decarceration that has taken place has shown us that the potential to realize abolition is not some far-off fantasy, but realizable in our lifetime.
Given the quick sea change in public opinion and the real possibility of mass decarceration, those of us who have long advocated for prison abolition see the present moment as an opening. The pandemic has brought with it an opportunity to push for more than mere decarceration—it has created an appetite for concretely thinking about what a world without prisons will look like. Yet, as with many political moments, there is also the danger that this awakening will disappear as quickly as it appeared—a flash in the pan of the twenty-four-hour news cycle. How can those of us committed to the work of abolition ensure that the next big news item does not bury the momentum gained over the summer of 2020? What, practically, has proven effective in the progress made, and how can we continue to build off this historic moment?
In this chapter, we reflect on our work as the Toronto Prisoners’ Rights Project (TPRP), a grassroots organization that uses mutual aid, direct action, and public education to support prisoners and promote prison abolition. In reflecting on our advocacy and organizing, we think critically about our short- and long-term strategies and offer some thoughts on how to best mobilize and build upon the work done thus far. While much of the energy in our 2020 organizing has been spent responding to specific, urgent issues, we argue that there are also lessons to be learned with wider strategic merit beyond the present crisis. Specifically, we document how the work of humanizing prisoners, elevating prisoner voices by peeling back the heavy veil of secrecy behind which prisons and detention centres operate, and mobilizing mutual aid as a means to building empathy and compassion have been, and must be, central to the longevity of our movement.

## Humanizing and Destigmatizing Prisoners

A system of so-called justice that relies on the literal caging of human beings in conditions that ensure their physical, emotional, social, and spiritual degradation can only maintain legitimacy through a complete dehumanization of its subjects.
State-sponsored strategies, supported by the media, build an image of prisoners as dangerous threats to our society. This image is often mobilized in contests of political power, as political parties vie for votes based on “tough on crime” legislation. Indeed, this strategy is so common, it has a name—penal populism. Yet, extensive research shows that the majority of prisoners are either awaiting trial and are being held on remand or have committed low-level crimes of poverty—that is, crimes of necessity.⁴ Even in situations where commissions of harm enter the realm of violence (a significant minority of all so-called crimes committed), research has shown that a lack of access to social, material, physical, and emotional supports and well-being play a significant precipitating, if not determining, factor in these stories. To humanize those subjected to criminalization and punishment, it is necessary to address narratives that deem certain acts of state-sanctioned violence acceptable, while condemning the “crimes” that are its result.
In our work as the Toronto Prisoners’ Rights Project, we have encountered no shortage of comments projecting uninformed and mythologized visions of who the “prisoner” is. These comments reveal a common public perception of prisoners as monstrous and naturally predisposed rule-breakers. We have also found that transparent information that is accessibly communicated can do a great deal to disrupt these narratives. Over the last year we have collaborated with the Criminalization and Punishment Education Project (CPEP) to produce a highly attended webinar series, Contain COVID, Not People, which brings together former prisoners, front-line workers, activists, family members, and legal professionals to dispel popular misinformation about prisons, jails, and prisoners. Additionally, we have published op-eds and reports, issued dozens of press releases, and organized press conferences to provide important counternarratives to dominant state and media discourse about prisoners.
Rather than hide this knowledge behind academic paywalls or political legalese, it is necessary to provide these essential counter-narratives through public education. Indeed, popular education initiatives lay at the core of the Black Panther Party’s successes. A growing interest in podcasts like Ear Hustle has led to substantive shifts in the de facto legitimacy often held by carceral institutions. As we move forward, it is essential that we do not create silos of knowledge and education, but continue to work with and for our communities by creating free and accessible educational resources that humanize the stories behind the numbers.

## Lifting the Veil of Secrecy

Prisons and jails, by their very nature, function to erase human beings from the physical, social, and discursive landscape of mainstream society.⁵ Indeed, it is this profound erasure that ensures that dehumanizing and violent narratives about prisoners prevail. This veil of secrecy denies any form of public reckoning with the profound violence of incarceration itself, and facilitates a comfortable ignorance or misguided belief that the basic rights of prisoners are met or that the prison itself is an institution of reform.
If the work of prison abolition requires a reversal of these dehumanizing and misleading forms of knowledge, the elevation of prisoners’ voices and experiences is an essential antidote to this problem. Information about the cruelty of incarceration rarely sees the light of day, and when it does, it is mired in the language of exceptionality. Throughout our organizing, we have used our platform to broadcast the voices of prisoners, publishing prisoner communiqués and audio recordings from inside. It is easy to disregard and dehumanize a number; it becomes much more difficult when that number has a voice, a story, and a family.
Throughout 2020 and into 2021, no fewer than eight different hunger and labour strikes were initiated by prisoners across Ontario. Often we have been contacted directly by prisoners with a request to publicize their demands and the conditions they have faced. In several instances, we have also been granted permission to record and share messages from prisoners who communicate with us by phone. These messages have been essential in breaking down public trust in carceral institutions, particularly when they come in direct contradiction with public statements from the Ministry of the Solicitor General.
For example, while news releases from the ministry have indicated that prisoners are given access to personal protective equipment, that staff comply with PPE regulations, and that new transfers are not housed with the general population until after a fourteen-day quarantine, reports from each institution have asserted the contrary. Most prisoners have reported no increase in cleaning supplies, being rarely provided masks or being made to reuse or remove them, guards
refusing to comply with PPE standards, and new transfers being immediately integrated into the general population. That these reports have come from each institution we have communicated with provides irrefutable evidence of these practices. We have seen, as a result, enormous outbreaks in correctional facilities across Ontario. Moreover, these stories also break apart the public’s faith in correctional services more broadly, and in the veracity of the information we often rely on to form our opinions on prisons and prisoners. Continuing to sustain channels of communication with prisoners and amplifying their voices, experiences, and knowledge about the day-to-day realities of incarceration will remain essential to our movement for abolition by providing important oversight and accountability of the ministries responsible.

## Building Community, Fostering Empathy

The final piece that has grown during this past year of activism, and that will remain essential if the movement for prison abolition is to sustain beyond the current conjuncture, is that of mutual aid. Inspired by the rise of mutual aid networks in response to COVID-19, TPRP created the Prisoner Emergency Support Fund in April 2020 to redistribute wealth and support to prisoners and their loved ones made particularly vulnerable during the pandemic. Working with CPEP and with the support of authors, musicians, and visual artists across Turtle Island, by September 2021 the fund had raised over $230,000 and supported more than one thousand prisoners.⁷ While the funds raised to support prisoners have been crucial, what has been most heartening is the level of community care and compassion demonstrated for prisoners who are often deemed disposable. While this project was started as a response to the pandemic, we now recognize this show of solidarity as an important tenet of our work, a means to expand membership, and a way to build bridges of trust, empathy, and care. By emphasizing the collective nature of security and accountability, the support fund has widened discussions around how our socio-economic systems themselves create and reproduce conditions of so-called criminality. Broader audiences are now finding purchase in the notion that safety takes place through the establishment of effective systems and communities of care, not as an afterthe-fact response to a lack of care.
Building off the energy and appetite for mutual aid, TPRP launched the We Keep Each Other Safe project in order to imagine and realize alternatives to police and prisons. Through this project, we mobilize existing community knowledge and resources to interrogate how a world of inclusive safety could operate, recognizing that security and insecurity are multifaceted and complex experiences. Through public forums, art and free food events, community database-building, and the development of free school community safety workshops, we are working through the practicalities of community safety from the ground up. This project contributes to broader community empathy and a recognition of the overlapping and mutually reinforcing structures that contribute to insecurity in our communities. Identifying such structural conditions of insecurity shifts focus away from individual acts of harm, and instead compels a reckoning with the sanctioned structural forms of harm from which “crime” is produced.

## An Ongoing Practice

Abolition is not a single cataclysmic moment, but an ongoing practice of mutual care, education, support, and accountability. While the events of 2020 have created the conditions of possibility for imagining the abolition of punitive justice systems, these conditions alone will not sustain our movement. If our goal is to dismantle these systems, it is necessary to dismantle the myth that prisons and police are sources of safety. By elevating the voices and stories of prisoners, pointing to the broader systemic forms of violence that render some bodies more “detainable” than others, and by fostering structures of community care, we are contributing to movements that have waged struggle against racist and colonial violence for generations. It is our collective responsibility to continue to undermine carceral punishment and build a future that we know will keep us safe.
The events of 2020 have created possibilities that for many of us existed only in our imaginations. Now more than ever, it is clear that abolition is not only possible, it is inevitable.

## Chapter 8

## Canada Is a Bad Company

Police as Colonial Mercenaries for State and Capital

## Shiri Pasternak

When Kanahus Manuel and her brother-in-law were surrounded on highway 5 in British Columbia by Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers, she experienced a terrifying moment as one officer, Bowden, slowly pulled on a pair of black gloves. “I thought he was going to kill me.” He did attack her, tackling the Secwepemc woman to the ground, forcing her face into the pavement and breaking her wrist in the process. But it would be ten hours before she received medical attention, in shackles, while eight officers guarded her bed.
The arrest was closer to an abduction than a legal procedure. On the morning of Saturday, October 19, 2019, Kanahus Manuel and Isha Jules were arrested for requesting that construction workers leave the area, where they were working on Trans Mountain pipeline infrastructure without Secwepemc consent. The workers were near a camp Manuel, Jules, and others in the Tiny House Warriors group had set up to protect the territory from pipeline construction.
When police arrived and slammed Manuel to the ground, she and Jules were told their arrest was on account of “bugging” workers. Eventually, they were charged with “mischief” and “intimidation,” but it took the RCMP almost the entire day to come up with charges. These charges were communicated to the pair’s legal counsel ten hours later from an ambulance en route to a hospital in Kamloops,
British Columbia—130 kilometres south of Clearwater—where he had been told to wait to see his clients.
If this was not an abduction, it is unclear which, if any, laws were applied to the arrest. Following their violent handcuffing, Manuel and Jules were taken to the Clearwater police station, 200 kilometres south of where they were arrested. The two-hour drive after arrest without access to legal counsel is potentially a violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. When asked why they were denied these rights, an RCMP officer advised their legal counsel that it was necessary for “officer safety” because they did not know who could be waiting for them “in the bush.”
Highway 5 winds along the North Thompson River deep within a stunning green-blue valley surrounded by the majestic Kootenay Mountains. It is unclear how an ambush might have been planned, and by whom, given that the pair themselves had been surprise-attacked by police on the side of the isolated road. Police also broke protocol by refusing to allow the pair’s lawyer or family to see them for hours, claiming the Clearwater station was understaffed, despite the frequent appearance of officers.
The normal procedure, once they had been booked, would have been to release Manuel and Jules on a “promise to appear” and conditions, by contacting the Crown counsel or justice of the peace. More inexplicable delays ensued here, as the RCMP waited until late that night to seek their remand in custody until Monday morning. Their bail hearing took place Monday morning.
What empowered the police to step in and violently arrest two people for “bugging” construction workers? A whole set of colonial laws could have justified this violence against two Indigenous people. There is a province-wide injunction to protect Trans Mountain pipeline infrastructure. There are property laws that claim to override centuries of Indigenous tenure. There are criminal laws applied to assertions of Indigenous jurisdiction. But none of these applied here.
Instead, the arrest seemed completely arbitrary, a kind of vigilante justice for interfering with pipeline construction. But if it were a “lawful” arrest, would that have made any difference in this case to Manuel and Jules? What is the difference between being above the law or an enforcer of law if your role is to uphold a colonial legal order, invented to justify dispossession?
The law in Canada followed the need to remove Indigenous peoples from their lands. The police have always played a critical role in this regard. Historically, they were invested with incredible powers that made the RCMP “virtually a separate government.”¹ Less understood is their colonial relationship to governments and corporations today.

## The Largest Theft in the World

“Canada” was a British multinational company long before it was a country. Over a third of its present-day land mass was the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC). When Canada bought the land in 1869, it established itself as the largest theft of the so-called New World.
This land of the HBC was gifted through “royal charter” from the king of England in 1670 to his cousin Rupert, thus dubbed “Rupert’s Land.” They didn’t even know the extent of the area at the time, assigning exclusive trading privileges to investors in what historians call a “parchment empire,” comprising the entire drainage basin of the Hudson Bay. Many of these same investors in the HBC also held shares in the Royal African Company, which was granted a royal charter in 1660, confirmed a few years later with a specific new provision to authorize the slave trade. Part of a global circuitry of capital financing enslavement and colonization, HBC was a fur warehouse for the British, headquartered in England while company men occupied only a tiny fraction of the lands claimed.
Rupert’s Land was governed by and belongs to the Indigenous nations that have lived there for thousands of years—like the Cree, Inuit, and Ojicree. It was never purchased, treatied, or negotiated with any these Indigenous nations. Sharon Venne, a nehiyaw (Cree) scholar of treaty rights, describes the original land grant as “tantamount to Pepsi Cola or another such company gaining title to the lands of another country merely by engaging in trading.”² As far as Indigenous nations were concerned, HBC had no jurisdiction, and neither could the British Crown authorize it.
And yet—Canada bought Rupert’s Land in 1869 for 300,000 pounds.³ The Métis, based along the Red River, went to war in 1868 to protect these territories
from invasion and their sovereignty from encroachment, delaying finalization of the sale. They faced the military, but soon they would face the police. When the sale finally went through, the land base of Canada had tripled in theft.
Established in 1873, the North-West Mounted Police (renamed the RCMP in 1920) were essentially a paramilitary police organization necessary to enforce Indigenous land removal and exercise the control required to enable settlers to take Indian lands. The problem for the new settler colonial government was that Indigenous peoples refused to give up their lands. As NahkawininiwakNêhiyawak leader Big Bear told the treaty commission in 1875 at Jack Fish Lake: “We want none of the Queen’s presents: when we set a foxtrap we scatter pieces of meat all around, but when the fox gets in the trap we knock him on the head; we want no bait. . . .”⁴ But the buffalo were nearly exterminated by the US Cavalry and starvation created a desperation on the prairies that shifted the balance of power in the west. The NWMP waged war against the Cree, Blackfoot, and Métis to clear the way for settlement; they were incompetent and brutal, but the hunger of prairie nations was on their side.
As the North-West Territories became Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the northern borders of Ontario and Quebec, Canadian policies and legislation to control Indigenous peoples became increasingly extreme and diverse. The pass system was introduced as an informal extra-legal policy to require First Nations on the prairies to obtain permission in the forms of passes to leave their reserves. Child abduction and re-education programs became mandatory at residential schools under the Indian Act. Land policies became increasingly predatory, chipping away at the land base recognized as Indigenous territories in the oral treaties made between Canada and First Nations. The NWMP were given magisterial powers, as were the Indian agents: they were police, judges, and juries. Across the country, cops and Indian agents were intertwined.
The treaties in the west made way for railroads, telegraph lines, roads, bridges, hydroelectricity, oil and gas, mineral extraction, industrialization, and agribusiness. Companies provided jobs for settlers, revenue for governments, raw materials for global markets. Lines blurred and debates erupted about the role of government in private enterprise.
But this has always been a hand-in-glove system. First, HBC colonized the country. Then colonization companies and the Canadian Pacific Railway were gifted millions of acres of discounted land to sell to homesteaders. Today, lands
are leased, sold, licensed, and permitted out by provincial governments to private companies. And Crown corporations like the Trans Mountain pipeline—bought by Canada from Kinder Morgan in 2018—directly transform Indigenous lands into resource assets.
Canada was built to colonize, and this shaped the liberal capitalist institutions of this country. Therefore, the police enact a highly racialized and territorialized dynamic of terrorizing Indigenous peoples. Not just on the side of isolated highways over pipelines, but on city streets and small towns where Indigenous peoples are deemed not to “belong” because their existence and survival challenges the ideology of conquest, removal, and dispossession.

## Canada and Corporations Today

A new motif was added to the symbols of Canada in February 2020: the burning injunction. As the RCMP invaded Wet’suwet’en lands to clear a path for a natural gas pipeline company, dozens of solidarity blockades sprang up across the country. To police this protest, provinces and companies went to court— sometimes even just phoning judges in a panic—and obtained injunctions to remove people from railway lines, transit hubs, highways, and ports.
The injunction is a legal tool to remove someone from somewhere. It’s a temporary emergency measure where the underlying legal issues are meant to later stand trial. But as an urgent action filed in court, very little evidence is needed to obtain this “interlocutory” remedy if the case for the cost of disruption is compelling to the judge. The three legal tests the judge must consider to grant an injunction are that the case must be serious, it must tip the balance of inconvenience toward the party seeking the injunction, and it must involve a matter of irreparable harm.
Almost 100 percent of injunctions filed against First Nations by corporations and governments involve resource extraction or development. In the case of corporations, they have an over 80 percent success rate at successfully obtaining them; for provinces the rate is closer to 90 percent.⁵ Each case is different, but there are trends and prevailing logics that explain this phenomenon.
The case for economic loss often seems much higher for corporations and governments because they use quantifiable financial metrics to report loss (though these figures are rarely fact-checked); the case for loss of livelihood, culture, lands, and knowledge for Indigenous peoples does not seem to register for these judges in the same way. Or judges claim they cannot adjudicate on claims of harm to Aboriginal Rights, which must be heard at higher courts.
But these successes for corporations and governments are less important if the injunctions are set on fire. Coming back to the Wet’suwet’en solidarity rallies, on Tyendinaga Mohawk territory, the injunction served against an occupation near the CN rail line was burned upon presentation. At a solidarity rail blockade in Vaughan, Ontario, the injunction was also burned upon arrival. A few days later, Hamilton blockaders burned the injunction served them too.
The trend continued a few months later in May 2020, when the chief of Tataskweyak First Nation in Manitoba ripped up and burned the injunction served to remove their blockade against the Keeyask hydro project labour force, to stop workers from travelling into their community at the height of COVID-19 spread. Images circulated on social media of a hot dog roasted on its flames.
Though I’m not sure if the Trans Mountain injunction was ever burned, it was certainly ignored. At the Tiny House Warriors Blue River camp, the word “Skoden” was spray-painted in red onto the posted injunction, which was nailed into the ground like a traffic sign. Kinder Morgan obtained an injunction on March 15, 2018, for a five-metre exclusion zone around Burnaby Mountain tank farm and Westridge Marine Terminal. It was expanded that June to include any worksite in British Columbia, and any interference with the company’s contractors and subcontractors throughout the province. Lawyers critical of the move called it “carte blanche” for the company.
A few days later, Canada announced that it had bought the pipeline. The injunction stayed in place. From the perspective of police, there was no difference between Kinder Morgan or Canada owning the pipeline. They played exactly the same role, despite the fact that, unlike corporations, governments have treaty obligations and are signatories to international human rights protocols. Police, in other words, work to protect the project. And the project— approved by governments, carried out by companies or Crown corporations—is what matters most to both.

## Beyond Injunctions

This chapter has examined how police as an institution protect a system of corporate sovereignty in Canada. As Joshua Barkan describes it, “corporate sovereignty” is the way a government expands its power through corporations. From the earliest days of contact, the Hudson’s Bay Company settled territory for England. The company was empowered to make laws and to enforce them; it preceded the state, shaped its institutions, and created its economic base. As Canada formed, police became the lynchpin in this system that tied the power of private companies to a public government. Today, the police continue to play this role, as mercenaries for a bad company.
The alleged mischief Manuel and Jules caused that led to the suspension of their rights was to tell construction workers to leave the site. They warned the workers that their actions were illegal because Canada had no consent from the Secwepemc Nation to build the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.
The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion crosses through 518 kilometres of Secwepemc land. While some bands signed rights-of-way and other agreements with Kinder Morgan (contracts that transferred to Canada when it bought the pipeline in 2018), the Neskonlith Indian Band that Manuel and Jules belong to has not consented. Nor has Canada been granted the approval by the title-holders —the Secwepemc Nation as a whole—who are the legal decision-making authority on the territory according to both the Supreme Court of Canada and Secwepemc law.
Therefore, legal uncertainty pervades the project. But law does not seem to be the prevailing logic of policing here. We are a project-driven country. It is a violent corporatism, facilitated by a violent colonization.

## Chapter 9

## A Brief Introduction to Anti-colonial Abolition

## Free Lands Free Peoples

## Justice

On January 4, 2021, over one hundred prisoners throughout Saskatchewan went on a five-day hunger strike to protest government inaction and negligence leading to COVID-19 outbreaks at jails across the province. ¹ As part of this action, prisoners engaged in a co-ordinated letter-writing campaign, voicing their concerns to government officials and calling for support from the broader public. nehiyaw (Cree) prisoner justice advocate Cory Cardinal, one of the strike leaders, published his letter to advocates in Briarpatch magazine, articulating an anti-colonial analysis of the pandemic’s disproportionate impacts on Indigenous prisoners, who make up 75 percent of the population of many prairie jails. “The current events surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak in provincial prisons is an example . . . of a 154-year-old tradition,” Cardinal made clear. “This cycle of oppression must be broken and must be recognized for what it is: a modern-day act of genocide.” ²
Anti-colonial penal abolition work in Canada recognizes the genocidal function of the Canadian “justice” system—what Métis scholar Patricia Barkaskas more accurately refers to as the “injustice system.”³ Not only is this system a direct violation of Indigenous sovereignty and inherent right to self-determination, but it is also antithetical to non-carceral Indigenous justice. The conflation of justice with punishment is pervasive throughout much of Canadian socio-political
consciousness and entrenched in all parts of the Canadian system. This largely unquestioned understanding of justice is what maintains the penal system, a central function of colonialism that separates, contains, confines, and isolates with the intent to dispossess Indigenous peoples from their lands, cultures, and communities. The practice of punitive justice in Canada precludes any state investment in true alternatives to responding to violence and “crime,” including prioritizing Indigenous justice traditions as forms of sovereign governance.
Indigenous peoples have always practised, and continue to practise, systems of justice that centre accountability through care and relationality. Indigenous justice traditions continue to evolve and be practised in response to the changing experiences of Indigenous communities. Indigenous justice systems are complex and best understood within the specificities of the regions, cultures, and peoples to which these systems belong. There are a great many knowledge keepers, scholars, and lawyers who can offer a nuanced and intricate understanding of Indigenous law, including Sylvia McAdam Saysewahum (Cree), John Borrows (Anishinabe/Ojibway), Val Napoleon (Cree), Elmer Ghostkeeper (Métis), and Leroy Little Bear (Blackfoot).
Broadly speaking, for many Indigenous peoples, law can in part be understood as a way of being that recognizes the interdependence of all of creation and the shared responsibility and obligation to be in good relations with each other. In nehiyaw justice traditions, there are “rules and laws that prescribe and proscribe conduct covering a wide range of relationships.”⁴ nehiyaw law dictates being in good relation, through principles such as “mutual respect” and the “principle of noninterference.”⁵ These laws continue to be ignored by the deliberate misinterpretation and denial of Indigenous law in the signing of the treaties. The unilateral implementation of the Canadian justice system over Indigenous justice systems is a direct violation of treaty obligations between Indigenous peoples and Canada.
Our understanding of treaty in the context of anti-colonial abolition is not simply an analysis of the legal treaties between Indigenous communities and the settler state. Rather, it is an analysis of treaties as a framework for understanding the ongoing “diplomatic practices intended to govern relationships that Indigenous peoples have practiced with other living beings since time immemorial.” However, in the context of the prairies, where our work is centred, we recognize that the numbered treaties have profound material implications for First Nations in relation to fair access to education, healthcare, resources, and the many
specific supports and jurisdictional parameters that were agreed upon. This is not to say that Indigenous communities without a treaty with the Crown should not have access to the same material resources. Rather, we see treaties as one tool to continue the work of maintaining and advancing the movement to ensure selfdetermination in all of our communities.
Importantly, we understand the legal treaties not as a surrendering of land in return for these resources,⁷ as this narrative erases the deliberate misinterpretation and outright violations of the spirit and intent of the treaties by the settler state. The one-sided narrative of the treaty process, and the complexities of how and why Indigenous peoples did or did not sign treaties, make important an analysis that understands Indigenous rights to selfdetermination beyond the legal treaties. Anti-colonial abolition considers Indigenous resistance, organizing, and self-determination outside of an analysis that binds us to the settler state and maintains divisions between our Indigenous communities. Indigenous law and justice systems exist beyond the scope of Canadian law, and they pertain to all Indigenous communities, the air, the waters, the land, and all that is of the land.
In this short chapter, we discuss how two facets of the Canadian penal system, policing and prisons, function to maintain and expand settler colonialism and support the ongoing genocide of Indigenous peoples. We argue that applying an anti-colonial lens to abolition not only allows us to elucidate how these and other co-constitutive systems of carceral control work to maintain an unbroken lineage of Indigenous dispossession at the hands of settlers and the settler state, but also opens up space to understand Indigenous resistance movements, actions, and justice traditions as potential spaces of abolitionist thought and action.

## Policing

Settler state police forces in the prairie provinces have always had the primary function of expanding Canadian control over and ensuring settler access to Indigenous lands, resources, and bodies. The policing tactics used to assert and protect white interests range from active violence against Indigenous individuals and communities to upholding broader social conditions that threaten and
devalue Indigenous lives and rights. From military or militarized actions against Indigenous groups protecting their lands and lifeways, to the public and incustody persecution and abuse of Indigenous people, to the deliberate cultures of denigration and neglect that contribute to the ongoing and barely acknowledged epidemic of lethal settler violence against Indigenous people (especially women, girls, queer, trans, and Two-Spirit people), policing in so-called Canada works not only to fundamentally suppress Indigenous political, legal, and social resistance to the ongoing ravages of colonialism, but also to undermine the survival of Indigenous peoples.
Federally, policing bodies have been created and are deployed explicitly to quell Indigenous resistance to the Canadian invasion of Indigenous lands, both historically and in the present. The North-West Mounted Police (now the RCMP) was birthed as a paramilitary force to control Indigenous movement and actions and protect Canada’s interests in the prairie provinces—a role it fulfills across the territory claimed by Canada to this day. The Canadian government has deployed its own army against Indigenous nations numerous times in order to try to suppress Indigenous territorial sovereignty. Two of the most well-known instances are the Battle of Batoche in 1885 and the Kanesatake Resistance in
## 1990.⁸

As more than just “crisis” management, federal and/or rural police also function as the primary policing forces across the vast majority of Canada’s claimed territory, with approximately 30 percent of all police officers in the country employed by the RCMP in 2019. The RCMP operates in large part, both rurally and in urban centres, as colonial ground troops tasked with maintaining a settler status quo through the anti-Indigenous violence and ongoing criminalization of Indigenous people mandated and required by the state. The sniper on the roof of the Battleford, Saskatchewan, courthouse during the 2018 Stanley trial, the RCMP pulling down the barricade and violently arresting Indigenous women at the February 2020 Wet’suwet’en blockade, and the shoddy investigating and ongoing deprioritization of the murder and disappearances of Indigenous people are not examples of flawed police work, bad apples, or bugs in the system. Rather, these examples highlight an essential mission of policing in Canada: to secure and maintain white control over Indigenous lands and resources by enacting violence against Indigenous people.¹
In urban centres, police additionally function to maintain the whiteness of socalled “public” space. Through street checks (also called “carding”) and other
forms of harassment, detainment, and assault, spaces that are nominally for the use and enjoyment of the public become sites of surveillance, hostility, and violence for Indigenous people.¹¹ To be clear, while the police operate officially as the armed guards of colonial capital in these instances, settler laypeople act to both trigger and enforce the criminalization of Indigenous people. Whether that looks like mobilizing presumptions of Indigenous criminality and degeneracy by calling the cops on Native people who make them “uncomfortable,” sharing details about “suspicious” looking Indigenous people on social media platforms like Nextdoor, mobilizing to keep their neighbourhoods free of Indigenous people,¹² or themselves committing physical violence against Indigenous people, settlers are secure in the knowledge that even if they are brought under investigation or to trial they are unlikely to experience the same intensity of
## carceral punishment as Indigenous people.¹³

Settlers are also likely to receive vocal and material support from other settlers, a trend demonstrated again and again on social media and by the huge amount of money raised on platforms like GoFundMe to support those brought to trial for violence against Indigenous people.¹⁴ Recognizing the carcerality of colonial whiteness is crucial to understanding that anti-colonial abolition requires both the dismantling of colonial carceral systems and the destruction of the white supremacist social peace that settlers have constructed through the legitimization —even valorization—of anti-Indigenous violence.

## Prisons

In his essay “Prison Life,” former prisoner Eric Young highlights the connection between prisons and the residential school system.
As a Residential School Survivor, I found living in prison to be the same as residential school. We had free meals, free clothes, and we were locked in. I was brought up in residential school, so jail was like a second home to me. . . . I guess I got used to the jail culture and learned from other inmates and from the Elders that worked in these places . . . but I also lost a lot of my own people’s teachings.¹⁵
Young’s essay pinpoints what journalist Nancy Macdonald would later suggest in a 2016 Maclean’s magazine article, that “prisons are the ‘new residential schools.’”¹ Rather than thinking of prisons as new residential schools, however, it would be more accurate to think of these institutions as existing on a carceral continuum, with each having informed and co-constituted the other. In the United States, for example, Carlisle Industrial School, one of the first residential schools, was modelled on the Fort Marion prison in Florida, where Plains Indigenous warriors were incarcerated following the so-called Indian wars at the end of the nineteenth century. Both Fort Marion prison and Carlisle Industrial School were founded by the same man, Richard Henry Pratt, an army officer who fought against the very Indigenous men he later incarcerated and attempted to “rehabilitate” from their supposed “savagery” through a regimented program of Christian education. He then turned this program of violent reform on Indigenous children, promising to “kill the Indian in the child.” We can see this same colonial impulse to reform the “savage”—now to “rehabilitate” the “criminal”—in the current penal system.¹⁷
What this history reveals is that the incarceration of Indigenous people is a mechanism of settler colonial warfare, designed to remove Indigenous peoples from their lands, nations, communities, and kin, as well as their cultures, languages, spiritual practices, systems of governance, and legal traditions. And not only in the past, but today.¹⁸ Most of us are aware of the current state of Indigenous incarceration: every year since 1960, the federal rate of Indigenous incarceration has increased by 1 to 3 percent. Indigenous people make up almost 30 percent of the total federal prison population, while making up only 5 percent of the overall population in so-called Canada, and in some places on the prairies and in the North, Indigenous people comprise between 75 and 90 percent of the jail population.¹
Some understand these numbers as an effect of structural racism within the system—in other words, discriminatory policies and practices, from hyperpolicing of Indigenous people to racist bias in sentencing, that lead to what is commonly called the “overrepresentation” of Indigenous people at all levels of the criminal legal system. The problem with the discourse of overrepresentation, as Robert Nichols argues, is that it implies that the system is working in error, when in fact, it is working as designed, to target Indigenous people and protect white property interests.² Others point to the intergenerational effects of colonial
policies and practices like the residential school system as a determining factor in the incarceration of Indigenous people. Certainly, intergenerational trauma is an important reality, but if it becomes the explanatory narrative for the “overrepresentation” of Indigenous people in prisons, it reinforces the notion of Indigenous “dysfunction” as the problem to be solved, once again positioning Indigenous people as “in need” of intervention.
An anti-colonial abolitionist perspective asks us, instead, to consider how the incarceration of Indigenous people is a strategic arm of the settler colonial project, facilitating the control and removal of Indigenous peoples from their lands. Tellingly, the rapid expansion of Indigenous incarceration in federal prisons began only in the early 1960s, following amendments to the Indian Act in 1951, including the repeal of both the pass system and the mandatory incarceration of status Indian children in residential schools.²¹ While the Canadian government ostensibly shifted toward recognizing Indigenous rights, in reality, the criminalization and incarceration of Indigenous people continued. Prisons became the new locus of containment, control, and punishment.

## Resistance as Justice

Indigenous resistance is Indigenous justice. The many movements of Indigenous peoples, such as Idle No More, Land Back, and actions like road blockades, the stopping of railway distribution of goods, encampments to care for Indigenous communities, and so on, are not simply protests to oppose the state or economy, as so-called Canada would have us believe. Rather they are embodiments of Indigenous justice in practice. The fight to protect Indigenous lands, waters, culture, language, and communities is driven by Indigenous law and the responsibility Indigenous peoples have to care for their human and other-thanhuman relatives. Resistance is not only affirming Indigenous rights to selfdetermination, but these systems of care actively resist the punitive and carceral logic that continues to justify the violence against Indigenous peoples.
The carceral continuum is maintained through the insidious implementation of laws that act to protect settler access to land and resources through the containment and punishment of Indigenous peoples. In June 2020, the Alberta
provincial government passed Bill 1, the Critical Infrastructure Defence Act, which introduces “fines of up to $25,000 on land protectors for blocking, damaging or even entering any area around a pipeline or resource development project that the government deems as ‘essential infrastructure.’ In addition to the steep fines, land defenders can also be imprisoned for 6 months for protesting and interfering in any way on public/private pipelines, oil and gas production, highways, railways and mines.”²² This ongoing criminalization of Indigenous people reaffirms that anti-colonial abolition cannot be reconciled with the Canadian state. Just as punitive justice is naturalized, so too is so-called Canada and its fraudulent claim to having ultimate and unquestionable legal extension over Indigenous lands and bodies.
It is then important as anti-colonial abolitionists to constantly be critical of the state. We must support movements and actions that are actively delegitimizing Canada and the naturalization of punitive justice that criminalizes BIPOC, migrants, poor, unhoused, and disabled people to maintain the colonial project. Through the amplification and support of systems of care being created by Indigenous peoples and allies, we actively undermine this naturalization process. Through projects, movements, and actions that place relationality and mutual responsibility to be in good relations at their core, we are witnessing the ongoing presence of Indigenous justice. Indigenous resistance to the state is part of an evolving practice of Indigenous justice. To protect the land and communities, we must move toward the creation of interdependent, community-oriented, and selfdetermined justice systems of care and accountability.

Lessons from Communities of Murdered and Disappeared Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit+ People

## Vicki Chartrand

Since the advent of modern colonialism in the sixteenth century, whereby Europeans imposed systems of governance throughout the world, a concept of justice continues to be monopolized by a “criminal” justice system. Based on utilitarian principles of just deserts and a philosophy of punishment, the system targets or abandons those who fall outside of the so-called social contract. ¹ Born of a global colonial undertaking, a criminal justice system protects a social order of white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, imperialism, and extractive capitalism. This colonial model is evident today for the murdered and disappeared Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit+ people where justice is absent, destructive, or both. ² In the face of an ongoing colonial violence that has long been veiled by the Canadian government, it is the families and Indigenous communities who continue to organize in support of the murdered and disappeared. ³
Indigenous grassroots work shows that justice is and needs many things: accountability, advocacy, and caring; celebrating, ceremony, and compassion; creating, educating, growing, healing, and helping; honouring, mourning, and nurturing; protecting, remembering, and safety; shelter, sharing, and supporting,
among many others. By considering some of the many important ways that families and communities organize to address the violence, often with few or no resources, I seek to highlight Indigenous strength and capacity and map out the many things that justice is and needs. Much of this work comes with a deep emotional, financial, personal, and spiritual hardship and loss for the people and communities involved that must be recognized, celebrated, and supported.
Searches: Constellations of Support
When communities organize in support of families who are still searching for loved ones, it is evident that justice is more than just “solving cases”; it needs to cultivate people through constellations of support. This principle is reflected in the Drag the Red! initiative, organized by Bernadette Smith and others in 2014, where volunteers came together to search the Red River of Winnipeg after a
## young Indigenous woman’s body was found.⁴

The initiative took root after the police refused to search the river, stating it would be ineffective and dangerous. As Smith tells us, there is a disconnect between the support that is needed for the murders and disappearances and what the system is able or willing to offer.⁵ To drag the river, family and community members pooled their resources to provide boats and financial support, map and navigate the river, identify bones, and offer search and rescue training. The families also developed an online Missing Persons and Persons at Risk Toolkit to help families navigate the media, build an investigation, log communications, interact with police, and learn various ways to carry out searches. The Taken Knowledge Keeper app allows users to create an album with details about their loved one and help conduct a search if a loved one goes missing; it also provides a missing-person action plan toolkit.
Other grassroots initiatives include supporting families in their searches by helping to navigate the media, showing how to build an investigation, offering accommodation, paying for hotel rooms, building banners and signs of the missing women, providing gas and supplies for searches, offering food to volunteers, raising funds, and joining in memorials and walks to raise awareness. Against the mono function of the criminal justice system—fact finding, building
cases, and securing convictions—grassroots initiatives build up community and people through constellations of support.

## Community Patrols: Safety through Caregiving

Community patrols in Winnipeg have a long history. Some of the earliest started with Indigenous women and the Native youth movement who would patrol the streets and hold vigils for the murdered and missing women in the city’s North End.⁷ Today, the Bear Clan Patrol walk the streets to provide personal security in a non-threatening, non-violent, and supportive way.⁸ Unlike the police, whose interactions with Indigenous communities often escalate to violence, the group defines its work as “community people working with the community to provide personal security.” This approach offers a visible presence on the streets in order to promote and provide safety and conflict resolution. The model now spans more than fifty communities across five provinces.
Also in Winnipeg is the Mama Bear Clan.¹ Having emerged from the Woman’s Warrior Circle, this is a group of volunteers led by women and supported by men, working at the grassroots level to (re)build community. According to the group: “We patrol the community making sure everyone is safe, this may include walking people home or to the bus stops, calling for police or ambulance if needed, sometimes we pray with people or give them a hug, it is all about building connections with the community.” In Portage la Prairie, the Women of Mother Earth Network offers a safe place to women passing through the town.¹¹ Sister Watch, in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, provides a setting where ideas and concerns are shared to make the community safer through information sharing.¹² Justice does not need security through force and containment; it needs to keep people safe through community and models of caregiving.
Marches, Memorials, Vigils: Healing Ceremonies
The number of marches, memorials, and vigils across the land known as Canada
for disappeared and murdered Indigenous women is unprecedented. One of the longest-standing marches is the annual Women’s Memorial March, first held in 1992 in response to the murder of a woman on Powell Street, Vancouver.¹³ The march is held on Valentine’s Day in the Downtown Eastside, Unceded Coast Salish Territories, and across the land, in honour and spirit of the missing and murdered and to stand in solidarity with the families who have lost loved ones.
Marches carry many significant justices: awareness, remembering, mourning, honouring, connecting, and healing, among others. They also reaffirm Indigenous presence and resurgence. Similar to the marches, vigils and memorials have also been a significant and meaningful way of keeping the spirits and stories of the women alive. These acts of remembering connect people and communities and return the spirits of women to the land and people from where they were stolen. Unlike a criminal justice system that trivializes violence and erases the murders and disappearances through cases, facts, and numbers, the grassroots create spaces for remembering and reminding us of the beauty, strength, and gifts of each woman and the value of all life.
Walks and Storytelling: Weaving Communities Together
More than just solving cases, approaches to justice need to connect families and community. From the grassroots, this is done through storytelling and keeping the stories of the women alive.
Gladys Radek is a carrier of stories.¹⁴ In her advocacy, Gladys and other volunteers have carried out five walks across Canada, each of approximately 7,500 kilometres and lasting over three months. Throughout these journeys, the walkers go from community to community sharing stories and collecting and sharing the names and images of the disappeared and murdered women. Gladys remembers hundreds of women’s stories and, as the group walks from town to town, she recounts them and posts a picture of each woman on her “war pony” (vehicle), not only keeping the stories, memories, and spirits of the women alive, but also connecting families.
Similarly, the annual Full Moon Memory Walk is a sacred memorial walk in Thunder Bay for families and friends.¹⁵ It offers prayer, smudge, walking, flag
raising, drum ceremony, healing songs, a pot-luck feast, and the burning of a sacred fire. These intimate walks and opportunities to share stories connect families and communities in their journeys of healing.

## Resource Sharing: Community Accountability

Accountability can take many forms. At the grassroots, it calls upon us in a shared and collective responsibility that seeks to grow people and build communities, rather than an individualized punishment that separates people.
Iskwewuk E-wichiwitochik (Women Walking Together) is a grassroots network in Saskatchewan that raises awareness, provides support to family members, and collaborates in anti-violence work.¹ According to the group: “We work at raising awareness and prevention through education and political action to the systemic nature of interlocking issues, such as racism, classism, elitism and colonization which contribute to violence against women; specifically Aboriginal women. We also do this work by being a network of women and groups that work with Aboriginal women.” The group centralizes the families to ensure they are supported in their work.
Kanawayhitowin, a Cree word that translates to “taking care of each other’s spirit,” is an Indigenous campaign to raise awareness about the signs of woman abuse in communities.¹⁷ Feathers for Our Women¹⁸ is a Canada-wide outreach initiative aimed toward youths to raise awareness about the murders and disappearances and violence prevention education in communities. The Highway of Tears Community Safety Toolkit also assists communities to promote safety in different ways by addressing and educating on violence and prevention.¹
Community accountability is diverse. It aims at preventing, intervening, responding, healing, strengthening relationships, building communities, addressing the conditions that allow violence to take place, and holding people accountable for that violence and harm.² In other words, taking care of each other’s spirits.

## Unearthing Infinite Justices

Many of us find it difficult to imagine what justice would look like outside of a criminal justice system. Yet for those where state intervention is either absent or destructive, it is not only possible but necessary. Grassroots initiatives to support disappeared and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit+ people emerge out of a widespread neglect and denial of justice. The initiatives outlined here are only some examples of the plethora of models of what justice is and needs when it is rooted in what communities need, rather than state-imposed. This important work highlights to us the colonial racism, sexism, and violence of our current justice orderings and reflects the range of ways we can think about and exercise justice otherwise. From the grassroots, the unearthing of justices is infinite.
Justice is and needs many things, but for it to grow, it must cultivate people, resource communities, and provide the everyday needs that will dismantle violence—basic livable income, safe and affordable housing, quality food and water, health and mental health care, meaningful employment and education, and well-funded schools and other accessible public institutions like libraries, recreational, and cultural centres. Accountability through this kind of resource sharing moves away from an individualized response toward community healing, wellness, and growth. We cannot expect communities to continue this work without resources, preparation, or support. And funding people and communities will require a defunding of the criminal justice system.

## Narratives on Carceral Abolition

## P4W Memorial Collective

## Context for the Narratives

Abolition is needed for the safety, dignity, and liberation of all. Here we present narratives about carceral abolition that three trans women who have been criminalized shared with members of the Prison for Women (P4W) Memorial Collective on the occasion of Prisoners’ Justice Day, August 10, 2020. The collective is a group of ex-prisoners from P4W, and abolitionist accomplices, who are working toward the creation of a memorial garden on the grounds of P4W in Katarokwi/Kingston, Ontario. By sharing these narratives, we seek to raise consciousness about ongoing injustices perpetrated in Canadian carceral sites, and to support resistance among people with and without experience of criminalization. Each narrative discusses the violence experienced at the hands of police, the interconnectedness with other carceral institutions such as courts and prisons, and the pursuit of abolition from a first-hand perspective that understands that criminalized trans women must be leaders within abolitionist and decolonial communities.
Trans people experience greater levels of sexual and physical violence,¹ and overwhelmingly do not find safety or dignity from interactions with police. There is a well-documented, ongoing history of police, courts, and prisons being used against queer communities in Canada.² Trans sex workers are especially targeted. Police violence against trans sex workers is firmly rooted within the context of criminalization, where sex workers are considered criminals, and within the context of transphobia, where trans people are framed as deviant.³ Further, within a colonial context, Black and Indigenous trans and Two-Spirit sex workers face additional police harassment and arrest.⁴ If imprisoned, trans people are targeted with various forms of physical, spiritual, emotional, and psychological abuse.⁵ Trans prisoners may be caged in prisons of a gender they do not identify with, placed in solitary confinement for “protection,” and subjected to discrimination, harassment, and assault.
Trans people have been speaking out about this violence for decades. Recent Canadian survey research of 2,873 trans and non-binary people reports that 73 percent of racialized trans and non-binary participants worry about being stopped or harassed by police or security because of who they are, compared to 50 percent of non-racialized participants. In the past five years, 33 percent of survey participants avoided calling 911 for police services, and 24 percent avoided calling for emergency medical services. Only one in five participants said they trusted that the police and courts would treat them fairly if they were physically assaulted, and only one in ten said they had that trust if they were sexually assaulted. Such findings are nothing new, as shared by the narrators of this chapter.
Trans people and trans narratives have faced erasure in cis-dominated communities and literature.⁷ Especially when it comes to writing about criminalization, the tendency is to reduce narratives to small excerpts that support the arguments and worldviews of generally cis, white, elite, and noncriminalized scholars. Some work can be exploitative and rely on “sexualization, voyeurism, sensationalism, and fetishization” to get its point across.⁸ Research has a tendency to bolster carceral systems and contribute to the stigmatization and distrust of criminalized people and their testimony. By presenting these narratives as fully as possible, our intention is for the message to be decided by the narrators. Each narrative was shared in an unstructured interview format with members of the P4W Memorial Collective who built relationships with the narrators. This format provides space for narrators to share life stories and experiences with less outsider imposition.¹

## Tami Starlight

I’m Tami Starlight; I’m Cree from Treaty Six originally. I’m also Norwegian, my dad’s from Burns Lake [BC]. I think for me, I came into the community as—I don’t know how to put it other than the fact that due to massive amounts of colonization and abuse, it was kind of set up for me. You know, it’s not like the education project as a colony was going to teach me that my family has been through so much trauma that I would end up a dope fiend in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver on Unceded Coast Salish. As a result of trying to come up through all that, I started really investigating deeper narratives [about] this colony on the land, and really expressed my gender and my sexuality for the next following number of years to much great delight. I ran away from home when I was fifteen and I came out west. I lived on the street and I’ve been here pretty much ever since. So that’s a pretty long time. I’ve lived in half the SROs [Single-Room Occupancies] in the Downtown Eastside, shot up drugs, done sex work, been to prison. My story is fairly well known in our community, I would say.
I think that diversity of gender is paramount. That really affirms the diversity of experience of trans, non-binary people living around the world right now. That I care, that other people care, that we’re here, that we’re fucking weird and we’re fucking amazing. A lot of us come from familial trauma, some of us have been in jail, some of us have been hardcore addicted to shit and on and on. We should be mindful of that when we are in our spaces. But I know there’s a lot of beautiful people in our community. And I do know that there’s a lot of amazing, inspiring, and important work that a lot of people have done already.
When we started CATA (Coalition Against Trans Antagonism), it was originally to address the TERFs and SWERFs that had been around, the Trans Exclusionary so-called Radical Feminists, and the Sex Work Exclusionary Radical Feminists who were totally not only infiltrating but toxifying our community, and sowing division and promoting their bullshit, white, feminist, patriarchy, supremacy ideology in our community. I believe that white supremacy is only a part of the picture. In fact what we need to discuss is the cishetero-patriarchy supremacy, that it’s all of those things. The prison system in
Canada is just another extension of the cis, hetero, white, patriarchy supremacy, and it’s a way to lock up Indigenous people. A lot of people who should be in abolition movements are not there—it’s been a problem. The John Howard Society, the Elizabeth Fry Society, they’re all Christian reformists, working with the cops. Sure, there’s some nice people that work there, but you know, I don’t like them.
The prison population in Canada is approximately 40 percent Indigenous. It’s fucking ridiculous, it’s just the new reservation system. The only reason I believe in prisoners’ rights is because I also believe in harm reduction. Because I really don’t believe prisons should exist at all. So I believe that notion is a form of harm reduction, that prisons should be abolished, they should be dismantled and have all the materials—possibly, if anyone even wants that material—to be reconstructed into actual social housing at low barrier. With that said, I’ve been to Fort Saskatchewan provincial jail, where they actually had a working gallows back then. Literally that was probably just a few years before they closed it and turned it into a goddamn museum.
I think about the urgency and the immediacy and the downright diabolicalness of the cops, the carceral industrial complex. I really believe they need to be abolished. It’s because it’s a growth industry, it’s just a capitalist gong show. They’re constantly looking to write shit down, constantly looking to interview people and pointing their finger out at wherever. They’re constantly looking to engage with the clueless fucking public so they can continue to rack up their stats so that they’re needed. You can literally be swearing at somebody and they’re going to walk up and start writing shit down. Cops are diabolical lying sacks of shit. Let’s be clear. There’s nothing good about any of them. Don’t be fooled. They’re there to bump their stats up so they can hire more people. Period. Whatever it is: drug war, somebody yelling, violence on the street, whatever it is.

## Moka Dawkins

Right now I’m associated with Not Another Black Life, Black Lives Matter, PASAN [Prisoner’s HIV/AIDS Support Action Network], Maggie’s [Toronto],
St. Stephen’s [Community House, Toronto], Parkdale Queen West [Community Health Centre, Toronto], a lot of community organizations and a lot of them stand for abolishing the system, period—the police. Just so everybody knows I’m Black, I’m a Scotian, my daddy’s Jamaican, but on my Scotian side I have my great-grandma, on my mom’s side, she was half Cree, half Mi’kmaq. And on my daddy’s side, one of my grandma’s parents, their father or mother I don’t know, was Chinese. So I’m BIPOC. I fully understand the struggles between each of the diversities, and sometimes when it’s combined in one, things seem to really just be over the top.
Me, myself, being diverse in cultural backgrounds and being here in Canada, I recognize that the police talk about restorative community acts, the police really mention that. But when you actually look at police, they have a problem with society in a whole, they have a problem with the LGBTQ2S+ community, they have a problem with the Black community, they have a problem with the Muslim community, they have a problem with the Asian community. They have a problem with community as a whole. We have to recognize the fact that it’s because of the roots they were formulated on. They were formulated on just disgustingness: racism, capitalism, colonialism, just self-gain. We already know that we do not prosper as a society because of self-gain. We prosper as a society because we are a community.
The root of policing is a toxic root, a colonial root, a capitalist root. At this point I’m here and I’m fighting the government. For you to even sit here and know the foundations of how this all formulated, and then you want to recognize the fact of overpopulation of Black and Indigenous people in prisons, and yet you’re still incarcerating Black and Indigenous people. You’re not even offering them a fair opportunity to bail. Just because of an accusation, just because of whatever. I feel like the justice system has let down society in a whole. The police system has let down society in a whole.
Real life, let’s strip you of your title and let’s treat you how your system treats a regular Black person. Let’s treat you how your system treats a regular Aboriginal person. And you go through it, go through it, go through the whole thing: have to sit inside and wait for trial, have to sit inside and find a lawyer who’s willing to really put it to work to back you up, who really believes. It’s not an easy thing. A lot of people plead, and a lot of people settle just because they’re tired. They’re tired. A system should never tire its citizens. A system should stand up for its citizens. And the system that we have, the whole system needs to be abolished.
Not just the police system, but every system associated with it: probation, and parole, the court system, and the court system includes the Crown attorney’s office because it’s the Crown attorney’s office who really depletes community the most and people don’t recognize that. Yes, police officers kill us—physically, police officers kill us—but the Crown attorney’s office kills us in community, kills us spiritually, kills us mentally.

## Anonymous

The discourse around abolition can forget that, if prison is going to be destroyed, it’s going to be by people who have been touched by it. It’s not going to be by the mass of people who don’t care and are content not to think about it. In prison organizing that I do, I always try to go toward the incarcerated people or the people who have been incarcerated or have families who are incarcerated rather than toward the general public, because it’s where this change is already being developed.
Where are the seeds of this? Sometimes attempts at supporting growth and political development with prisoners unfortunately ends up reproducing the dynamic of the prison itself, where it happens as a service provision model. The framework prison gives is programs. So an expert or a service provider is allowed to enter the prison under certain circumstances, and some prisoners can go and access this program that is pre-vetted and determined by the prison itself. So I would say, just finding ways to break out of that paradigm and refuse to engage with it, and finding ways to empower prisoners to do that political education work themselves and do that personal work themselves on their own terms, is one way of thinking about it.
I’d say, foundationally, what prison is for is a way of controlling and managing threats to the established order, and that can take various shapes. Oftentimes black market economics and forms of economics that happen outside of the taxable and legible economy get criminalized. So do people’s attempts at doing various kinds of street justice or dealing with things in their own way without relying on the violence of the police get criminalized. So do a whole suite of other things, and one of those things is various forms of political struggle that
are determined to break with that liberal democratic container, because one of the reasons that democracy is a resilient system for carrying out oppression and exploitation is that it contains its own critique. It has a lot of ability to suck back in the people who see the violence going on and swirl them around inside this process and use it to add to its own strength, even as it tries to flatten out the contradictions and oppressions that aren’t important to its goals at that moment. And its goals typically just involve accumulating wealth and producing inequality.
Right now at the time of this interview, we’re in the middle of a historic wave of prisoner protests happening within Ontario. There have been hunger strikes in at least four facilities in recent weeks against the intensification of conditions within prison, supposedly in response to the Coronavirus. There’ve been some inspiring gains, like prisoners in our local jail here in Hamilton, the Barton jail, were able to force the prison system to reinstate visits and to discard certain premade meals that were being considered especially objectionable. That is a huge win. I think it also is understanding that we’re in a moment when there’s going to be repression, and I think that’s true on the outside too. Struggles go through crests and troughs, and sometimes when a struggle’s at its highest moment, people think it’s going to go on forever and our power’s just going to keep growing. But actually when you’re at the top of that peak, it’s actually when you’ve started to already come down, and that process of descending, of decreasing support, also means increasing isolation for the most active elements. So I think it’s time for us to begin paying even closer attention to what’s going on inside and not being content with these gains we have made, and actually watching for what happens next because the repression is coming.
These three narratives make it clear what police and the overarching carceral system can mean to trans people. Policing and imprisonment present suffering and deadly consequences. Instead of reform, abolition is needed for the safety, dignity, and liberation of all.

## Toronto Sex Workers Resisting Carceral Violence

## The Front Lines

Sex workers are on the front lines of struggles against police violence because our communities are ground zero for violent encounters with cops. The criminalization of our work moves the state to invest in and expand policing technologies to track, surveil, detain, and disappear us. ¹ The loss of friends, family, and colleagues to gender-based violence and police brutality; the loss of our workplaces to gentrification; the way criminal laws and local bylaws force many sex workers underground and into unsafe working conditions; the funding cuts to sex-worker-led organizations providing harm reduction supplies, outreach, and advocacy for sex workers; and increased government funding and visibility to faith-based “exit” programs characterizing all forms of sex work as inherently exploitative: all of these things undermine sex worker justice movements by dismissing the growing call for the decriminalization of sex work in Canada and our demand for labour rights and bodily autonomy. Sex workers are on the front lines of struggles against police violence and violence within progressive movements because our survival depends on it.
In a local context, sex work is heavily stigmatized both by law enforcement, sex work exclusionary feminists, and faith-based organizations looking to “rescue” us. In Toronto, police, local bylaw enforcement officers, and the criminal justice system play a key role in disappearing sex workers and other populations deemed undesirable to the state, including poor and working-class populations, homeless communities, and drug users. For sex workers specifically, our work, our bodies, and our existence are criminalized and then we are systematically removed from communities. We are disproportionately targeted and surveilled, threatened and harassed, ticketed, fined, detained, and deported by the state. We are also propositioned, taken advantage of, raped, and murdered by law enforcement with little to no recourse. While many sex workers can speak to very intimate experiences of police violence, it’s important that we expand our understanding of what violence looks like to account for the erasure and dismissal sex workers face from agencies purported to “serve and protect” our communities—from state agencies to non-profit organizations and grassroots collectives.
The Toronto Police Service has a long history of targeting and brutalizing local sex workers. From entrapping, ticketing, and arresting street-based sex workers in the downtown east end to “undercover operations” meant to trick, trap, and manipulate sex workers in local strip clubs and massage parlours, to major events like the co-ordinated bathhouse raids of the 1980s. The policing of sex work as well as sex, sexuality, and sexual expression in queer and trans, Black and Indigenous communities of colour (QT/BICOC) is central to the aggressive policing strategies we see in Toronto’s downtown east end. Toronto police target local bathhouses, gay clubs, well-known strolls, and adult entertainment venues with a clear goal of shutting these spaces down. Developers, political leaders, and people with means seize these opportunities to tear our buildings down and replace them with high-rises, condo-security teams, and new local economies that price us out of our homes.
In some sense the Toronto police do exist to “serve and protect”— they just don’t exist to do those things for us. They exist to serve and protect the capitalist state: wealthy residents, new developments, and private property. To add insult to injury, our communities have largely been excluded from progressive movements challenging such issues as police violence, gentrification, and gender-based violence due to the stigma surrounding our work. We believe that there is no meaningful resistance to police violence, racial capitalism, and the carceral state that excludes sex workers, as our communities so often bear the
brunt of this violence.
Maggie’s Toronto Sex Workers Action Project, situated in Toronto’s downtown east end, is one of Canada’s oldest sex-worker-led organizations.² We exist in the heart of Toronto’s most rapidly gentrifying community and, as an organization run by and for local sex workers, see first-hand the degree to which Toronto police terrorize our communities. In the last three decades, we’ve watched the police presence in our communities increase as a new wave of gentrification displaces low-income residents.³ From physical police presence to the policing practices of bylaw enforcement officers, transit fare inspectors, local condo boards, private security forces, and neighbourhood associations, policing has been used strategically in our community to clear out homeless communities and encampments, and poor and working-class sex workers, to make way for local “revitalization” efforts. This is displacement framed as neighbourhood “improvement” and “development” projects.
The Policing of Sex Work and the Deviant/Victim Dichotomy
The tactics of policing and criminal justice are uniquely applied to sex workers. As erotic labourers, our work is both criminalized and heavily stigmatized (framed as “degrading,” “dirty,” “dangerous,” and harmful to community safety and development) by political leaders, lawmakers, and the public. Overpolicing, racial and social profiling, police brutality, assault, and arbitrary arrests and detentions disappear sex workers each day. At the same time, harmful laws that criminalize sex work in Canada only justify a further expansion of these carceral systems and policing technologies. Ironically, the criminal justice system and the tactics used to police sex workers are often characterized as a form of “rescue” and “saviourship,” while pushing sex work to the margins, forcing us further underground and preventing us from asserting our rights in the workplace. This is strategic framing that the state uses to regulate intimacy, transactional sex, and erotic labour. It’s deeply harmful to our communities, as it strips us of agency and the ability to assert our rights as workers.
This framing is entrenched in Canada’s federal response to sex workers through Bill C-36, The Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act (PCEPA),
introduced by Stephen Harper’s Conservative government in 2014 after Ontario sex workers Terri Jean Bedford, Amy Lebovitch, and Valerie Scott successfully launched a constitutional challenge to strike down anti-prostitution laws.⁴ After sex workers successfully convinced the Supreme Court that Canada’s anti–sex work laws infringed on our charter rights and exposed us to further risk, the federal government came back with a new set of laws explicitly criminalizing clients, advertisers, and third parties, while framing sex workers as “exploited victims” in need of “protection” and sex work as a threat to our communities.
Under this legislation, sex work and by extension sex workers are depicted both as exploited victims and deviant threats to our surrounding communities. Ignoring the work of the sex worker justice movement—our demand for decriminalization, dignity, and workplace protections—and continuing to conflate sex work and human trafficking undermines work to support victims of trafficking and prevents sex workers from demanding better working conditions. From criminal laws surrounding our ability to (1) advertise our services and effectively screen, (2) communicate with clients, (3) secure safe indoor workspaces, and (4) live off of the income we make from work, to local bylaws used to push sex work out of public spaces—the impact of morality-based regulation (and how these harmful laws are enforced by police) endangers sex workers by driving our work further underground.⁵
From the targeted harassment of street active sex workers in Toronto’s downtown east, to Toronto police running undercover operations in strip clubs and massage parlours to coerce and entrap sex workers, police violence and the criminalization of our work is a major source of fear for many sex workers. The realities of this violence are disproportionately felt by Black and Indigenous sex workers, queer and trans sex workers—particularly trans women of colour, migrant sex workers, homeless sex workers, and street active sex workers. The power dynamic is something officers make clear to sex workers while patrolling local strolls, strip clubs, and massage parlours. Our experiences of physical and sexual violence from police officers are a terrifying reality—coercion, rape, and sexual violence to avoid tickets, fines, physical violence, and abuse.
The violence and erasure our communities experience is complex, ranging from overt forms of physical and sexual violence at the hands of local police, online doxing and harassment under the guise of “surveillance,” to the casual dismissal sex workers encounter with police, healthcare workers, social workers, and others when seeking out supports. We risk losing civilian jobs and education
once outed, as well as our relationships with friends and family, housing, custody of our children, even our status. Violence and erasure go hand in hand. The criminalization of our work contributes to the stigma and to degrading public narratives targeting sex workers. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Toronto Mayor John Tory made a number of targeted remarks about sex workers and local strip clubs as super-spreaders, while it was local bars, restaurants, and casinos that reported outbreaks at record rates. The myth that sex workers are not only a security threat but also a public health risk has increased police presence in our communities, justified shutting down our workplaces, and contributed to public narratives that sex workers are “dirty” and “dangerous” and must be removed from communities. One key consequence of this precarious position is that our communities have had to openly challenge this hostile framing, advocate for our right to the city, and develop vast mutual aid networks and support systems at the grassroots level. But when pursuing justice for our people, we’re often left without meaningful support from the state and local progressive movements.
When Sex Workers Go Missing, Who Responds?
In July 2017, a valued friend and Maggie’s community member disappeared. Alloura Wells, a young Black and Indigenous trans woman, had been an active member of our community at Maggie’s, participating in our weekly drop-in programming. When Alloura stopped attending drop-in sessions and our street outreach teams weren’t able to connect with her, her absence was felt. The importance of community spaces for sex workers became clear as our space at Maggie’s became a place for friends and family to connect over Alloura’s disappearance and co-ordinate next steps. Maggie’s staff and long-time trans rights activist Monica Forrester began connecting with local shelters, hospitals, jails, and police to express concerns over Alloura’s disappearance. Monica had known Alloura since she was seventeen years old, and was aware that Alloura was facing increasing challenges in finding affordable housing and employment —barriers that are all too common for Black and Indigenous trans communities due to rampant anti-Black racism and transphobia.
At the time of Alloura’s disappearance, she was living between friends’ places
and encampments along the Rosedale Valley and the Don River Valley. When Alloura’s father contacted Toronto police to report her missing, he was told the case wasn’t high priority. Specifically, Toronto police told him that people like Alloura are “transient . . . they disappear and reappear all the time.” Police did not follow up and actively refused to file a missing persons report in July when she was initially reported missing. It was in this moment that our community at Maggie’s decided to take action and find Alloura.

## The Search for Alloura Wells

Between July and November of 2017, Monica and our community at Maggie’s launched a series of search parties, vigils, and demonstrations in her name. We took it upon ourselves to do this work because local police were so quick to mock and dismiss Alloura’s case. They cited her homelessness and her background in sex work, and discussed her “lifestyle” choices in thinly veiled, dismissive remarks that are all too familiar to sex workers looking to be taken seriously by law enforcement, political leaders, and other social service sectors.

When the federal response to sex work frames us as both exploited victims and active threats to the moral fabric of our communities, we find ourselves in a frustrating position where police are quick to mobilize around our presence— clearing us out of local strolls, ticketing and fining us at massage parlours and strip clubs, even booking and arresting us after physically and sexually assaulting us—but refuse to respond when we go missing or report violence.
What they didn’t count on was our collective power.
They didn’t anticipate how persistent we were, how sex workers were quick to call out their degrading remarks and mobilize on our own. They didn’t anticipate that sex workers would be able to shape public opinion and make direct appeals to the public for support. We descended on the downtown east, leaving flyers at local shops, bars, restaurants in the Church/Wellesley village, posting notices around Allan Gardens, Riverdale Park, and throughout the Rosedale Valley. We organized public search parties, calling on more privileged sex workers, our allies, and media to help us find Alloura and see for themselves how Toronto police were so quick to dismiss the disappearance of a friend and valued community member. We appealed to anyone with information to come forward directly to community advocates. Alloura’s family and friends came together to demand the Toronto police take the case seriously and invest time and resources into finding her—at the very least, open a missing persons investigation. But we also sent a clear message that in the absence of this time and attention from law enforcement and local political leaders, we’d do it ourselves.
Our weekly search parties grew quickly. In the first week, three of us from Maggie’s did a walk-through of Alloura’s last known location. In the weeks following, dozens came out to support the search, including local media outlets wondering why community members had to organize search parties over the well-resourced Toronto police. Search parties brought together friends, family, and broader communities—from other sex workers and activists to members of
the public shocked by the lack of response from local police and political leaders. While we shared a collective sense of solidarity and commitment to demanding justice for Alloura, the mood at search parties was one of overwhelming frustration, sadness, and grief. The days were long, often running more than eight hours, and required a lot of climbing, crawling, sifting through trash, and trips through the Rosedale Valley and the Don River Valley. With every discovery—from boots to clothing to friends who saw her before her disappearance—we spent a great deal of energy holding out hope. Our search parties often began and ended in tears.
On November 6, five months after her initial disappearance, Toronto police caved to public pressure and issued a missing persons report. A short while later a community member, Rebecca, contacted Maggie’s with news that she’d discovered a body in the Rosedale Valley and contacted police. The police did not issue a news release when the body was reported and did not release details to the public, as they normally would. Their spokesperson at the time maintained that they did this to gather evidence so that they could appeal to the public for assistance. Rebecca followed up multiple times with Toronto police to learn about developments, even reaching out to The 519 community centre on Church Street, who promised to have staff investigate. The 519 did not follow up with Rebecca or our community.

After seeing media coverage about search parties for Alloura, Rebecca reached out to us at Maggie’s directly. Despite Alloura’s father’s attempts to issue a missing persons report much earlier on, heavy news coverage of Alloura’s disappearance, and a community member notifying The 519, we had not been informed about this key development by police in the months of back and forth. Only after following up with police about Rebecca’s discovery did they agree to retest DNA and, on November 23, identified Alloura’s body. Police maintain that the cause of death can’t be determined, but estimate she died sometime in July.
Alloura was twenty-seven years old, and to this day we remember and honour her as someone with a big heart who cared deeply for the people around her and fought to live her life.

## Honouring the Life and Legacy of Alloura Wells

Maggie’s and Trans Pride Toronto organized a vigil for Alloura’s family and friends, and later a public memorial. The service took place at Sanctuary, a community drop-in space in the heart of the city. Around thirty people gathered in a circle around the memorial, as Alloura’s father spoke alongside Monica and Alloura’s old classmates, friends, and co-workers. It was a space to mourn her passing and to remember the joy she brought into the lives of so many. We did this because Alloura deserved to be remembered as the light that she was for our community. She deserved a memorial that allowed friends and family to truly honour her life, mourn her passing, and say goodbye in peace.
Sex Workers Resisting Police Violence: A Question of Life and Death
When we talk about the impact of the criminal justice system, and the impact of experiencing police violence and being dismissed or disappeared by these systems, sex worker movements often find a lot of affected friends, family, and community organizing for justice while grieving the loss of loved ones. Too often we are forced to step in to demand justice for ourselves and our networks because no one else will—not police or lawmakers, not politicians and local councillors, and certainly not social service organizations caught up in bureaucracy or grand visions of “saving” us. Closure for people who knew Alloura Wells was something we were adamant about because her life mattered to us. In the midst of a legal system that criminalizes, violates, and discards sex workers, every move to interrupt and disrupt that process is an act of rebellion. Refusing to rest until we got answers on Alloura’s disappearance was an act of resistance and survival.
Following the memorial service, our work of demanding justice and a thorough review of the gross mishandling of the case by Toronto police was far from over. Alloura’s case was just one in a string of missing persons cases in Toronto’s Church and Wellesley area that police mismanaged. Other cases included the disappearance of community members Tess Richey, Andrew Kinsman, and Selim Esan. Maggie’s and the wider community’s demands for police accountability resulted in the launch of an independent external review of how local police handle missing persons cases. How police responded to Alloura’s disappearance clearly demonstrates whose life matters to the state and who police are out here to protect.
Maggie’s joined the working group to help represent the struggles of the trans and sex working community in their interactions with and efforts to gain assistance from law enforcement. Opportunities for our community to weigh in on police protocols are rare, and all too often tokenizing and exhausting for those who have already been traumatized by the system they are now being asked to help. The carceral system was built with the objective of disappearing oppressed groups and expanding colonial rule; it cannot be improved or reformed to support our communities. Queer and trans, Black and Indigenous communities of colour, poor and working-class populations, sex workers and drug users—we will always be targeted by a police force established to protect the rich and their property. The way forward isn’t a better police service with additional funding, more officers, or anti-racism training—it’s no police service. The way forward
looks like total divestment from a billion-dollar police force and meaningful investments in community services and social safety nets.
Little has changed since 2017 in how local law enforcement treat QT/BICOC sex workers. Our community’s well-being continues to be massively jeopardized by our criminal justice system. Overpolicing, racial and social profiling, police brutality, assault, and arbitrary arrests and detentions disappear sex workers each day.

## Sex Workers Are Central to Abolitionist Movements

We believe in abolition because we recognize that the institution of policing was conceptualized and operates with an intention to protect the wealthy, developers, and communities that thrive on the elimination of ours. Attempts to sanitize this call by asking to “defund” or “detask” police do not replace abolitionist politics or support sex worker justice movements in a meaningful way.
Sex workers have been challenging police brutality and demanding abolition for decades. From the Stonewall riots, to feminist organizing and the Black Lives Matter movement, our communities, specifically QT/BICOC sex workers, have been deeply invested in creating, building, and growing modern struggles against the carceral state. More often than not, we build these struggles locally off of our own time, energy, and resources. We take on the billion-dollar force that is the Toronto Police Service as well as multi-million-dollar “rescue” industries, using our personal resources to ensure that no one gets left behind. At Maggie’s, we began street outreach in the early 1980s, using dollars from sex work to fund safe sex and drug use supplies for communities in Toronto’s downtown east. That program continues nearly forty years later, providing sex workers with harm reduction supplies in a moment where crises around housing, homelessness, and overdose deaths converge. We refuse to let our communities be disappeared through police violence and the criminal justice system, just as we refuse to let our communities be disappeared through the violence of poverty, capitalism, gentrification, and displacement. We disrupt those processes through our outreach and harm reduction work, through extensive mutual aid networks, campaigns for decriminalization, and individual advocacy for sex workers in our
communities.

Our communities have led key struggles—even within progressive organizing spaces—to ensure that Black sex workers, queer and trans sex workers, streetbased sex workers, incarcerated sex workers, and other oppressed groups facing criminalization and stigma are truly represented in modern movement building. We know that no one is free until those most oppressed in our communities are free, and we bring that energy into local struggles for racial justice, gender justice, queer and trans liberation, feminist organizing, and abolition.
When we call for the abolition of police, we call for the abolition of all carceral frameworks—a criminal justice system targeting our communities based on morally charged views of sex and sexuality; a prison industrial complex that disappears our communities and inflicts lasting, intergenerational trauma; a social service sector built on the politics of “rescuing” sex workers over listening to our communities. All of these industries work in tandem and further extend colonial, white supremacist politics. As movements for abolition and Black liberation enter mainstream discourses, we must recognize these struggles as a direct response to deeply traumatic histories of violence and genocide that have systematically terrorized Black and Indigenous communities.
The rise of Black liberation movements in response to the brutal killings of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, and local cases of anti-Black violence against Andrew Loku, Jermaine Carby, Dafonte Miller, and Regis Korchinski-Paquet have resulted in the mainstreaming of calls to “defund the police” with the ultimate goal of law enforcement abolition.⁷ We cannot let calls for abolition be walked back into more palatable discourses that push for slight “defunding” and “detasking” efforts. In our city, Black people are twenty times more likely than white people to be killed by police. Abolition is the only way forward because police are killing us, prisons are disappearing us, and our city is increasingly displacing and disposing of poor and working-class communities. For our people, this is a question of life and death. We call for the total abolition of carceral frameworks and investment in,
by, and for projects that empower us to live on our terms.
Sex worker organizing against police violence is a key element in struggles against carceral frameworks. The criminal justice system looks to disappear sex workers: arresting and charging us, deporting us, violating and silencing us, and dismissing these experiences. Our organizing in response to direct experiences of police violence and the casual dismissal of sex workers who have gone missing, who have been murdered, or who survive and attempt to report experiences of abuse is a form of rebellion. Toronto police tried to disappear Alloura; we refused to let that happen. The sex worker justice movement must find support from other local movements calling for racial justice, migrant rights, prison abolition, and gender justice because sex workers find themselves marginalized in each of these spaces and routinely excluded from progressive movement spaces.

## Our Promise to Sex Workers: Until We Win

Our commitment to sex worker justice means that we are dedicated to responding to state violence, social exclusion, and oppression within our communities. We will not let any single sex worker experience the violence, intimidation, and brutalization of our criminal justice system alone. We challenge this oppression while celebrating our collective power and resilience. We build community, supports, and dedicated sex worker spaces that celebrate and empower our communities. In doing this we assert our right to life and our right to the city.
Not only are sex workers resisting police violence in our communities on the daily, but we are also actively dismantling, reimagining, and rebuilding a world without carceral frameworks. We are disrupting these processes with our own mutual aid networks and advocacy precisely because we have been so heavily targeted by the state, social service sectors, and progressive movements. We’ve turned this dispossession into a global movement for sex worker justice, and we will endure until all of our people are free.
We’d like to dedicate this chapter to the life and legacy of Alloura Wells as well as Monica Forrester and Aanya Wood, who have all been instrumental in sex worker organizing in Toronto. We also dedicate this chapter to sex workers we’ve loved and lost; those who were taken from us too soon; those who continue to struggle, fight, and survive; and sex workers everywhere who have organized for human rights, dignity, and social justice in their communities.

## Easy Steps to Defunding the Police!

Realize and tell all your friends that policing makes our streets less safe, and that this disproportionally hurts members of our communities who are already bearing the brunt of unjust systems.
Research where your local police service gets its funding. Look at their annual budget and reporting (they have to report it).
Think of ways to encourage the general public to avoid giving their monies to the local police services.
Reach out to local groups working against police brutality, for abolition, and against white supremacy to see what they’re up to. You are not alone in this.
Set the date, time, and place. Make the direct-action magic happen! Create a witty press release and let everyone on social media know!
Celebrate every victory!
The Sex Workers of Winnipeg Action Coalition (SWWAC), a volunteer collective made up of sex workers, activists, and other allies, advocates for the decriminalization and destigmatization of sex work and for improvement in the lives and working conditions of sex workers. SWWAC first came together in opposition to Bill C-36 (Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act) in 2014, and has been active ever since. More recently, we joined our voices to those calling for the defunding of the police and held an action during the summer of 2020 to take some funds back from law enforcement.
Sex Workers Want to Defund the Police Too!
If you’re new to the issue, you might be thinking, “Why do sex workers care about defunding the police so much?” Let us tell you why!
Sex workers care about safer streets. We oppose all forms of exploitation and believe that individuals should feel empowered to set the terms under which they will part with or receive money in exchange for services. We were therefore distressed to learn how callously the Winnipeg Police Service (WPS) exploits
Winnipeg drivers!
Would we go so far as to call WPS “predators” or “victimizers” who lurk in the bushes with their moose-sized radar machines waiting to extract a disproportionate fee from drivers in radar traps? We would. We are. This must stop.
As Winnipeggers, we are all in this together. The city’s cowardice in failing to control the expansion of WPS means that we citizens all suffer. Every day, some drivers pay with their wallets. Sex workers in Winnipeg, and beyond, are victimized by the police in so many other ways.
Policing puts sex workers at real and serious risk. Criminalizing sex workers’ clients directly endangers us, putting us at heightened risk of unwanted sexual contact and even sexual or physical assault. The dangers caused by the overpolicing of sex work are compounded for sex workers of colour, and we join with our allies who decry the long history of racist and biased policing, and who advocate for the significant and immediate redirection of funds away from policing in favour of community-led safety initiatives.
As we have publicly expressed in the past, SWWAC does not partner with the Winnipeg Police Service and is not included in the WPS’s Counter Exploitation Unit claims that they partner with “sex trade workers themselves” to fight street prostitution.¹ SWWAC’s goal is to make things safer for all sex workers. Criminalizing and arresting those who buy sex, as Winnipeg police currently do, puts sex workers at risk. Any legal framework that criminalizes either the selling or buying of sex puts those who sell sex at risk, especially if they really need the money.
For example, criminalizing sex workers’ clients endangers sex workers by pushing both indoor and outdoor workers to negotiate client services in very generalized or coded language to avoid catching police attention. Without clear communication about services being negotiated, serious misunderstandings can happen. At best, this puts sex workers at heightened risk of unwanted sexual contact for all people involved and/or unsatisfied clients who won’t or don’t pay. At worst, such miscommunications can result in sex workers being sexually or physically assaulted. In contexts where police are tracking potential clients—by patrolling streets, for example, and watching or following cars—street-based sex workers experience pressure to quickly get into clients’ cars, or to quickly move
to more secluded and poorly lit areas to negotiate transactional terms—practices that can be life-threatening. As we have argued on our website:
Fewer clients for sex workers—whether because clients are scared away or arrested by police—leaves sex workers with fewer options in terms of who they do or don’t see. It’s not like sex workers’ bills and other expenses go away just because some clients have gone, or been arrested and taken away. This means that those who really need the money are more likely to take on clients they wouldn’t normally see, or agree to services they wouldn’t normally offer. This very much increases risks of violence and poor mental health for sex workers.
Sex workers are experts in street safety, and we know just what to do: Just slow down, Winnipeg. And then, defund the police.

## “Just Slow Down” Action

In the midst of a pandemic and a wave of outrage at the ongoing police violence disproportionally affecting BIPOC and other historically oppressed communities, one SWWAC member decided that it was time to take things into our own hands and keep the money in communities and away from police services. After all, sex workers from those communities are also disproportionally affected by policing and police surveillance.
It came to our members’ attention that a surprisingly large amount of money comes to WPS through photo speed limit enforcement. In 2019 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Treaty One territory, much of the revenue of the WPS—$13 million— comes from photo enforcement of speed limits. A June 2020 CBC article highlights that “out of more than 900 locations legally eligible for enforcement, 15 locations repeatedly account for about 70 per cent of tickets” and that some of these locations are not necessarily related to the stated goal of promotion of pedestrian safety around schools, playgrounds, and construction sites.² That same article points out that, while Manitoba Public Insurance reported 1,500
pedestrian collisions between 2015 and 2019, the city’s most enforced location only had seven reported pedestrian injuries in that time period. Additionally, profits from the photo speed limit enforcement program flow directly into WPS revenues. Therefore, any reduction to the revenues coming from photo enforcement program would directly reduce WPS funding.
With this in mind, we decided to organize a direct action to mitigate the risks for fellow Winnipeg drivers. We reached out to other local groups who share our views around the harms of policing in our city, researched which cameras bring in the biggest payday for the police, created some colourful signs, and made the action happen!
Nobody wants to get a ticket and have to contribute to the bottomless pit of police expansion. For our action we decided on a “picket line” of signs and people just before the camera, drawing attention to the active camera ahead. We were careful to choose a location that brings in a lot of funds to the WPS and that isn’t associated with a significant number of pedestrian collisions.
This action was important to SWWAC because it was a way to reframe how sex workers interact with the media and the public. Mainstream and social media coverage tends to focus on violence against sex workers, conflation of sex work and human trafficking, and other tired narratives that generally place sex workers and sex work organizations in the position of having to react to these stories.
Sex workers are often considered by society to be one of the causes of unsafe streets and communities. This action had us framing our own narrative; who gets to claim to make streets safer, who gets to march the narrative forward and interact with social media and mainstream media first, and who gets to flip the script on tag lines and slogans usually reserved for “law and order” types of campaigns. Posters displaying the words “Sex Workers for Safer Streets,” “Slow Down for the Sake of the Children,” and “Sex Workers for Public Safety” caused many honking horns and double takes from passing cars and got encouragement from residents!
This action also painted sex workers in a much different light than the usual stock image of a thin woman, wearing high boots and a short skirt, leaning into a vehicle. (We hope this model signed a per-use agreement with the image agency!) Sex workers are viewed as not contributing to the community but as
making communities unsafe. This action flipped that narrative by having sex workers and allies on the streets midday, wearing everyday clothes and concerned with everyday activities, like not driving unsafely and getting a traffic ticket during a pandemic.
The Sex Workers of Winnipeg Action Coalition is made up of very careful and responsible drivers. Contributors to this chapter were SWWAC members Mareike Brunelli, Claudyne Chevrier, Jonny Mexico, and Craig Ross.

## Abolishing the Police to Defend Sex Workers

Police present a grave danger to sex workers’ safety, rights, and freedoms. Here are the top four reasons why we must defund and abolish the police to defend sex workers:
Police are a danger to sex workers first because sex workers are multiply marginalized people who routinely experience policing as oppressive and abusive, inside and outside of the sex industry. Sex workers are typically some combination of poor, working class, migrants, racialized, Indigenous, disabled, transgender, gender non-conforming, or people with prior convictions. Police are never good for these communities; selling sex only exacerbates the dangers presented by the policing of marginalized communities.
Police are a danger because they exercise broad discretionary powers upholding laws and policies that discriminate against sex workers and create conditions for harm and violence against them. For example, police enforce criminal laws and city bylaws that criminalize the provision of housing to sex workers and to their support services or security, and they enforce laws that restrict sex workers’ control over their ability to clearly communicate their services and limits, their ability to work together for safety, and so on. Police use racial profiling to determine which neighbourhoods and businesses they will surveil and investigate for sex work activity and to determine what constitutes “suspicious activity.”
Police commit harassment and physical and sexual violence against sex workers, they steal from sex workers, and they refuse to help sex workers who are in need of protection. Police can get away with abusing their power because of sex workers’ status as criminalized people and because they are from marginalized communities.
Police are a danger to sex workers because they work closely with border security agencies and other law enforcement to further punish workers by threatening their migration status.

## The Criminalization of Sex Work and Police Power

First, let’s talk about the laws that the police and other law enforcement officials are mandated to uphold. The state criminalizes sex workers through the Criminal Code of Canada, municipal bylaws, and immigration regulations. Taken together, these laws and regulations define sex workers as “criminals” and manufacture sex workers’ vulnerability to violence. Canadian laws like those introduced through the 2014 Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act turn sex workers’ practical safety measures into criminal acts. PCEPA makes it illegal for sex workers to work together and to help each other with work;
illegal to advertise the sexual services that sex workers provide (or don’t provide); illegal for sex workers to hire third parties who can provide them with a place to work, advertising, or security; and illegal for clients to hire sex workers.
The criminalization of clients prevents sex workers from screening their clients, because the client is afraid to provide their information. Clients can be an important support system to sex workers, but criminalization makes this role dangerous for them. PCEPA empowers the police to surveil sex workers’ movements and their personal devices, and to interrogate and arrest them. PCEPA forces landlords to evict sex workers if they are working at home or renting a workplace, because illegal activities are occurring. Third parties who work with (or for) sex workers, such as managers, reception, or security, are also criminalized through PCEPA.
Once sex workers have a criminal record or have been under criminal investigation, they are banned from accessing many resources and jobs. Sex workers who have temporary or permanent status lose their legal immigration status and may not be able to stay in Canada. Their movement across borders is restricted. The Canadian government prohibits migrants from engaging in any sex work—including in legal areas of the industry such as body rub parlours or strip clubs—and migrants caught engaging in sex work have been detained, abused, and deported. Many (if not most) sex workers are parents, and a conviction may jeopardize custody over their children. Laws that criminalize any part of the sex industry (management, renting space, advertising, communication) force sex work underground to avoid law enforcement detection, away from safety mechanisms, and without access to social and labour protections. This creates or worsens the conditions for discrimination and violence against sex workers.
“Anti-trafficking”: The New Sex Work Criminalization
Anti-trafficking, through the conflation of sex work and trafficking, is the new face of sex work criminalization. All the laws we’ve described above, laws that penalize and endanger sex workers, are framed as necessary and moral responses
to sex trafficking. Many people have come to reject the label of “criminal” for sex workers and to question the role of the police in solving social problems. But for the past two decades, the anti-trafficking framework has served as a powerful way around those reservations that continues to legitimize and increase law enforcement power and funding, especially when it comes to migrant women from the global South. Through the anti-trafficking framework, police are framed as the heroes, saving trafficked women by arresting the “buyers and pimps.” Proponents of this ideology call it “partial criminalization,” the “Nordic Model,” or the “Equality Model.” Many sex workers’ rights groups and researchers have shown how harmful these models are to sex workers.
In reality, anti-trafficking investigations are sex work criminalization. Antitrafficking laws assume that sex work is trafficking and that no other forms of labour experience coercion or abuse. They assume all third parties who are supporting sex workers are exploitative and that they are criminal, including a manager, boss, sex workers themselves, or their family members. All antitrafficking laws contain measures that criminalize sex work. For example, hotels that are required to turn over their registration records to examine for evidence of sex work, the criminalization of housing, and the criminalization of working for or with sex workers are defined as anti-trafficking measures.
Anti-trafficking “investigations” are not rescues. They are terrifying police raids where women sex workers are racially profiled, arrested, strip-searched, detained, and deported. Some people report being physically and sexually abused and robbed by police conducting anti-trafficking raids. Butterfly: Asian and Migrant Sex Workers Support Network documented that roughly 60 percent of migrant sex workers in Toronto experienced some form of violence, the majority coming from law enforcement, including assault, sexual assault, intimidation, and theft.¹
Research conducted by the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network documented sex workers’ extensive experiences of police violence. “I got up and they started batoning me with their stupid stick thing. They end up hitting me in the leg, and they’re hitting my knees so my knees would bend,” reported one sex worker. “They came up with a warrant into my apartment, when I wasn’t there, and threw my whole place upside down. Everything was everywhere,” said another.² Some Toronto sex workers describe being taken to the Cherry Beach and sexually assaulted by police. James Fisher, a former detective constable with the Vancouver Police Department’s Counter Exploitation Unit, was honoured with a
Community Safety and Crime Prevention Award, despite having sexually assaulted a number of sex workers.³
Sun is an Asian migrant sex worker who has lived in Toronto for over five years. She was arrested, detained, and deported in an anti-trafficking investigation. Mi was suspected to be a trafficking victim in an investigation. However, she was locked up in prison for almost two months. “I was locked up by chains and weights, on my wrists and legs. I felt like I was being treated as a murder suspect. They do not allow me to make a phone call or contact other people.” The $10,000 she earned in Canada was seized by the police.⁴ In their study, Butterfly found that half of the workers in body rub and massage spas who participated in a survey on their experiences with law enforcement reported that they had been charged and ticketed for trivial bylaw issues unrelated to safety (for example, their business licensing number was not present on an advertisement), demonstrating a pattern of police harassment.
In a reflection of the racist biases throughout the criminal legal system, those charged with sex trafficking offences are predominantly people of colour and are often current or former sex workers themselves. This is because police are heavily present in racialized working-class neighbourhoods and nowhere to be seen in wealthy white neighbourhoods. Law enforcement do not conduct their anti-trafficking investigations and raids at expensive hotels where white middleclass sex workers see wealthy clients. They exclusively raid the streets, motels, apartments, and massage parlours where racialized, migrant, and poor sex workers work. Migrant sex workers come under heavy surveillance by law enforcement because they live at the intersection of multiple oppressions as racialized people, migrants, women, poor and working-class people, and sex workers.
Sex workers and their family members, friends, and romantic or business partners get charged with human trafficking because they are seen as assisting or profiting from sex, which is a trafficking offence. For example, in most jurisdictions, a sex worker who introduces her friend to a client and then takes a cut of the money that her friend earned (as a referral fee) has committed human trafficking. This has a particularly damaging effect on migrant sex workers who, because of language barriers, depend on third parties to help them do their work. But often police consider the support network around migrant sex workers, including their co-workers, friends, and family, to be an “organized crime ring” and subject them to police surveillance, arrest, and deportation. For example,
when one migrant sex worker was found dead, instead of investigating the reason for her death and the history of violence from her abusive partner, her friends who came to her help were investigated by the police.⁵
Anti-trafficking Organizations and Their Boys in Blue
The advocacy of the anti-trafficking industry has directly contributed to the increase in law enforcement harassment and abuse of racialized and migrant sex workers. The anti-trafficking non-profit industry (including churches and NGOs), which is aimed at ending sex work, provides moral justification for police, whom they frame as their “partners.” These organizations serve as the “eyes and ears” of police, collecting information on sex workers and providing it to police, often covertly and without consent. By conflating sex work with trafficking, anti-trafficking organizations can generate hundreds of thousands of “potential victims” and provide a financial justification for their own budgets and for expanded police and border security budgets.
Many anti-trafficking organizations are actually anti–sex worker organizations. They are mainly led by the white women and Christian evangelicals who advocate for repressive laws and policies and increased policing of migrant sex work. Within a decade of the creation of the anti-trafficking industry, sex work organizations in the global South began sounding the alarm that their lives and livelihoods were endangered by this new kind of policing being called “antitrafficking.” Despite this, the anti-trafficking industry has enjoyed two decades of explosive growth in funding, power, and credibility. This has led to a dramatic increase in sex work criminalization, the investment of billions of dollars in policing and border security, and with that, an increase in police abuse. Meanwhile the very real and urgent demands of sex workers, such as for human, labour, and migrant rights, are discredited and opposed.
The Canadian Centre to End Human Trafficking has received over $14 million from Public Safety Canada to develop a national anti-trafficking hotline. Like many other anti-trafficking programs, the centre engages in sex worker surveillance or collecting data that it provides to state authorities. Most of the anti-trafficking programs include accessing excessive information about working
in the sex industry. Some organizations are founded largely with the purpose of collecting data for law enforcement or government, or they informally share information with law enforcement. For example, one of the major goals of the Canadian Centre to End Human Trafficking’s hotline is information, data, and statistics to share with the Ministry of Public Safety. This puts sex workers who disclose information to the hotline, without knowing that it may be shared with law enforcement or other governmental agencies, at risk. Anti-trafficking organizations want their work to sound helpful, but it is never harmless to collect information and supply that information to police.
Anti-trafficking organizations not only collaborate with police, they are also police advocates and champions on the political stage. When sex workers come together to demand changes that would reduce police power, decriminalize sex work, or repeal discriminatory and dangerous regulations, anti-trafficking organizations are front and centre, fighting to defend or expand police power. For example, in many holistic centres and body rub parlours, massage workers are prohibited from locking the doors to their treatment rooms, so that bylaw officers can conduct investigations at any point and ensure that none of the staff are being trafficked. There is no evidence of trafficking in the massage parlours in Toronto, and no other body workers are subject to these invasive rules that grant the police the power to barge into a massage room, unannounced. Only massage workers, who are almost entirely migrant women, must work with their doors unlocked “for their protection against trafficking.” The results of this policy are horribly predictable. Massage workers are targeted by predators and thieves who know that these workers cannot lock their doors. According to Butterfly’s research, massage workers in Toronto report on average one instance of sexual or physical violence per week.
Massage and holistic workers have been building their power, fighting back, and demanding the right to safety measures like locking their doors. In 2019, over two hundred massage workers from across Toronto joined together in a campaign to reduce law enforcement power, harassment, and abuse at their workplaces. An unprecedented organizing win in Canada, it was the result of years of patient and skilful outreach and base building within migrant spas and massage parlours. Instead of supporting these workers, well-funded antitrafficking organizations rose up to oppose the workers’ campaigns. In the name of “ending human trafficking,” they pushed for the city to strengthen and expand police powers over massage workers, demanding even more bylaw investigations and calling for all massage parlours to be shut down entirely,
something that would eliminate thousands of jobs for migrant women.
Anti-trafficking organizations in Toronto have successfully pressured the city to increase investigations of holistic centres, which are mainly run by Asian workers. In response, the number of bylaw inspector visits to holistic centres increased by 212 percent between 2013 and 2016. During the same period, visits to individual holistic practitioners increased by 323 percent. Around four hundred holistic centres were investigated over 4,300 times in 2016, comprising almost 20 percent of all bylaw investigations for the entire city.
Anti-trafficking organizations and activists claim that collaborating with police to end sex work is good for society, because it will prevent sexual exploitation and human trafficking.⁷ In reality, they are covering up their anti–sex work, antimigrant, and racist agenda. The harmful global impact of anti-trafficking organizations has been extensively documented by sex workers’ rights organizations for the previous two decades.⁸ Decades of research and our own extensive experience with sex workers in Canada and internationally has shown us that sex workers who are facing coercion and violence are harmed, not helped, by policing—and this includes anti-trafficking policing.
The anti-trafficking industry relies on the same racist stereotypes about sex workers and people of colour as the police do. They both tap into centuries-old racist stereotypes about sexually predatory Black and Indigenous pimps; unscrupulous, thieving Asian organized gangs; and naturally submissive Asian women. The police and anti-trafficking organizations repeatedly promote the idea that people of colour are the real danger—not the state and not a lack of rights, money, or power. The anti-trafficking industry uses racism to claim the moral authority to make key policy and legal decisions about sex work and present themselves (and their “police partners”) as the benevolent solution.
The anti-trafficking industry does not address the root sources of coercion, wage theft, or violence in the sex trade, such as poverty or the lack of rights and protections. Its ultimate goal is not to protect women from violence. If it were, the state would choose evidence-based human rights policies that increase sex workers’ power and have been shown to increase access to safety and justice for sex workers, such as the inclusion in labour health and safety policies and the right to unionize. For example, in New Zealand, where sex workers (except for migrants) are decriminalized, workers are covered by labour health and safety protections and are able to defend themselves against abuse. The safest sex
workers are those with the least criminalization.
Strange Bedfellows?
In the name of ending sex trafficking, we have witnessed our progressive, feminist, and leftist allies suspend their principled opposition to police and unquestioningly trust the police. They quote police-fabricated statistics about the causes, nature, and incidence of sex trafficking, and they support policegenerated “solutions” such as greater surveillance and criminalization of sex work. We have watched these allies align with right-wing conservative Evangelical and Catholic organizations in their support for anti-trafficking investigations, while discrediting sex workers’ own movements for safety and justice. Too often our allies think that police are dangerous—to everyone except sex workers—and trust that police can distinguish between sex work and sex trafficking. This is naive; the anti-trafficking industry has, since its inception, deliberately conflated sex work with violence and relied on policing power over sex workers’ lives as a false solution.
We are so disappointed and angry that many feminist organizations collaborate with and even lead this oppressive approach to sex work. Organizations like the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies and the YWCA claim to be concerned about violence and fighting racism and women’s incarceration—but they have actively supported the criminalization of sex work and advocated to end sex work and eliminate sex work jobs. For example, in 2012, the Canadian Women’s Foundation lobbied the City of Toronto to increase surveillance and investigations into holistic centres and body rub parlours, which are almost entirely staffed by racialized migrant women. They argued that this was necessary to prevent sex trafficking. The Canadian Centre to End Human Trafficking, Covenant House, and an anti-trafficking initiative of religious groups called Defend Dignity also conflate holistic centres and body rub parlours with sex trafficking, and have organized a number of agencies to advocate for increased criminal charges, investigations, and other repressive laws and policies against the sex industry, including the centres and parlours.
In one of many examples, in 2016 sex worker organizations participated in the
United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. During the meeting, some of the feminist organizations, including the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action, were reluctant to include the discrimination and violence faced by sex workers in the “Violence Against Women” section. They see sex work as itself intrinsically violent, and they do not care about the actual violence faced by the sex workers. Women who choose sex work are not seen as victims worthy of protection.
The anti-trafficking industry actively works to exclude sex workers’ rights organizations from decisions that affect sex workers. For example, in 2016, the two of us were invited to speak at the National Forum on Human Trafficking. In its twenty-year history of making policy and budgets that are aimed at increasing surveillance and policing of the sex industry, the forum had never included sex workers’ rights organizations. Anti-trafficking activists screamed at us, cried, and threatened a public walkout. We were never invited to return, and the feminist organization that invited us was never asked back. The anti-trafficking industry works to discredit sex workers and their movements—including survivors of violence—as apologists for the sex industry, not as oppressed workers who are demanding and building power.
But What about the Sex Trafficking Victims?
In our justice-based approach, we fight abuse and violence against sex workers in all its forms: coercion, force, harassment, wage theft, discrimination, exclusion from public services and legal protections, and physical and sexual violence. We advocate for migrant justice, labour rights, and sex workers’ rights to right these wrongs. To this, some retort: But what about the sex trafficking victims? Sometimes people restrict their concern for those they consider “sex trafficking victims” because, as people who did not choose the sex industry, they are cast as the good victims. In the case of migrants, they are cast as the good migrants who did not willingly cross borders. But the anti-trafficking sector has little to no concern for sex workers who willingly entered the industry and are victimized by police and other law enforcement or by clients and spouses who can get away with it because of sex workers’ criminalization.
We avoid using the language of “sex trafficking” because it frames the problems that migrant sex workers face as due to sex work and migration, not a lack of power, resources, social or immigration status, and labour rights. Anti-trafficking policies do the exact opposite of what they claim. They make things worse for sex workers and they increase coercion, force, debt bondage, and violence. It should come as no surprise that the anti-trafficking industry, which promotes the criminalization of sex work, is inherently biased. We do not reinforce divisions between good/worthy “sex trafficking victims” and bad/unworthy sex workers and migrants. We call on our allies to do the same: reject the “sex trafficking” framework and embrace a justice-based approach where everyone in the sex industry and all migrants deserve rights and protections, including protection against “rescues.”

## Defund Anti-trafficking; Invest in Sex Workers

Sex workers—including those experiencing force, coercion, or violence—need justice, not policing. Organizations that support the criminalization of sex work under the rubric of “anti-trafficking” are supporting the abuse of sex workers and migrants. They must be defunded, and the portion of the billions of dollars spent on the policing of sex work be reinvested in services for sex workers. Progressives must reject the claim that police or anti-trafficking organizations who work with the police are a help to sex workers, trafficking victims, or anyone else.
We urge those who consider themselves feminists and human rights activists to stop collaborating with anti-trafficking organizations that provide surveillance and moral justification for racist police investigations into sex work. In addition to the defunding of police, we call for the defunding of all social service agencies that advocate for the criminalization of sex work. Money from antitrafficking and law enforcement agencies and their social service partners should be reallocated to services and supports for sex workers, such as income supports, help escaping intimate partner violence, and labour protections at work. These monies could also fund support and services for the communities from which migrant sex workers come: those of poor and working-class racialized and migrant people.
The tentacles of sex work policing extend into other agencies, such as immigration enforcement (Canadian Border Services Agency) and municipal bylaw enforcement. We are also calling to defund these organizations, as well as the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and jails, prisons, and immigration detention centres.
As sex work activists, we want to build sex worker power and end violence. To do that, we need to break the power of the police over sex workers’ lives and we need an investment in the services that keep sex workers strong, safe, and in control. We demand the reallocation of the power that law enforcement holds over sex workers’ lives. Support the fight by migrants in the sex trade for their human and labour rights.

## Troubling Police and Social Work Collaborations

## Jijian Voronka

Recent police killings of Black people, Indigenous people, and people of colour in Canada have resulted in reinvigorated nationwide demands to defund, dismantle, and abolish the institution of policing. Such calls to action have aligned with global anti-Black racism resistance efforts in the wake of the highprofile killings of unarmed Black residents of the United States, reignited by the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police on May 25, 2020. Despite the popular promotion of police as the “thin blue line” that protects society from disorder and chaos, most policing work centres on non-criminal matters. “Wellness checks” and other mental health interventions are a case in point. When a concerned family member or friend calls police to assist someone in a mental health crisis, arriving officers are meant to de-escalate the situation and provide support. Yet even in these instances, interactions with police can result in death.
In just a three-month period in 2020, for example, numerous people across the country who were experiencing a mental health crisis died either during or shortly after their interaction with police. On April 6 of that year, D’Andre Campbell, a twenty-six-year-old Black man from Brampton, Ontario, called 911 as he wanted to be taken to a nearby hospital for mental health support. Instead, he was tasered by two Peel police officers and then fatally shot in front of his family members. Peel Regional Police had officially partnered with a Mobile Crisis Rapid Response Team in January 2020 but did not dispatch the intervention team to the scene. One month later, on May 5, twenty-seven-yearold Caleb Tubila Njoko fell fifteen storeys from his London, Ontario, apartment balcony following the arrival of several police officers. His mother had been worried about his mental health and called 911 for help. Njoko died in hospital three days later. On May 27, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a twenty-nine-year-old Indigenous Black Ukrainian woman in Toronto, fell from her twenty-fourth-floor balcony after six uniformed officers arrived at her apartment in response to calls for mental health support from her mother. Chantel Moore, a member of the Tlao-qui-aht First Nation and mother of a six-year-old, was shot and killed by police on June 4 during a wellness check at her home in Edmundston, New Brunswick. Ejaz Choudry, a sixty-two-year-old father of four, was fatally shot by Peel Regional Police on June 20. Concerned family members had contacted a nonemergency helpline, but police arrived at Choudry’s home in tactical gear, entered through his apartment balcony, and shot him within minutes.
These and other deaths have been the focus of Black Lives Matter solidarity protests that specifically identify policing as integral to anti-Black racial capitalism, a formulation that calls attention to how racism permeates the organization and development of capitalism.¹ Here, anti-Blackness is understood as inherent to capitalist regimes, with this type of racism operating not only through intended acts of violence by police, but also through the deliberate economic deterioration and disenfranchisement of entire communities.²
One reformist strain emanating from public and policy debates surrounding the protests suggests that police should collaborate with external partners, especially social workers, in certain instances. In Toronto, for example, some are looking for police to “do better” by more regularly collaborating with mental health workers when attending crisis calls.³ Similarly, the president of New Brunswick’s Association of Social Workers, Geraldine Poirier Baiani, argues that “having social workers on staff at police departments would be ideal to assist in many situations.”⁴ We find these assertions concerning, as increasing police / social work partnerships or strengthening the powers of social work practitioners will not, in many cases, offer respite to marginalized communities.
While we do not deny the potential life-saving effects of de-escalation experts attending the scene of a mental health crisis alongside police, the purported benefits of co-operation between police and social workers (or the replacement of police with social workers) requires interrogation. First, through these kinds of collaborations, social services become further entangled in practices of criminalization and securitization that have been proven harmful to
communities. Second, police / social work partnerships can require additional resources, which runs counter to urgent calls for defunding and dismantlement. Third, like policing, the social work profession was built on colonial, racist, and classist interventions, and thus to assume it can help reform policing appears overly optimistic. Social workers, after all, were responsible for removing Indigenous children from their homes and placing them in residential schools or with white families during the ’60s Scoop, with some contemporary child welfare practices following this egregious tradition. The project to legitimize Canada as a white settler nation relied, and continues to rely, on establishing, naturalizing, and entrenching moral, legal, and carceral practices that together interlock to uphold white supremacy.
It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that social workers commonly engage in partnerships with police and thereby reduce the social conditions faced by their service users to matters of criminal justice.⁵ Further, scholarly research has shown that social workers who work with police are less likely to hold them accountable in meaningful ways. At the same time, police who collaborate with social workers are frequently touted as successfully changing the institution of policing.⁷ In this way, police are re-established as viable sources of safety and protection, while to many BIPOC communities that are regularly confronted with police surveillance, harassment, and abuse of authority, they represent the very opposite.
Police and legal systems have long depended on the collusion of more benignly positioned “helping professions” (social work, education, nursing) to extend the long arm of the law. And indeed, formalized or official police / social work collaborations are increasing in jurisdictions across Ontario, with police often positioned as the lead agency, such as rapid response crisis teams where a police officer is partnered with a social worker, nurse, or occupational therapist to attend a mental health call. Some jurisdictions, like Toronto and Durham Region, are beginning to consider or implement other models of crisis interventions that are not led by police, provided that the situation is determined to be non-violent or not a security risk.⁸ Indigenous-led crisis teams made up of culturally trained clinicians, which will replace police on certain mental health and wellness calls, are additionally being piloted in Scarborough.
Outside of Ontario, the Canadian Mental Health Association of New Brunswick has advocated for mental health workers to replace police on mental health crisis calls altogether.¹ Efforts like CAHOOTS (Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the
Streets) in Eugene, Oregon, also seek to improve the response to mental health and other non-criminal calls by sending crisis workers instead of police; in 2019, police were dispatched for backup in less than 1 percent of the 24,000 calls to which CAHOOTS staff responded.¹¹ While these measures have the potential to reduce violent situations brought on by police, more research is needed on the information sharing and accountability functions of these relationships, the resource allocation models they will follow, and how they will be implemented locally. Of major concern is that police services can decide whether or not to send a crisis team in the first place, as in the cases of D’Andre Campbell and Ejaz Choudry.
Competition over which profession—social work or policing—is the most appropriate to respond to and manage state interventions is not new. Rather, contestation over who should hold ultimate authority is ongoing, which works to shore up the powers of social work as distinctly useful in ways that other professions are not. However, white or “mainstream” social work has long been critiqued for being imbued with white supremacist and regulatory practices.¹² We, too, are concerned about the trajectories of regulation and white supremacy, as well as neo-liberal governance, that continue to underlie much social work practice, and that have been cited as further oppressing BIPOC communities. In these systems, BIPOC individuals are often made responsible for their social conditions, and the focus thus remains on punitive risk management measures, individualized rehabilitation, and minimal to no systemic change.
The widely used category of “at risk” youth, for example, is produced through policies and practices that predominantly target BIPOC young people, aimed at responding to their experiences not through structural transformation of root causes but often through punitive and responsibilizing methods of selfregulation.¹³ Within the education system, BIPOC students deemed “at risk” are frequently removed from school and placed in expulsion programs employing carceral techniques and technologies that serve to criminalize them. Ontario’s Education Amendment Act mandates suspension and expulsion programs that warehouse youth labelled “at risk” even in the absence of them committing acts warranting such consequences. These students are considered “at risk” on the basis of prediction of risk or risk read on their bodies. They are codified as “at risk” through neo-liberally inclined government, policing, and NGO mechanisms, where the deployment of this label functions to render “risk” as something within their control or inherent to them.
Social workers assigned to suspension and expulsion programs uphold neoliberal white supremacy through racist and ableist discourses that pathologize these youth, condemning them to the school’s carceral spaces.¹⁴ In these and other ways, the education system, supported by social workers, functions alongside police systems to implement punitive state measures that were built to monitor, regulate, and control marginalized peoples.
In Canada, mainstream social work practice has historical roots in white bourgeois charitable inclinations to regulate and monitor BIPOC and lowincome communities, often tied to a certain moral economy that places greater value and worth in middle-class whiteness.¹⁵ Sunera Thobani has been vocal about this racist and colonial history and its ongoing effects.¹ She suggests that mainstream social work practice began to take shape when white people, particularly women, were exalted into roles as helpers, while Indigenous peoples were effectively othered and constructed as a threat to the social order. Other scholars, too, have pointed to the unchecked racism that underlies social work practice. Harjeet Badwall, for example, has found that contemporary social work is plagued by its historical underpinnings of whiteness, with emphasis on “moral superiority, helping, and goodness” that contributes to the marginalization of communities of colour, including social workers of colour.¹⁷ Such traditions have contributed to the demarcation of white social workers as rescuers and BIPOC communities as in need of rescue or, alternatively, in need of heightened regulation for both their own and the common good.
Certainly not only moral but also material capitalist economic structures contribute to such exclusion and violence, and they are central to maintaining the racist status quo. They also operate in the opposite direction, with capitalism thriving through anti-Blackness and other forms of systemic and institutionalized racism.¹⁸ Children’s Aid Societies in Ontario, for instance, have been known to rely on class and race markers, such as purportedly unhealthy snacks or nonWestern foods,¹ while risk assessments will deem a stocked fridge and a tidy house as measures of good parenting rather than systemic privilege. Families who do not have adequate funds to cover the costs of food, housing, and utilities are more likely to have their children taken away.²
The social conditions faced by BIPOC communities due to systemic and structural failures are conveniently reduced to individualized and apolitical explanations.²¹ Collaborating with police thus further silences community demands for social, economic, and political transformation, for the allocation of
resources toward health, housing, education, and community safety, for the decriminalization of sex work and drug possession, and for the overall abolition of police and the prison industrial complex. Even outside of collaboration, however, to proffer social work as a solution to ending state and police violence conceals how the profession itself engenders capitalist, racial, and colonial logics.
Our concerns, therefore, lie not only with the collaboration of police and social work to the extent that it might further perpetuate police powers, but also in that it may simply shift power from one oppressive and regulatory institution to another. At the same time, anti-racist and anti-colonial social work practice has been made possible by Black, Brown, and Indigenous workers, and can change the mainstream white profession.²² Black social workers in the United States, for instance, have a long-standing but often silenced history of critiquing white social workers and securing programming and resources for Black communities. Racialized workers continue to challenge the colonialism and whiteness of social work through everyday practice and narratives.²³ White social workers, in particular, will need to support this work by actively challenging the powers of both social work and police, recognizing how they benefit from white supremacy and other systems of oppression and denouncing them, advocating for anti-racist and anti-colonial policies, and organizing for improved material conditions for BIPOC communities.

## A Growing Chorus

We must abolish the police. No amount of reform will transform an institution founded on the dispossession of Indigenous peoples, the overseeing of enslaved African peoples, and the forcing of workers into factories. These are the central, original, and current functions of the police. Movements that have arisen since the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis have strengthened the possibility that police abolition will become a reality in our lifetime. Some cities in the United States have already begun to make moves toward abolition. Campaigns to abolish the police are not aligned with neo-liberal attempts to abandon social goods; instead, they have pushed for a reallocation of funds from police budgets toward grassroots self-organized community initiatives.
Liberal commentators have relished the opportunity to call for funding more
social workers, mental health workers, and other “helping” professions. Professional social work associations have jumped to offer their assistance in collaborating with cops, in taking roles unsuitable for cops, and in training cops to become more “sensitive.”
We join a growing chorus of radical social workers, mental health providers, social work educators, and social service workers in rejecting the idea that professional social work is a desirable alternative to contemporary policing.¹ Professional social work has always been a part of the carceral apparatus of the state. It is intimately linked to containment, control, dispossession, and violence.² In the current era of “official reconciliation,” a response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s Calls to Action and more recently spurred by the latest rebellions for Black lives, social workers have struggled to come to terms with what abolition and decolonization look like for a profession that is intimately ensnared in the white supremacist settler colonial project.
Social workers are quick to defend our practice without carefully considering the ways in which our histories reverberate in the actions we take in the present. Many social work careers are built on the treatment of Indigenous and Black suffering, framing ourselves as innocent helpers. In the mid 2000s, INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence produced two seminal anthologies, The Color of Violence (2006) and The Revolution Will Not Be Funded (2007), that critiqued the limits of institutionalized social work and other “helping” professions to address the needs of marginalized communities and to transform society in any meaningful way. In framing helping professions (and our own complicity in working within them) as the non-profit industrial complex, INCITE! proposed pathways to liberation guided by principles of abolition, transformative justice, and community-led, non-institutional programming. In proposing to address the root structures of interpersonal violence through intersectional and collaborative movements that work across differences in power and social position, these books, derived from grounded experience and experimentation with alternatives to professional social work, radicalized an emerging generation of community-based activists who were seeking to develop new approaches to dealing with violence, trauma, poverty, and precarity.

## Social Work and the Founding Carceral Societies

The worlding of abolitionist futures is both an imaginative and a physical praxis. We want to get to a place where theory work—a commitment to understanding how carceral systems spread and operate in our society—meets ways of being in relation. When challenging carceral systems, inevitably we are confronted with the questions: So, what are your alternatives? Who will take on these roles? What systems could possibly replace prisons or policing?
Even more inevitably, social work will be offered up as an alternative. There are two reasons why social work is so easy to reach for. It is deeply rooted and entangled in settler colonial narratives of white supremacy, superiority, benevolence, and salvation that thrive in the North American collective imaginary. And it is pragmatic. Settler colonialism has been so successful in violently dismantling relationships, ravaging a plethora of kinship practices and collective organization, that this monolithic settler state service is what remains in our minds and our communities as the only possible option to control populations in upheaval. This function of social work is not only a historical practice, but a deep, sustained, and primary branch of carceral society.
In this piece, while we join our friends, families, and communities in the razorfocused call to abolish police, we also soften our gaze to see the larger apparatus at work. This is not a plea for social workers to not become police officers; it is understanding that we already are.
Much has been documented about Indigenous societies and the role of social work in the exercise of removing and replacing these structures with European peoples, communities, and practices. Settler colonialism is an extractive exercise: it extracts land, resources, humanness. These extractive processes are divisive, removing people from family, community, and creation in a way that severs the whole and violently isolates pieces for management, civilizing, or disposal. This atomization, rooted in the Cartesian individual—the (neo-)liberal belief that the individual is the primary social unit—is a kind of ontological supremacy inherent to settler colonialism.³ It then forms the lens through which life itself is viewed and from which society is organized; it determines how problems are understood and solutions are developed, and which choices are made available to our collective imaginations. Professional social work extracts the individual from a constellation of networks to put them into relation to the state, where the individual, private property, and the settler state are established
as true knowable objects, real and eternal. This is true in all realms of the profession, be they child welfare, education, housing, mental or primary health, immigration, or welfare services.
Social work with Indigenous peoples illuminates this violent displacement at the heart of carceral systems, while at the same time demonstrating how the settler state sustains itself through mediating access to resources, health, community, land, and life. New strategies, services, and systems of “care” are designed and deployed to tend to the harms of previous interventions, extending state violence across generations. Rather than narrowing or limiting the effects of settler colonial interference in our families and communities, these systems of “care” seem to multiply them. While social workers and mental health workers regularly engage in a kind of self-administered amnesty—packaging themselves as a safe space away from the harms of the world—their office is not some kind of sanctuary from carceral violence, it’s actually an expression of it. Professionalization and formalization of care plays an important and insidious role in sustaining the carceral state itself. We must interrogate the social work narrative of providing care where gaps in relationships exist. Understanding how social work works both overtly and covertly to erode and sustain our isolation is one way we can restore the relationships and ways of being with one another that these “systems of care” have sought to make unimaginable.

## More Mental Health Workers Won’t Stop Policing

The atomization and formalization of care is exemplified clearly in the carceral frameworks of mental health services. Mental health work and the broader psychiatric field are integral to the carceral system. Black people, Indigenous people, and people of colour enter the sights of the mental health field through being disproportionately diagnosed with psychiatric labels like schizophrenia, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Given the widespread collaboration between the criminal justice system and the mental health field, involvement in one increases exposure to the other.
Collaboration includes the practice of “forming,” whereby social workers and other mental health professionals may enact a police order to bring a person
involuntarily to a psychiatric facility. Social workers are also involved in administering Community Treatment Orders, which permit police intervention toward involuntary hospitalization should the person fail to follow a treatment plan. These are but a few of the mental health practices rooted in an ongoing history of white supremacy and settler colonialism.
The mental health field emerged out of the eugenics movement. One of the most prominent eugenics organizations, the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene (CNCMH), formed in 1918, is now known as the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA). A key tenet held by the CNCMH was antimiscegenation, based on fears that interracial “breeding” would lead to racial degradation and a greater prevalence of mental disorder among the population. Anti-miscegenation perspectives also influenced demands by the CNCMH for more stringent immigration controls. It was feared that immigrants would ruin Canada’s gene pool through a growth of interracial relationships that would eventually overtake “white” people through higher reproductive rates. This led to the deportation of racialized mental patients and the barring of mad people from immigration on the basis of medical inadmissibility, which included not only potential public health risks but also the likelihood to place an “excessive demand” on social services. These practices remain in place today.
Considering the mental health field’s long-standing participation in racial violence and the policing of racialized communities, we should be critical of calls to replace one institution of state violence through a strengthening of another. Instead, we should consider responses to mental health crises informed by perspectives from mad people themselves.
Mad movement activists have long called for mad literacy—a willingness to understand those whose behaviours do not conform to social norms—and skill sharing, to allow for community-driven approaches to crisis intervention not predicated on violent coercion. For example, Bonnie Burstow, the late mad movement activist and professor, suggested community befriending, a return to an emphasis on relationship building by community members to creatively support a person before, during, and after a crisis.⁴ Elements of this proposal can be seen in Toronto, where activist-led neighbourhood response groups organized in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic have served as first responders, supporting people targeted by police and white supremacists, and engaging in de-escalation of conflicts. Their objective is to serve as an alternative to calling the police and to mitigate violence.
We should also consider the wisdom shared by Onyota’a:Ka (Oneida) activist and scholar Roland Chrisjohn, that emotional distress is a social problem rooted in racism, sexism, capitalism, and colonialism.⁵ Substantively addressing this distress requires us to directly confront racial and colonial violence, including the violence perpetrated by the mental health field. It also requires a new lens of educating and training social work students.

## We Need to Transform Social Work Education

As social work educators, we attempt to demonstrate the discrepancy between the stated aim of social work practice—“to improve the lives of people”—and the outcomes—which are often “to increase harm and trauma in the lives of people.”
One of the co-authors of this chapter, MJ Rwigema, does an exercise with the social work students she teaches. She draws up a table, and as a class they list various areas of social work practice: child welfare, shelters, social services / welfare, residential mental health and addiction centres, group homes for people with disabilities, community-based organizations, immigrant and refugee services, and so on. MJ then asks students to summarize the mission or vision statement of these organizations. These statements usually offer goals (independent living, restoring dignity, recovery, gaining employment) that generally centre around improving the lives of “clients.” But if you read closely or in between the lines of most social work agencies’ mission statements, the notion of “improvement” is discursively and implicitly attached to productivity.
Many post-structural theorists have made the argument that, ultimately, social work as a field serves the purpose not of improving people’s lives but rather turning “problem people” into “preferred neo-liberal citizens.” These theorists argue that the liberal and neo-liberal discourses that permeate the values and practices of social work organizations serve to obscure the structural forces that create an underclass of citizens that is rendered into expendable labour while simultaneously being blamed for their failure.⁷
Examining “the mechanisms of power”⁸ embedded in what appear to be innocuous everyday social work practices (assessments with clients, case notes,
eligibility criteria for programs, rules for shelter occupants), students come to understand the carceral nature of the profession. Depending on the organizational context, there is some time spent on “programs”—life skills workshops, job search workshops, activities for residential clients, visits to client homes. However, as the class continues to deconstruct what both the documentation and service provision aspects of social workers’ jobs involve, it becomes clear that a significant part of such a job involves watching (surveilling) clients and making plans for clients that those clients have to follow as part of the program they are engaging in. There is often some form of coercion, through reward or punishment, that ensures that clients are inclined to comply with directives.
MJ then surveys students about the success rates for these organizations: Do they succeed in accomplishing their missions and visions? Students, after reflection, generally report that no—most of these organizations are not successful in improving the lives of program participants. Most clients do not end up with better employment or better housing. They do not fully recover from their mental health and addiction issues. Children do not end up in safer and more loving homes after being removed from their families.
“So, what happens to your clients after they leave your organization’s services?” MJ asks. Students respond either that they do not know because they do not track clients once they leave, or that ultimately clients cycle back and through services, like a revolving door. They then discuss why social work services tend toward ineffectiveness, coming to realize that much of what is called social work is in fact policing/surveilling particular groups of people: disproportionately Black people, Indigenous people, immigrants and refugees, people with disabilities, and poor people (and the intersections thereof), people who have been systematically marginalized in our societies. Rather than doing what social work promises to do in its missions and visions, social work operates as part of the system of policing the “underclass.”
This work is conducted in tandem with other “normalizing” agencies of the state, such as education, healthcare, policing, and the legal system. Social work, too, is a pipeline system that plays a role in categorizing individuals as “failures” due to personal deficit, documenting and reaffirming individual character deficits, and then laying the groundwork for criminalizing these individuals to the point of contacting the police and legal systems to complete the process.

## A Decolonizing, Abolitionist Social Work

Rejecting the practices and values encapsulated by professional social work as embedded in carceral and colonial systems, we argue for a move toward practices guided by principles of mutual aid, accountability, and relationality led by Indigenous, Black, queer/trans*, racialized, immigrant, disabled, poor, and other communities for whom social work has inserted itself into their lives.
Doing so may mean working within, against, and beyond professional social work. We must oppose any and all collaboration between social workers and police officers. We must resist the carceral functions of social workers themselves in our agencies, schools, hospitals, and community organizations. We must defy and dismantle the corporate boards and executives who control and expand the non-profit industrial complex. We must refuse to support the notion that social workers are the quick fix to bringing about a world without police.
Instead, we urge current social workers who are disillusioned with the existing carceral system to work together and mobilize in solidarity with the communities they seek to serve. We urge current social worker educators to restructure curriculums away from professionalization and toward accountability— including a fulsome understanding of the profession’s role in settler colonialism and sustaining white supremacy. If the way social work organizes itself and society is contributing to continued oppression, perhaps the key to collective liberation lies in ways of being that do not centre our relationship with the state, but instead our relationships to each other, deprofessionalizing care, promoting community, and understanding the power of neighbourhood and peer support networks. Frameworks for decolonization and abolition are emerging among many grassroots and self-organized communities, and it is imperative that we divert financial resources to them, but also that we respect their autonomy, leadership, and visions and work as accomplices to bring about the worlds we can hear through the cracks of the one we exist in now.

## We Are Like Waves

## Kikélola Roach

As unprecedented, sustained waves of mass demonstrations and rallies called for the defunding and abolition of the police throughout Canada and the United States, politicians scrambled to respond. Cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Edmonton voted to reduce their police budgets by modest amounts. In Toronto, a June 2020 motion at city council to cut the $1.2-billion police budget by 10 percent was defeated by a vote of sixteen to eight.
While record numbers of citizens watched Toronto City Council’s debate on police funding, streamed online, the mayor and a majority of councillors passed a motion to increase the police budget by tens of millions of dollars to buy and maintain police body-worn cameras (BWCs), despite there being no consistent evidence that cameras reduce police violence. This only a day after a Pride weekend rally saw thousands gather outside City Hall to demand that government act to defund, disarm, demilitarize, and abolish the police.
City council was unwilling to squarely address the heart of the demands of a growing movement calling not only for an end to police violence, but also for a massive redistribution of resources and a different conceptualization of how to create safe and healthy communities, free from poverty, homelessness, gun violence, unaddressed mental health and addiction crises, and other social ills. Instead, politicians and police spokespersons stifled the real scope and nature of the issues before them, and narrowed the demands down to a need for greater police transparency and accountability, to “restore trust” with the community at large. Questions about the legitimacy, usefulness, morality, racism, ableism, and
violence of the police were replaced with a restricted focus on issues of trust and “confidence in” the police. Politicians rushed to reassure us these latter concerns could all be dealt with handily by one new device: a police body-worn camera.
Whether the cameras would actually engender trust, end police violence, or make officers accountable seemed less relevant to councillors than what BWCs had already provided them with: a way to appear responsive to community concerns while reorienting the debate back to ground where neo-liberal “solutions” could be delivered with a tech fix.
In a 2019 article in the journal Criminology and Public Policy, researchers did a comprehensive review of seventy empirical studies on BWCs, concluding that use of these cameras has not had “statistically significant or consistent effects” on citizens’ perceptions of police or on police officers’ behaviour. Researchers at the University of Toronto found little proof that cameras increase police accountability.
Despite a lack of evidence showing that BWCs make officers more accountable or improve police relationships with civilians, Toronto purchased 2,350 BWCs, with a full rollout to front-line officers by the end of 2021, at a cost of an estimated $52 million dollars over a ten-year period. The cameras are made by Axon, a multinational corporation formerly known as TASER International, makers of “conducted electrical weapons” that fire electrically charged probes into people to immobilize them.
Today, retired police officers have found new careers as consultants and strategic advisers to Axon. They are keenly aware that notorious instances of police brutality, the work of a global Black Lives Matter movement, and greater scrutiny of government actions by the public during a worldwide pandemic have shifted the Overton window, throwing the door open to questioning the legitimacy of preserving the institution of policing as we know it. They have heard the demands to defund, to remove police from responding to mental health calls and so much more, and now they devise ways to maintain and expand police powers, presenting new technology as progress. New areas of business include implementing digital evidence management systems for police forces, with the Ontario government announcing that Axon Public Safety Canada won the contract for such a project for an undisclosed sum.
If history and other jurisdictions are guides, we can expect a hornet’s nest of
problems related to the cameras, including the following: privacy and civil liberties issues, difficulties for members of the public and media to access the recordings from the police (especially in situations of police misconduct, excessive use of force, and killings of civilians), and increased and enhanced surveillance of activists.
As the summer rolled on and abolitionists’ voices persisted, the Toronto Police Services Board carried out a series of online town hall consultations to hear from the public on “police accountability, reform and community safety priorities.” Activists saw this for what it was: an empty public relations move to pretend the police board cared about public sentiment when city council had already voted against defunding the police.
For the final day of the board’s public consultations, the No Pride in Policing Coalition organized a rally in front of police headquarters with support from the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty, Black Lives Matter–Toronto, Doctors for Defunding the Police, Not Another Black Life, Decolonize Davenport, the Indigenous Youth Encampment, Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) Toronto, and me as an educator and university Chair in Social Justice and Democracy. We took the risk of protesting during a global pandemic using precautions of physical distancing, hand-sanitizing, and mask-wearing.
With the recent death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet in the presence of Toronto officers, and the police killings of Chantel Moore, Rodney Levi, D’Andre Campbell, and many others now seared into our collective memory, we gathered to address the urgent need to put an end to police violence, to reinvest in community, and to reimagine a society where all are truly safe. This is the speech I delivered at that rally in Toronto on July 16, 2020:
Here we are again. We’re back to raise our voices. But we’re not back for a sham consultation. Our voices were loud and clear: “Defund the police by 50 percent.” A demand that is echoing across the continent. We are not here to be consulted. Stop tinkering. Stop reforming. Stop “round tables” and regressive thinking. You killed us because we were Indigenous, because we were Black, because we were poor, because we had mental health issues. You spied on / raided / jailed and beat us because we were queer, because we did not conform. You killed us when we were young, when we were old, when we were in between. We cried out and
marched and resisted. We are not here to be consulted. You consulted us before, and you produced report after report after report:

This is only a partial list! We are not here to be consulted. We’ve been consulted to death. And they told us if we hired more racialized cops, things would get better. They told us if we gave them tasers, then they wouldn’t have to kill people—then they killed Robert Dziekanski in the airport with tasers. Then they killed Rodrigo Almonacid Gonzalez, tasering him eight times while he was in his bathtub in his own home. They gave police batons and Officer Van Seters strangled Kenneth Allen to death with his baton behind 52 Division on Dundas Street West. They gave them pepper spray and police pepper-sprayed O’Brien Christopher-Reid before shooting him to death. They said they needed more training, but then Officer Andrew Doyle, who trains other police officers, killed Andrew Loku within twenty-one seconds of arriving on scene and testified under oath that if presented with the same situation again he would act no differently. Now they want to give them body cameras.
Officer Derek Chauvin didn’t need a taser, pepper spray, a baton, a firearm, all he needed was his body, his knee. And he murdered George Floyd on camera— he knew he was being filmed. The police murdered George Floyd on camera. The police killed Philando Castile on camera. The police killed Eric Garner on camera. The police killed John Crawford III on camera. The police killed Rayshard Brooks on camera. Did a police-worn body camera save James Boyd? NO. Did a police-worn body camera save Jason Harrison? NO. Did a policeworn body camera save Dillon Taylor? NO. Did a police dashboard camera save Richard Ramirez? NO.
And right here in this city: The police shot Michael Eligon to death as he was walking on Milverton Boulevard, shoeless, still in his Toronto East General hospital gown—all recorded on police dashboard camera. The police killing of Sammy Yatim on the Dundas streetcar was caught on camera and ruled attemped murder. There is video footage of police shooting into Ejaz Ahmed Choudry’s Mississauga home. The prescription of body cameras as an answer to issues of accountability is based on a wrong diagnosis: that police abuse persists because of a lack of evidence. Roxanne Carr and Stacy Bonds were physically violated
on video camera, and it wasn’t enough. Sammy Yatim died with eight bullets in his body, and it wasn’t enough. Dafonte Miller lost his eye, and it wasn’t enough.
No amount of evidence will ever be enough—because the problem isn’t an absence of evidence of police brutality, but the active production of narratives to justify it. The problem is a system that was built this way. Police forces were born out of slave patrols created to terrorize enslaved Black people into subjugation, born out of the colonial militias organized to expel Indigenous peoples off their lands. Current “reforms” amount to little more than better recording the crimes of an institution that should be abolished altogether. There was another kind of violence—caught on camera. Thousands of us tuned in and saw it. It happened at City Hall in the Council Chambers at the end of June. What these politicians have done is violent: leaving people without homes and food is violent; approving an ever-growing police budget is violent—a police budget that is the knee on the neck of our city—strangling the resources, the life out of the housing we need, the healthcare, the childcare, the free transit we need, the programs and proper social assistance, the education we need.
As long as there is government-approved violence, as long as there is government-designed violence, as long as there is government-funded violence, we will resist.
We are like waves that will keep coming back to police headquarters, to City Hall, to Queen’s Park until we wash all the hatred and indifference away, wash all the violence away, leaving only the peace and harmony we all deserve to live in. A camera can be turned on or off. But our movement, our resistance will not be switched off . . . Forever on until we are free.
A few lines in this speech are from an article I co-wrote with Azeezah Kanji entitled “Police Brutality Acquittals Show Why We Should Abolish Police,” published July 9, 2020, in the online journal Ricochet. The speech was lightly edited for inclusion in this volume.

## Police Abolition / Black Revolt

## Robyn Maynard

The lynching of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police sparked a chorus of protests that are global in scale, marked by calls for radical transformation and channelling the world toward an abolitionist future. The conditions for global Black uprisings emerge in a context of enduring anti-Black logics, the ravages of racial capitalism, and forms of surveillance and punishment that were put in place centuries ago, from which we have not yet emerged. Still, the contemporary eruption of political contestation is unidentical to, if growing out of, past generations of struggle. Against a backdrop of failed police reforms, increasingly inequitable distributions of public resources, and the vast inequities laid bare by the COVID-19 response, there has been an upsurge of widespanning forms of Black revolt: demonstrations, press releases, hunger strikes— demands on the state, against the state, and against the logics that have served to violently curtail Black life in the Americas since 1492.
If the most visible uprisings have been those against policing, the registers of Black revolt against the racially uneven proximities to death so brutally exacerbated by the pandemic have been wideranging. From spaces of confinement (jails, prisons, and detention centres) to the front lines of highly exploited essential workers, undocumented and temporary agricultural and factory labourers, contestations of differing scales, organized and informal, have permeated the landscape since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. These forms of Black struggle have dramatically spread in scale and scope since George Floyd’s public execution.
Even as economies and nations have been “closed down,” the violence of police killings has been unceasing in North America and well beyond. The deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade in the US, and D’Andre Campbell and Regis Korchinski-Paquet north of the colonial border, demonstrate that while labouring on the front lines of the pandemic, Black people are continuously outside the register of the “public” within common framings of public safety and health. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets— are still taking to the streets—across Canadian cities and towns, condemning Black expendability and demanding transformation, confronting the police and refusing the disposability of Black life.
This moment of protest and uprising, which may well become a movement, is undergirded by demands for forms of change that are substantive, transformative, and focused on shifts that veer us sharply away from the catastrophic violence of the past. The current moment refuses inclusion, refuses “equality” within the status quo and all of its attendant violences. Instead, this upswing of revolt demands nothing short of a new world. Perhaps the most visibly transformative demand has been the renewed surge of energy to defund —and abolish—the police.

## Policing Black Life in Canada

The struggle to defund the police is struggle against a form of anti-Black violence that is at once a contemporary crisis and a historical inheritance. In North America, policing emerged as and remains a form of racial, gendered, and economic violence shaped by the logics of slavery and settler colonialism. The policing of Black life in Canada is embedded in the historical development of the nation-state and its historical antecedents. The surveillance of Black movement was a facet of life within early (then) French colonies in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with Black peoples continually suspect for being possible “runaways.”¹ State and extrajudicial violence was evidenced in the public corporal punishment of enslaved and free Black peoples in the British Maritimes.² As more formal policing was entrenched, law enforcement continually functioned in order to enact and maintain racial, gendered, and economic inequality. This is evidenced, in the nineteenth century, by the policing
of Black (and Indigenous) women across Canadian cities for “vagrancy” or prostitution-related offences³ and the high arrest and incarceration rates of Black men in the twentieth century.⁴ Deeply intertwined with these logics is the historical role of the RCMP (formerly the North-West Mounted Police) as a force of quelling Indigenous rebellion, furthering Indigenous dispossession for white settlement and conquest, all the while violently suppressing emergent labour movements and their challenges to the rule of capital over life.⁵
The policing of Black life emerges from, and is endemic to, the Canadian nationstate in its very functioning. The ongoing investment in carceral and anti-Black agents of repression, an outgrowth of slavery and settler colonialism, has nonetheless taken new and more intensive forms in recent decades. An ongoing disinvestment in Black community supports, programming, education, and housing has been matched by a continually increasing scope and intensity of policing and an ongoing expansion of police and prison budgets.
The intensity and scale of policing has dramatically ramped up in the past fifty years as part of long-standing domestic warfare against Black communities. Essential to this movement was the 1980s “war on drugs,” which intensified the scope and scale of law enforcement powers over Black communities and cemented the practice of racial profiling. The effects of this escalation are visible in the dramatic rates of Black incarceration in federal prisons. At the same time, crime “prevention” relies on the policing of Black presence in public space: studies conducted in Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, and Vancouver demonstrate that Black peoples are stopped by police anywhere from two to six times more frequently than white residents.⁷ In effect, Black communities are being surveilled, harassed, and criminalized merely for existing in public.
National spending on police operations has increased steadily since the mid 1990s, reaching $15.1 billion in 2017–18.⁸ A 2013 government report noted that the cost of policing nationally had more than doubled since 1997, “outpacing the increase in spending by all levels of government,” with police salaries increasing by 40 percent since 2000 (whereas most Canadians’ salaries increased by 11 percent). Spending on anti-Black carceral controls has gone up, accompanied by a militarization of the practice of policing: the use of SWAT teams increased by 2,000 percent over the past four decades; they are “increasingly being used by public police for routine activities such as executing warrants, traffic enforcement, community policing and responding to mental health crises and domestic disturbances.”¹ For Black communities, this militarization has been
marked by at times fatal violence: Somali refugee communities have experienced raids in which they were assaulted with battering rams and flashbang devices, with elderly Somali women describing being physically brutalized —and in one instance told to “die” in the context of tactical raids¹¹—in incidents described as racial profiling and elder abuse. The death of Haitian forty-sevenyear-old Bony Jean-Pierre, in Montréal-Nord, shot in the head with a rubber bullet during a tactical squad raid in the context of drug enforcement, further illustrates that state warfare on Black communities is more than a metaphor.¹²
Reform, Defund, and/or Abolish?
The violence inherent to the practice of policing itself has been continually challenged by Black families, community members, activists, and organizers who have staged—across decades—sit-ins, tent cities, dieins, and a multitude of other tactics in defence of our lives. The major state response in the wake of Black organizing and uprisings, however, has been not only an ever-increasing budget and an ever-expanding scope of policing, but also a series of police reforms that have served only to uphold the status quo of racial violence and maintain, extend, and even expand the scope of the institution. At the municipal level, police forces have implemented “diversity” and “sensitivity” trainings, expanded the recruitment of female and “visible minority” officers, expanded police foot and bicycle patrols, hired community liaison officers, and expanded spaces for police-community dialogue. At the provincial level, one response to ongoing community protest has been the creation of civilian oversight mechanisms like Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) and Quebec’s Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), tasked with conducting “independent” investigations when the police use lethal force.¹³
From the perspective of protecting Black life, all of these reforms have been abject failures, even as they have succeeded in perpetuating the illusion of law enforcement agencies’ legitimacy and benevolence. The local reforms and increases in funding for law enforcement agencies across the country have occurred alongside an increase in the number of deaths at the hands of police, which have nearly doubled over the past twenty years,¹⁴ impacting Black and Indigenous communities most substantially,¹⁵ with broad impacts on Black
peoples, especially Black drug users and sex workers, and Black homeless and mad peoples.
With no empirical or ethical leg to stand on, calls for more police reforms at this historical juncture are morally untenable: body cameras, racial diversity in hiring, and implicit bias training are, after all, the conditions that nonetheless allowed for the public execution of George Floyd. This reality is recognized by Black and multiracial communities across North America that are now forwarding calls, not to reform or reimagine, but to defund, demilitarize, and dismantle the police—and, along the way, to reduce their scope and reverse their expansion into schooling, mental health response, and the wide arena of public and private life that have been so naturalized in recent decades.¹ These calls emerge from generations of struggle against policing, displacement, and environmental devastation wreaked by the state.
Calls for defunding the police, however, do not aim simply to combat a racist and violent institution, to cut it down to size on the way to complete elimination, though this is one core element of the struggle. The call to defund, in fact, emerges from the Black radical tradition, which has not only contested racial violence in all forms but has also been a form of world-building. Abolition, as Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Angela Y. Davis, and Mariame Kaba continue to remind us, is as much about building the conditions for safety as it is about dismantling institutions of harm and captivity, and ending racial violence in all of its forms. W.E.B. Du Bois’s Black Reconstruction details, painstakingly, how the abolition of slavery did not mean simply ending legal bondage: Reconstruction was a project (if violently aborted) that was geared toward creating a world that supported Black life, and human life more broadly.¹⁷ The more contemporary call for the abolition of police and prisons is grounded, similarly, by the call to create and sustain life-affirming conditions.
Moves to defund police—and the prisons that policing makes possible—emerge from a broader political project of divestment and of investment: a movement away from prisons and police and toward institutions and initiatives that protect, nurture, and sustain living and all of the richness of human and ecological life. The police and prison systems consume huge sums of public money; they syphon wealth out of Black and non-Black communities and deploy resources toward policing and caging those made vulnerable by the state and by statesanctioned practices. Abolition, in contrast, as Mariame Kaba notes in her historic New York Times intervention, does the opposite, building life where life
has been abandoned: “We are not abandoning our communities to violence. We don’t want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete. . . . We can build other ways of responding to harms in our society.”¹⁸ The radical implications at the core of the call to defund, indeed, make up a broader call to invest in the root causes of harm rather than attempting to use arrests and prisons to manage populations abandoned by the state: it is this that grounds calls to divert public money toward community-led anti-violence programs, support for survivors of gender-based violence, harm reduction programming, mutual aid, transformative justice, a safe supply for drug users, and the decriminalization of homelessness, drugs, and sex work—these being only a few of the worldbuilding measures invoked within its call (for Canada, see Black Lives Matter demands;¹ for the US, see #DefundPolice Toolkit). Redistributing “national” public wealth—divesting police funding and redirecting billions of dollars— marks a necessary undertaking toward ending the enduring proximity to death that is experienced by Black communities.
In Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and well beyond, in addition to pop-up marches, vigils, and occupations of police headquarters, community members are holding town halls, forwarding motions to remove police from schools, demanding cuts to bloated police budgets, and proposing “people’s budgets” and alternative forms of community safety. This organizing stems, broadly, from courageous young Black peoples risking everything for a new world, and builds from generations of radical thought, struggle, and praxis—by incarcerated intellectuals, Black feminists, multiracial coalitions of prison abolitionists, survivors of sexual violence—of everyday people desiring more than what has been offered by a morally bankrupt political class. In its best iteration, the #DefundPolice movement is nothing less than an attack on one of the most enduring forms of racial violence and anti-Black carceral controls since slavery, a rethinking of the sexual and gendered and transphobic violences at the heart of the colonial project.

## An Expansive Terrain of Abolition

As we enter the expansive terrain of a #DefundPolice era and turn toward
undermining and overturning the long-standing violences of our era, it is essential to vigilantly maintain the vast expansive possibilities—and requirements—of the project at hand. This includes forms of violence that are global in their scope: domestic policing, after all, is only one facet of the global controls that enforce the boundaries of racial capitalism and anti-Black carceral controls on a planetary scale. The demand for the reinvestment of public wealth, meanwhile, requires an interrogation into the racially uneven violences required to produce wealth in the first place, as laid out by generations of Black radicals including Eric Williams, Cedric J. Robinson, and Claudia Jones. A call to redistribute social wealth necessarily requires that we envision forms of Black liberation that are neither confined within the limitations of the nation-state nor bound within the confines of the metropole.
Defunding and redirecting: these projects demand that we reckon with the realities that “wealth,” if unevenly distributed along racial lines in North America, is also itself the product of racial violence and exploitation: capital was/is accrued from slavery and colonialism, from displacing Black and Indigenous peoples from the places they reside, from rendering Black life fungible, exploitable, disposable. This dispossession is an ongoing reality in Canada, from Wet’suwe’ten to Herongate, and well beyond the apartheid fences of the global North. Calls to defund and redirect/reinvest social wealth demand, too, that we reckon with the global delineations of racial-colonial capitalism. This, or risk naturalizing imperialism and the world-ending violence directed against Black, Indigenous, and racialized peoples globally in the name of profit. Redistribution in the context of uninterrupted imperialism, after all, amounts to little more than a more equitable division of the spoils of war, barbarism, and violence that have defined Euro–North American “civilization” for half a millennium.
The global dimensions of Black life—and the carceral and economic controls undermining life at every turn—make the terrain of abolition necessarily expansive. We will not, after all, achieve the conditions required to render Black life livable when “our” institutions, retirement funds, and investments (for those who have them) are, quite literally, premised on the destruction of Black life elsewhere, anywhere.
This quickly globalizing moment of Black revolt in the context of COVID-19 demands nothing less than a total upending of the global and enduring legacies of slavery and colonialism and the creation of frameworks for living otherwise.
As police are removed from their long-standing strongholds in our neighbourhoods, as monuments to slavery and genocide are thrown into the sea, as Cecil Rhodes falls and Leopold III is removed from his pedestal, these testaments to brutality are being exposed for the violence they celebrate, their permanence questioned, if not negated. While there are no guarantees of the future to come, the conditions for possibility of a different world are wideranging. This moment demands nothing less than a vision of abolition that transcends nation, upends empire, and overturns the epistemologies that have justified and enabled the longue durée of barbarism so consistently hidden behind the veneer of “civilization.”

Annualized over the twenty-year period of study, Indigenous people represented 4.21 percent of the population, but 16 percent of deaths at the hands of the police, while Black people represented 2.92 percent of the population and 8.63 percent of deaths. Researchers were unable to confirm the race of the person killed in approximately 25 percent of cases. Were those cases to involve a Black or Indigenous victim, these disparities could be even more pronounced.

8. Scot Wortley, Police Use of Force in Ontario: An Examination of Data from
the Special Investigations Unit, for submission to the Ipperwash Inquiry, Ontario, 1996, attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca. The SIU is an arms-length civilian agency charged with investigating incidents involving police that result in death, serious injury, or allegations of sexual assault. Between 2000 and 2006, Black people represented 3.6 percent of Ontario’s population, but 12 percent of civilians documented in SIU investigations. During the same period, Indigenous people represented 1.7 percent of the population but 7.1 percent of all civilians in SIU investigations. It should be noted here that this overrepresentation does not extend to other racialized groups, with Asians, South Asians, West Asians, and persons from other racialized backgrounds found to be significantly underrepresented in SIU cases.

9. Between 2000 and 2006, Black people were 7.5 times more likely than the
provincial average to be involved in a police shooting and 10.1 times more likely than white residents, while the shooting rate for Indigenous residents was 4.1 times greater than the white rate. Finally, the rate of shooting deaths for Black residents was 9.7 times higher than the provincial rate and 16 times higher than the rate for white people.

10. Wortley, Laniyonu, and Laming, Use of Force by the Toronto Police Service.
Black people comprised 38.9 percent of persons identified in cases that did meet
the use of force threshold required to trigger an SIU investigation. By this measure, Black people would be 4.42 times more likely to be represented in a lower-level use of force case than their representation in the population, indicating an even greater degree of overrepresentation than in SIU cases. Further, between 2013 and 2017, Black people in Toronto represented 36 percent of persons involved in police shooting cases, 61.5 percent of all cases involving civilian deaths, and 70 percent of all shooting deaths at the hands of the police.

## Chapter 12. Sex Worker Justice—by Us, for Us

1. In Are Prisons Obsolete? (Seven Stories Press, 2003), Angela Y. Davis writes,
“Prisons do not disappear social problems, they disappear human beings. Homelessness, unemployment, drug addiction, mental illness, and illiteracy are only a few of the problems that disappear from public view when the human beings contending with them are relegated to cages.” In local sex worker organizing and mutual aid work, we see that Toronto police and local government also “disappear” people in our communities by displacing us from gentrifying communities and leaving us to die.

2. Maggie’s was founded in 1986 as Peggy Miller and Danny Cockerline looked
for community support spaces for sex workers experiencing violence from the police and courts. We are indebted to the work of sex workers’ rights activists of the 1970s and ’80s for welcoming us into their movement and allowing us to extend this work into a larger movement for sex worker justice addressing all forms of oppression our communities face. We’d like to thank Chris Bearchill, Gwendolyn, Grant Lowry, June Callwood, Valerie Scott, Danny Cockerline, and
Peggy Miller.

3. Maggie’s initially opened its doors in Regent Park right at the corner of
Parliament and Gerrard Street East. We have since relocated to Richmond and Parliament and have observed rampant gentrification in Toronto’s downtown east end—most notably the ongoing “revitalization” of Regent Park that has displaced predominantly Black and brown poor and working-class communities in the area and, with new condos, brought in a greater police presence to surveil, ticket, fine, and harass local sex workers.

4. Terri Jean Bedford, Amy Lebovitch, and Valerie Scott argued that laws
criminalizing (1) communication for the purposes of selling sex, (2) operating a bawdy house—an indoor space used for sex work, and (3) living off of the avails (money, donations, favours) of sex work all infringed on sex workers’ charter rights, specifically the right to security of the person and the right to freedom of expression. Ontario courts agreed with this assessment and struck down Canada’s “Anti-Prostitution Laws.” The case escalated to the Supreme Court of Canada.

5. Sex work in Canada is currently criminalized under Bill C-36 (The Protection
of Communities and Exploited Persons Act), which claims to “protect” sex workers by criminalizing clients and third parties. While these laws continue to be used to arrest and charge sex workers, we must also stress that criminalizing any aspect of our industry endangers sex workers.

6. Monica Forrester is the founder of Trans Pride Toronto and has spent nearly
thirty years organizing for sex worker justice and LGBTQ2S+ liberation in Toronto’s downtown east. She created Maggie’s Indigenous program and hosts specific programming for Indigenous sex workers—the first program of its kind in Canada.

7. Many sex workers—particularly Black sex workers, trans sex workers,
survival sex workers, drug-using sex workers, formerly incarcerated sex workers, and those living on the streets—do not make mainstream lists due to respectability politics.

13. In both provinces, the oversight bodies have been critiqued for a lack of
independence, being staffed largely by former police employees, and marred by the fact that investigations have led to few charges, and zero or less than 1 percent criminal convictions. From when the BEI was instituted in Quebec in 2016 until 2019, it investigated 126 cases, including 71 deaths, and laid zero charges (Kate McKenna, “126 Cases and 0 Criminal Charges: Is Quebec’s Police Watchdog Doing Its Job?,” CBC News, 22 May 22, 2019, cbc.ca; see also Robyn Maynard, “Initiatives face au profilage racial,” Revue Droits et Liberté 25, no. 2 (2017), liguedesdroits.ca). In Ontario, CBC’s 2018 Deadly Force report demonstrated that over 17 years and 52 incidents, just seven Toronto Police officers have faced charges after being involved in the death of a civilian, and only one was found guilty (Trevor Dunn, “In Deadly Encounters with Toronto Police, More Than a Third of Victims Are Black,” CBC News, April 5, 2018, cbc.ca). A 2010 Toronto Star exposé uncovered a “cozy” relationship between police and prosecution, officers breaking conduct rules of investigations, and a general lack of “rigour” within investigations, highlighting that at that time, out of 3,400 SIU investigations over 20 years, criminal charges were laid in 95 cases, and 0.5 percent of officers were ever convicted (David Bruser and Michele Henry, “Are These Cops above the Law?,” Toronto Star, October 28, 2010, thestar.com).
