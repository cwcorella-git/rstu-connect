[Sample] Local Union Resolution Against the Dakota Access Pipeline
WHEREAS,
the $3.78Billion, 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline would carry over half a million barrels of dirty crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota, through South Dakota and Iowa to Illinois to connect to other pipelines bringing oil to the East Coast and the Gulf; and
WHEREAS,
the pipeline is slated to pass through the tribal lands of Standing Rock Sioux near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, and underneath the Missouri River, the main source of water for the tribe; and
WHEREAS,
the pipeline desecrates the ancestral burial grounds of the Standing Rock Sioux; and
WHEREAS,
millions of workers – including many union members – their families, and communities live in the path of the proposed pipeline; and
WHEREAS,
the transport of heavy crude is particularly volatile, leading to 18.4 million gallons of oils and chemicals spilled, leaked, or released into the air, land, and waterways between 2006 and 2014 in North Dakota alone, causing death, contamination of soil and water, and all kinds of disease; and
WHEREAS,
scientists have warned that in order to avoid wide-scale, catastrophic climate disruption, the vast majority of known remaining fossil fuel reserves must be left in the ground; and
WHEREAS,
Native American land protectors and their supporters have been brutally attacked by private security forces with attack dogs and pepper spray; and
WHEREAS,
Native Americans and other activists defending their land and water have the same right to defend their land and engage in non-violent protest as workers who are protesting the actions
of an unfair employer; and
WHEREAS,
the U.S. Congress has repealed the ban on exporting oil, meaning that the oil transported by the pipeline is likely to be sold overseas and not contribute to US energy independence; and
WHEREAS,
we know that the real threat to workers’ lives and livelihoods is catastrophic climate change; and
WHEREAS,
many large corporations, and especially fossil fuel corporations, have been putting profits ahead of the common good of workers, the public, and the environment, and these corporations have been granted the unjust constitutional rights and powers of person-hood, and the doctrine of money as speech through activist Supreme Court decisions thereby diminishing democracy and the voice and power of the people; and
WHEREAS,
numerous national and international unions have already passed resolutions against construction of the pipeline, including National Nurses United, the Amalgamated Transit Union, the Communications Workers of America, the United Electrical Workers, and others; and

## WHEREAS

, this local union is already on record supporting the development of renewable energy sources and investment in sustainable energy including quality union jobs; and
WHEREAS,
more long term good paying jobs would be created by investing in sustainable energy infrastructure projects using already existing technologies while at the same time reducing pollution that creates greenhouse gases; and
WHEREAS,
we support the rights of our union brothers and sisters building the pipeline to work in safe environments at jobs that are consistent with respect for the environment and the rights and safety of frontline communities; therefore be it
RESOLVED,
that we call upon the Federal Government to make permanent the moratorium on construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline by revoking permits for construction issued by the Army Corps
## of Engineers; and be it further

RESOLVED,
that this local union calls on the labor movement to support a just transition to a renewable energy economy and investment in the construction of a nationwide sustainable energy infrastructure that will address the growing threat of climate change and its consequent droughts, floods, fire, crop failure, species extinction and other dire consequences of global warming; and be it further
RESOLVED,
that this local union make a financial contribution of $_____ to the land protectors at the
## Standing Rock protest camps; and be it further

RESOLVED,
this local union urges its internal union and the rest of the labor movement to become actively involved in promoting a just transition to a sustainable alternative energy economy that protects the environment and respects the rights of all working people to good paying safe jobs, human rights and justice for all; and be it finally
RESOLVED,
that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the International Union and all Central Labor Councils we are affiliated, with, with a request for concurrence.
