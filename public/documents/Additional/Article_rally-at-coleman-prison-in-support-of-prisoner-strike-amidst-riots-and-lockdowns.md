The event occurred as part of a nationwide strike on Sept. 9, the anniversary of the Attica prison uprising in New York, was initially announced earlier this year by prisoners in various states, including Alabama, Ohio, Virginia, Texas.

of entire facilities in Florida have already been reported. Other state and federal facilities have reported similar situations around the country. The Coleman prison complex houses over 7,000 prisoners and is home to the largest prison factory in the entire country, primarily producing material goods such as furniture for government agencies nationwide. Federal Prison Industries, also known as UNICOR, has over $34 million in contract obligation coming out of Bureau of Prison (BOP) facilities in Florida. This is three times higher than any other state in the country. These workers are subjected to slave conditions based on the 13th Amendment of the US Constitution, which exempts prisoners of protection from slavery.

The Campaign to Fight Toxic Prisons aims to develop ties between the environmental movement and the movement against mass incarceration. The IWW is the only labor union in the country which actively accepts prisoners as members. Additional details about the demonstration can be found here, on the Facebook event page.
