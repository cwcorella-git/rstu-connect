## Preliminaries – Mainstream Political Currents in the US

## Conservatism

                  The dust had hardly settled on the revolts of the sixties before the counter-revolution began, a
               class war to ensure that in the future capitalists would control absolutely everything. This counterrevolution brought with it a new right wing ideology, to replace the traditional conservatism, an
               ideology that came to be known worldwide as neoliberalism, which was capitalism without the
               veneer, a brutal, zero tolerance capitalism. This initiative called for the privatization of everything,
               that is, ownership by capitalists and corporations. Every last thing on earth was to be turned into a
               commodity and source of profit – water, hospitals, schools, social services, parks, libraries, science,
               mass media, even war, and the government itself. Nothing public was to be left standing.
               Everything was to be sold off, and turned over to profit-taking corporations, usually at bargain
               basement prices. These policies were imposed relentlessly and successfully all over the world,
               resulting in a fabulous enrichment of the ruling class. They were also implemented domestically in
               the United States. So this is the face of modern conservatism. There remains of course a tiny
               assortment of right wing libertarians, who believe in small government, the Bill of Rights, and
               rugged individualism, but these people have no power, even though this philosophy probably
               expresses majoritarian sentiment in the US. As of 2006, capitalist domination of American society
               (the USA, that is) could hardly be more complete.

## Liberalism

                  After the New Left’s attempt (by its liberal wing) to break into national electoral politics was
               smashingly defeated in the 1972 McGovern campaign, what emerged out the fiasco is what came to
               be known as ‘progressive populism.’ Traditional liberalism, along with traditional conservatism,
               died (or were killed off) during the sixties. Progressive populism is the face of contemporary
               liberalism in the United States. It is represented by figures like Ralph Nader, Molly Ivins, Jim
               Hightower, and Medea Benjamin. Most of the widely recognized faces in the independent media on
               the so-called left (but not the left as defined by neocons) are progressive populists, or greens. They
               are liberal because they are not anti-capitalist. They may rant and rail against giant corporations,

               but they sing the praises of small town businesses. They believe in the US constitution. They
               believe that the United States used to have a democracy and they want to get back to it by building
               a grassroots citizens movement.. They think that we can go back to the welfare state, and
               reestablish it. They are firmly committed to representative government, with its elections, and its
               Congress. The tendency is represented by a weekly newspaper out of Iowa, the Progressive
               Populist, among other publications. Progressive populists may number a million or two, as
               evidenced for example by the Nader vote, but they are far from being a mass movement.

                  Preliminaries – The Two Failed Two-Stage (statist) Strategies of the Left

## Leninism

                  Leninism, the strategy of capturing the state apparatus through armed struggle and revolution,
               has been one of the two-stage strategies for overthrowing capitalism – first capture the state, and
               then move to build a free society (variously called communism, socialism, anarchism). The strategy
               was applied not only in Russia but throughout the colonial world in national liberation struggles.
               Even though numerous revolutionary parties came to power, nowhere was capitalism overcome.
               Thus the strategy now stands as a proven failure, through more than a century of trials. Even hard-
## core Marxists are abandoning the goal of seizing the state.
                  Unfortunately, there are still moribund, remnant leninist groups active in the United States, all of
               which are striving to build a vanguard party to seize state power. Two of the most prominent are:
               International Socialist Organization, which publishes the weekly paper Socialist Worker, and the bimonthly magazine, International Socialist Review; and Revolutionary Communist Party, which
               publishes the newspaper Revolution, and operates bookstores around the United States.

## Social Democracy

                  Social Democracy, primarily in Europe, was the strategy of capturing the state apparatus through
               elections. This two-stage strategy can also now be seen as a massive failure, since even though
               socialist parties have been in power in many European countries, sometimes for decades, capitalism
               has gone rolling on. What has thus been established is that we can’t get to a free society (anarchy/
               communism, that is a society without a state or capitalism) by getting control of the state apparatus.
               This is why the anarchist strategy, of bypassing the state altogether, is once again back on the front
## lines of the class war.
                  Of course, small social democratic parties are still active on the USA scene. The largest is the

               Democratic Socialists of America. They organize the annual Socialist Scholars Conference in New
               York City, publish a magazine, Left Turn, and regularly run candidates for public office. A smaller
               organization is the Socialist Party USA, whose official magazine is The Socialist.

## Anarcho-Syndicalism, Anarcho-Communism, and Cousins

## 1. Workers Solidarity Alliance
                  This tiny group is the closest there is to a pure anarcho-syndicalist organization in the United
               States. Their strategy focus is on workplace organizing, with an eye to eventually seizing the means
               of production. For what happens after that, they subscribe to the standard vision of federated
               workers councils to challenge and eventually overthrow the state and capitalism. WSA is the U.S.
               member of the International Workers Association, founded in Berlin in 1922.

                  There is a vast literature on anarcho-syndicalism, workers control, and workers councils, seeing
               that this was the main anarchist strategy for decades, guiding many of the 20th century’s greatest
               revolutions. Two classics are:

                  ASR is the main magazine for anarcho-syndicalism in the United States. Its strategy focus is on
               the ‘revolutionary union’. Revolutionary unions are to be built with the aim of seizing the means of
               production, establishing workers councils, which will then be federated into a dual power structure
## to eventually overthrow capitalism.

## 3. Wobblies (The Industrial Workers of the World)
                  The IWW strategy is to build ‘one big union’, to defeat capitalism, with a strong emphasis on
               direct action. There is considerable stress on building a revolutionary working class counterculture.
               Beyond this though it is probably the syndicalist vision of federated workers councils that provides
               the backdrop, although wobblies deny that theirs is an anarcho-syndicalist organization.

## 4. Northeastern Federation of Anarchist-Communists
                  Their strategy is to build a revolutionary organization to intervene in, and radicalize, working
               class struggles over work, housing, and community control. They “envision an international
               confederation of directly democratic, self-managed communities and workplaces.” This is a very
               activist organization. They have participated in numerous labor fights, are regulars on the picket
               lines, have worked with the unemployed, and are organizing an anarchist workers network. They
               founded the Boston Angry Tenants Union. And of course they also participate in demonstrations
               and street protests. Nefac is a member of the International Libertarian Solidarity network. Other
               federations with much the same purposes and organization as Nefac have been established recently
               in the Northwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Midwest, with varying degrees of success.

## 5. Situationists
                  This was a French current, from 1957 to 1972, which helped trigger the revolution of 1968 in
               France. The Situationist International broke with the old left and orthodox marxism and sought to
               redefine the radical project across the board. They incorporated the effects of mass media and the
               culture industry into their analysis of capitalism. Debord, in Society of the Spectacle, restored
               workers councils to the center of the revolution. But situationists also sought to extend the council
               system, into “neighborhood, city, regional, and international councils”, that is, to “generalized selfmanagement”. The main proponent of situationism in the US has been Ken Knabb in Berkeley. His
               essay, “The Joy of Revolution” (1997) is an insightful synthesis of workplace and community
               emphases, as well as other currents. It is a good exposition of “generalized self-management.”

                  6. Grassroots Economic Organizing and the Cooperative Commonwealth
                  Frank Lindenfeld, Len Krimerman, and the GEO (Grassroots Economic Organizing)
                  In May 2004 the founding conference was held for the National Federation of Worker
               Cooperatives and Democratic Workplaces. Len Krimerman, Frank Lindenfeld, and their friends,
               have been reporting on this movement for the past twenty years. They ferret out actual experiments
               in workplace democracy all over the world and publicize them in their newsletter. They have
               published a national directory of such experiments for the United States. Last I heard, there are
               about 1500 worker-owned businesses in the United States. The GEO collective fosters networks of
               worker co-ops, organizes conferences, and plugs into the international movement for self-managed
               workplaces which holds a conference every couple of years or so. They say that “GEO has assisted
               our movement in becoming conscious of itself.” They believe that the seeds of a cooperative
               commonwealth are already present in the existing worker and consumer co-ops, community
               development financial institutions, and barter networks. As these increase in number, and federate,
               they may reach enough of a critical mass to transform the entire society. A broader anti-capitalist
               political movement will also be needed though for this to happen. This transformation will not be
               achieved however by seizing the means of production outright, but through legislation which will
               enable the construction of a cooperative commonwealth, after the mass movement has gained
               majorities in Congress through elections. So ultimately, although its focus is on worker-owned
## workplaces, this tendency is social democratic in nature.

## Libertarian Municipalism
## 7. Libertarian Municipalism
                  Murray Bookchin, Institute for Social Ecology, Alliance for Freedom and Direct Democracy
                  The basic strategy advocated by libertarian municipalists is for anarchists to run for office in
               municipal governments. Once a majority of anarchists control the local government, they will set
               about abolishing the electoral system and establishing in its stead community assemblies based on
               direct democracy. Also, they will somehow institute public (i.e., community) ownership of ‘the
               economy’. They don’t explain how they will do this. They reject organizing at the workplace. The
               community assemblies will be confederated. I don’t think this proposal has ever advanced to the
               status of being an actual movement or tendency. As far as I know, it has never been tried in
               practice. The attempt to organize an “Alliance” (the Alliance for Freedom and Direct Democracy),
               based more or less on libertarian municipalist principles, was still born.

## 8. Inclusive Democracy Project
                  Takis Fotopoulous, and the Democracy and Nature journal (not a US journal)
                  Takis Fotopoulous’ project for Inclusive Democracy emerged out of Libertarian Municipalism.
               But Fotopoulos reinstated workplace assemblies and combined them with community assemblies
               for a more comprehensive view of a self-governing society, based on direct democracy (except
               these local assemblies will be federated). He nevertheless still advocates trying to capture local
               governments through elections. He supports all struggles and projects which further inclusive
               democracy goals, such as local currencies and democratic credit unions. He calls for the formation
               of a ‘party’ to agitate for these objectives. He also outlines a radical epistemology compatible with
               direct democracy which avoids the relativism of most post-modernism and the objectivism of
               orthodox science and mechanical marxism. As far as I’m aware, Fotopoulos’ proposal has found
               almost no resonance in the anarchist movement in the United States.

## 9. Surrealism
## Chicago Surrealists
                  Although keenly supportive of workplace and labor struggles, as well as the goal of
               reestablishing community, these aspects are not explicitly spelled out by Chicago Surrealists in
               their manifestos. The main items of the surrealist outlook as outlined by Paul Garon and the
               Rosemonts in 1996 are: revolt and revolution; poetry as praxis; psychoanalysis as a subversive
               activity; love above all; anti-miserabilism; the exaltation of play; free territories of the imagination;
               the marvelous against religion; abolishing whiteness; undermining patriarchy; black music now and
               forever; dialectic x dialectic x dialectic; alchemy, by any means necessary; the emancipation of
               wilderness; humor. Their strategy and practice is to intervene relentlessly in the major struggles,
               especially cultural ones, and they have done so. They claim a strong affinity with the IWW.

## 10. Autonomous Marxism
                  This current takes its name from the autonomous movement of Italy’s New Left of the 1970s,
               and the theoretical output of that movement. Also included are: the Johnson-Forrest Tendency in
               the US (Raya Dunayevskaya and CLR James), Council Communists, the Socialism or Barbarism
               group in France, and the Midnight Notes collective in Boston. Also usefully and reasonably
               included, I believe, is western marxism in general, that is, anti-bolshevik communism, hegelian
               marxism, and the Frankfurt School of critical theory. All this represented an updating and
               refurbishing of marxism, without the vanguard and statist strategy. It was a break with both
               Leninism and the orthodox marxism of the Second International.

## 11. Libertarian Socialism
                  Libertarian socialism is quite close to the anarchist tradition. It is probably only because
               anarchism was so thoroughly excluded from the political arena for so long by the hegemonic
               marxism-leninism that this tendency evolved independently of anarchism. There is much from each
## tradition that might be useful to the other.

## Individualists
## 12. Primitivists
## John Zerzan, Green Anarchy
                  This current, as articulated by John Zerzan, seeks to overcome alienation (i.e., humans once were
               one with nature, but are now separated) by abolishing agriculture, language, math, art, culture,
               technology, industry, the domestication of animals, the division of labor, and all symbolic thought.
               Primitivists seek the destruction of civilization, and do whatever they can to assist in this, although
               they believe that civilization is going to collapse of its own accord anyway. Their main strategic
               thinking is about how to survive this collapse, and about how to live as hunters and gatherers after
               the big die-off (they assume that they will be among the survivors). They don’t actually have a
               political program and pay scant attention to attempts to change or improve the world because they
               believe that civilization, all civilization, in its entirety, is destructive and alienating and based on
               hierarchy and therefore must end. They seek a so-called unmediated existence. They seem blind or
               unconcerned about the enormous suffering and loss of life that their analysis so calmly
               contemplates. This current is essentially individualistic. However, many people who now identify
               as primitivist do not necessarily endorse all the extreme views pushed by Zerzan.

8 of 12 9/17/25, 11:36 AM Anarchist Revolutionary Strategy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/james-herod-anarchist-revolutionar...

## Hakim Bey, Temporary Autonomous Zone
                  “TAZ is like an uprising which does not engage directly with the State, a guerilla operation
               which liberates an area (of land, of time, of imagination) and then dissolves itself to re-form
               elsewhere/elsewhen, before the State can crush it.” This strategy seeks to identify “spaces”
               (physical, social, cultural, mental) which are not yet completely controlled by the oppressors, and to
               use them for insurgencies, and to live free (for a while). The social form is the band; it is seen as a
               festival; it practices psychic nomadism. There is a primitivist thread, in that Hakim Bey (Peter
               Lamborn Wilson) advocates “the refusal of all mediation”, and other primitivist themes. This is a
               basically individualistic tendency. Later, Bey extended the strategy to encompass ‘permanent
               autonomous zones.’ However, these are seen mostly as already existing zones of ongoing duration
               which the ruling class has somehow overlooked. No strategy actually is ever advanced for
               defending these zones against attacks by the oppressor, nor is much attention paid to defeating
               capitalists in general. We certainly must do better than to try to find a few overlooked niches in the
               Empire where we can breath a little more freely, whether temporarily or permanently. We must get
               free from capital and empire completely. Nevertheless, there are many insightful suggestions in
## these writings.

## 14. Crimethinc
                  This is yet another (peculiarly American) highly individualistic political initiative. They hate
               meetings. Democracy is a dirty word for them. Their attitude toward work is: don’t do it; quit your
               job. The chapter on “unemployment” in their book of resistance tactics, Recipes for Disaster, is
               about how to become unemployed, and stay that way. They have a strong belief in the absolute
               autonomy of the individual. They are intolerant of any social cooperation that goes beyond the
               affinity group or small collective. The workplace and the neighborhood, as sites for struggle, are
               completely off their radar screen.. They say that “the root of anarchism is the simple impulse to do
               it yourself.” They believe that since there is no god and no master there is no morality, and you can
               do whatever you please. They are strongly influenced by primitivism, and constantly rail against
               civilization. They see the good society as an aggregate of autonomous individuals.. It is a
               philosophy of ‘do your own thing.’ This is the politics of the ‘traveler kids’ who live off theft and
               out of dumpsters (and the generosity of their friends who haven’t quit their jobs). They exhibit no
               understanding whatsoever that humans are social creatures, intersubjective beings. Nevertheless, in
               spite of their horrible politics, I sort of perversely enjoy these writings, expressing as they do such a
## total, almost poetic, revolt against the existing society.

## 15. So-called Post-Left Anarchism
## Jason McQuinn, Bob Black
                  This is a sectarian current which is attempting to draw a narrow boundary around
               individualistic anarchism as the only true, pure anarchism. Self-described post-left anarchists reject
               workplace organizing as ‘workerist’. They reject neighborhood organizing. In fact, they are against
               ‘organization’, as well as several other abstractions with which they seem to be obsessed, and
               which they constantly attack, including ‘work’, ‘collective’, and the ‘left’. Their arch-enemy,
               “leftism,” is entirely fabricated, a product of their addled brains, as there has never been any such
               thing. They have failed to get beyond the specious individual/collective dichotomy, yet they deny
               that they are individualists. Their only strategy, that I can see, other than incessantly attacking
               ‘leftism’, that is, everyone in the anti-capitalist movement outside their own narrow circle of true
               believers, is to attack the system in whatever way they can, and to protest.

## 18. Intentional Communities

10 of 12 9/17/25, 11:36 AM Anarchist Revolutionary Strategy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/james-herod-anarchist-revolutionar...
                  There is a rich tradition in the United States of communal experiments. The nineteenth century
               was littered with them, representing a wide variety of philosophies and structures. The New Left of
               the sixties gave birth to a whole new generation of “communes”, both urban and rural, many of
               which embodied anarchist principles. Today, the country is covered with dozens of “intentional
               communities.” Most of them are ‘new age,’ and are based on religion. But there are some which are
               more secular. Some are democratic, and to the extent that this democracy is direct, these
               communities therefore represent an actually existing bit of (partial) anarchy (not many are anticapitalist) scattered across the landscape of America. There should at least be a campaign by
               anarchists to try to win these communities over to full anarchy.

## 19. Global Justice Movement
                  There are pronounced anarchist tendencies in the Global Justice Movement, including a
               commitment to direct democracy on the local level in many cases, a serious disillusionment with
               national representative government, extensive horizontal networking among various groups and
               projects, a refusal to set up a hierarchical, bureaucratic governing structure for the overall
               movement, a discrediting and rejection of the old Leninist strategy of capturing state power, many
               attempts to link the global movement to local struggles, and many innovative experiments toward
               sustainable self-sufficiency on the community level. Regrettably, there are also strong reformist
               elements in the movement. The World Social Forum, as of 2006, may already have been NGOed
               (or so claims Arundhati Roy).
