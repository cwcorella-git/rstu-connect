Anger is often regarded as a one-dimensional emotion. However, anger can be complex and may arise in different circumstances for different reasons. Anger may be a response to something perceived as unfair or unjust, or it may connect to concealed emotions or underlying repressed issues.
When these issues are triggered, it may make a person feel more vulnerable or out of control, and therefore, they might lash out in anger. There are a few ways that anger might appear for you or someone you care about.

A brief overview of anger
Anger is
an emotional state
that may manifest when someone feels hurt, threatened, or otherwise provoked. Different things may trigger anger in someone, but anger is often a natural response to discomfort.
The ability to feel angry is wired into our brains as part of the
fight or flight response
that has helped humans survive as a species. It allows us to defend ourselves from threats. Anger often causes the feeling of wanting to "fight" or become defensive. However, feeling the urge to run away or freeze may also occur with anger.
There may be a few misconceptions regarding anger. One potential misconception you may have is thinking that feeling angry is "bad" or "wrong. "However, the feeling of anger is natural. Feeling angry is an emotional reaction that may defend us from harm or let us know when we have been hurt. When individuals believe anger itself is wrong, they may be referring to potentially harmful behaviors that could be urged by the emotion.
In some cases, anger might be enlightening or serve as a source of motivation to try to change something that could be wrong or unjust. When problems arise, it may be because someone had difficulties controlling their behavior alongside strong feelings of anger. The difference between an emotion and what we might do with it can be an essential distinction.
The types and levels of anger
Anger is a complex emotion with different modes of expression and underlying causes. Understanding each of these and what they entail may be enlightening.
An awareness of the potential types may also help you determine steps to manage anger when it doesn't match your reality.
Annoyance
Annoyance
can be a relatively common form of anger. It may feel less severe than other types. People might get annoyed at things such as long lines, traffic jams, or hearing someone chew with their mouth open. Often, annoyance is mild and tends to subside quickly.
Someone who finds themselves regularly annoyed may want to become aware of what's bothering them since constant annoyance may indicate another underlying condition or situation. For example, anxiety or depression may cause annoyance or frequent "irritability," a symptom of the conditions.
Frustration
The emotion of
frustration
is not anger but may manifest as anger if an annoyance or other obstacle has lasted for too long. Frustration may pass quickly if the situation gets resolved, or it may turn into a long-term issue if the frustrating situation continues without resolution.
A frustrated individual may feel tense or have difficulty concentrating at work or school. They may have trouble sleeping or feel anxious and upset. A frustrated person may also feel helpless or out of control of their circumstances, which may lead them to express their frustration as anger.

Hostility
Whereas annoyance, frustration, and other forms of anger may not necessarily be expressed openly or directly toward another person,
hostility
is an overt expression of powerful emotion. A person who is being hostile toward someone or something may make those angry feelings known. They might do this by behaving in aggressive or antagonistic ways.
Hostility
may arise after someone has been consistently subjected to situations that displease them or they perceive as threatening. In some cases, hostility may result from pent-up anger that hasn't been constructively resolved and is seeping out in hurtful words or actions.
Individuals may also seem to be automatically hostile to people and situations they encounter. These individuals may be employing hostility as a means of defense or to exert control. Other people may develop hostile behavior because of traumatic experiences or brain injuries.
Hostility may be displayed overtly, in angry words or actions directed at their target, or it might be expressed as
passive-aggressive
behavior or sabotage. Hostility often differs from annoyance or frustration, as it may have more intent to harm or target an external factor. Someone may also be hostile toward themselves.
Rage
Rage
is an extreme expression of anger. By the time someone has reached the point of being enraged, they may be verbally confrontational. They may throw objects, make threats, or even physically lash out at others. Although we may think that rage means someone has lost control of their emotions and cannot manage their anger, this may not always be the case.
In some situations, rage may be used as a tool of manipulation or abuse by someone choosing to act abusively or believing that they aren't in control of themselves. In other situations, rage may be the release of anger that has been pent up for a long time, including anger that may have a reasonable cause and that has been triggered by something someone said or something that happened.
Addressing the things that make us angry before our feelings can escalate to rage can be one way to stay more emotionally healthy and avoid taking our anger out on other people.
If you or a loved one is experiencing abuse, contact the
Domestic Violence Hotline
at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). Support is available 24/7.
Managing anger
Different types of anger may each have their own triggers and intensity. It can be much easier to manage annoyance and frustration than to control hostility or rage.
At times, anger may start as annoyance and work up to rage if the underlying issue causing the disturbance is not addressed. Other times, a person might become hostile or enraged with little provocation.
Anger is not an inherently bad emotion. However, if you are experiencing it on a frequent or even constant basis, it can become
chronic anger
, which may impact your emotional, mental, and physical health, and may negatively affect your relationships with other people.
Anger is a normal human emotion that can occur throughout our lives with greater or lesser frequency,
depending on factors
like our personal situation or mental health. While anger isn't necessarily bad or wrong, our failure to manage our anger may lead to problems at home or work.
There are many different techniques you can use to
manage your anger
. Consider learning to walk away from a frustrating situation and return to it when you're feeling calmer, as well as how to evaluate what you're thinking and feeling. Learning to actively choose how to respond
instead of just reacting
may be beneficial.
Knowing what kinds of people or situations trigger our anger may also help us avoid those triggers or develop strategies in advance for how to deal with them in healthier ways.

Asking for help
Dealing with anger may feel challenging. At times, the cause of anger isn't readily apparent because anger may emerge as a defense mechanism or because of an unresolved issue. Managing anger may also feel difficult to handle when you know what triggered it.
If managing anger is something you regularly struggle with, working with a professional therapist may be of value to you. The ability to ask for help when you know it's necessary can be a positive sign of growth and maturity. It can also be a form of investing in yourself to improve and have a better future.
Anger issues and their treatments have been studied extensively, and counseling is effective for many people struggling with anger issues. The American Psychological Association (APA) reviewed hundreds of studies on anger treatment and found that roughly 7five% of people who sought treatment for anger
saw significant improvement and healing
. According to the APA, cognitive-behavioral therapy, family therapy, and psychodynamic therapy have shown the most promise for treating anger issues.
Some people may be more comfortable seeing their therapist face-to-face in the therapist's office, but others prefer to have their appointments online. Online counseling may allow individuals to receive treatment from the comfort of their own homes and on their own schedules.
Studies have shown that online therapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, which can be suitable for treating anger issues, can be as effective as in-person treatment. Services such as
BetterHelp
can connect you with a therapist specializing in treating anger issues and any other mental health challenges you may face.
Takeaway
Anger is a normal human emotion that may be a reasonable response to being hurt or mistreated. Different types and stages of anger can have varying triggers and expressive behaviors.
Feeling angry isn't necessarily good or bad by itself. What may be beneficial to you is learning to manage behavioral urges driven by anger to handle difficult emotions in healthy ways.
Anger may feel challenging to manage, but several techniques exist to control anger. If you want professional help, you're not alone. Consider reaching out to a qualified counselor for support and research-based anger management techniques.

Individuals may experience different levels of anger
It's essential to recognize that individuals may experience anger differently, and the intensity of anger can vary from person to person and situation to situation. Effective anger management involves understanding and addressing anger at its earlier, more manageable stages to prevent it from escalating to more intense and destructive levels.
What are the 3 stages of anger?
Anger typically progresses through several stages, although the exact number and description of these stages can vary depending on the model or theory.
Three stages of anger
Here is a common three-stage model of anger:
Triggering Stage (Activation): This is the initial stage where anger is triggered by a perceived threat, injustice, frustration, or some other emotional or situational stimulus. In this stage, individuals may experience physiological changes, such as an increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, the release of stress hormones, and an increase in adrenaline levels. They may also have immediate emotional reactions, such as irritation, annoyance, or frustration.
Expression Stage (Crescendo): In this stage, anger intensifies, and individuals may choose to express their anger in various ways. This can include verbal expressions like shouting, arguing, or making accusatory statements. It may also involve physical expressions like clenched fists, aggressive body language, or even physical aggression. At this point, the person's cognitive functioning may be affected, making it difficult to think rationally or make calm decisions.
Resolution Stage (De-escalation): In the final stage, anger begins to subside as the individual either resolves the underlying issue, disengages from the situation or exhausts their emotional energy. During this stage, the person may start to regain control of their emotions, their physical responses return to normal, and they may reflect on their actions or seek ways to address the situation constructively. Effective resolution often involves finding ways to manage or express anger in healthier ways or addressing the underlying issues that led to the anger.
What are the five anger styles?
Anger styles
refer to the different ways individuals tend to express and manage their anger. While there are various models and categorizations, here are five common anger styles:
Assertive Anger Style: People with an assertive anger style demonstrate appropriate social behavior and express their anger in a healthy and constructive manner. They communicate their feelings clearly, directly, and respectfully in a relaxed state without resorting to aggression or hostility. They seek to address the underlying issues causing their anger and work toward finding solutions. This style is generally considered the most adaptive and effective way of managing anger.
Passive Anger Style: Individuals with a passive anger style tend to suppress or internalize their anger rather than express it outwardly. They may avoid confrontation, withdraw from situations, or keep their feelings bottled up. While this style may prevent immediate conflict, the pent-up energy can lead to long-term heightened resentments and emotional distress.
Aggressive Anger Style: People with an aggressive anger style express their anger in a hostile and confrontational manner. They may have an angry outburst, or shout, insult, blame, or engage in aggressive behaviors. This style can be destructive to relationships and may lead to negative consequences.
Passive-Aggressive Anger Style: This style combines elements of both passivity and aggression. Individuals with a passive-aggressive anger style express their anger indirectly, often through sarcasm, sarcasm, or passive behaviors like procrastination or deliberately not following through on commitments. This style can be confusing and damaging to relationships.
Avoidant Anger Style: Some individuals with an avoidant anger style tend to distance themselves from situations or people that trigger their anger. They may avoid confronting the issue or person altogether, opting to disengage and ignore their feelings. While avoidance can temporarily reduce conflict, it doesn't address the underlying problems.
What are level 5 anger issues?
Level 5 anger issues typically refer to a high level of anger intensity that can be classified as extreme or severe. It may involve intense emotional reactions and aggressive behaviors that can be harmful to oneself or others. When anger reaches this level, anger may be difficult to control or involve threatening violence. Individuals may exhibit behaviors that could lead to legal consequences or damage to relationships, property, or personal well-being.
What contributes to Type 3 anger?
Type 3 anger, often referred to as "aggressive anger" or "explosive anger," is characterized by an intense and often impulsive emotional reaction. Several factors and triggers can contribute to someone displaying Type 3 anger:
Perceived Threat:
Type 3 anger often arises when an individual perceives a threat to their physical or emotional well-being. This threat may be real or perceived, and it can trigger a strong defensive response.
Frustration:
Frustration with obstacles, challenges, or unmet expectations can lead to Type 3 anger. When individuals feel thwarted in their goals or desires, they may respond with intense anger.
Lack of
Coping Skills
Individuals with Type 3 anger may have limited or ineffective coping skills. They may not know how to manage their anger in a healthier way, leading to explosive outbursts.
Stress and Overwhelm:
High levels of stress, overwhelming responsibilities, or multiple stressors can contribute to Type 3 anger. When people feel overwhelmed and unable to manage their stress, they may experience an adrenaline rush and anger can become a release valve.
Emotional Triggers:
Certain emotions, such as fear, shame, or humiliation, can trigger aggressive anger as a defensive response to one's self-esteem or sense of self-worth.
What are the ABCs of anger?
The ABCs of anger
is a cognitive-behavioral approach to understanding and managing anger. It involves breaking down the components of anger into three main parts: Activating Events, Beliefs, and Consequences. Here's what each component represents:
Activating Event (A):
This is the initial trigger or situation that leads to anger. It can be an external event, such as someone's words or actions, or an internal event, like a thought or memory. Identifying the activating event helps individuals recognize what specifically led to their anger.
Beliefs (B): Beliefs refer to the thoughts, interpretations, and perceptions that occur in response to the activating event. These beliefs can be rational or irrational. Irrational beliefs are not easily released and tend to escalate anger and include thoughts like, "This should not have happened," or "They must respect me at all times." Identifying and challenging irrational beliefs can help reduce anger.
Consequences (C): Consequences refer to the emotional, behavioral, and physical reactions that result from the activating event and associated beliefs. These consequences can include anger, frustration, physical tension, aggressive behaviors, and more. Understanding the consequences of anger and, how it may impact your life, helps individuals assess whether their reactions are constructive or harmful.
By examining the ABCs of anger, individuals can gain insight into the specific triggers, thought patterns, and reactions that contribute to their anger. This awareness enables them to develop more effective anger management strategies, such as challenging irrational beliefs, practicing relaxation techniques, saying soothing affirmations, and finding healthier ways to express and cope with their emotions. Over time, a person may have the same reasons for being angry but may express their anger in healthier ways.
What are four healthy ways to express anger?
Expressing anger in healthy and constructive ways
is essential for maintaining healthy relationships and emotional well-being. Here are four stages or healthy ways to express anger:
Use "I" Statements: As anger and stress levels begin to rise, instead of making accusatory or confrontational statements, express your feelings using "I" statements. For example, say, "I feel hurt when you cancel our plans without notice" instead of "You always cancel our plans, and it's so frustrating." "I" statements help you communicate your feelings and needs without blaming or attacking the other person.
Take a Timeout: When you feel anger escalating, take a timeout to cool off and regain your composure. Step away from the situation, take deep breaths, or practice relaxation techniques like mindfulness or meditation. This can help you avoid reacting impulsively and give you time to think before responding.
Communicate Assertively: Assertive communication involves expressing your thoughts, feelings and needs clearly and respectfully while also listening to the other person's perspective. Avoid aggressive or passive-aggressive communication styles. Assertive communication allows you to address the issue directly and work toward a resolution.
Seek Problem Solving: Use anger as a motivator to address the underlying issue or problem. Focus on finding solutions and compromises rather than dwelling on the anger itself. Collaborative problem-solving can lead to more satisfying outcomes and help prevent future anger-triggering situations.
Is there a degree scale for rage, fury, and wrath?
Yes, there are variations of anger, including rage, fury, and wrath. Rage is an intense and potentially violent induced and uncontrolled anger that is counter to rational thought. While fury is similar to rage in that
they both suggest a loss of self-control
, it is often tinged with a disordered, frenzied quality.
Wrath is an intense anger in response to an unceasing string of infuriating events. Wrath is often used to describe an explosive fit of pent-up anger that often seeks to enact revenge or punishment. This word is often used in a biblical sense to describe the “wrath of God.”
How can I silently release annoyance, irritation, and frustration?
Certain relaxation techniques can help to calm the body’s response to frustrating events. Deep breathing exercises are some of the most effective methods for releasing irritation and anger silently. Reciting a mantra, checking your self-awareness, and completing cognitive restructuring exercises may also help. Over time, you may develop effective strategies that work consistently for your needs and boost overall well-being in your daily life.
Seeking support in anger management classes, support groups, or talk therapy with a mental health professional can help change negative thought problems and bolster problem-solving strategies and communication skills.
How do you snap out of anger and resentment?
Steeping yourself in self-awareness instead of blind anger can help recenter you in the present moment and steer your energy to more productive thoughts. It can be helpful to acknowledge your anger without judgment, address it directly and in appropriate proportion, accept the outcome and the things you cannot change, and shift your attention to something
