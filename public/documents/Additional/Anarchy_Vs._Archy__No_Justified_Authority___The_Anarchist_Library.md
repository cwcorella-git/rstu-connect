                Archy: The Opposite of Anarchy
                The dictionary definition of 'archy' is any body of authoritative
                officials organized in nested ranks. Be it a Monarchy, an
                oligarchy, a republic, a feudal state or any other hierarchical
                society.
                While anarchy is the opposition to hierarchy and authority,
                archy is the full embodiment of those things. While anarchy
                calls for the absence of rulers, archy thrives when a population
                serves and obeys rulers. Sometimes a few rulers (e.g.
                monarchies), and sometimes many (e.g. social democracies).
                Hierarchies exist for rulers to maintain their social control &
                power over the population. This control is maintained with
                violent force by authorities appointed by the rulers: the army,
                national guard, police, courts, prisons, social workers, the
                media, tax collectors, etc.
                Not all guidance given by one person to another constitutes
                hierarchy. Choosing to accept a specialist's expertise in their

                craft needn't create a hierarchy or make them your ruler. A
                roofer laying your roof or a chef cooking your meal or a
                surgeon repairing your heart needn't be your superior on a
                hierarchy simply because they are providing you with a valued
                service.
                Similarly, an individual using force to strike a blow at the
                hierarchy that oppresses them does not turn the individual into
                an authority. Destroying archy where you see it does not create
                archy, it creates anarchy.
                On "Justified Authority"
                Once you start justifying authority and hierarchy, you
                effectively twist a knife in anarchy. We've all heard the phrase
                "all power corrupts". It's not a meme; it's the entire reason
                anarchy exists as a practice.
                Legitimizing authority enables archy. Doesn't matter if you call
                yourself an anarchist while justifying hierarchies you personally
                approve of for whatever reason. NO authority is legitimate in
                anarchy. Yes, even in a parent-child relationship.
                When you legitimize an authority, you're granting it power,
                presenting it as an institution that needs to be obeyed at all
                costs, and it won't stop there. It'll want more power because
                that's the nature of power. Always grows, never stops to
                examine its devastating effect on its surroundings. Power is a
                license to do harm. Whether it was your original intention to
                enable a violent force of power when you legitimized an
                authority is irrelevant. It will do harm and the people who
                signed off on legitimizing it are (or should be) culpable for that

                harm.
                Anarchy is the opposition to authority. To pretend otherwise
                would be a blatant misrepresentation of what anarchy is.
                Expertise Vs. Force Vs. Authority
                A lot of people confuse expertise for authority and then use
                that confusion to insist anarchy doesn't oppose all authority.
                They say anarchy only opposes unjustified authority. They of
                course never explain who gets to determine which authority is
                justified... I assume that determination is made by a further
                authority? An authority that is also justified? And which
                authority justified that authority..? It's silly when anarchists try
                to go down this justified authority rabbithole.
                A carpenter might be good at making cabinets, an expert at it
                even, but that doesn't make them an authority. Their talent
                doesn't give them the right to assert authority; power over
                anyone. Authority is not simply an isolated instance of a person
                using force. Authority is a distinct on-going social relationship
                between people. A coercive relationship that has been
                legitimized by our authoritarian hierarchical society. It's a
                relationship where authority figures assert power over less-
                powerful individuals in their care. These individuals are
                expected to submit to this mighty authority figure and obey
                their commands unwaveringly.
                Imagine you're walking home at night and someone jumps out
                of the shadows and tries to stab you. In the resulting scuffle,
                you kill them in self-defense. This was a simple use of force; it
                does not make you an authority over the person who tried to
3 of 13 3/17/25, 5:06 PM Anarchy Vs. Archy: No Justiﬁed Authority | The Anarchis... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                kill you. This isolated action you took to preserve your own life
                does not magically imbue you with the authority to go on a
                killing spree.
                Similarly, when a child is about to walk in front of a speeding
                truck and you grab their hand to stop them, you're not using
                authority. You're using simple force. A temporary spur-of-the-
                moment action to preserve life is not authority. It doesn't give
                you ownership over the person you're helping. Anarchy has no
                qualms with the isolated use of force, just the structural
                institution of authority.
                The Chomsky Connection
                Noam Chomsky frequently uses the "saving a child from being
                hit by a car" example to explain his concept of "justified
                authority". The people that repeat the 'justified authority'
                fallacy are usually parroting Chomsky's ill-thought-out words.
                He says:
                “Authority, unless justified, is inherently illegitimate and the
                burden of proof is on those in authority.”
                He insists that a person's authority should be legitimized if
                justification is provided for it. But of course, he misses a step by
                neglecting to explain who gets granted the authority to judge
                that the authority figure's justification is legitimate...
                His definition of authority is inherently flawed. If he'd just say
                "force" instead of authority, there wouldn't be so many
                confused Chomsky-acolytes out there making arbitrary
                justifications for all kinds of hierarchical shit and then branding
                that shit "anarchist" when it's anything but. I've even seen his
4 of 13 3/17/25, 5:06 PM Anarchy Vs. Archy: No Justiﬁed Authority | The Anarchis... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                followers using his definitions to frame so-called "Night-
                watchman states" as being anarchist in nature. Night-
                watchman states are states that only exist to provide citizens
                with military, police and courts. This is minarchism, not
                anarchism. The idea of anarchist states and anarchist prisons is
                obscene.
                Even if we were to naively accept that minarchism were
                somehow desirable, it would only lead right back to full-scale
                statism. Legitimized power never remains still, and attempts to
                control its growth have forever proven futile.
                Chomsky is never a good source for what anarchy means. He's
                made a career of watering down anarchy to better appeal to a
                white middle-class North American audience, even going as far
                as to state that government isn't inherently bad and that it can
                be somehow "reformed" with what he calls "real democracy"
                and "social control over investment". Far too many anarchists
                look to Chomsky as an authority on anarchy, when he's clearly
                a minarchist.
                He also likens anarchy to the enlightenment and classical
                liberalism in his talks and writings, which is a very Western-
                centric thing to do, especially since the enlightenment oversaw
                the divvying up of Africa by European imperialists and other
                horrifically racist and genocidal acts. So it's probably not a
                good idea to associate anarchy with that authoritarian chapter
                of history... While it's true that the political movement that first
                branded itself as anarchism originated in Europe, anarchy
                thrived unnamed in every corner of the world before and after
                The Enlightenment, long before European philosophers began
                to pine for a return to it.

                I don't consider Chomsky to be an anarchist (because he's
                demonstrably not one), so his definitions aren't that important
                to me. But unfortunately they're important to a lot of
                minarchists and liberals that call themselves anarchists, and
                they keep repeating his flawed definitions to newcomers,
                creating further confusion that reverberates for years.
                The EXPERTISE of the Cobbler
                The likely source for Chomsky's confusion over the anarchist
                definition of authority is the originator of collectivist anarchism,
                Mikhail Bakunin. In his rough and unfinished text “What is
                Authority” (1870), he spoke of "the authority of the cobbler":
                "Does it follow that I drive back every authority? The thought
                would never occur to me. When it is a question of boots, I refer
                the matter to the authority of the cobbler; when it is a question
                of houses, canals, or railroads, I consult that of the architect or
                engineer. For each special area of knowledge I speak to the
                appropriate expert. But I allow neither the cobbler nor the
                architect nor the scientist to impose upon me. [...] But I
                recognize no infallible authority, even in quite exceptional
                questions [...] So there is no fixed and constant authority, but a
                continual exchange of mutual, temporary, and, above all,
                voluntary authority and subordination." -Bakunin
                "Voluntary authority and subordination" is essentially what
                every liberal insists they stand for. They claim capitalism is a
                voluntary contract between people. They say workers
                voluntarily choose to be subordinate to their bosses or the
                state in exchange for wages or security. Anarchists need to
6 of 13 3/17/25, 5:06 PM Anarchy Vs. Archy: No Justiﬁed Authority | The Anarchis... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                reject Bakunin's language if we're to differentiate ourselves
                from these authoritarian ideologies and truly take a stand
                against authority.
                With that text, Bakunin was trying to articulate the difference
                between expertise and authority, but did it in a confusing and
                roundabout way that has enabled generations of minarchists
                to mistakenly identify as anarchists and promote a broken
                definition of anarchy. Expertise isn't hierarchical unless the
                expert is deliberately enshrined with authority. Being good at
                something needn't give you the right to use your craft to rule
                people.
                The guy made a poorly-worded argument 150 years ago, when
                the European anarchist movement was still in its infancy and
                the terminology was still being developed. It was a small part
                of a rough draft that he never completed, and it is often quoted
                without any context by people who obviously haven't read the
                whole text or the associated works that he wrote around the
                same time.
                We obviously don't need to hold up everything every anarchist
                ever wrote as some kind of immovable anarchist canon. We
                don't cling to Bakunin's rampant antisemitism, so why cling to
                his half-baked bootmaker blunder?
                Diluting the Goals of Anarchy
                The oft-cited example of saving someone from being struck by
                a car simply has nothing to do with authority. It's a
                fundamental misrepresentation of the anarchist concept of
                authority, and I hope this piece will help shift the discourse
7 of 13 3/17/25, 5:06 PM Anarchy Vs. Archy: No Justiﬁed Authority | The Anarchis... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                away from it. Every fucked up political ideology out there, from
                monarchy to neoliberalism to fascism, claims to be for justified-
                authority and against unjustified-authority. We know it's
                horseshit when liberals deem bombing school buses in Syria or
                Iraq a "justifiable" action to "protect freedom" or "acceptable
                collateral damage", so why would we adopt their dangerous
                doublespeak to define anarchy? As soon as you start making
                allowances for authority, you've stopped advocating for
                anarchy.
                Pushing "justified authority" as Chomsky keeps attempting to
                do is a pointless exercise that only confuses the uninformed
                and gives us scores of middle class baby-anarchists who come
                in not understanding the basic underpinnings of anarchy. They
                then use that misunderstanding to equate anarchy with all
                kinds of authoritarian shit, even including states. It makes the
                line that separates liberalism from anarchy increasingly thin.
                And quite frankly, it breeds shit anarchists.
                I’ll finish this chapter by quoting an “anarchist” on a popular
                anarchist forum who is a perfect example of what I’m talking
                about:
                “I feel it's necessary to have authorities that can perpetuate
                and protect certain things - for example, I think an unrevocable
                societal constitution that every autonomous community
                should follow is a good thing - and that there should also be
                codified laws - with the aim to protect individual liberty.”
                “Resultantly, I feel like there should be authorities as there are
                now that ensure that those laws - such as the right to
                education to a good standard, or that housing or medical

                training or care should be of a certain standard, or the right to
                process through a justice system. Necessarily these authorities
                should have the ability to change situations where these laws/
                rights are breached. As an extension, I also find myself
                believing in a well-trained voluntary police force that can
                undertake these duties (though one of course that is as directly
                democratic as possible and revocable and responsible in the
                anarchist tradition).”
                “In this way I find myself drawn more to a desire for a "state" of
                federated anarchistic communities that function as an
                anarchist society might although within a greater framework of
                a limited system that wields authority.”
                A constitution that everyone has to follow, a “democratic”
                police force, a state, a system that wields authority. None of
                this is any different than the liberal status quo. This person has
                no understanding of anarchy and yet feels the need to identify
                as an anarchist because they would prefer liberal society be
                more democratic..? It’s nonsensical. And yet the post was well-
                regarded by other “anarchists” who replied in agreement, with
                two of them even citing Rojava as an “anarchist state” that
                matched up to these stated ideals.
                An “anarchist state”. An “anarchist state”…
                Authority is a Moral Hierarchy
                A hierarchy is an artificial construct that depends on the
                principle of authority. Authority is the socially-enforced rule
                that the ruler in a hierarchical relationship gives commands
                and the subordinate obeys under threat of (socially

                legitimized) violence. If I offered my boss a meal, or saved
                them from drowning, I wouldn't be exercising authority over
                them. That action alone doesn't create a hierarchy. But just by
                being my boss, they are constantly exercising authority over
                me and I'm constantly their subordinate. I am ruled by them. I
                am constrained; controlled by the boss-worker hierarchy, by
                my boss's constant assertion of authority over me.
                Authority is a deliberate social construct that divides people
                into either rulers or obeyers; using violence and the notion of
                "morality" to maintain this coercive system. Talking back to
                your boss, refusing their authority: That's a big "moral" no no.
                Society uses this coercive conditioning to uphold the
                oppressive dynamic and to keep you controlled and obedient.
                The system will not tolerate any real dissent against its law.
                Instead it will condition you to realign your perceptions until
                you finally accept its law as normal.
                Proponents of "free-market" capitalism promote supposedly
                "voluntary" hierarchies (such as the relationship between
                owners and workers). This is merely an excuse for normalizing
                structural violence against the less-powerful, a process that is
                legitimized by appealing to authority. These hierarchies aren't
                voluntary in any quantifiable way, since we'd be punished by
                society in various ways if we chose to ignore them (say, by
                refusing to work or by killing our bosses and taking the true
                value of our labor). "Justifiable hierarchy" / "legitimate
                authority" is an eerily similar concept as "voluntary" labor
                under capitalism.
                On Anarchist Parenting

                Authority is a structurally violent institution. It has nothing to
                do with the act of rendering aid to a child; feeding them or
                preventing them from falling into a pool and drowning. A
                parent-child relationship needn't be a hierarchy unless you go
                out of your way to construct it as such.
                Parenting is only hierarchical when parents choose to force
                authority on their child. An anarchist parent would use child-
                rearing methods that treat the child as an autonomous
                individual and not as a subordinate to their authoritarian
                demands. Anarchist parents see themselves as caretakers, not
                authorities, and legitimizing parental authority with the excuse
                of "justifiable hierarchy" is a scapegoat. It's not justified. Using
                violent coercion to control children is not anarchy. Parents don't
                need to be tyrants to raise children.
                Countless anarchist communities throughout history, including
                the modern-day Hadza in the Great Rift Valley of East Africa
                have shown us that the parent-child relationship doesn't need
                to be the violent dictatorship it has become in capitalist-
                industrial society.
                Yet a lot of "anarcho-minarchists", for lack of a better term,
                insist on seeing the "ownership" authoritarian society grants
                them over their children as a "justified hierarchy". It's such an
                odd argument. If they're okay with applying authoritarianism to
                their own children, they'd obviously be fine with using it to
                dominate strangers too. It's baffling to see people claim the
                domination of children is compatible with anarchy just because
                it's something they choose to engage in.
                "Civilized" people make the mistake of constructing

                dangerous, unhealthy and authoritarian environments for us to
                live in that completely ignore the burning desire every child
                has for freedom, play, exploration and learning through first-
                hand experience.
                We force children into metal carriages that take them to
                school-buildings where strangers are paid to dictate rigid
                lesson plans to them for years. Children spend their entire
                childhoods being moved from room to room, forcibly trained to
                function under the system as obedient civilized workers. Most
                children aren't even allowed to play outdoors because the
                dangers of industrial civlization are so frightening to their
                parents.
                Industrial civilization is simply unfit to nurture human life. The
                perverse ways we structure our societies around danger,
                authority, fear, coercion, punishment, conformity and
                obedience isn't something that should be forced on children, or
                anyone. As anarchists, we should be tearing down these
                authoritarian structures instead of making excuses to maintain
                them. Children don't need authority, they need anarchy.
                Watered-Down Anarchy
                Certain people attach themselves to the flawed collectivist-
                anarchist definition of authority and then decide they can
                justify all sorts of hierarchies with it. That revisionism then
                enters the wider anarchist sphere and is seldom analyzed for
                its deficiencies since so many collectivist "anarchists" are really
                minarchists in disguise. Minarchists see no real problem with
                authority so long as it benefits them materially. Sadly, these
12 of 13 3/17/25, 5:06 PM Anarchy Vs. Archy: No Justiﬁed Authority | The Anarchis... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                minarchists largely control the discourse in many anarchist
                spaces where the idea of true anarchy is simply unfathomable.
                Most people born and raised under authoritarian systems have
                tremendous trouble parting with the faux security-blanket that
                a lifetime of archy has imbibed them with. Then the absurd
                idea of "good hierarchy" becomes normalized in these spaces
                and is used to keep anarchy from forming.
                Anarchists need to make a strong distinction between the
                words "authority", "force" and "expertise" so language
                misunderstandings don't lead to minarchism suppressing
                anarchy.
                "Justifiable authority" is one of several fundamental
                misunderstandings of anarchy that need to be thrown out
                before further diluting our (really very easily defined)
                objectives. We tend to overthink things and that leads to
                mountains of round-about revisionist theory that only detracts
                from anarchy and leaves people confused about what even our
                most basic objectives are.
                Every genocidal dictator considered the hierarchies they
                upheld to be justifiable. Anarchists know better. Anarchy is,
                was and always will be the outright rejection of all archy.
                When you compromise and make excuses to construct
                hierarchies; what you're doing is no longer anarchy.
