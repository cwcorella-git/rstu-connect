In this regard, the present paper reviews the literature to explain the concept ‘emotional labor’. In explaining emotional labor and its nomological network, the paper discusses the factors that affect and are affected by it. This paper contributes to the existing literature by assimilating different works done in this domain and providing a comprehensive understanding of emotional labor. This paper focuses on some of the critical issues, about which, the existing literature on emotional labor is silent and thus, providing a platform for further research. W.P.

Therefore a clear understanding of the concept and its place in the nomological network is warranted. This paper explains the concept of emotional labor and elaborates the factors associated with the concept. Based on the understanding of the literature some research gaps are explained for future study. Emotional Labor Emotion work is the starting point for the understanding of emotional labor. Hochschild (2003) used the term emotion work to refer to any attempt to modify the experience or expression of a consciously felt emotion. When the individual performs emotion work as a required part of her/his actual job performance it is called emotional labor. Callahan and McCollum (2002) interprets that the term emotional work is appropriate for situations in which individuals are personally choosing to manage their emotions for their own noncompensated benefits. The term emotional labor is appropriate only when emotion work is exchanged for something such as a wage or some other type of valued compensation. In her definition of emotional labor, Wharton (1993 as cited in Callahan & McCollum, 2002) remarks that not only such actions are performed for a wage; they are also under the control of others. Thus, in organizational settings, emotional labor is under the control of organizations. Various scholars have conceptualized emotional labor in various ways. In the next section these conceptualizations of emotional labor has been reviewed. Conceptualization of Emotional Labor Hochschild’s (2003) conceptualization of emotional labor involves impression management of service employees. These employees put effort to express emotions acceptable by customers. According to this perspective, the discrepancy between felt and expressed emotion is related to job stress and burnout. W.P.

Although these works have defined emotional labor differently, and focused on different outcomes, they all have the same underlying theme: individuals can regulate their emotional expressions at work. Emotional labor is thus the process of regulating the expression of emotions for achievement of organizational goals and the employee is paid for this labor. As emotional labor is the process of managing the expression, it is similar to many concepts like deception, impression management, and dramaturgy. Related Concepts Though the concepts are similar in nature there are conceptual differences between these terms. Kagle (1998) described deception as an interpersonal act which involves at least two actors: the deceiver and the deceived. It is defined as a deliberate attempt to mislead others (DePaulo, Lindsay, Malone, Muhlenbruck, Charlton, & Cooper, 2003). Buller and Burgoon (1996, as cited in DePaulo et al., 2003) noted that when people try to deceive, they attempt to convey their deceptive message, and at the same time, they continually monitor the target of their deception for signs of suspiciousness and then adapt their behavior accordingly. When people deceive others they usually make effort to seem credible. This deliberate attempt to manage impressions, including impressions of credibility, is deception. In impression management, the focus of the deliberateness is typically limited to the content of the performance and not its credibility (Fisk & Grove, 1996). Thus, there is an overlap between impression management and deception. In dramaturgy each participant is considered to be "on stage" and "acting" in ways specifically chosen to create the most favorable impression (Fisk & Grove, 1996). This seems true of almost any organizational events - particularly in service organizations. W.P.

Emotional Labor and Display of Emotion Qualitative research shows that all employees find their true feelings do not always conform to their roles (Ashforth & Toumiuk, 2000). As feelings do not erupt spontaneously or automatically employees modify their display of emotions either by deep acting or by surface acting (Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993; Hochschild, 1979, 2003). Both deep acting and surface acting represent different intentions. When engaged in deep acting, an actor attempts to modify feelings to match the required display rules whereas in surface acting employees modify their displays without shaping inner feelings (Ashforth & Humprey, 1993; Hochschild, 2003). Deep acting has been called ‘faking in good faith’ as the intent is to seem authentic to the audience. Surface acting is called ‘faking in bad faith’ because the employee conforms to the display rules to keep the job, not to help the customer or the organization (Rafaeli & Sutton, 1987). According to Cote and Morgan (2002), emotions may be regulated either at the input from the environment (antecedent- focused emotion regulation) or at the output after emotion response tendencies have been triggered (response-focused emotion regulation). Grandey (2003) argued that both antecedent-focused emotion regulation and response-focused emotion regulation correspond to deep acting and surface acting, respectively. Antecedent-focused emotion regulation occurs when an individual modifies a situation or the perception of the situation in an attempt to alter her/his felt emotions (Gross, 1998). It is similar to deep acting as it focuses on modifying feelings, which subsequently impacts expressions (Grandey, 2003). Gross (1998) identified four different types of strategies that could be used to engage in antecedent-focused emotion regulation. These are: situation selection (choosing or avoiding certain situations), situation W.P.

The feeling rules that obtain at a funeral demand that we feel sad. Both social situations and social roles impose emotional demands on people (Rosenberg, 1990). In addition, emotional display serves as an important means for the attainment of one’s ends. A customer may feign anger in order to elicit better service in a restaurant and a good natured sales-person sells more goods than their peers (Rosenberg, 1990). Emotional concealment is as much a feature of emotional display as is emotional exhibition and it plays an equally important part in enabling people to realize their objectives in society (Shott, 1979 as cited in Rosenberg, 1990). The above discussion suggests that in the society individuals display emotions irrespective of their feelings. Sometimes occupations demand expression of certain emotions. Occupational Factors The display of positive emotions is required in many service occupations, including restaurant workers and flight attendants. Funeral directors in contrast are required to display negative emotions (i.e. sadness). Some job requires display of neutrality i.e. those of the judges (Rafaeli & Sutton, 1987). In service organizations, service employees are often the only contact that customers have with the organization and projection of right emotions is important in enhancing the organization’s public image. Therefore, organizations are increasingly influencing emotional labor of the service employees. With the growth of service industry emotional labor has gained momentum both in the workplace and in the academics. This paper concentrates on the role of emotional labor in organizational context. There are many organizational factors that shape the display of emotions. The following section elaborates the organizational factors that influence the emotional labor. W.P.

In another study Gosserand & Diefendorff (2005) argued that, mere presence of display rules is not enough and commitment to display rules may have important effect on the display of emotions. They define commitment to display rules as a person’s intention to extend effort toward displaying organizationally desired emotions, persist in displaying these emotions over time, and not abandon these display rules under difficult conditions. They found that the commitment to display rules moderates the relationships between display rule perceptions and acting strategies: these relationships are strong and positive when commitment is high and weak when commitment is low. Gosserand & Diefendorff (2005) conclude that perceiving high levels of display requirements combined with high commitment to those display rules is associated with more use of emotional regulation strategies and positive affective delivery. Interaction Characteristics Apart from display rules, the frequency, duration, and routines of interpersonal interactions influence emotional labor. Morris & Feldman (1996) proposed that individuals will have a greater need to regulate their emotions, in jobs requiring frequent contact with others. In an empirical study, Diefendorff et al. (2005), found no relationship between frequency of interaction and acting. Routineness is the extent to which customer interactions are repetitive and scripted. Routineness of interaction is related positively with deep acting (Diefendorff et al, 2005), but Rafaeli and Sutton (1990) commented that when routine interactions occur customers may prefer impersonal but cordial interactions. This creates little incentive to deep act. Duration refers to how long typical customer interaction lasts. Studies found that duration of interaction correlates positively with deep acting (Diefendorff et al., 2005; Morris & Feldman, 1996). Technology changes the way W.P.

Cues from target persons include gender, age, and apparent social status. Store busyness. Busyness is the extent to which a store is rapidly paced and crowded with customers. A negative relationship between store busyness and employee display of positive emotion has been demonstrated in supermarkets in Israel (Rafaeli & Sutton, 1990), convenience stores in United States and Canada (Rafaeli, 1989; Sutton & Rafaeli, 1988), and banks in the United States (Pugh, 2001). Rafaeli and Sutton (1990) note that the clerks were apparently cognitively overloaded during the busy times, which affect their emotional display. However, Tan, Foo, Chong, & Renee, (2003) in the study of cashiers in the fast food chains in Singapore found no relation between store busyness and display of positive emotion. The difference may be due to different cultures at national and organizational levels. Customer demand is the extent to which a transaction requires a prolonged and complex response from a service employee. It is positively related to the display of positive emotion during transactions with customers (Pugh, 2001; Rafaeli & Sutton, 1990; Tan et al, 2003). This supports the general assumption that employees use positive emotions to gain control over demanding customers. Work intensification. Ogbonna and Harris (2004), in a university context, found that when the work intensifies, the lecturers are attempting actually to experience occupationally and organizationally expected emotions. This is a form of deep acting and it is noticed that university lecturers frequently exhibit spontaneous emotions as an everyday part of their working lives to cope with work intensification. Liu et al. (2004) argued that emotional labor will vary as individuals perceive and interpret the interaction cues with the customer differently. Tan et al. (2003) found that W.P.

However, Diefendorff et al. (2005) found that emotional expressivity is correlated neither to surface acting nor to deep acting. Gross and John (2003) argued that there may be important individual differences that predict how emotional response tendencies are translated into behavior. Gross, John, & Richards, (2000) explained dispositional expressivity as a stable individual difference in emotion-expressive behavior and found that, for positive emotions both felt emotion and dispositional expressivity are substantially and independently related to emotion-expressive behavior. For negative emotion, apart from individual effects, both felt emotion and dispositional expressivity has interaction effect: emotion experience predicted emotion expression for dispositionally high-expressivity individuals but not for dispositionally low-expressivity individuals. So, emotional expressivity has a strong influence on emotional labor. Conscientiousness. Conscientiousness reflects the extent to which a person is careful, thorough, and responsible (McCrae & John, 1992 as cited in Witt, Andrews, & Carlson, 2004). It is anticipated that conscientious individuals would follow emotional display rules by working to be genuine in their expressions, rather than just going through the surface acting. Consistent with this argument, Diefendorff et al. (2005), in their study found that conscientiousness is negatively correlated with surface acting. Agreeableness. Agreeableness reflects stable individual differences in the need to develop and maintain positive relationships through social behaviors. Agreeable individuals are expected to put more effort into emotion regulation so that they have positive social interactions. Also, realizing the negative effects of insincere emotional displays, agreeable individuals may try to display genuine emotions by deep acting rather than surface acting. Diefendorff et al. (2005), found in their study that agreeableness correlates positively with deep acting and negatively with surface acting. W.P.

In an empirical study Barrett, Gross, Christensen, & Conner, (2001) found that individuals with highly differentiated and more intense negative emotional experience reported greater emotional regulation. However, positive emotional differentiation was unrelated to emotional regulation. Psychological climate. Psychological climate is defined as an employee’s perception about an organization’s events, practices, and procedures and the kind of behaviors that get rewarded, supported and expected (Schneider et al., 1992 as cited in Tsai, 2001). The psychological climate has many dimensions. The concept of ‘climate for service friendliness’ refers to employee’s perception that certain practices (which are adopted by the organization) are rewarding for being warm and friendly to the customers. Tsai (2001) found that psychological climate for service friendliness is positively related to displayed positive emotions. Grandey (2003) argued that deep acting is positively related to and surface acting is negatively related to the perception of the service delivery as friendly and warm. Grandey, Dickter, & Sin, (2004) in their study found that employees who appraise customer aggression as highly stressful use surface acting and deep acting is more likely for those who appraise customer aggression as mildly stressful in comparison with those who view them as highly stressful. Employees who feel that they have control at work feel more empowered in customer encounters, including aggressive ones and show less stress appraisal of customer verbal aggression (Grandey et al., 2004). Gender. There is strong evidence in the literature that women and men demonstrate different patterns of emotional expression even within the same jobs (Rafaeli, 1989). Women are more emotionally expressive than men (LaFrance and Banaji, 1992 as cited in Pugh, 2002). Ogbonna and Harris (2004), in their study found that women academics W.P.

Simpson and Stroh (2004) suggest that the critical dimension linking emotional labor to worker well being is emotional dissonance. Negative Consequences Emotional dissonance. Lewig and Dollard (2003) found that emotional dissonance exacerbates the level of emotional exhaustion at high levels of psychological demands. This indicates that jobs combining high levels of demands are much more risky (Lewig & Dollard, 2003). Researchers express that, surface acting is more likely to lead to emotional dissonance (Hochschild, 2003) and emotional exhaustion (Grandey, 2003) than deep acting. Consistent with the argument, Brotheridge and Grandey (2002) found that, surface acting is linked to burnout and lower service performance, while deep acting is positively linked to service performance. Heuven and Bakker (2003) emphasized the importance of emotion work variables on emotional dissonance. They found that emotional dissonance explains a significant amount of variance in predicting emotional exhaustion and depersonalization among cabin attendants. Lewig and Dollard (2003) found that emotional dissonance results in emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction beyond that accounted for by psychological demands. They also found that emotional dissonance fully mediates the relationship between positive emotional display and emotional exhaustion which is consistent with the results of Brotheridge and Lee’s (1998, cited in Lewig and Dollard, 2003) view that the emotional demands of work do not directly lead to emotional exhaustion but do so through their relationship with emotional dissonance. Hochschild (2003: 90) argued that the effort to maintain a “difference in feeling and feigning over the long run leads to strain”, ultimately posing threats to the physical well-being of employees. Similarly, self-alienation may result when the worker ceases to recognize or even feel authentic emotions (Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993). W.P.

(1994) emphasized that service employees with positive emotions will be more successful in organizational life than employees with negative emotions. Updegraff, Gable, & Taylor, (2004) found that people with positive expectancies, not only experience more positive emotions over time, but also their overall sense of daily wellbeing is tied more to positive emotional experiences and less to negative emotional experiences. Ashforth and Humphrey (1993) propose that emotional labor can increase self efficacy of the employees and also increase personal wellbeing. Organizational Level Consequences. Pugh (2001) remarked that the display of positive emotions by the employee is positively related to the customers’ positive affect and this positive affect of the customer leads to positive evaluations of service quality. Ashforth and Humphrey (1993) proposed that expression of positive emotions is related to increased task effectiveness. Rafaeli and Sutton (1987) found that positive emotions of the service employee brings about immediate (increased sales), encore (customer revisit), and contagion gains (spread of good words by the customer) for the organization. Contradictory to this finding, Tsai (2001) found no support for the relationship between employee display of positive emotions and immediate gains in the context of shoe stores. However, consistent with the findings of Rafaeli and Sutton (1987), he found that when employees display more positive emotions toward customers, customers were more willing to visit the store again and pass positive comments to friends. Individual Level Consequences. The expressions of positive emotions by service employees influence outcomes that are salient to the role occupant like financial wellbeing, mental and physical wellbeing (Rafaeli & Sutton, 1987). Service employees with positive emotions receive favorable evaluations of their performance and get better pay compared to their coworkers (Staw et al., 1994). Staw et al.

The image also introduced to capture the clients’ perception of a company (Burnstein, 1984 as cited in Alvesson and Berg, 1992). Dutton, Dukerich, & Harquail, (1994) explained organizational identity as the degree to which a member defines her/him-self by the same attributes that s/he believes defines the organization. Alvesson (1992) defined organizational identification is one form of psychological attachment that occurs when members adopt the defining characteristics of the organization as defining characteristics for themselves. Broadly speaking, organizational identity is individuals’ identification with the organization. Organizational identity affects individuals’ identity in following ways. First, indicates organizational membership confer positive attributes on its members (called as perceived organizational identity) and people may feel proud to belong to the organization (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991); Second, when, members believe that outsiders see the organization in a positive light, they bask in the reflected glory of the organization (Cialdini, Borden, Thorne, Walker, Freeman, & Sloan, 1976: 366; Dutton & Dukerich, 1991). Ibarra (1999) noted that, people enact personas that convey qualities they want others to ascribe to them. Thus, the two images influence the cognitive connection that members create with their organization and the kind of behaviors that follow (Dutton et al., 1994). Consistent with this argument Gibson and Schroeder (2002) argued that increasing one’s identity in general leads to positive emotions. A person’s well-being and behavior are affected both by the attributes they ascribe to themselves and the organization.

This positivity affects the connectivity among the individuals and influences the group dynamics (Losada & Heaphy, 2004). Thus, there may be a relationship between the leader’s expression of positive emotion and group dynamics. The research is silent about these facets of emotional labor. Conclusion Thinking and feeling are indispensable part of human actions (Muchinsky, 2000). Thus the need of research on feelings of individuals in the workplace is as important as the research on cognition. As feelings are at the core of human emotions, emotion plays a vital role in organizations. In this era of intense job stress, the capacity to cope with emotions is related to interpersonal relations.

It was felt that there are many unexplored areas in the realm of emotional labor. Some of the unexplored areas are described for further research.
