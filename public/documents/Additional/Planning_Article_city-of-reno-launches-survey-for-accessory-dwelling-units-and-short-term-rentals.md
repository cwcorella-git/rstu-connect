         City of Reno Launches Survey for Accessory Dwelling Units and Short-Term
         Rentals

         The City of Reno continues to address the issue of aﬀordable housing and is inviting the public to take a survey regarding
         the possible implementation of an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) and Short-Term Rental (STR) ordinance. As of now,
         ADUs, sometimes referred to as ‘granny ﬂats’, are restricted in most areas of the City.
         The nine-question survey hopes to collect diverse perspectives on ADUs and STRs and asks residents if they should be
         allowed in more areas of the City. The survey also hopes to identify what key areas should be addressed if an ordinance is
         adopted and how likely a resident is to build one on their own property.
         “In the City of Reno we are exploring all options to help make it more aﬀordable to live here,” said Mayor Hillary Schieve.
         “People who work in the Biggest Little City should be able to buy a home here and build their lives here. Feedback from
         our residents is an important part of the process to make that a reality.”
         Residents can participate in the survey now through the end of February and make their voices heard on this critical
         matter. To access the survey and contribute to the conversation, take the survey here or visit the City of Reno's website for
         more information on ADUs, STRs, and other housing initiatives geared toward alleviating the aﬀordable housing issue.
         The results from the survey will be used to provide Reno City Councilmembers information in anticipation of a text
         amendment, which is anticipated for Summer 2024.
         Housing aﬀordability continues to be a top priority for the Reno City Council and the Nevada State Legislators. Assembly
         Bill 213, which passed in the 2023 legislative session, requires that on or before July 1, 2024 the governing body of each
         jurisdiction shall create an expedited process for aﬀordable housing, and create incentives that encourage aﬀordable
         housing.
