# Iww Deliveroo Riders Strike and Blockade in London

IWW Deliveroo riders strike and blockade in London Date: Unknown Source: https://libcom.org/article/iww-deliveroo-riders-strike-and-blockade-london Tags: Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), strikes, distribution, London, United Kingdom, food service, wildcat strikes, blockades, Deliveroo, gig economy
Deliveroo riders organising with theLondon IWWhave been taking spontaneous action for improved wages and working conditions, shutting down one of Deliveroo's 'dark kitchens' in Swiss Cottage, North-West London.
Deliveroo drivers, and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) London branch took spontaneous action at the Deliveroo Editions kitchen in Swiss Cottage on Saturday, May 25 and Sunday, May 26. Drivers are working under terrible conditions, with low pay and no security. It is an untenable situation that demands change.
In a meeting last week drivers from Swiss Cottage voted on the following demands:
The IWW stands beside both member and non-member drivers in their fight for better working conditions. We believe in calculated and collective direct action, and hope that drivers in other delivery zones will be inspired by the action in Swiss Cottage.On Saturday, drivers and the IWW successfully halted all operations out of the editions for 2 hours. We hope to do the same on Sunday night.
If you are a Deliveroo or UberEats driver working in London, or are interested in volunteering for the campaign, please do not hesitate to get in touch. Work conditions can change, but only when we work together.
If you are a driver and would like to join the union, please go to https://iww.org.uk/join/.
For further information and press enquiries please contact London IWW Deputy Secretary Merlin Baker-Whitelaw at[email protected].

Does anyone know if there's a single write-up anywhere of this weekend's Deliveroo-related events in London, Leeds and Nottingham? Or even separate write-ups of each city beyond just social media posts?

^ Yeah, it would be nice to get an update on how their campaign is going.

For reference, (some of) the social media posts in question:https://twitter.com/LondonIWW/st atus/1149758612979535872https://twitter.com/LondonIWW/status/1150101547633860610

So, not a full writeup, but confirmation that there was action of some kind happening across three cities last weekend.
