## Introduction

## What is anarchy?

## In everyday speech, “anarchy” usually means out of control,
## disorderly, or chaotic. As a political philosophy, however,
## anarchism is in opposition to an Archos, the Greek word for
## “master.” People who identify themselves as anarchists are
                usually sceptical of government institutions and their ways of
                controlling society. Their ideal society, modelled after the
                Greek word anarkhia, meaning “without a ruler,” is one without
                figures such as presidents, prime ministers, or kings, but also
                without the institutions that maintain their control, such as
                police forces, militaries, national religions, and centralised
## banks, among other things. While anarchists vary in their
                beliefs and ideals, all anarchists are interested in resisting
## centralised systems of control and hierarchy.

## What is the Internet?

## The Internet is a global system of computer networks, a
                network of networks. The Internet has its origins in the military.
## During the 1960s, the United States Department of Defense
## wanted to find a way to share messages and information from
## one computer to another without having to physically cart
## around the massive “drum memory” most computers used for
## storage. Drum memory cylinders weighed about ten pounds
                each, and only stored 10KB worth of data—that’s only about 10

## pages of a text document!

## A 10lb drum memory used as computer storage in the 50s and
## 60s.

                Despite its origins as a military tool, the Internet is quite
                anarchist in its organisation. Any participant in the network can
## share information to anyone, and there is no hierarchical
## structure the network follows. Anarchists themselves have
## noted this design as proof of their philosophy working in
                practice:
                “Most people, including and arguably especially most digital
## technologists, can intuitively understand the principles of
## anarchic coordination. There are myriad examples of modern
## technologies with names such as consensus algorithms,
## cluster orchestration, and distributed ledgers (like
## "blockchains") that are, when you actually stop to examine
## them, fundamentally anarchic approaches to solving complex
## problems in environments with various degrees of trust
## between participants.” (Tech Learning Collective)

## On the other hand, many engineers, corporations, and
                governments saw the anarchic design of the Internet as a weak
                spot:

                “[The Internet’s creators were] no longer in charge. Nobody
## really was. Those with dark intentions would soon find the
## Internet well suited to their goals, allowing fast, easy,
## inexpensive ways to reach anyone or anything on the
## network.” (Timberg)

## These predictions ended up being correct. As early as the
                Internet’s first days, already there were tech specialists and
## hobbyists finding ways to exploit the weaknesses of various
## networks. This community began with a group of academic
## researchers and programmers at MIT, but gradually began to
## expand as computer technology became more accessible to
## the general public. They began to call themselves hackers,
## describing themselves as people who enjoy “exploring the
## details of programmable systems and how to stretch their
                capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only
## the minimum necessary” (“Hacker”).

## Phreakers, hackers, and freedom fighters

## By the 1980s, home computers were becoming more
## common, and an increasing number of businesses,
                governments, and corporations were using the Internet in their
## daily operations. While computer usage was still not
                widespread, those who were interested in the technology were
                now able to communicate with each other online through email
## and online bulletin boards. In the hacking community, a
## number of ezines began to pop up in the mid-80s, the most
## notable being Phrack, a portmanteau of phreak and hack.
## Whereas hackers were mostly interested in computer
## networks, phreakers were interested in telephone networks.

## The two often worked together, as in those days, Internet
## access was often connected to a landline telephone—hence
                the term “dial-up” Internet. Thus, hackers could use phreaking
## methods to find the telephone numbers for modems belonging
                to businesses, which was a popular way to break into “private”
## business networks. Phrack helped bring together phreakers
## and hackers, but it was also a publication with a political
                agenda. Most of the editors and contributors to the zine were
## anarchists, and many cited this ideology as one of the key
## influences behind their fascination with technology.

                Perhaps the most famous article ever published in Phrack was
## “The Conscience of a Hacker,” later renamed “The Hacker
                Manifesto,” first published in November 1986. The article was
                written by a figure known as The Mentor shortly after his arrest,
                and seeks to outline the thought processes and motivations of
## hackers so that the general public might better understand
## them. The Mentor describes the hacking community as a group
## of freedom fighters which oppose the government, the
## military, and corporations, and one that values independent
                thought, intelligence, and curiosity over nationality, gender,
                race, or religion:

## “This is our world now... the world of the electron and the
## switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service
                already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if
                it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals.
## We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after
                knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin
                color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call
## us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you

                murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for
## our own good, yet we're the criminals.

                Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is
## that of judging people by what they say and think, not what
                they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something
## that you will never forgive me for.” (The Mentor)

## The cover of Phrack's 62nd volume, released in 2004.

                This idea of the Internet as a place where everyone could be
## equal was very popular among anarchist hackers in the 80s
                and 90s. Outside of Phrack, one of the other major electronic
                publications connecting anarchists in the computer scene was
## the Cypherpunks Mailing List.

## Cypherpunks are mainly interested in matters regarding
## surveillance and privacy, and advocate for the use of
## cryptography, or secure communication, to protect people
## from the prying eyes of governments, militaries, and
                corporations. Cryptography as a technique has been practised
                for thousands of years in various forms: Ancient Greek armies
                often wrote confidential information in code so it couldn’t be
## understood if intercepted by enemy forces, Nazi generals
## received and gave orders in a complex, ever-changing code
## that could only be deciphered using early computer

## technology in World War II, and modern credit cards use
## cryptographic smart chips to prevent fraud. Cypherpunks
## aimed to use these technologies to anonymize communication
                in a world where the Internet was making it increasingly easy
                for powerful entities to spy on everyday people. In addition,
## Cypherpunks wanted to apply this technology to economic
                exchanges. By applying cryptographic technology to currency,
## they could make transactions between parties impossible to
                track or trace. This was the beginning of cryptocurrency—once
## only an idea shared by a few Cypherpunks online, and now a
## reality.

## Timothy C. May was one of the leading figures in the
## Cypherpunk movement, and a creator of the Cypherpunks
## Mailing List. In 1988, he published “The Crypto Anarchist
## Manifesto,” which outlined the ideology and goals of the
                movement:
                “Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability
## for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with
## each other in a totally anonymous manner… These
## developments will alter completely the nature of government
                regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions,
                the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the
## nature of trust and reputation…

                The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this
## technology, citing national security concerns, use of the
## technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of
                societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid;
                crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and
## will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An

## anonymous computerized market will even make possible
## abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various
## criminal and foreign elements will be active users of
                CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.”
                (May)

## Both “The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto” and “The Hacker
                Manifesto” share two main themes: the struggle between
                anarchists and state or corporate entities for control over the
                Internet, and the excuse of “cracking down on crime” used by
                these entities to justify potential oppressive, over-regulatory,
                and voyeuristic laws and technologies applied to the Internet
## by them. These themes will feature heavily throughout the
## three items this exhibit focuses on, and have been at the
## centre of anarchist’s discussions about the Internet for
## decades.

## Thoughts on Hacktivism Post Y2K by Jesse Hirsh

## This pamphlet was published by TAO (“The Anarchy
                Organization”) in Toronto, Canada, in January 2000. In it, author
## Jesse Hirsh argues that Y2K as a spectacle event was a
## symptom of the sense of mystical confusion and awe much of
                the public feels when interacting with the Internet. Because the
## average person doesn’t understand the inner workings of the
## networks and technologies they use, the Internet exists to
                them as a product they can interact with but not understand.
## Hirsh argues this is intentionally done by corporations to
                alienate users and retain their power over the Internet as a
## social tool. Hackers complicate this corporate power. Hacks
                both destabilise public trust in corporations' ability to preserve

                their data online, and increase public interest in the inner
## workings of networks and computers. Hackers have thus
                become key figures in imagining the Internet as a site where
                corporate and government control is exerted, but also as a site
## for social change.

                The cover art, as well as a transcription of the first half of the
## pamphlet, is included below.

## "It would appear that the most important, if not essential
                aspect of surviving in this ‘post-Y2K’ society has become the
                task of “Understanding Reality”. That is to say, our society has
                reached such a high level of media saturation, that reality is
## not so much an objective experience, but more a subjective
## construct facilitated by a sprawling economy that combines
## telecommunications, computers, marketing, and
## entertainment, to generate a facility that more and more
                permits the customization of reality, when and where possible.
## Power in this system manifests as the ability to control,
## contain, maintain, and escape one’s constructed reality. As
## with most political systems, power is centralized and
                continuously accumulated into the hands of the few, while the
                appearance of distributed wealth is enabled by the reality of
## distributed computing and communications. For every remote
                control there is the illusion of change, even when we all know
## that everything is the same, regardless of the channel.

                For most people however, reality bites, and it bites hard. The
                values that the society presents as the bonds of its existence,
## include accumulative and possessive individualism, often at
                the expense of the society (and social fabric) itself. We are told
                that happiness is in success, that success is in power, and that
## power comes with money, so we need to get mo’ money and
## mo’ money, by any means necessary.

## Hacking Reality is the means by which we can reclaim our
## communities and struggle towards an equitable and

## democratic society. Within this technological system that
## surrounds us, the Hacker struggles to become human. We are
                all born animals, but via socialization with each other, and our
## environments, we become the human being that we’re
## instinctively driven to become. What sets the Hacker apart
                from other identities in our society, is the considerable effort
## and ongoing change that the Hacker undergoes to understand,
## and furthermore, transform, the environment in which they
## reside. Contrast this with the average Consumer, who has
## discarded their humanity, in favour of a much more reliable
## and secure corporate identity, that guides them through the
## trends and fads of their culture. The Consumer does not
                understand or attempt to transform their environment; rather
## they accept it as it is, conforming to whatever changes the
## system presents.

## What these two identities hold in common is an existence
                within a dynamic and ever changing system. For as we all see
                and hear: the only constant in our world, is change itself. What
## sets the Hacker apart, is their possession of social power,
## which is largely derived from an understanding of their
                environment (aka: reality). For within this technological
                society, there are always inherent mechanisms of power built
                into the logic and operations of its systems. Colloquially this is
                referred to as “God Status”, and most frequently manifests as
## a systems’ root account. While these powers generally exist
                (and were intended) for administrative purposes (and control)
## they can also have countless secondary and tertiary
## applications, especially when it comes to unintended
## applications or possessions of said power.

## As a culture, and as a set of social networks, Hackers have
## been uniquely successful in both understanding the presence
                and role of this power (within the system) as well as being able
                to both subvert and broaden the access to said positions and
## mechanisms of power. Out of this particular ability, if not
                potential social role, has emerged the concept of Hacktivism,
## which while widely used (by the mass media) really does not
                have a consensual definition that is accepted by all actors in
                the culture. For the purpose of this discussion however, let us
                define Hacktivism as: Social Activism augmented by an
                advanced literacy of communications environments. For one of
                the largest tensions that is underlying many of the conflicts in
                our technological society is the contrast between open source
                shared organizing, and closed proprietary development. In the
                realm of Hacktivism, this is the difference between the military-
## centric strike teams, and the social-centric hackers (and
                groups) who freely give out source code and intelligence that
## they gather.

## Most of our technology, indeed, most of our communication
                environments, were originally, and for the most part still are,
                the domain of the military. This is not to say that economic and
                civil activities cannot simultaneously co-exist, but it does mean
## that any telephone and computer is within reach of the eyes
## ears and guns of the military and state intelligence
## establishments. This only serves to emphasize and highlight
                the need for a broader sphere of Critical Collaborative Free
## Open Source Distributed Development.

                Essentially we are all squatters on the largest military base
## ever created, and it is the role of Hacktivists to help the
                residents of the squat (o/k/a society) understand what it is they
                can do with the facilities (Internet) as part of a greater struggle
## to be human beings living in a social world." (Hirsh)

## Hirsh pits the Hacker against the Consumer as two seperate

14 of 27 10/4/25, 12:08 PM Anarchists on the Web · Anarchists on the Web · Omeka ... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fomekas.library.uvi...

## roles in capitalist society. Whereas the Hacker fights for
                freedom and actively pushes back against corporate and state
## control, the Consumer is content to live by the rules and
## regulations these powers enact on the population. Computer
                literacy is thus an important aspect of fighting back against the
## powers that be in the 21st century.

## Perhaps more importantly, however, is Hirsh's focus on
                copyright, propietary vs. open source software, and intellectual
                ownership. In the past, copyright largely existed for physical
                inventions, in the form of patents. But the rise of white collar
## and intellectual or creative work as industries in the past
## century, and more importantly, the rise of advertising,
                corporate branding, and merchandising, has shifted the idea of
                copyright from patents to more nebulous legal guidelines. The
## Internet has further complicated copyright. Piracy is
## exceptionally easy online, and due to the uncentralized,
                anarchistic design of the Internet, as discussed earlier, it is
## difficult for law enforcement agencies and corporations to
## catch pirates who share copyrighted materials online. This,
## Hirsh argues, is another area where the Hacker can resist
## government and corporate control.

                First, the anarchistic design of the Internet allows the Hacker to
                post intelligence unearthed by their exploits online in a manner
                that is virtually impossible for governments and corporations
## to stop, control, or keep from spreading. WikiLeaks, for
## example, has posted more than ten million documents stolen
## by hackers from entities such as the Central Intelligence
## Agency, the National Security Agency, the Church of
## Scientology, the British National Party, and the U.S.

                Department of Defense. So far in 2023, the year this exhibit
## was created, hackers have posted the U.S. No Fly List on
                BreachForums, a popular hacking forum. Authorities struggled
## for days to have the post taken down, and by the time they
                succeeded, the information had spread so far and wide it could
## no longer be contained.

## Secondly, the ability to develop and distribute open source
## software has undermined corporate control over technology.
                Alternative operating systems like Linux have stolen from the
## monopoly of Windows, and free, open source alternatives to
                subscription services like Adobe Suite and Microsoft Suite have
## become increasingly accessible and popular over the years.
                Cracked versions of propietary software are also distributed on
                online piracy sites, further taking away from the control large
## tech corporations have over the Internet.

## In this way, the Hacker has become a modern-day Robin Hood,
                stealing classified information, leaking documents, and making
## copyrighted, expensive software and entertainment free for
## the masses. When the Hacker helps the Consumer view the
                Internet as a tool of resistance rather than consumption and
                complacency, the Internet can exist as a tool for social change.
                from knapping to crapping: running riot

                pointing to informational zines on a variety of topics. Its section
                on hacktivism includes several resources about the history and

                practical application of hacking techniques, mostly related to
                creating viruses, finding ways to steal free Internet access or

## Much like Hirsh's article, "from knapping to crapping"
## advocates for education about the inner workings of
                computers and the Internet as a way of resisting corporate and
                government control. Much of the tutorials pointed to in "from
## knapping to crapping" focus on how to obtain products and
## services for free, either through piracy or through more
                straightforward thievery. Many anarchists online have pointed
                to the possibilities for destablizing private property that the
                Internet presents as part of its revolutionary potential. For
                example, Humanaesfera writes in 2018:
                "One of the most basic features of computing is the exact copy
                of information at almost zero cost. Even before the Internet,
## ever since the emergence of digital computers (especially
                PCs), there was already an extensive network of users around
## the world who transmitted free or pirated programs, files,
## books, images, codes, etc., on magnetic tapes or diskettes.
## The world wide web is nothing other than this data-copying
## network become automatic and instantaneous via
## telecommunication repeater stations, which span the entire
## globe with fiber optics, cables, and radio frequencies.

## The copying and dissemination of information thus becomes a
## universal community where data can be made available by
## anyone for everyone and vice versa. Moreover, this occurs
## almost in real time. It can include everything from live
                reporting on events to reserves of knowledge, both practical (
                how to fix things or even construct them) and theoretical. A
                multiplicity of reports equally accessible to all who sought
## them, combined with a variety of views on any given topic,
                allowed individuals to form fairly objective ideas about events
## and topics that affected their life.

## Digital transmissions of information fundamentally ignore
                scarcity, which forms the basis of private property, because
## such transmissions are themselves already copies. Not by

                chance, this word “copy” originated from the Latin copia — as
## in copiousness, meaning “abundance, ample supply,
                profusion, plenty” (from co- “together, with, in common” + ops
                [genitive opis] “power, wealth, ability, resources”).
                Yet this is absolutely intolerable in a society founded upon
                constant buying and selling, which requires everyone to strive
## tirelessly for the continued imposition of scarcity — i.e.,
## privation — as the absolute condition for survival within
## generalized competition." (Humanaesfera)

## Moreover, one of the most suggested forms of resistance
                offered to those looking to join the ranks of Internet anarchists
                is committing piracy. The article "How To Start a Hackbloc,"
## published by Hack This Zine! vol. 4 in 2006, suggests the
                following as ways to resist corporate control online:

             - Hold workshops on online security culture: showing people
                how to use and install tor/privoxy (secure proxy through onion
                routing), using SSL on IRC, off the record (for secure AIM chats),
                pgp/gpg, how to clear your system of temporary files, internet
## caches, "deleted" files, etc

             - Explore alternatives to copyrights / anti-copyright activism:
                have a 'pirate file share fest', set up file servers on the network,
## promoting creative commons/copyleft /anti-copyright media
## and projects

             - Have a "linux fest" and play with various distros and livecds,
                encouraging people to bring their machines + install or dual
## boot linux. (Hack This Zine!)

## Linux is another tool of resistance often talked about by
                anarchists online. As I have previously mentioned, Linux is an

                operating system often touted as an alternative to Microsoft
                Windows. It has been heavily criticized by tech companies for
                "encouraging piracy" and other acts of Internet crime, as there
## are no anti-piracy measures built into the software (unlike
## Windows Defender, which flags pirated files and can even
## prevent torrenting programs from running).

## Linux for Punks

                This informational zine, self-published by the author in 2009,
## guides readers through the process of setting up Linux, an
                open-source, free operating system meant to rival mainstream
## corporate operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or
## Apple macOS. The author includes satirical drawings of
                Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who railed against Linux for its
## connections to the anti-copyright and piracy movements,
## juxtaposed with quotes from Linux’s creators about the
## importance of not relying on corporate, privately-owned
## software.

                Linux has been around since the mid-1990s, and while it is not
                popular with the general population, it is highly popular among
                hackers, Cypherpunks and those interested in privacy, cyber-
## criminals, whistleblowers, and DIYers. There are two main
                reasons for Linux's relatively unpopularity: one, it requires a
## small amount of programming knowledge to install and use,
                which most of the population doesn't possess; and two, it does
                not come pre-installed on most computers. Manufacturers like
## Dell and Acer have agreements with Microsoft to sell their
## computers with Windows as the default operating system. All
## of Apple's computers use MacOS, and usually cannot run
## programs intended for Windows. Selling computers with these
## two standard operating systems pre-installed allows tech
                corporations to maintain a level of control over how users use
                their devices, and de-incentivizes the use of free, open source,

## community generated operating systems like Linux.

                However, whether the open source model is truly revolutionary
                or a good use of the potential for social change the Internet
                holds has been doubted by some:

## "The Linux system is produced collectively by many people
                from different parts of the world, collaborating together out of
                their own choice in order to produce a product for free. The free
## association of producers, production for use not exchange,
                international community: is this communism? Well maybe, but
## if it is, then communism is no big deal. Freeware may well
## reduce the revenue of commercial software houses a small
## amount. Certainly the communist impulse of those that
## produce for free is exemplary and should be recognised as
                such. But there seems little in this activity that truly threatens
## the status quo." (Antagonism)

## Nonetheless, Linux's enduring connections to the anti-
## copyright movement have made it popular among Internet
                anarchists. As the comic featured in "Linux for Punks" to the
23 of 27 10/4/25, 12:08 PM Anarchists on the Web · Anarchists on the Web · Omeka ... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fomekas.library.uvi...
                right indicates, Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft at the time
                of the zine's creation, famously stated that "Linux is a cancer
## that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to
## everything it touches."

## As Rickard Falkvinge wrote in his article "I Am a Pirate,"
                published in Hack This Zine! in 2006, it may be true that the
                financial losses corporations suffer from piracy isn't the real
                danger the crime poses. After all, to pirate software or media
                isn't necessarily to steal it—no physical product with attached
                production costs is taken, but rather, the publisher loses the
## potential of a sale. Instead, Falkvinge argues, the outrage
## generated surrounding piracy is more about monopoly and
                control:

## "Downloading is the old mass media model where there is a
                central point of control, a point with a 'responsible publisher',
## somebody who can be brought to court, forced to pay and so
## on. A central point of control from where everybody can
## download knowledge and culture, a central point that can
## grant rights and take them away as needed and as wanted.

## Culture and knowledge monopoly. Control.

## Filesharing involves simultaneous uploading and downloading
                by every connected person. There is no central point of control
                at all; instead we have a situation where the culture and the
## information flow organically between millions of different
## people." (Falkvinge)

                As I described at the beginning of this exhibit, the organization
                of the Internet follows an anarchist structure. Filesharing,
                torrenting, and piracy further exploits this anarchic design. The

                lack of centralized control within the Internet has long been a
                source of anxiety for governments and corporations alike, but
## has been exalted and joyfully manipulated by anarchists
                online. As these three items have shown, the struggle between
                the state and the people to claim the Internet as their own has
## been ongoing for decades. However, anarchists argue, if the
## population were to increase their skepticism and computer
## literacy, and understand how to use the Internet for means
                other than consumption, it might tip the needle of control away
## from governments and corporations in a more permanent way.
