## 11.6 Why is the notion of “discovery” contradictory?

               This is an anarchist FAQ. Its aim is to present what anarchism really stands
             for and indicate why you should become an anarchist.
             An Anarchist FAQ after 21 years
               For reasons too unimportant to discuss here, the 20th anniversary blog for
             An Anarchist FAQ (AFAQ) ended up on my personal blog rather than AFAQ’s
             “oﬀicial” one. Now I correct this by reposting it here as well as taking the
             opportunity to preface it with a few comments to mark 21 years since AFAQ
             was oﬀicially launched.
               This year, 2017, marks numerous anarchist related anniversaries besides
             AFAQ’s — most obviously, 100 years since the Russian Revolution (see section
             A.5.4). Given subsequent events, it is easy to forget that the overthrow of the
             Tsar was initially — and rightly — viewed as great event by all on the left. As
             information of the increasing social nature of the revolt — what Voline termed
             The Unknown Revolution — became better known, the far-left was
             increasingly enthused by the revolution: workers had formed soviets and were
             starting to organise unions and factory committees, peasants were taking
             back the land, and so on. The revolution — as Anarchists alone had argued
             during the failed revolution of 1905 — was going beyond political reform into
             a social revolution. Reports of the new, radical and functionally based
             democracy were avidly read across the Left and especially by Anarchists – it
             appeared that our vision of social revolution was coming true.
               By the early 1920s, Anarchists had broken with the new regime. Accounts of
             the dictatorial nature of the Bolsheviks could no longer be ignored –
             particularly when coming from eye-witnesses like Emma Goldman and
             Alexander Berkman as well as the reports of the delegates from syndicalist
             unions sent to the Second Congress of the Communist International and that
             of the newly formed Red International of Labour Unions. However, what
             Berkman termed The Bolshevik Myth held sway in the non-Anarchist left in
             spite of these facts becoming available. While this myth was slowly eroded as
             the evils of the regime became harder and harder to ignore, the damage had
             been done: the liberatory promise of revolution and of socialism became
             associated with its opposite.
               Anarchists were not surprised that State socialism became a new class
             system — we had, after all, predicted this from Proudhon and Bakunin
             onwards. However, this did not stop many on the left believing The Bolshevik
             Myth and today there are still many grouplets on the left (with impressive
             names which reﬂect aspirations rather than reality) which denounce Stalinism
             while seeking the “genuine” socialism of the Bolsheviks. As part of its goal to
             be a resource for Anarchists, AFAQ sought to show the links between the
             regime of Lenin and Trotsky and that of Stalin. It sought to show the
             ideological roots of the degeneration of the Revolution and to show that the
             post-hoc explanations ﬁrst postulated by Trotsky and regurgitated by
             Leninists to this day were inadequate.

               This was part of the aim of section H (on Marxism) and I think it was
             successful. Originally, it was going to be much bigger, too big as it turned out.
             So sections on the Russian Revolution which were originally planned to be in
             section H (including ones on Kronstadt and the Makhnovists) were moved to
             an appendix. This appendix, as noted in the 20th anniversary blog, is still
             incomplete but its most important points have been placed in section H,
             particularly in section H.6 which summarises why the Russian Revolution
             failed and, just as importantly, that anarchist warnings were proven correct. It
             shows how that favourite post-hoc excuse of Marxists – “objective
             circumstances” — does not explain what happened and how ideological and
             structural factors are much more signiﬁcant.
               Ideological, for the politics of the Bolsheviks played a key role. For example:
             their vision of socialism was impoverished, their analysis of the State was
             ﬂawed and their vanguardist perspective inherently hierarchical (see section
             H.5). Some of these ideological positions were unique to the Bolsheviks, many
             were simply Marxism (or at least social-democratic) as we show (not least, the
             prejudices in favour of centralisation and economic central-planning).
               Structural, for the prejudices of Bolshevik ideology played their part in the
             organisations and solutions they favoured. A perspective which assumes
             centralisation is “proletarian” and inherently “eﬀicient” builds certain types of
             organisation. These structures, in turn, produce certain forms of social
             relationships — namely, a division between rulers and ruled. Centralised
             bodies also produce a bureaucracy around them in order to make decisions
             and implement them.
               So the interaction of ideology and structure played its part and the
             “objective circumstances” pushed the embryonic bureaucratic class system in
             certain ways but they did not create it. In other words, while some kind of
             new class system was inevitable, the horrors of Stalinism can be said to be the
             product of the speciﬁc factors facing the Russian Revolution. A shorter civil
             war, for example, may have resulted in a less brutal regime in the 1930s.
             Note, less brutal — for Lenin’s regime was a bureaucratic State-capitalist
             party dictatorship and had been within six months of the October Revolution.
               Hopefully, AFAQ has shown that the real turning point of the revolution was
             not Kronstadt in 1921 but the spring of 1918 when the Bolsheviks made
             explicit what had always been implicit: that party power was more important
             than soviet democracy. It also shows that recent research conﬁrms that
             Berkman and Goldman were right (see my “From Russia with Critique,”
             Anarcho-Syndicalist Review, No. 69) and are far better guides to
             understanding what went wrong than turn-coats like Serge (see my “Victor
             Serge: The Worst of the Anarchists,” Anarcho-Syndicalist Review, No. 61).
               We need to learn the lessons of history rather than seek post-hoc
             rationalisations which will inevitably lead to a similar outcome in the unlikely
             event of a Bolshevik-style party gaining popular support as in 1917. I must
             stress unlikely, for as well as Leninists having little grasp on the actual course
             of the revolution after October, as discussed in section H.5.12 they also fail to
             understand that the Bolshevik party in 1917 did not act like modern-day
             vanguardists think it did. For if it had, as in 1905, then it would have been as
             counter-productive — when not irrelevant — as modern-day Leninist sects
             are. This does not mean there was no party bureaucracy – there was, with an
16 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             obvious negative impact before and after it seized power — but that it was
             usually ignored by the rank-and-ﬁle while being fought by Lenin: it was
             revolutionary during 1917 in spite of itself, its structures and its perspectives.
                Anarchists, of course, did not need to come up with post-hoc explanations
             for the failure of the Revolution. Our predictions and warnings were
             conﬁrmed — the State is not simply an instrument of economic class but has
             its own interests, nationalisation does not end capitalism but just replaces the
             boss by the bureaucrat, the State is centralised to ensure minority rule and
             cannot be used to abolish it, and so on. If Marxism paid anything other than
             lip-service to the idea of “scientiﬁc socialism” then all socialists would be
             anarchists.
                Talking of Marxism, the ﬁrst volume of Capital was published 150 years ago,
             in 1867, twenty years after Marx’s disgraceful diatribe against Proudhon, The
             Poverty of Philosophy. Looking at both works is interesting, not least because
             Marx singularly failed in 1867 to apply the methodology he denounced
             Proudhon for not following in 1847. Instead, he uses the very one he mocked
             the Frenchman for utilising – namely building an abstract model of capitalism
             — while also taking up Proudhon’s theory of exploitation he had likewise once
             ridiculed (see my “The Poverty of (Marx’s) Philosophy”, Anarcho-Syndicalist
             Review, No. 70). Ironically, if you ignore the facts and accept The Poverty of
             Philosophy as a valid critique of Proudhon then you also have to admit it is
             also a valid critique of Capital, which is not the book he criticised Proudhon
             for not writing in 1847.
                In many ways, The Poverty of Philosophy is the template of subsequent
             Marxist polemics on Anarchism (see section H.2 for a critique of the most
             common claims). It is full of so many distortions that it is nearly impossible to
             answer them all, not to mention the postulating of some notion — in this case,
             amongst many others, labour notes and idealism — that are just inventions.
             Take the latter. As one ex-Marxist academic noted:
                   “Despite Marx’s scornful criticism, it is not the case that Proudhon
                   regarded actual social conditions and economic forces as the
                   embodiment of abstract philosophical categories antecedent to
                   social reality. On the contrary, he is at pains to state that the
                   intellectual organisation of social reality in abstract categories is
                   secondary to that reality.” (Leszek Kolakowski, Main Currents of
                   Marxism [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978], vol. 1, p. 205)
               Which raises the obvious question: why did Marx suggest Proudhon was an
             idealist given that he obviously was not? Then again, this is hardly an isolated
             case and most Marxists have tended to follow this example when trying to
             critique anarchism. As informed readers of Marxist polemics against
             Anarchism will know, the notion of post-truth has existed far longer than most
             acknowledge.
               Given the level of nonsense in it, it is perhaps understandable why
             Proudhon did not bother replying — if personal and political events had not
             made responding diﬀicult, he surely would have thought no one who has read
             his book would take it seriously. He was right — except that the two volumes
             of System of Economic Contradictions are not an easy book and few readers
             of Marx bother to compare him to what Proudhon actually wrote. All in all, the
17 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             words of scientist (and, obviously, non-anarchist) Richard Dawkins against one
             of his critics are applicable here:
                   “we are in danger of assuming that nobody would dare to be so rude
                   without taking the elementary precaution of being right”. (“In
                   Defence of Selﬁsh Genes,” pp. 556–573, Philosophy, Vol. 56, No.
## 218, p. 556)

                Given that many Marxists regurgitate previous attacks on anarchism when
             putting pen to paper, it is not academic or obscure to discuss things like this.
             The echoes of Marx’s 1847 book are still being heard today and it aids our
             current activity and theory to understand what was wrong with that critique
             and subsequent ones. To not know our own history, to not know our own
             theorists, means being at a disadvantage against those who pretend to do.
                Beyond the dishonesty, Marx’s work is of note for the alternative he
             sketched to Proudhon’s market socialism — and “sketched” is being generous.
             It amounts to a few sentences and is rooted in generalising from an example
             of two workers and two products to an economy of millions of workers and
             products. Given this, perhaps it is not surprising that the Bolshevik
             experiment failed so spectacularly — Marx clearly had no notion of the need
             for gathering, processing and implementing the information required for
             central planning. He and Engels always presented this process as simple
             rather than the bureaucratic nightmare it would be.
                It should be said that Marx did make contributions to socialism and the
             understanding of capitalism. Even Bakunin recognised this and said so,
             repeatedly. This should not stop us recognising that he built upon an analysis
             started by others (not least, Proudhon) and that his arguments for practical
             activity were deeply ﬂawed. Bakunin, not Marx, was right about the fate of
             “political action” (in reformism) and the “dictatorship of the proletariat” (in
             tyranny).
                So on the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution, we can but hope that
             socialists will reﬂect on the ideological roots for the failure rather than seek
             solace in the post-hoc rationalisations began by Trotsky. After all, the
             Bolsheviks remained true to the vision of a centralised economic system
             based on nationalisation. As with Marx, workers’ self-management of
             production did not ﬁgure highly (if at all) in Bolshevik visions of “socialism” —
             unlike anarchists from Proudhon onwards. Similarly, they remained true to
             the vision of centralised, hierarchical and unitarian political structure even if
             it were based, nominally, on working class organisations, the soviets (workers
             councils), rather than the orthodox Marxist position of capturing and
             transforming the current State (see section H.3.10). As Kropotkin put it:
                   “It is therefore essential that to free themselves the masses who
## produce everything without being allowed to control the
                   consumption of what they produce, ﬁnd the means which enable
                   them to display their creative forces and to develop themselves new,
## egalitarian, forms of consumption and of production.

                   “The State and national representation cannot ﬁnd these forms. It is
                   the very life of the consumer and of the producer, his intellect, his

## organising spirit which must ﬁnd them and improve them by
## applying them to the daily needs of life.

                   “It is the same for forms of political organisation. In order to free
                   themselves from the exploitation they are subjected to under the
                   supervision of the State, the masses cannot remain under the
                   domination of the forms which prevent the blossoming of popular
                   initiative. These were developed by governments to perpetuate the
                   servitude of the people, to prevent it from letting its creative force
                   blossom and to develop institutions of egalitarian mutual aid. New
                   forms must be found to serve the opposite goal.” (La Science
                   moderne et l’anarchie [Paris: Stock, 1913], p. 323)
                This means that the Russian experience has conﬁrmed that socialism has to
             be free — libertarian — or not at all. Sadly, unlike when AFAQ was started 21
             years ago, “libertarian” has become increasingly associated with the right in
             Britain as it has in the United States. This is of obvious concern for all
             genuine libertarians. I have addressed the history of libertarian in AFAQ and
             its blog, which — like the revision of non-published appendices — has been
             somewhat quiet of late. An obvious exception was the posting of 160 years of
             Libertarian this year to mark the coining of libertaire by Joseph Déjacque. As
             well as including a new and complete translation of Déjacque’s 1857 “Open
             Letter” to Proudhon, it covers anarchist use of the term and the right’s
             attempt to steal the word.
                Suﬀice to say, the mess which is Wikipedia’s entry on “libertarian” shows
             how distinct Anarchism is from Liberalism — unsurprisingly, given that
             Proudhon’s seminal What is Property? and other works are obviously an
             extended critique of (classical) liberalism. For the right, “liberty” means little
             more than those with private power being able to restrict the freedom of the
             rest. What is annoying is that they use the good word “libertarian” to describe
             this regime of private power. Kropotkin’s words from 1913 are still as relevant
             now as then:
                   “In today’s society, where no one is allowed to use the ﬁeld, the
                   factory, the instruments of labour, unless he acknowledge himself
                   the inferior, the subject of some Sir — servitude, submission, lack of
                   freedom, the practice of the whip are imposed by the very form of
                   society. By contrast, in a communist society which recognises the
                   right of everyone, on an egalitarian basis, to all the instruments of
                   labour and to all the means of existence that society possesses, the
                   only men on their knees in front of others are those who are by their
                   nature voluntary serfs. Each being equal to everyone else as far as
                   the right to well-being is concerned, he does not have to kneel
                   before the will and arrogance of others and so secures equality in all
## personal relationships with his co-members.

                   “[…] We ﬁnally realise now that without communism man will never
                   be able to reach that full development of individuality which is,
                   perhaps, the most powerful desire of every thinking being. It is

## recognised for some time if we had not always confused
## individuation — that is to say, the complete development of
                   individuality — with individualism. Now, individualism – it is high
                   time to understand this — is nothing but the Every man for himself,
                   and the Devil take the hindmost of the bourgeoisie, who believed to
                   ﬁnd in it the means of freeing himself from society by imposing on
                   workers economic serfdom under the protection of the State” (Op.
## Cit., pp. 163–5)

               Of course, thanks to Bolshevism, “communism” is usually viewed to mean
             central-planning (or what Anarchists more accurately call State-capitalism —
             see section H.3.13) but we should not forget that Kropotkin simply meant
             distribution according to need rather than deed: which was what Joseph
             Déjacque had argued for in 1857 against Proudhon’s market socialism
             (distribution according to the products of labour). Nor should we forget the
             desire for genuine freedom, for the free association of equals rather than that
             of master-servants driven by economic necessity, which inspired the coining of
             the term “libertarian” in 1857 and its subsequent embrace by Anarchists
             world-wide. Hopefully recounting the origins of the word, showing how and
             why the propertarians stole it, will make more people refuse to let the right
             use it — we can only hope that by 40th anniversary of AFAQ they will be called
             propertarians by all…
               Finally, it is also 175 years from Kropotkin’s birth. I’m glad to note that the
             all-too-common notion of Kropotkin as “the gentle sage” is being replaced by
             a more accurate account of his politics. Rather than being one of the best
             served Anarchist thinkers in terms of their works, only a fraction of his
             writings is available in English. His articles for French, British and Russian
             anarchist papers are still mostly unknown and even his ﬁnal book, the last
             book published in his lifetime, 1913’s La Science moderne et l’anarchie has
             never been translated in full (although I have been working to remedy that
             and next year, 2018, will see AK Press ﬁnally publish Modern Science and
             Anarchy in English translation).
               So our understanding of Kropotkin’s works is to some degree incomplete.
             Many accounts of his ideas are based on his most general works, which
             cannot help but skew our understanding of his ideas. In short, his works most
             focused on the labour movement have not generally been published as
             pamphlets and when they have (such as the English-language work “Politics
             and Socialism”) they have rarely been reprinted. These articles help ﬂesh out
             why Anarchists are against the State, against using it to abolish capitalism,
             and what our alternative to electioneering is (see section J).
               Rather than oppose the State for idealistic reasons, Anarchist anti-Statism
             is based on a class analysis of it — the recognition that it exists to impose
             minority class rule and has developed speciﬁc features to do so. This means
             that utilising the bourgeois State — or a State, like the Bolsheviks, marked by
             centralisation and unitarian structures — will not create socialism. This is
             because the modern State is ﬁrst and foremost a bourgeois structure:
                   “the State, with its hierarchy of functionaries and the weight of its
                   historical traditions, could only delay the dawning of a new society
                   freed from monopolies and exploitation […] what means can the

                   State provide to abolish this monopoly that the working class could
                   not ﬁnd in its own strength and groups? […] what advantages could
                   the State provide for abolishing these same privileges? Could its
                   governmental machine, developed for the creation and upholding of
                   these privileges, now be used to abolish them? Would not the new
                   function require new organs? And these new organs would they not
                   have to be created by the workers themselves, in their unions, their
                   federations, completely outside the State?” (Kropotkin, Op. Cit., pp.
## 91–2)

               This shows the alternative to social democracy, namely militant labour
             struggle: what became known as syndicalism — although, as Direct Struggle
             Against Capital shows, Kropotkin had advocated it in the late 1870s and early
             1880s. The notion that there is a fundamental diﬀerence between anarchism
             and syndicalism cannot be supported (see section H.2.8). True, anarchism
             was initially reformist (Proudhon was opposed to strikes) but modern,
             revolutionary, anarchism was born in the First International and took a
             syndicalist position from the start. Kropotkin, like other revolutionary
             anarchists, took this “Bakuninist” position — although, like Bakunin, he did
             not think unions by themselves would inevitably be revolutionary and so also
             saw the need for anarchists to organise as anarchists to inﬂuence the class
             struggle (see section J.3).
               Likewise, we should not become ﬁxated on unions for in 1905 — twelve
             years before Lenin — Kropotkin saw the possibility of the soviets as a means
             of ﬁghting capitalism and statism and explicitly linked them to the Paris
             Commune:
                   “the workers’ Council […] had been appointed by the workers
                   themselves – just like the insurrectional Commune of August 10,
                   1792 — […] This very much reminds us of the Central Committee
                   which preceded the Paris Commune of 1871, and it is certain that
                   workers across the country should organise on this model […] these
                   councils represent the revolutionary strength of the working class.
                   […]
                   “This is direct action at work […] Let it not then be said that the
                   workers of the Latin nations, by preaching the general strike and
                   direct action, have taken the wrong path. The Russian working
                   people, by applying these for themselves, have proven that their
                   brothers in the West were perfectly right. […] it is certain that the
                   workers who succeeded in forcing the autocracy to capitulate will
                   also force capitalism to do so. They will do more. They will be able
                   to ﬁnd forms of communal industrial organisation. But ﬁrst they
                   must ﬁrst send packing the hypnotisers [endormeurs] who tell them:
                   ‘Just make the political revolution; it is too early for the social
                   revolution.’ […] and while the socialist theoreticians strove to prove
                   the impossibility of any general strike, they, the workers, began to
                   go through the workshops, putting a stop to work everywhere. […]
                   After a few days, the strike was absolutely general […] It was a
                   whole people going on strike […]

                   “A new force was thus established by the strike: the force of the
                   workers asserting themselves for the ﬁrst time and setting in motion
                   this lever of any revolution — direct action. […] It is equally obvious,
                   furthermore, that the revolution will not be the work of a few
                   months, but of several years. At the very least, what has been
                   accomplished so far proves that this revolution will be of a social
                   nature […] bourgeois elements have already faded behind the two
                   great forces of the peasants and the workers, and the two great
                   means of action have been the general strike and direct action.
                   “There is every reason to believe that the workers of the cities will
                   understand the strength conferred by direct action added to the
                   general strike and, imitating in this the peasant rebels, they will
                   likely be led to get their hands on all that is necessary to live and
                   produce. Then they can lay in the cities the initial foundations of the
                   communist commune.” (“L’Action directe et la Grève générale en
## Russie,” Les Temps Nouveaux, 2 December 1905)

               This, obviously, is echoed in La Science moderne et l’anarchie but it has its
             origins in the Bakunin and the Federalist wing of the First International, as
             reﬂected Kropotkin’s writings on the labour movement from the 1870s
             onwards (see Direct Struggle Against Capital for a representative selection
             across the decades) and ably explored by Robert Graham in ‘We Do Not Fear
             Anarchy – We Invoke It’: The First International and the Origins of the
             Anarchist Movement (Oakland/Edinburgh: AK Press, 2015). As Bakunin put it:
                   “Workers, no longer count on anyone but yourselves […] Abstain
                   from all participation in bourgeois radicalism and organise outside
                   of it the forces of the proletariat. The basis of that organisation is
                   entirely given: the workshops and the federation of the workshops;
                   the creation of funds for resistance, instruments of struggle against
                   the bourgeoisie, and their federation not just nationally, but
                   internationally. The creation of Chambers of Labour […] the
                   liquidation of the State and of bourgeois society […] Anarchy, that it
                   to say the true, the open popular revolution […] organisation, from
                   top to bottom and from the circumference to the centre” (“Letter to
## Albert Richard”, Anarcho-Syndicalist Review No. 62, p. 18)

               Kropotkin also pointed to the neighbourhood assemblies, or sections, of the
             Great French Revolution as a form of popular self-organisation which
             anarchists today could learn from (see chapters XXIV and XXV of The Great
             French Revolution, both included in Direct Struggle Against Capital). In this
             way would develop “independent Communes for the territorial groupings, and
             vast federations of trade unions for groupings by social functions — the two
             interwoven and providing support to each to meet the needs of society”.
             Added to these are the “groupings by personal aﬀinities — groupings without
             number, inﬁnitely varied, long-lasting or ﬂeeting, emerging according to the
             needs of the moment for all possible purposes”. These “three kinds of
             groupings” would ensure “the satisfaction of all social needs: consumption,
             production and exchange, communications, sanitary arrangements, education,
22 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             mutual protection against aggression, mutual aid, territorial defence; the
             satisfaction, ﬁnally, of scientiﬁc, artistic, literacy, entertainment needs.”
             (Kropotkin, La Science moderne et l’anarchie, pp. 92–3)
               So Kropotkin is very clear that the link between now and the future is
             forged in the struggle and so — see section I.2.3 — we build the framework of
             Anarchism by our struggles against Capital, State and other forms of
             hierarchy (such as patriarchy, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc.). Also of
             note is his comment that the revolution would not take months, but years.
             This shows that notions of “overnight” revolution habitually ﬂung at
             anarchists by Marxists — see section I.2.2 — are nonsense. As such, we must
             remember that Anarchism is something for the here-and-now and that we
             must think in terms of a long-term strategy.
               All of which points to Kropotkin as a realistic revolutionary and advocate of
             class struggle as the means of creating a better world rather than some sort
             of “gentle sage” with utopian visions, as some seem to think (see my
               Anarcho-Syndicalist Review No. 64/5 for a summary). Yet this does not
             mean we have an “unknown” Kropotkin for his revolutionary class struggle
             politics were there to be found even in his well-known “general” works if you
             were prepared to look: sadly, neither the British reformist Anarchists of the
             post-war period nor the Marxists were going to do that!
               So 21 years on, we have a better notion of the Anarchist tradition than ever
             before and I hope AFAQ played its part in that. Simplistic accounts – which
             seem to be based on little more than looking up “Anarchism” in the dictionary
             — should be harder to produce. It will take a particularly studious ignorance
             to proclaim Anarchism is just “anti-State” given its actual history as a theory
             and a movement. Still, we can sadly expect the right and left — for their own
             reasons — to continue to ignore Anarchism’s socialist core. At least we have
             resources like AFAQ to show the accuracy of such claims.
               When AFAQ was started, in the early 1990s, neo-liberalism appeared to be
             triumphant, “socialism” (i.e., Stalinism) had just collapsed and the “great
             moderation” was proclaimed. Yet the triumphalism could not hide the
             problems facing society — not least, the ever-increasing inequality as well as
             ecological crisis. Come the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–8 – caused, in part,
             because the neo-liberal assault on the working class had been too successful
             — the critique of capitalism and various economic theories developed to
             defend it AFAQ had summarised proved its usefulness (see section C)
               After a rush to State-intervention — blowing the dust of Keynes and, for a
             few, even Marx — to stabilise the situation (at least for the few), the rush to
             austerity (at least for the many) began. AFAQ had summarised (in section
             C.9.1) why cutting wages would be counter-productive — and so it was.
             Austerity was proven to be counter-productive, making the situation worse as
             predicted by anyone who did not worship the holy textbooks of neo-classical
             or “Austrian” economics — even the most neo-classical Keynesian economist
             grasped the situation. Yet class interests and its ideologues proved — as
             would be expected — more signiﬁcant.
               In the UK, the Tories rushed to inﬂict austerity onto society and blamed a
             crisis caused by the elite on welfare provision for the many. Unlike in Greece
             and elsewhere in Europe, austerity was not imposed upon the government by
             the heavy hand of the EU but was embraced willingly – so killing oﬀ a

             recovery and stalling the economy for two years. When growth ﬁnally
             returned, austerity was proclaimed vindicated in spite of the critics being
             proven correct. Worse, it returned to trend growth without the higher growth
             usually associated with an exit from recession. Still, the utter failure of
             austerity did not stop Tory politicians in the UK proclaiming its necessity
             years later — while holding up austerity-struck Greece to warn against the
             horrors of not imposing austerity. Logic and reality will always come a distant
             last when defending the powers and the proﬁts of the few. Little has changed
             since 1846 when Proudhon sarcastically noted:
                   “Political economy — that is, proprietary despotism — can never be
                   in the wrong: it must be the proletariat.” (Property is Theft!, p. 187)
                The crisis produced popular resistance, although obviously not enough.
             Anarchists took part in these struggles against austerity. This caused some
             commentators problems — why were Anarchists protesting against
             governments seeking to reduce the State? Yet Anarchism has never been just
             anti-State (surely “property is theft” shows that?). We are against the State
             because it defends that property and theft, so using economic crisis to impose
             austerity is State activity simply as a weapon for the few against the many.
                Anarchists do not side with the State against its subjects. Rather we ﬁght
             with our fellow workers against attempts by governments to save capitalism
             by pushing the costs of so doing onto the general population. This does not
             mean we favour State welfare any more than any other State activity. Welfare,
             like the State itself, must be abolished from below by the many, not from
             above by the few seeking to increase their wealth and power (see section
             J.5.15). Similarly, the alternative to nationalisation (or bailouts) is not
             privatisation but rather socialisation — workers’ control. As Kropotkin
             suggested, echoing Proudhon (General Idea of the Revolution, p. 151), there
             is a lack of imagination and class analysis in State socialism:
                   “Well, it is to increase the capital owned by the modern bourgeois
                   States that the radicals and socialists are working today. They did
                   not even bother to discuss — like English co-operators asked me one
                   day — if there were no way to hand over the railways directly to the
                   railway-workers’ trade-unions, to free the enterprise from the yoke
                   of the capitalist, instead of creating a new capitalist, even more
                   dangerous than the bourgeois companies, the State.” (Op. Cit., p.
## 325)

                Needless to say, the much more extensive welfare State for the rich should
             be targeted for reduction and eventual elimination long before anything else
             is even considered for reform.
                Such popular struggles against privatisation or austerity — against the
             decisions and actions of the State against its subjects, never forget – will build
             the conﬁdence and organisations needed to really change things, to really
             reduce the authority of the State and win improvements in the here-and-now.
             Indeed, the UK anti-union laws show that our masters know this, know where
             our real power lies: not in Parliament but in our workplaces and streets. This
             — direct action and solidarity — is what creates the possibility for revolution.

                Neo-liberalism has singularly failed in terms of the promises it made
             (“trickle down,” its anti-union arguments, productivity growth has trended
             down since the 1980s, the private proﬁteering associated with previously
             nationalised industries, etc., etc., etc.) — however, it did make the rich richer,
             its usually unstated goal, and all that can be forgiven and forgotten. However,
             its limitations are being felt — it is in danger of so hollowing out society that
             capitalism itself is threatened. This is being reﬂected in the ballot box. As
             discussed in section D.1, we may be at one of those points where, thanks to
             popular discontent and the pressing need to maintain the system, the State is
             used more to repair the damage that an inherently unstable capitalism inﬂicts
             on society than it is used to bolster the property and power of the few.
                Yet we must never forget the nature of the State as an instrument of
             minority classes and that there are vested interests at work (see section B.2).
             This means that leaving change to politicians will result in little improvement.
             We need an anti-parliamentary movement:
                   “We see in the incapacity of the statist socialist to understand the
                   true historical problem of socialism a gross error of judgement […]
                   To tell the workers that they will be able to introduce the socialist
                   system while retaining the machine of the State and only changing
                   the men in power; to prevent, instead of aiding, the mind of the
                   workers progressing towards the search for new forms of life that
                   would be their own — that is in our eyes a historic mistake which
## borders on the criminal.” (Kropotkin, Op. Cit., pp. 124–5)

               The lesson of both the rise of social democracy at the end of the nineteenth
             and Bolshevik success in 1917 is that Anarchists need to organise to inﬂuence
             the class struggle, to present a real alternative both in terms of visions of
             tomorrow and how to win improvements today. The latter is more important in
             many ways for without that we will never be in a position to create the
             former: we will be an isolated sect complaining from the side-lines rather a
             key factor in moving society towards freedom. As 1917 shows, without an
             eﬀective organised anarchist movement then others will take advantage of the
             situation — by using ideas and actions previously raised by Anarchists — for
             non-Anarchist ends.
               The key, then, is to ﬁnd positive areas to apply anarchist ideas, to encourage
             those subject to hierarchies to assert themselves and change themselves
             while changing their conditions. Only the struggle for freedom can make us
             able to live as free and equal individuals: that means we need be part of social
             struggle and self-organisation, in other words we need “Anarchy in Action”
             (see section J). Without that, Anarchy remains a dream — and the powers of
             State and Capital will continue to crush what little freedom we have.
             Resistance is fertile — and why direct action is always opposed by the
             authorities and their ideological shrills.
               In 2017 it is clear we Anarchists have much to do. Time will tell if we are up
             to the challenge — but one thing is sure, as Kropotkin said only those who do
             nothing make no mistakes.

             An Anarchist FAQ after 20 years
                It is now 20 years since An Anarchist FAQ (AFAQ) was oﬀicially launched
             and six years since the core of it was completed (version 14.0). It has been
             published by AK Press as well as translated into numerous languages. It has
             been quoted and referenced by other works. So it has been a success —
             although when it was started I had no idea what it would end up like.
                I am particularly happy that AK Press took the time and invested the
             resources to turn it into a book. Volume 1 of AFAQ (sections A to F plus the
             appendix on “The Symbols of Anarchy”) was published in 2008 followed by
             volume 2 (sections H to J, slightly abridged) in 2012. Both volumes are
             impressive in both size and presentation — they look lovely.
                Since then, though, there has been little done — a revision of an appendix
             about a laughingly bad Marxist anti-anarchist diatribe (more or less a copy of
             Hal Draper’s equally bad Two Souls of Socialism). The unﬁnished appendix on
             the Russian Revolution remains so and the other appendices need to be
             revised. I hope to correct this by the 30th anniversary of AFAQ but no
             promises!
                In my defence, I have been busy. Numerous other articles and reviews have
             been produced thanks to the work embodied into AFAQ and it has produced
             two other books: anthologies of Proudhon’s and Kropotkin’s works (Property
             is Theft! and Direct Struggle Against Capital, respectively). Both came about
             due to the research AFAQ needed — it showed that the picture we had of both
             key thinkers was not completely accurate. Both conﬁrm the analysis of AFAQ
             on the nature of anarchism (i.e., libertarian socialism) and its history. Both
             would have been helpful in days-past when debating propertarians (right-wing
             “libertarians”) and Marxists.
                Taking Proudhon, before Property is Theft! very little of his voluminous
             writings had been translated into English and much of his writings —
             particularly his journalism and polemics during the 1848 revolution — were
             unknown. We now have a better idea of his ideas and contribution to
             anarchism as well as allowing various false, but commonplace, assertions
             about his ideas to be refuted.[1] Marx’s claim that he advocated “Labour
             Notes” (i.e., pricing and payment by hours worked) was simply a baseless
             assertion made in the face of clear evidence in System of Economic
             Contradictions to the opposite (he advocated generalising “bills of exchange”
             as many commentators correctly noted).[2] The Poverty of Philosophy is, as
             Proudhon noted at the time, “the libel of one doctor Marx” and should be
             dismissed as “a tissue of crudities, slanders, falsiﬁcations, and plagiarism.”[3]
             Sadly, this deeply dishonest work has shaped our perception of Proudhon
             (even in the anarchist movement) but hopefully the real Proudhon — advocate
             of self-managed (market) socialism — will become better known.[4]
                It also became clear that those who most loudly proclaimed their allegiance
             to Proudhon, namely Benjamin Tucker and other (but not all) individualist
             anarchists, were very selective in what they took from him. Proudhon’s
             critique of wage-labour and corresponding advocacy of self-management and
             socialisation were lost on Tucker.[5] Revolutionary anarchism is closer to
26 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             Proudhon’s ideas than those who claimed his mantle — but this championing
             of Proudhon by Tucker shaped how many viewed the Frenchman and yet
             another false image (albeit less false than the one Marx invented) was
             created.
               Similarly with Kropotkin — while more of his writings were available in
             English, these were the more general introductions to anarchism and his
             “day-to-day” journalism in the anarchist press (particularly the French) was
             unknown. This gave a somewhat skewed impression of his ideas and helped
             those seeking to portray him as a utopian or reformist (whether Marxists or
             self-proclaimed anarchists). This was because while the key texts on ends
             were readily available, the texts on means were less so. This does not excuse
             those — like the reformist (“liberal”) wing of British anarchism in the 1960s
             onwards (and who were readily echoed by Marxists) — who portrayed
             Kropotkin as anything other than the revolutionary, class struggle anarchist
             he was for even these general works included references to unions, strikes,
             insurrections and so forth. Moreover, Caroline Cahm’s excellent book
             Kropotkin and the Rise of Revolutionary Anarchism, 1872–1886 has shown
             this aspect of anarchism since 1989 — indeed, Direct Struggle Against Capital
             owes a great deal to her research in tracking down numerous key articles
             from Kropotkin’s early journalism.
               These two works also indicate another improvement over the past 20 years
             – the increase in good quality research on anarchism and anarchists. We have
             had Emma Goldman’s papers published while AK Press has just started the
             publication of Errico Malatesta’s Collected Works. Shawn Wilbur continues
             his sterling work making Proudhon accessible and, moreover, has translated
             Bakunin’s Collected Works for PM Press. Nestor Makhno’s writings and
             autobiographies are also available in English. To name just a few amongst a
             host of excellent histories of movements and individuals.
               All this is very welcome but more is needed — thinkers like Luigi Fabbri
             need their works available in English and key source materials (such as James
             Guillaume’s L’internationale: documents et souvenirs) are also in need of
             translation. Even for ﬁgures like Kropotkin, a whole wealth of material in
             French, Russian and English which remains inaccessible and/or untranslated
             in archives.[6] However, such research and translation is time and resource
             consuming and few anarchists have much of either (being working class
             people in the main, we need to both earn a living and have a social life). Yet
             compared to where the movement was when AFAQ was started, we have seen
             signiﬁcant progress. I hope that my work has helped this in some way. One
             thing is sure, AFAQ does save a lot of time because it can be referenced when
             the all-too-often myths about anarchism are raised (yet again!) by Marxists,
             propertarians and others.
               As with any project, once it was completed I realised how I should have
             started. What is clear now is that the usual account of anarchism which starts
             in the distant past before discussing William Godwin and Max Stirner is not
             right. Regardless of their merits, neither of these people inﬂuenced the rise of
             anarchism as a theory or a movement. Indeed, both were discovered by a fully
             developed anarchist movement in the 1890s and, ironically, the only impact
             Stirner had in his lifetime was on Marx and what became Marxism (needless
             to say, Marx distorted Stirner’s ideas just as much as he did Proudhon’s or
27 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             Bakunin’s).
               Anarchism developed in the context of the French workers’ movement and
             so embodied the legacies of the French Revolution (and its “Anarchists”) as
             well as the critique of liberalism and capitalism current within French radical
             circles. Proudhon’s seminal What is Property? was not written in a social
             vacuum nor did his ideas develop without a social and intellectual context.
             Anarchism, then, was born in the context of the rising labour movement. It
             ﬂows from the associationist ideas raised by French workers faced with
             industrialisation — that is, proletarianisation. They rejected the inequalities
             and hierarchies associated with the rise of capitalism as sought to apply
             democratic ideas within the workplace and so abolish wage-labour by
             association.
               This reﬂected workers during the Great French Revolution about whom one
             building employer moaned, “by an absurd parody of the government, regard
             their work as their property, the building site as a Republic of which they are
             jointly citizens, and believe in consequence that it belongs to them to name
             their own bosses, their inspectors and arbitrarily to share out the work
             amongst themselves.”[7] Proudhon echoed this position repeatedly throughout
             his works:
                   “Workers’ Associations are the locus of a new principle and model of
                   production that must replace present-day corporations [...] The
                   principle that prevailed there, in place of that of employers and
                   employees [...] is participation [...] There is mutuality, in fact, when
                   in an industry, all the workers, instead of working for an owner who
## pays them and keeps their product, work for one another and
                   thereby contribute to a common product from which they share the
                   proﬁt.”[8]
               Workers’ self-management of production by means of associations has been
             a part of anarchism from the start (from What is Property?: “leaders [...] must
             be chosen from the workers by the workers themselves”[9]) and any form of
             “anarchism” which rejects this in favour of factory fascism (wage-labour) is
             hardly libertarian.
               This means that the all-too-common notion of anarchism being a fusion
             (confusion!) of “socialism” (presumably Marxism) and liberalism is simply
             wrong. Anarchism is a school of socialism (“the no-government system of
             socialism”, to quote Kropotkin[10]) and cut its teeth critiquing liberalism and
             the class-ridden, unequal and unfree society it was creating. It was then
             members of this well-deﬁned movement who could look back at the likes of
             Godwin and popular movements note similarities between their ideas on the
             state, property, etc. and those which had arisen later and, crucially,
             independently of them. These pre-1840 thinkers and movements can be better
             described as anarchistic rather than anarchist as such.
               This analysis of where anarchism comes from is relevant to current events.
             Take inequality, or more correctly the recognition within mainstream politics
             and journalism that massive inequality exists and is rising. When AFAQ was
             started, this was generally denied but now the recognition of reality is at least
             acknowledged and, often, deplored, by some of the elite (usually politicians
             seeking votes). The denials of reality could be surreal — I remember reading
28 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             an edition of the Economist at the turn of the millennium which had
             editorialised that the 20th century had shown Marx’s predictions of a tiny
             minority of wealthy capitalists surrounded by a sea of impoverished
             proletarians to be false while, a few pages elsewhere, had a report on how
             inequality in America and elsewhere in the West had exploded so resulting in
             a few very wealthy people and the rest stagnating. The contradiction between
             ideology (faith) and reality (facts) could not have been more obvious — at
             least if you weren’t the editors or a true believer in capitalism.
                Perhaps needless to say, the reasons why this has happened have been
             much discussed but as it has been within a neo-classical framework it has not
             gotten very far. This is understandable as that ideology was developed
             precisely to rationalise and justify the inequalities of capitalism and not to
             explain them (see section C). Taking an anarchist analysis (as ﬁrst expounded
             by Proudhon before being taken up by Marx) it is easy to understand why
             inequality has expounded. As section C.2 indicates, labour is exploited by
             capital and the former has been weakened over the last four decades by neoliberalism (not least by increased state regulation of unions) and so workers
             cannot retain more of the value we produce as the product is monopolised by
             the owning class and senior management.
                This means, for example, that the exploding wages of CEOs is not an
             example of “market failure” as some claim but rather an expression of how
             the capitalist market is meant to work.[11] Which all ﬂows back to where
             anarchism came from, namely the (French) workers’ movement, and what it
             was born ﬁghting, namely a rising capitalism and its ideological expression of
             (classical) liberalism.
                Thus we ﬁnd John Locke’s just-so story justifying property results “by a tacit
             and voluntary consent” to “a disproportionate and unequal Possession of the
             Earth”[12] Yet any agreement between the owners and proletariat would
             favour the former and once the worker has consented to being under the
             authority of the wealthy then her labour and its product is no longer hers:
             “Thus the grass my horse has bit;
                the Turfs my Servant has cut; and the Ore I have digg’d… become my
             Property.” The workers’ labour “hath ﬁxed my [the employer’s] property” in
             both the product and common resources worked upon.[13] Locke’s defence of
             property as resting on labour becomes the means to derive the worker of the
             full product of her labour[14] — as intended.
                Compare this with anarchism. Proudhon’s analysis brings him into conﬂict
             with Locke and the liberal tradition. Rejecting the notion that master-servant
             contracts were valid, he dismisses its basis of property in the person in a few
             words: “To tell a poor man that he has property because he has arms and legs,
             — that the hunger from which he suﬀers, and his power to sleep in the open
             air are his property, — is to play with words, and add insult to injury.”
             Property, then, is solely material things — land, workplaces, etc. — and their
             monopolisation results in authoritarian relationships. To “recognise the right
             of territorial property is to give up labour, since it is to relinquish the means
             of labour”, which results in the worker having “sold and surrendered his
             liberty” to the proprietor. This alienation of liberty is the means by which
             exploitation happens. Whoever “labours becomes a proprietor” of his product
             but by that Proudhon did “not mean simply (as do our hypocritical
29 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             economists)” — and Locke — the “proprietor of his allowance, his salary, his
             wages” but “proprietor of the value which he creates, and by which the
             master alone proﬁts.” Locke is also clearly the target for Proudhon’s comment
             that “the horse […] and ox […] produce with us, but are not associated with
             us; we take their product, but do not share it with them. The animals and
             workers whom we employ hold the same relation to us.”[15]
               As noted, the rise in inequality is even acknowledged by those who helped
             create it. Thus we ﬁnd the Economist[16] admitting that “Liberalism depends
             on a belief in progress but, for many voters, progress is what happens to
             other people. While American GDP per person grew by 14% in 2001–15,
             median wages grew by only 2%.” The journal also states that “liberals also
             need to restore social mobility and ensure that economic growth translates
             into rising wages” yet social mobility falling while inequality rises should be
             unsurprising (it is easier to climb a hill than a mountain) as is the awkward
             fact that the least “liberal” nations (continental Europe) have higher social
             mobility than the USA or UK (“liberal” nations). As for increasing wages, the
             neo-liberal agenda has been to regulate workers and our unions by anti-union
             laws to stop just that happening which makes a mockery of the claim that
             “[i]n the 1970s liberals concluded that the embrace of the state had become
             smothering and oppressive.”[17] It is not hard to conclude that for “liberals”
             state intervention against workers is just normal — just like defence of
             capitalist property-rights is not oppressive. Rest assured, their solution to the
             problems caused by neo-liberalism is yet more neo-liberalism: “a relentless
             focus on dismantling privilege by battling special interests, exposing
             incumbent companies to competition and breaking down restrictive
             practices.” Which was, as discussed in section J.4.2, the rhetoric used to
             increase state regulation of unions which, in turn, produced all the evils the
             journal is bemoaning now and which are the opposite outcome to those
             promised to justify this onslaught on working people and our organisations.
               We should not be surprised. Let us not forget that belief is deﬁned as “an
             acceptance that something exists or is true, especially one without proof”
             (such as Locke’s stories which underlie liberalism in all its forms, particularly
             propertarianism). Anarchists, however, prefer to study the facts and draw
             conclusions based on them. The facts of the last few decades clearly support
             Proudhon’s analysis — rising productivity and level wages show that workers
             are exploited in production and allows the few to monopolise the gains
             derived from productivity increases. He also indicated in System of Economic
             Contradictions how the favoured “solution” of liberalism — more competition
             — resulted in monopolies (i.e., big companies) which meant that the amount
             of investment needed to enter the market was an objective barrier which, as
             well as reducing competition, turned the bulk of the population into wageworkers who have “sold their arms and parted with their liberty” to the few.
             [18]
               Thus the social question remains fundamentally the same as when Proudhon
             took pen to paper. As is its answer: to end these social problems means
             ending master-servant relations within the workplace by means of association
             and abolishing the state that protects them by means of federalism. An
             account of anarchism which ignores all this would be a travesty and produce
             false picture of what anarchism is and what counts as anarchist.[19] Sadly, this

             false picture still exists in academic and other works — based on little more
             than if someone calls themselves an anarchist then they are. Few (bar the
             propertarians who fail to recognise the oxymoronic nature of “anarcho”-
             capitalism) would tolerate adding Nazism to accounts of socialism based on
             them having “socialist” in their party name — but even this low bar seems to
             be considered too high for some when it comes to discussing anarchism!
                AFAQ was started in the early 1990s, just after the collapse of Stalinism
             (“socialism” or “communism”) and the corresponding triumphalism of neoliberals. Japanese-style corporate capitalism was in its “lost decade” and neoliberalism was being accepted as “common-sense” within the leadership of
             the “oﬀicial” opposition (the British Labour Party and its equivalents
             elsewhere). Yet within ten years, we had the bursting of the dot com bubble
             and a deep crisis in East-Asia. The latter saw economies previously praised by
             advocates of capitalism as being a heaven of “free-market” policies become,
             overnight, statist nightmares. Such is the power of ideology.
                Then came the crisis of 2007–8, a crisis caused by neo-liberal policies which
             — incredible as it may seem — became the means of imposing more of said
             policies in the name of “Austerity”. The Tories in the UK were particularly
             good (if that is the right word!) at turning a crisis caused by the 1% and their
             favoured policies into one apparently caused by New Labour not letting single
             mothers starve. While the narrative of the crisis turned the facts on their
             head, they could not stop the policies being implemented dragging out the
             crisis and turning it into the slowest recovery on record. So the ﬁnancial crisis
             showed the bankruptcy of neo-classical economics in two senses. First,
             mainstream economists did not predict it (while post-Keynesian economists
             did). Second, the notion of “expansionary austerity” was tried and proven to
             be as nonsensical as even the mainstream (“bastard”) Keynesians predicted.
             This resulted in a downward spiral whenever it was tried – whether Greece or
             the UK (so conﬁrming section C.9 of AFAQ). However, the critics being proven
             correct was not considered good enough and so when growth — ﬁnally! —
             returned to the UK, the architects of this harmful policy were proclaimed by
             the much of mainstream press (including the Financial Times) to have been
             vindicated! Why? Simply because, as with Milton Friedman (see section C.8),
             the Tories made the rich richer and skewed state intervention even further
             towards the few.[20]
                The global economic crisis rolls on — a classic example, as per section C.7,
             of a crisis caused by labour being too weak. We have seen the “traditional”
             left ride the wave of protest in many countries and divert it into
             parliamentarian avenues — were it quickly died. The example of Greece is the
             classic example with a left-wing anti-austerity party (Syriza) elected only for it
             to end up imposing even more stringent austerity measures than before. This
             conﬁrmed our analysis in section J.2 of AFAQ on why anarchists reject
             electioneering and support direct action. The pressures on left-wing
             governments from big business and capital, the willingness the state
             bureaucracy (the civil service, etc.) to frustrate the policies and decisions of
             popularly elected governments, all played their role even without the years of
             campaigning for votes which have traditionally watered-down radical parties
             long before they achieve oﬀice (but not real power). Still, we are sure the
             true-believers will proclaim that next time they will not make the same
31 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             mistakes as the Social Democrats, the Greens, and now Syriza. And state
             socialists call anarchists utopians…
               So while proclaiming itself “Scientiﬁc Socialism” (an expression, like so
             much of Marxism, appropriated from Proudhon), it adherents seem
             wonderfully immune from learning from experience. Marxism continues,
             albeit in smaller numbers, to put countless numbers oﬀ socialism by
             presenting the cure (socialism) as being worse than the disease (capitalism).
             This may explain why Marxists so regularly distort anarchist ideas — if
             Marxism were so robust they would have no need to invent nonsense about
             anarchism. Yet they do — and section H.2 continues to be of use in replying to
             them. It may also explain why some Marxists prefer to invoke the Spanish
             Revolution than the Russian (understandably given how bad Lenin’s regime
             was!) or seek to associate their ideology with far more appealing forms of
             socialism (such as syndicalism[21]). Again, AFAQ is there to show the ﬂaws in
             such attempts — and to show that much of what passes for “Marxism” was
             ﬁrst expounded by anarchists[22] but without the authoritarian and
             metaphysical baggage.
               Anarchists have long critiqued state socialism but on the assumption
             (sometimes unstated or mentioned in passing) that we were the genuine
             socialists. The logic is simple enough — the state is a hierarchical body and so
             based on inequality and so state socialism violated socialist principles
             (namely, equality) and could not, therefore, produce a socialist society. This
             was based on empirical evidence which shows that states developed to impose
             minority rule and the conclusion that, as a result, it cannot be used to end it.
             As Proudhon argued:
                   “And who beneﬁts from this regime of unity? The people? No, the
                   upper classes […] Unity, today and since 1815, is quite simply a
                   form of bourgeois exploitation under the protection of bayonets. Yes,
                   political unity, in the great States, is bourgeois: the positions which
                   it creates, the intrigues which it causes, the inﬂuences which it
                   cherishes, all that is bourgeois and goes to the bourgeois.”[23]
                Even if we smash the existing state and replace it with a new one (marked,
             like all states, by centralisation and hierarchy, even an elected one) then it
             will just reproduce a new class system (this is a major theme of section H).
             The centralised, hierarchical, state is “the cornerstone of bourgeois despotism
             and exploitation”[24] and “nothing resembles a monarchy more than a
             unitarian republic [république unitaire].”[25] It would be wishful thinking to
             conclude that an institutional structure so well suited to minority rule could
             produce a classless society and, as the Bolshevik regime showed (section
             H.6), we anarchists were proven correct.
                Yet with Leninism and Social-Democracy becoming so dominant, anarchists
             often stopped calling themselves socialists or communists in order to distance
             themselves (understandably!) from both. If most people understood
             “communism” to be the Soviet Union then talking about a libertarian, or free,
             communism may be confusing. Similarly, if “socialism” meant centralisation
             and nationalisation (rather than federalism and workers’ self-management) or
             slowly making capitalism slightly better (rather than replacing it with
             something better) then it is understandable that some anarchists would drop
32 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             the term. Simply put the anarchist vision of socialism was at odds with what
             most people considered it to mean:
                   “socialism is... the extinction of poverty, the elimination of
                   capitalism and of wage labour, the transformation of property, the
                   decentralisation of government, the organisation of universal
                   suﬀrage, the eﬀective and direct sovereignty of the workers, the
                   balance of economic forces, the substitution of the contractual
                   regime for the legal regime, etc., etc.”[26]
               Sadly, some took anti-statism as the deﬁning characteristic of anarchism
             and forgot the underlying assumption of socialism. AFAQ showed that this
             was not the case. It also debunked the nonsense of “anarcho”-capitalism (in
             section F) and subsequent research has shown that the notion of a nonsocialist “anarchism” is at odds with the history of anarchism as both a theory
             and a movement. Even the individualist anarchists — who were the closest to
             classical liberalism — rejected capitalist property-rights and recognised that
             capitalism exploited the worker (see section G). Ignoring this Proudhoninﬂuenced analysis and the rough equality its advocate’s expected it to
             produce results in something very much at odds with their aspirations.
             However, “anarcho”-capitalists are, as when AFAQ was started, just an
             annoyance for a few zealots on the internet and some academics funded by
             propertarian “think-tanks” or wealthy backers does not equate to a movement
             — particularly given the obvious theoretical contradiction between claiming
             to be “libertarian” while supporting authoritarian social relationships (namely,
             private hierarchies — section B.1). As Kropotkin summarised:
                   “They understand that, as they live amidst sociable creatures, such
                   as men are, they never would free themselves if they tried to free
                   themselves alone, individually, without taking the others into
                   account. To have the individual free, they must strive to constitute a
                   society of equals, wherein every one would be possessed of equal
                   rights to the treasuries of knowledge and to the immense wealth
                   accumulated by mankind and its civilisation, wherein nobody should
                   be compelled to sell his labour (and consequently, to a certain
                   degree, his personality) to those who intend to exploit him.
                   “This is why Anarchy necessarily is Communist, why it was born
## amidst the international Socialist movement, and why an
                   individualist, if he intends to remain Individualist, cannot be an
## Anarchist.

                   “He who intends to retain for himself the monopoly of any piece of
                   land or property, or any other portion of the social wealth, will be
                   bound to look for some authority which could guarantee to him
                   possession of this piece of land, or this portion of the modern
                   machinery ― so as to enable him to compel others to work for him.
                   “Either the individual will join a society of which all the members
                   own, all together, such a territory, such machinery, such roads, and
33 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   so on, and utilise them for the life of all ― and then he will be a
                   Communist; or he will apply to some sort of authority, placed above
                   society, and obtain from it the right of taking, for his own exclusive
                   and permanent use, such a portion of the territory or the social
                   wealth. And then he will NOT be an Anarchist: he will be an
                   authoritarian.”[27]
                Hopefully academics will do their research and start to exclude “anarcho”-
             capitalism from accounts of anarchism and start to note how right-wing
             “libertarians” have twisted the meaning of the word in order to defend
             various private authoritarian social relationships (not least those associated
             with property). Sadly, given the quality of most works on anarchism, this hope
             may be unﬁlled — but at least AFAQ exists to show those interested what
             anarchism really stands for.
                Still, there seems to be an improvement within academic circles – perhaps
             because there has been an increase in anarchist academics? This can be seen
             by many important works which have increased our understanding of both
             anarchist thinkers and movements and which have been published, often by
             AK Press, in cheaper editions. So in terms of serious research, anarchism is
             being better served than was often the case in the past — myths are being
             debunked and I hope AFAQ has played its part in that.
                Yet theory without practice is of little use and producing accurate accounts
             of past anarchists and movements, while important, does not bring anarchy
             closer. Twenty years is a long time and there is still no sign of the social
             revolution — although social revolts continue aplenty! Does this mean AFAQ
             was a waste of time? Far from it! To think that misunderstands what
             anarchism is — it is not a vision of a “perfect” society but rather a movement
             aiming to change the world for the better. Sometimes our resistance — like
             the class struggle it is part of — is small-scale, invisible, securing minor
             victories or just slowing down the decisions of the powerful (whether the state
             or the boss). Sometimes our resistance explodes into the public and the revolt
             becomes newsworthy. Regardless of the size of activity, anarchists work today
             to make the world a bit more libertarian. As Kropotkin put it:
                   “Anarchists are thus forced to work without respite and without
                   delay […]

## “They must reaﬀirm the main philosophical cornerstones of
                   Anarchy. They must incorporate scientiﬁc methods, for these will
                   help to reshape ideas: the myths of history will be debunked, along
                   with those of social economy and philosophy […]
                   “They must participate in the daily struggle against oppression and
                   prejudice in order to maintain a spirit of revolt everywhere people
## feel oppressed and possess the courage to rise up.

                   “They must thwart the clever machinations of all those parties who
                   were once allies but who now are hostile, who seek now to divert
                   onto authoritarian paths those movements which were originally
                   spawned in revolt against the oppression of Capital and State.
34 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   “And ﬁnally […] they have to ﬁnd, within the practice of life itself
                   and indeed working through their own experiences, new ways in
                   which social formations can be organised, be they centred on work,
                   community or region, and how these might emerge in a liberated
                   society, freed from the authority of governments and those who
                   would subject us to poverty and hunger.”[28]
                If AFAQ has helped some people to join the struggle, to defend and extend
             what freedoms we have, to combat inequality in wealth and power, then it has
             been a worthwhile project even if an anarchist society remains an inspiration
             rather than a reality. It has brought that society a bit closer by showing the
             world what anarchism actually is, by debunking myths, by showing that there
             is an alternative and how the struggles of today create it to some degree.
                For never forget that we create the new world when we resist the old. Even
             today we have the choice of acting in a libertarian manner or in an
             authoritarian one: we can organise with our fellow workers to resist the
             oppression and exploitation of our bosses — or be servile, know our place and
             grumble over low wages; we can resist the decisions of politicians by
             organising our communities — or wait quietly for four years to vote for the
             lesser evil; we can take to the streets in protest at the murderous results of
             racism — or just turn the channel and hope you will remain unaﬀected; we
             can struggle against patriarchy — or remain quiet; we can ﬁght to ensure
             everyone can be themselves — or acquiesce to “popular” prejudices; we can
             encourage co-operative alternatives to wage-labour, landlordism and
             oﬀicialdom — or quietly consume while muttering about being ripped oﬀ.

             An Anarchist FAQ after ten years
               It is now ten years since “An Anarchist FAQ” (AFAQ) was oﬀicially released.
             A lot has happened over that time, unfortunately ﬁnishing it has not been one
             of them!
               Over that decade, AFAQ has changed considerably. It was initially conceived
             as a energy-saving device to stop anarchists having to continually make the
             same points against claims that “anarcho”-capitalism was a form of
             anarchism. As would be expected, the quality of the initial versions and
             sections were pretty mixed. Most of it was extremely good (even if we do say
             so ourselves!) and has required little change over the decade (mostly we have
             built upon and expanded the original material). A few bits were less good and
             have been researched more and rewritten. We have also, of course, made
             mistakes and corrected them when we have been informed about them or
             have discovered them ourselves. In general, though, our initial work has stood
             up well and while we were occasionally wrong on a few details, the general
             thrust of even these areas has been proven correct. Overall, our aim to
             produce an FAQ which reﬂected the majority of anarchist thought, both
             currently and historically from an international perspective, has been a
             success as shown by the number of mirrors, links and translations AFAQ has
35 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             seen (being published by AK Press conﬁrms this).
               Since the oﬀicial release, AFAQ has changed. When we released it back in
             1996, we had already decided to make it a FAQ about anarchism rather than
             an FAQ on why anarchism is anti-capitalist. However, the ﬁrst versions still
             bore the marks of its origins. We realised that this limited it somewhat and we
             have slowly revised the AFAQ so that it has become a resource about
             anarchism (indeed, if it were to be started again the section on “anarcho”-
             capitalism would be placed into an appendix, where it belongs). This means
             that the aim of AFAQ has changed. I would say that it has two related goals:

                    1. To present the case for anarchism, to convince people they
## should become anarchists.

                    2. To be a resource for existing anarchists, to use to bolster their
                       activism and activities by presenting facts and arguments to
## allow them to defend anarchism against those opposed to it
                       (Marxists, capitalists, etc.).
               Te second goal explains why, for example, we spend a lot of time refuting
             capitalist economics and Marxism/Leninism (partly, because many of the facts
             and arguments are in academic books which are unavailable to the general
             public). We hope that AFAQ has proved useful to our comrades as much as we
             hope we have convinced non-anarchists, at best, to become anarchists, or, at
             worse, to take our ideas seriously. Hopefully, the two aims are mutually
             complementary.
               Not only has AFAQ changed over the last ten years, so has the anarchist and
             general political landscape on the internet. When AFAQ was being initially
             created, the number of anarchists on-line was small. There were not that
             many anarchist webpages and, relatively speaking, right-wing “libertarians”
             were un-opposed in arguing that “anarcho”-capitalism was a form of
             anarchism (the only FAQ was Caplan’s biased and inaccurate “Anarchist
             Theory FAQ”). As a non-American, I was surprised that this oxymoron even
             existed (I still am, as are all the anarchists I mention it to). Anarchism has
             always been a socialist theory and the concept of an “anarchism” which
             supported the economic system anarchism was born opposing is nonsense.
             Arguing with its supporters and reading up on it convinced me that the only
             real link it has with anarchism is simply its attempted appropriation of the
             name.[29] Hence the pressing need for a real anarchist FAQ, a need AFAQ
             successfully met.
               Luckily, over the 1990s things changed. More anarchists went online,
             anarchist organisations created a web presence and the balance of forces
             changed to reﬂect reality (i.e. there are far more anarchists than “anarcho”-
             capitalists). The anti-capitalist movement helped, putting anarchists back in
             the news (the BBC even linked to AFAQ for those interested in ﬁnding out
             what anarchists wanted!) Even in the USA, things got better and after Seattle
             genuine anarchism could no longer be ignored. This produced some articles
             by “anarcho”-capitalists, explaining how there are two forms of anarchism
             and that the two have nothing or little in common (if that is the case, why call
             your ideology anarchism?). Anarchist organisations and activism increased
             and the awareness that anarchism was anti-hierarchy, anti-state and anti36 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM
An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             capitalist increased. As an added bonus, some genuine individualist anarchists
             appeared, refuting the claim that “anarcho”-capitalism was merely a form of
             “updated” individualist anarchism. All these developments were welcomed, as
             were the words of praise and encouragement we received for our work on
             AFAQ from many anarchists (including, it must be stressed, individualist
             ones). Today, genuine anarchism in all its forms has a much greater proﬁle, as
             is anarchist opposition to “anarcho”-capitalism and its claims. We hope AFAQ
             played a role, however small, in that process.
               Of course, the battle is not over. On Wikipedia, for example,
             right-“libertarians” are busy trying to rewrite the history of anarchism. Some
             anarchists have tried to counteract this attempt, and have meant with
             diﬀering degrees of success. We urge you to get involved, if you have the time
             and energy as numbers, sadly, do seem to count. This is because we
             anarchists are up against people who, apparently, do not have a life and so
             can wage a war of attrition against those who try and include relevant facts to
             the entries (such as the obvious anti-capitalism of “traditional” anarchism,
             that anarchism is not compatible with government or hierarchy — hence anarchy! — or that calling yourself an anarchist does not necessarily make it
             so). It is a shame that such a promising project has been derailed by
             ideologues whose ignorance of the subject matter is matched only by their
             hatred of AFAQ which they deny is a “credible” or valid reference on
             anarchism.
               I am not surprised that AFAQ is hated by the “libertarian” right (nor will I
             be surprised if it is equally hated by the authoritarian left). After all, it
             presents the case for genuine anarchism, exposes the claims of a capitalist
             “anarchism” for the nonsense they are and shows how deeply authoritarian
             right-wing “libertarianism” actually is. That the FAQ can be called “biased” by
             these people goes without saying (it is, after all, a FAQ about anarchism
             written by anarchists). What seems funny is that they just do not comprehend
             that anarchists take oﬀence to their pretensions of labelling their ideology
             “anarchism,” that we would seek to refute such claims and that their notion
             that “anarcho”-capitalism is anarchist is far more biased. Let us hope that
             more academics will pay attention to this and the obvious fact that there is a
             very long list of anarchists, famous and not-so-famous, who consider the
             whole concept an oxymoron.
               Equally unsurprising is the attempt to deny that AFAQ is a valid reference
             on Wikipedia. This boils down to the claim that the authors are “nobodies.”
             Given that Kropotkin always stressed that anarchism was born from the
             people, I take that intended insult as a badge of pride. I have always taken the
             position that it is not who says something that counts, but what they say. In
             other words, I would far sooner quote a “nobody” who knows what they are
             talking about than a “somebody” who does not. As AFAQ indicates with its
             many refutations of straw man arguments against anarchism, there are plenty
             of the latter. Ultimately, the logical conclusion of such an argument is that
             anarchists are not qualiﬁed to discuss anarchism, an inherently silly position
             but useful if you are seeking to turn anarchism into something it is not.
               Given that even such an usually reliable expert as the late, great, Paul
             Avrich made mistakes, this position is by far the most sensible. Between what
             a suitably qualiﬁed “expert” writes and what actual anarchists say and do, I
37 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             always go for the latter. Any serious scientist would do so, but sadly many do
             not — instead, we get ideology. A classic example is Eric Hobsbawm’s thesis
             on “Primitive Rebels” which he decided to illustrate, in part, with the
             example of Spanish anarchism. As we recount as part of our appendix on
             “Marxism and Spanish Anarchism” while being undoubtedly a “somebody”
             and immensely qualiﬁed to write on the subject, his account was utter
             nonsense. This was proven beyond doubt when an anthologist interviewed the
             survivors of the Casas Viejas massacre. Their account of the event had only
             appeared previously in anarchist papers at the time and both, needless to say,
             refuted Hobsbawm.
                So, to be called a “nobody” is quite a complement, given how many of the
             “somebodies” have not stopped being ignorant of anarchism from putting pen
             to paper and exposing that ignorance to the world (the worse recent example
             of this, outside of Marxism, must be George Monbiot’s terrible comments in
             his “Age of Consent”). So, when it comes to saying what anarchism is, I turn
             to anarchists. This is what the “experts” should be doing anyway if they were
             doing their job.
                Are we “qualiﬁed” to write about anarchism? Well, the the collective has
             always been made up of anarchists, so we have an anarchist FAQ written by
             anarchists. It has always been a popular site, given the number of mirrors,
             translations and links it has been given (one mirror called it “world famous”).
             It is being published by AK Press, one of the leading anarchist publishers in
             the world.
                I am the main editor and contributor to AFAQ. While one contributor to
             Wikipedia claimed I as an American academic, this is not the case. I have a
             “real” job and work on AFAQ in my spare time (I do despair when people,
             particularly leftists, assume that wage slaves are incapable of producing
             works like AFAQ). I have been always been an anarchist since becoming
             politically aware which means I have been an anarchist activist for
             approximately 20 years (time ﬂies when you are having fun!). I have been a
             member of numerous anarchist groups and have contributed to many
             anarchist publications and websites. As can be seen from my personal
             webpage,[30] I regularly contribute articles to Freedom (the leading Englishlanguage anarchist newspaper). Rarely does an issue come out without
             something by me it in. Moreover, some of the longer articles have appeared in
             Black Flag (before and after I joined its editorial committee). My works have
             also been published in Scottish Anarchist, Anarcho-Syndicalist Review
             and Free Voices and some have been translated into other languages. I am
             also an invited columnist for the www.infoshop.org and www.anarkismo.net
             webpages (neither of which I am otherwise involved with). In addition, I have
             been invited to speak at anarchist conferences in Scotland and Ireland, as
             well as by Marxist parties to debate the merits of anarchism. Due to family
             commitments, my speciﬁcally anarchist activities are pretty much limited to
             writing these days, but I remain a reasonably active trade unionist.
                I will leave it up to the reader to decide whether we are “qualiﬁed” to write
             about anarchism or not!
                But as I said, I always consider what is said more important than who says
             it. The fact that AFAQ is so popular with anarchists is what counts and I hope
             that we continue to be. We are always looking for help and suggestions, so if
38 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             you want to get involved or want something added or changed, please contact
             us — we consider AFAQ as a resource for anarchists and we want it to reﬂect
             what anarchists think and do.[31] However, if you do want something changed
             or added be prepared to do some or all of the work yourself as we have our
             own plans on future developments and may not be able to provide the time or
             energy for other changes. Also, if you spot a mistake or a typo, please inform
             us as no matter how often we check errors do creep in. We take our task
             seriously and correct all errors when informed of them (diﬀerences in
             interpretation or terminology are not, of course, errors).[32]
               Speaking personally, I have enjoyed being part of this project. I have
             learned a lot and have gained a better understanding of many anarchist
             thinkers and historical events. For example, I can now understand why Daniel
             Guerin was so interested in Proudhon and why it has been a crying shame
             that Voltairine de Cleyre’s works have been unavailable for 8 decades. As
             such, my understanding and appreciation of anarchism has been enriched by
             working on AFAQ and I hope that others have had a similar experience
             reading it. On the negative side, I’ve had to read some terrible books and
             articles but very few, if any, of those were anarchist. But this is minor. The
             work has been worth it and while it has taken longer than any of us had
             imagined at the start, I’m glad that we are still working on it ten years later
             as AFAQ is much improved for all that time and energy. If nothing else, this
             work has reinforced my belief in the positive ideas and ideals of anarchism
             and conﬁrmed why I became an anarchist so long ago. And, let me be honest,
             I would not do it unless I enjoyed it!
               What of the future? Obviously, we know that AFAQ is not the ﬁnal word on
             anarchism (we have always stressed that this is An Anarchist FAQ and not
             “The Anarchist FAQ,” although some do call it that). The immediate aim is to
             revise the existing main sections of AFAQ for publication, which we are slowly
             doing. In the process some previous work is being added to and, in some
             cases, totally revised. After ten years, our knowledge of many subjects has
             expanded considerably. We have also asked a couple of individualist anarchist
             comrades to have a look over section G and hopefully their input will ﬂesh out
             that section when it comes to be revised (for all its ﬂaws, individualist
             anarchism deserves far more than to be appropriated by the right and social
             anarchists should be helping its modern supporters attempts to reclaim their
             radical tradition). [33] Once the revision of the main body of AFAQ is complete,
             the appendix on the Russian Revolution will be ﬁnished and then all the
             appendices will be revised.
               After that, AFAQ will be added to once new information becomes available
             and new anarchist social movements and ideas develop. We have not covered
             everything nor does AFAQ discussed all developments within anarchism in all
             countries. If you think we have missed something, then contact us and we can
             arrange to include the subject and issues missing. As noted above, though, do
             not expect us to do all the work for you. This is a resource for the movement
             and, as such, we expect fellow anarchists to help out beyond merely
             suggesting things they expect others to do!
               Hopefully, after summarising 19th and 20th century anarchism, the
             anarchists of the 21st century will use that to build and develop new ideas and
             movements and create both viable anarchist alternatives under statism and
39 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             capitalism and, eventually, a free society. Whether we do so or not is,
             ultimately, up to us. Let us hope we can rise to the challenge! I do hope that
             anarchists can rise above the often silly arguments that we often inﬂict on
             each other and concentrate on the 90%+ that unites us rather than the often
             insigniﬁcant diﬀerences some consider so important. One thing is sure, if we
             do not then the worse will happen.
               Finally, another personal note. On the way to work, I go past a little park.
             This little oasis of green in the city is a joy to behold, more so since someone
             has added this piece of graﬀiti to one of its walls:
               “Resistance is never futile! Have a nice day, y’all. Love Friday, XXX”
               With that in mind, we dedicate the ten year anniversary release of “An
             Anarchist FAQ” to all those “nobodies,” all those anarchists who are not
             famous or have the appropriate “qualiﬁcations”, but whose activity, thoughts,
             ideas, ideals, dreams and hopes give the “somebodies” something to write
             about (even if they fail to get some, or even all of it, right).

## The History of the Makhnovist Movement

             Welcome to our FAQ on anarchism
                This FAQ was written by anarchists across the world in an attempt to
             present anarchist ideas and theory to those interested in it. It is a cooperative eﬀort, produced by a (virtual) working group and it exists to present
             a useful organising tool for anarchists on-line and, hopefully, in the real world.
             It desires to present arguments on why you should be an anarchist as well as
             refuting common arguments against anarchism and other proposed solutions
             to the social problems we face.
                As anarchist ideas seem so at odds with “common-sense” (such as “of
             course we need a state and capitalism”) we need to indicate why anarchists
             think like we do. Unlike many political theories, anarchism rejects ﬂip
             answers and instead bases its ideas and ideals in an in-depth analysis of
             society and humanity. In order to do both anarchism and the reader justice we
             have summarised our arguments as much as possible without making them
             simplistic. We know that it is a lengthy document and may put oﬀ the casual
             observer but its length is unavoidable.
                Readers may consider our use of extensive quoting as being an example of a
             “quotation [being] a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of
             thinking for oneself.” (A.A. Milne) This is not the case of course. We have
             included extensive quotations by many anarchist ﬁgures for three reasons.
             Firstly, to indicate that we are not making up our claims of what certain
40 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             anarchists thought or argued for. Secondly, and most importantly, it allows us
             to link the past voices of anarchism with its present adherents. And lastly, the
             quotes are used for their ability to convey ideas succinctly rather than as an
             appeal to “authority.”
               In addition, many quotes are used in order to allow readers to investigate
             the ideas of those quoted and to summarise facts and so save space. For
             example, a quote by Noam Chomsky on the development of capitalism by
             state protection ensures that we base our arguments on facts without having
             to present all the evidence and references Chomsky uses. Similarly, we quote
             experts on certain subjects (such as economics, for example) to support and
             bolster our analysis and claims.
               We should also indicate the history of this FAQ. It was started in 1995 when
             a group of anarchists got together in order to write an FAQ refuting the
             claims of certain “libertarian” capitalists to being anarchists. Those who were
             involved in this project had spent many an hour on-line refuting claims by
             these people that capitalism and anarchism could go together. Finally, a group
             of net-activists decided the best thing was to produce an FAQ explaining why
             anarchism hates capitalism and why “anarcho” capitalists are not anarchists.
             However, after the suggestion of Mike Huben (who maintains the “Critiques
             of Libertarianism” web-page) it was decided that a pro-Anarchist FAQ would
             be a better idea than an anti-“anarcho”-capitalist one. So the Anarchist FAQ
             was born. It still bears some of the signs of its past-history. For example it
             gives the likes of Ayn Rand, Murray Rothbard, and so on, far too much space
             outside of Section F — they really are not that important. However, as they
             present extreme examples of everyday capitalist ideology and assumptions,
             they do have their uses — they state clearly the authoritarian implications of
             capitalist ideology which its more moderate supporters try to hide or
             minimise.
               We think that we have produced a useful on-line resource for anarchists and
             other anti-capitalists to use. Perhaps, in light of this, we should dedicate this
             anarchist FAQ to the many on-line “libertarian” capitalists who, because of
             their inane arguments, prompted us to start this work. Then again, that would
             give them too much credit. Outside the net they are irrelevant and on the net
             they are just annoying. As you may guess, sections F and G contain the bulk of
             this early anti-Libertarian FAQ and are included purely to refute the claim
             that an anarchist can be a supporter of capitalism that is relatively common
             on the net (in the real world this would not be required as almost all
             anarchists think that “anarcho”-capitalism is an oxymoron and that its
             supporters are not part of the anarchist movement).
               So, while coming from a very speciﬁc reason, the FAQ has expanded into
             more than we originally imagined. It has become a general introduction about
             anarchism, its ideas and history. Because anarchism recognises that there are
             no easy answers and that freedom must be based on individual responsibility
             the FAQ is quite in-depth. As it also challenges a lot of assumptions, we have
             had to cover a lot of ground. We also admit that some of the “frequently asked
             questions” we have included are more frequently asked than others. This is
             due to the need to include relevant arguments and facts which otherwise may
             not have been included.
               We are sure that many anarchists will not agree 100% with what we have
41 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             written in the FAQ. That is to be expected in a movement based upon
             individual freedom and critical thought. However, we are sure that most
             anarchists will agree with most of what we present and respect those parts
             with which they do disagree with as genuine expressions of anarchist ideas
             and ideals. The anarchist movement is marked by wide-spread disagreement
             and argument about various aspects of anarchist ideas and how to apply them
             (but also, we must add, a wide-spread tolerance of diﬀering viewpoints and a
             willingness to work together in spite of minor disagreements). We have
             attempted to reﬂect this in the FAQ and hope we have done a good job in
             presenting the ideas of all the anarchist tendencies we discuss.
               We have no desire to write in stone what anarchism is and is not. Instead
             the FAQ is a starting point for people to read and learn for themselves about
             anarchism and translate that learning into direct action and self-activity. By so
             doing, we make anarchism a living theory, a product of individual and social
             self-activity. Only by applying our ideas in practice can we ﬁnd their strengths
             and limitations and so develop anarchist theory in new directions and in light
             of new experiences. We hope that the FAQ both reﬂects and aids this process
             of self-activity and self-education.
               We are sure that there are many issues that the FAQ does not address. If
             you think of anything we could add or feel you have a question and answer
             which should be included, get in contact with us. The FAQ is not our
             “property” but belongs to the whole anarchist movement and so aims to be an
             organic, living creation. We desire to see it grow and expand with new ideas
             and inputs from as many people as possible. If you want to get involved with
             the FAQ then contact us. Similarly, if others (particularly anarchists) want to
             distribute all or part of it then feel free. It is a resource for the movement. For
             this reason we have “copylefted” An Anarchist FAQ (see http://www.gnu.org/
             copyleft/copyleft.html for details). By so doing we ensure that the FAQ
             remains a free product, available for use by all.
               One last point. Language has changed a lot over the years and this applies
             to anarchist thinkers too. The use of the term “man” to refer to humanity is
             one such change. Needless to say, in today’s world such usage is
             inappropriate as it eﬀectively ignores half the human race. For this reason the
             FAQ has tried to be gender neutral. However, this awareness is relatively
             recent and many anarchists (even the female ones like Emma Goldman) used
             the term “man” to refer to humanity as a whole. When we are quoting past
             comrades who use “man” in this way, it obviously means humanity as a whole
             rather than the male sex. Where possible, we add “woman”, “women”, “her”
             and so on but if this would result in making the quote unreadable, we have
             left it as it stands. We hope this makes our position clear.
               So we hope that this FAQ entertains you and makes you think. Hopefully it
             will produce a few more anarchists and speed up the creation of an anarchist
             society. If all else fails, we have enjoyed ourselves creating the FAQ and have
             shown anarchism to be a viable, coherent political idea.
             We dedicate this work to the millions of anarchists, living and dead, who tried
                and are trying to create a better world. An Anarchist FAQ was oﬀicially
                released on July 19th, 1996 for that reason — to celebrate the Spanish
              Revolution of 1936 and the heroism of the Spanish anarchist movement. We

             An Anarchist FAQ: Introduction to
             Volume 1
               As many anarchists have noted, our ideal must be one of the most
             misunderstood and misrepresented political theories on the planet. “An
             Anarchist FAQ” (AFAQ) aims to change this by presenting the basics of
             anarchist theory and history, refuting the most common distortions and
             nonsense about it and providing anarchists with a resource they can use to
             aid their arguments and struggles for freedom. This is important, as much of
             the ground covered in AFAQ was provoked by having to critique other
             theories and refute attacks on anarchism.
               Anarchism has changed over the years and will continue to evolve and
43 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             change as circumstances do likewise and new struggles are fought and
             (hopefully) won. It is not some ﬁxed ideology, but rather a means of
             understanding an evolving world and to change it in libertarian directions. As
             such, AFAQ seeks to place speciﬁc aspects of anarchism into their historical
             context. For example, certain aspects of Proudhon’s ideas can only be
             understood by remembering that he lived at a time when the vast majority of
             working people were peasants and artisans. Many commentators (particularly
             Marxist ones) seem to forget this (and that he supported co-operatives for
             large-scale industry). Much the same can be said of Bakunin, Tucker and so
             on. I hope AFAQ will help anarchism continue to develop to meet new
             circumstances by summarising what has gone before so that we can build on
             it.
                We also seek to draw out what anarchists have in common while not
             denying their diﬀerences. After all, individualist-anarchist Benjamin Tucker
             would have agreed with communist-anarchist Peter Kropotkin when he stated
             that anarchism was the “no government form of socialism.” While some
             anarchists seem to take more time in critiquing and attacking their comrades
             over (ultimately) usually minor diﬀerences than ﬁghting oppression, I
             personally think that this activity while, at times, essential is hardly the most
             fruitful use of our limited resources — particularly when it is about possible
             future developments (whether it is on the economic nature of a free society or
             our attitude to a currently non-existing syndicalist union!). So we have
             discussed the diﬀerences between anarchist schools of thought as well as
             within them, but we have tried to build bridges by stressing where they agree
             rather than create walls.
                Needless to say, not all anarchists will agree with what is in AFAQ (it is,
             after all, as we have always stressed “An Anarchist FAQ”, not “The Anarchist
             FAQ” as some comrades ﬂatteringly call it). From my experience, most
             anarchists agree with most of it even if they have quibbles about certain
             aspects of it. I know that comrades do point others to it (I once saw a Marxist
             complain that anarchists always suggested he read AFAQ, so I explained to
             him that this was what having a “Frequency Asked Questions” was all about).
             So AFAQ is only a guide, you need to discover anarchism for yourself and
             develop and apply it in your own way. Hopefully AFAQ will help that process
             by presenting an overview of anarchism and indicating what it is, what it is
             not and where to ﬁnd out more.
                Some may object to the length of many of the answers and that is a valid
             point. However, some questions and issues cannot be dealt with quickly and
             be considered as remotely convincing. For example, simply stating that
             anarchists think that capitalism is exploitative and that claims otherwise are
             wrong may be both correct and short but it hardly a convincing reply to
             someone aware of the various defences of proﬁt, interest and rent invented by
             capitalist economists. Similarly, stating that Marxist ideology helped destroy
             the Russian Revolution is, again, both correct and short but it would never
             convince a Leninist who stresses the impact of civil war on Bolshevik practice.
             Then there is the issue of sources. We have tried to let anarchists speak for
             themselves on most issues and that can take space. Some of the evidence we
             use is from books and articles the general reader may not have easy access so
             we have tried to present full quotes to show that our use is correct (the
44 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             number of times I’ve tracked down references only to discover they did not
             say what was suggested is, sadly, quite numerous).
               Moreover, refuting distortions and inventions about anarchism can be
             lengthy simply because of the necessity of providing supporting evidence.
             Time and again, the same mistakes and straw man arguments are
             regurgitated by those unwilling or unable to look at the source material
             (Marxists are particularly bad at this, simply repeating ad nauseum the
             assertions of Marx and Engels as if they were accurate). Assumptions are
             piled onto assumptions, assertions repeated as if they were factual. AFAQ
             seeks to address these and present evidence to refute them once and for all.
             Simply saying that some statement is false may be correct, but hardly
             convincing unless you already know a lot about the subject. So I hope that
             readers will understand and ﬁnd even the longest answers interesting and
             informative (one of the advantages of a FAQ format is that people can simply
             go to the sections they are interested in and skip others).
               This volume covers what anarchism is, where it comes from, what it has
             done, what it is against (and why) as well as what anarchism is not (i.e.,
             showing why “anarcho”-capitalism is not a form of anarchism).
               The latter may come as a surprise to most. Few anarchists, never mind the
             general population, have heard of that speciﬁc ideology (it is US based, in the
             main) and those who have heard of it may wonder why we bothered given its
             obvious non-anarchist nature. Sadly, we need to cover this ground simply
             because some academics insist in listing it alongside genuine forms of
             anarchism and that needs to be exposed for the nonsense it is. Few serious
             thinkers would list fascism along side socialism, regardless of whether its
             supporters call their ideology “National Socialism” or “National Syndicalism”
             (unsurprisingly, right-“libertarians” do precisely that). No one took the Soviet
             bloc states seriously when they described themselves as “peoples’
             democracies” nor considered their governments democratic. Anarchism
             seems to be excluded from such common-sense and so we ﬁnd academics
             discussing “anarcho”-capitalists along side anarchism simply, I suspect,
             because they call themselves “anarchists.” That almost all anarchists reject
             their claims to being anarchists does not seem to be a suﬀicient warning
             about taking such statements at face value! For obvious reasons, we have not
             wasted space in explaining why another US based ideology, “National
             Anarchism”, is not anarchism. While some individual anarchists were racist,
             the notion that anarchism has anything in common with those who aim for
             racially pure nationalist communities is ridiculous. Even academics have not
             fallen for that, although for almost all genuine anarchists “anarcho”-
             capitalism makes as little sense as “anarcho”-nationalism.
               Then there is the history of AFAQ. As indicated in the original introduction,
             AFAQ was prompted by battles with “anarcho”-capitalists on-line in the early
             1990s. However, while AFAQ may have started as a reply to the “anarcho”-
             capitalists it is no longer that. It would be a mistake to think that they are
             more signiﬁcant than they actually are or that many anarchists bother with
             them (most, I am sure, have never heard of it). I did consider whether it was
             wiser to simply exclude section F from the book but, in the end, I decided it
             should remain. Partly, for the reasons above and partly because it does serve
             another, more useful, purpose. Neo-liberalism is based, in many ways, on
45 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             right-“libertarian” dogmas so critiquing those helps our struggle against
             “actually existing” capitalism and the current attacks by the ruling class.
                I do not wish anarchism to go the same way that “libertarian” has gone in
             the US (and, to a lesser extent, in the UK). Between the 1890s and 1970s,
             libertarian was simply a pseudonym for anarchist or similar socialist theories.
             However, the American free-market right appropriated the label in the 1970s
             and now it means supporters of minimal state (or private-state) capitalism.
             Such is the power having ideas that bolster the wealthy! The change in
             “libertarian” is such that some people talk about “libertarian anarchism” — as
             if you can have an “authoritarian anarchism”! That these people include
             “anarcho”-capitalists simply shows how ignorant of anarchism they actually
             are and how alien the ideology is to our movement (I’ve seen quite a few of
             them proclaim anarchism is simply a “new” form of Marxism, which shows
             their grasp of the subject). Equally bizarrely, these self-proclaimed
             “libertarian anarchists” are also those who most fervently defend the
             authoritarian social relationships inherent within capitalism! In other words,
             if “authoritarian anarchists” could exist then the “libertarian anarchists”
             would be them!
                As AFAQ explains, being opposed to the state is a necessary, but not
             suﬀicient, condition for being an anarchist. Not only is this clear from the
             works of anarchist thinkers and anarchism as a social movement, but also
             from the nature of the idea itself. To be an anarchist you must also be a
             socialist (i.e. opposed to capitalist property and the exploitation of labour). It
             is no coincidence that Godwin and Proudhon independently analysed private
             property from a libertarian perspective and drew similar conclusions or that
             Kropotkin and Tucker considered themselves socialists. To deny this critique
             is to deny anarchism as a movement and as a socio-political theory never
             mind its history and the aims of anarchists across the years.
                Furthermore, as AFAQ stresses, to be a consistent anarchist you must
             recognise that freedom is more than simply the ability to change masters.
             Anarchism means “no authority” (an-archy) and to support social relationships
             marked by authority (hier-archy) produces a self-contradictory mess (such as
             supporting forms of domination, such as wage labour, which are essentially
             identical to those produced by the state — and, sometimes, admitted as
             such!). Anarchism is, fundamentally, a theory of organisation based on
             individuals associating together without restricting, and so denying and
             limiting, their freedom and individuality. This means that a consistent
             anarchism is rooted in free association within a context of self-management,
             decentralisation and “bottom-up” decision-making (i.e., it is rooted in political,
             economic and social equality). While it is possible to be an anarchist while
             opposing exploitation but not all forms of hierarchical social relationships, it
             is hardly logical nor a convincing position.
                AFAQ also seeks to go into subjects anarchists have, traditionally, been
             weak on, such as economics (which is ironic, as Proudhon made his name by
             his economic critiques). In this sense, it is a resource for anarchists both in
             terms of our own history and ideas but also on subjects which we inevitably
             come across in our struggles (hopefully, the critiques we provide of
             capitalism, neo-liberalism and so forth will also be useful to other radicals).
             We have tried to indicate the quoted source is an anarchist or libertarian. If in
46 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             doubt, please look at the bibliography on the webpage. This breaks references
             down into libertarian (anarchist and non-anarchist) thinkers (or sympathetic
             accounts of anarchism) and non-libertarians (which, needless to say, includes
             right-“libertarians”). It should go without saying that quoting an expert on
             one subject does not mean anarchists subscribe to their opinions on other
             matters. Thus if we quote, say, a Keynesian or post-Keynesian economist on
             how capitalism works it does not imply we support their speciﬁc political
             recommendations.
                Some have criticised AFAQ for not including some of the more recent
             developments within anarchism, which is fair enough. I have asked on
             numerous occasions for such critics to contribute a section on these and, of
             course, for referenced corrections for any mistakes others think we have
             done. Nothing has been forthcoming and we have usually discovered mistakes
             ourselves and corrected them (although a steady ﬂow of emails pointing out
             typos has come our way). We have always been a small collective and we
             cannot do everything. This also explains why important social events like, say,
             the turn of the century Argentinean revolt against neo-liberalism is not
             discussed in section A.5 (this is a wonderful example of anarchist ideas being
             spontaneously applied in practice during a mass revolt). Suﬀice to say,
             anarchistic tendencies, ideas and practices develop all the time and
             anarchism is growing in inﬂuence but if we continually added to AFAQ to
             reﬂect this then it would never have become ready for publication! As it is, we
             have excluded most of the appendices from the book version (these remain
             available on the website along with a lengthy links page).
                I would like to thank everybody who has helped and contributed (directly
             and indirectly, knowingly and unknowingly) to AFAQ. As for authorship, AFAQ
             started as a collective eﬀort and remained so for many years. I have been the
             only person involved from the start and have done the bulk of the work on it.
             Moreover, the task of getting it ready and revised for publication has fallen to
             me. I have enjoyed it, in the main. This explains why the book has my name on
             it rather than a collective. I feel I have earned that right. As such, I claim
             responsibility for any typos and examples of bad grammar that remain. I have
             substantially revised AFAQ for publication and while I have tried to ﬁnd them
             all, I am sure I have failed (particularly in sections that were eﬀectively
             rewritten). I hope these do not detract from the book too much.
                Finally, on a personal note I would like to dedicate this book to my partner
             and two lovely children. They are a constant source of inspiration, love,
             support and hope (not to mention patience!). If this work makes the world we
             live in better for them then it has been more than worthwhile. For, when it
             comes down to it, anarchism is simply about making the world a freer and
             better place. If we forget that, then we forget what makes us anarchists in the
             ﬁrst place.

             — has always struck me as the same as democracy carried to its logical and
             reasonable conclusions. Of course those who rule — bosses and politicians,
             capital and the state — cannot imagine that people could rule themselves, for
             to admit that people can live without authority and rulers pulls out the whole
             underpinnings of their ideology. Once you admit that people can — and do,
             today, in many spheres of their lives — run things easier, better and more
             fairly than the corporation and the government can, there’s no justiﬁcation for
             the boss and the premier. I think most of us realise and understand that, in
             our guts, but schools, culture, the police, all the authoritarian apparatuses,
             tell us we need bosses, we need to be controlled ‘for our own good.’ It’s not
             for our own good — it’s for the good of the boss, plain and simple.”
## “Anarchism is a demand for real freedom and real autonomy”
               “But I also remain convinced that something like an anarchist future, a
             world of no bosses or politicians, one in which people, all people, can live full
             and meaningful lives, is possible and desirable. We see glimpses of it all
             around us in our day-to-day lives, as people organise much of their lives
             without depending on someone to tell them what to do. We see it in that spirit
             of revolt — a spirit that is often twisted by anger and despair, but nonetheless
             shows us that people have not given up. We see it in the political activism, the
             social lives, the demands for decency and respect and autonomy people put
             forward, the desire to be individuals while still being part of a community.
               “No, I don’t think bowling leagues are the anarchist utopia, but they, like
             much of our lives outside of the workplace, are organised without hierarchy
             and oppression; the most meaningful, truly human parts of our lives already
             work best when organised on anarchist principles. Yet I also believe that in its
             function as critique and as a vision of the future — perhaps the only one that
             doesn’t end in our extinction as a species, or, as Orwell put it, as a jackboot
             smashing a human face, forever — anarchism is not only desirable but
             possible and necessary.”
                                                        Mark Leier: The Case for Anarchy
             Section A — What is Anarchism?
               Modern civilisation faces three potentially catastrophic crises: (1) social
             breakdown, a shorthand term for rising rates of poverty, homelessness, crime,
             violence, alienation, drug and alcohol abuse, social isolation, political apathy,
             dehumanisation, the deterioration of community structures of self-help and
             mutual aid, etc.; (2) destruction of the planet’s delicate ecosystems on which
             all complex forms of life depend; and (3) the proliferation of weapons of mass
             destruction, particularly nuclear weapons.
               Orthodox opinion, including that of Establishment “experts,” mainstream
             media, and politicians, generally regards these crises as separable, each
             having its own causes and therefore capable of being dealt with on a
             piecemeal basis, in isolation from the other two. Obviously, however, this
             “orthodox” approach isn’t working, since the problems in question are getting
             worse. Unless some better approach is taken soon, we are clearly headed for
             disaster, either from catastrophic war, ecological Armageddon, or a descent

             into urban savagery — or all of the above.
               Anarchism oﬀers a uniﬁed and coherent way of making sense of these
             crises, by tracing them to a common source. This source is the principle of
             hierarchical authority, which underlies the major institutions of all
             “civilised” societies, whether capitalist or “communist.” Anarchist analysis
             therefore starts from the fact that all of our major institutions are in the form
             of hierarchies, i.e. organisations that concentrate power at the top of a
             pyramidal structure, such as corporations, government bureaucracies, armies,
             political parties, religious organisations, universities, etc. It then goes on to
             show how the authoritarian relations inherent in such hierarchies negatively
             aﬀect individuals, their society, and culture. In the ﬁrst part of this FAQ
             (sections A to E) we will present the anarchist analysis of hierarchical
             authority and its negative eﬀects in greater detail.
               It should not be thought, however, that anarchism is just a critique of
             modern civilisation, just “negative” or “destructive.” Because it is much more
             than that. For one thing, it is also a proposal for a free society. Emma
             Goldman expressed what might be called the “anarchist question” as follows:
             “The problem that confronts us today… is how to be one’s self and yet in
             oneness with others, to feel deeply with all human beings and still retain one’s
             own characteristic qualities.” [Red Emma Speaks, pp. 158–159] In other
             words, how can we create a society in which the potential for each individual
             is realised but not at the expense of others? In order to achieve this,
             anarchists envision a society in which, instead of being controlled “from the
             top down” through hierarchical structures of centralised power, the aﬀairs of
             humanity will, to quote Benjamin Tucker, “be managed by individuals or
             voluntary associations.” [Anarchist Reader, p. 149] While later sections of
             the FAQ (sections I and J) will describe anarchism’s positive proposals for
             organising society in this way, “from the bottom up,” some of the constructive
             core of anarchism will be seen even in the earlier sections. The positive core
             of anarchism can even be seen in the anarchist critique of such ﬂawed
             solutions to the social question as Marxism and right-wing “libertarianism”
             (sections F and H, respectively).
               As Cliﬀord Harper elegantly puts it, ”[l]ike all great ideas, anarchism is
             pretty simple when you get down to it — human beings are at their best when
             they are living free of authority, deciding things among themselves rather
             than being ordered about.” [Anarchy: A Graphic Guide, p. vii] Due to their
             desire to maximise individual and therefore social freedom, anarchists wish to
             dismantle all institutions that repress people:
                   “Common to all Anarchists is the desire to free society of all political
                   and social coercive institutions which stand in the way of the
## development of a free humanity.” [Rudolf Rocker, AnarchoSyndicalism, p. 9]

               As we’ll see, all such institutions are hierarchies, and their repressive
             nature stems directly from their hierarchical form.
               Anarchism is a socio-economic and political theory, but not an ideology. The
             diﬀerence is very important. Basically, theory means you have ideas; an
             ideology means ideas have you. Anarchism is a body of ideas, but they are
             ﬂexible, in a constant state of evolution and ﬂux, and open to modiﬁcation in
49 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             light of new data. As society changes and develops, so does anarchism. An
             ideology, in contrast, is a set of “ﬁxed” ideas which people believe
             dogmatically, usually ignoring reality or “changing” it so as to ﬁt with the
             ideology, which is (by deﬁnition) correct. All such “ﬁxed” ideas are the source
             of tyranny and contradiction, leading to attempts to make everyone ﬁt onto a
             Procrustean Bed. This will be true regardless of the ideology in question —
             Leninism, Objectivism, “Libertarianism,” or whatever — all will all have the
             same eﬀect: the destruction of real individuals in the name of a doctrine, a
             doctrine that usually serves the interest of some ruling elite. Or, as Michael
             Bakunin puts it:
                   “Until now all human history has been only a perpetual and bloody
                   immolation of millions of poor human beings in honour of some
                   pitiless abstraction — God, country, power of state, national honour,
                   historical rights, judicial rights, political liberty, public welfare.”
                   [God and the State, p. 59]
               Dogmas are static and deathlike in their rigidity, often the work of some
             dead “prophet,” religious or secular, whose followers erect his or her ideas
             into an idol, immutable as stone. Anarchists want the living to bury the dead
             so that the living can get on with their lives. The living should rule the dead,
             not vice versa. Ideologies are the nemesis of critical thinking and
             consequently of freedom, providing a book of rules and “answers” which
             relieve us of the “burden” of thinking for ourselves.
               In producing this FAQ on anarchism it is not our intention to give you the
             “correct” answers or a new rule book. We will explain a bit about what
             anarchism has been in the past, but we will focus more on its modern forms
             and why we are anarchists today. The FAQ is an attempt to provoke thought
             and analysis on your part. If you are looking for a new ideology, then sorry,
             anarchism is not for you.
               While anarchists try to be realistic and practical, we are not “reasonable”
             people. “Reasonable” people uncritically accept what the “experts” and
             “authorities” tell them is true, and so they will always remain slaves!
             Anarchists know that, as Bakunin wrote:
                   ”[a] person is strong only when he stands upon his own truth, when
                   he speaks and acts from his deepest convictions. Then, whatever the
                   situation he may be in, he always knows what he must say and do.
                   He may fall, but he cannot bring shame upon himself or his causes.”
                   [quoted in Albert Meltzer, I couldn’t Paint Golden Angels, p. 2]
               What Bakunin describes is the power of independent thought, which is the
             power of freedom. We encourage you not to be “reasonable,” not to accept
             what others tell you, but to think and act for yourself!
               One last point: to state the obvious, this is not the ﬁnal word on anarchism.
             Many anarchists will disagree with much that is written here, but this is to be
             expected when people think for themselves. All we wish to do is indicate the
             basic ideas of anarchism and give our analysis of certain topics based on how
             we understand and apply these ideas. We are sure, however, that all
             anarchists will agree with the core ideas we present, even if they may
50 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             disagree with our application of them here and there.
             A.1 What is anarchism?
               Anarchism is a political theory which aims to create anarchy, “the absence
             of a master, of a sovereign.” [P-J Proudhon, What is Property , p. 264] In
             other words, anarchism is a political theory which aims to create a society
             within which individuals freely co-operate together as equals. As such
             anarchism opposes all forms of hierarchical control — be that control by the
             state or a capitalist — as harmful to the individual and their individuality as
             well as unnecessary.
               In the words of anarchist L. Susan Brown:
                   “While the popular understanding of anarchism is of a violent, anti-
## State movement, anarchism is a much more subtle and nuanced
                   tradition then a simple opposition to government power. Anarchists
## oppose the idea that power and domination are necessary for
                   society, and instead advocate more co-operative, anti-hierarchical
                   forms of social, political and economic organisation.” [The Politics
                   of Individualism, p. 106]

## However, “anarchism” and “anarchy” are undoubtedly the most
             misrepresented ideas in political theory. Generally, the words are used to
             mean “chaos” or “without order,” and so, by implication, anarchists desire
             social chaos and a return to the “laws of the jungle.”
               This process of misrepresentation is not without historical parallel. For
             example, in countries which have considered government by one person
             (monarchy) necessary, the words “republic” or “democracy” have been used
             precisely like “anarchy,” to imply disorder and confusion. Those with a vested
             interest in preserving the status quo will obviously wish to imply that
             opposition to the current system cannot work in practice, and that a new form
             of society will only lead to chaos. Or, as Errico Malatesta expresses it:
                   “since it was thought that government was necessary and that
                   without government there could only be disorder and confusion, it
                   was natural and logical that anarchy, which means absence of
                   government, should sound like absence of order.” [Anarchy, p. 16]
               Anarchists want to change this “common-sense” idea of “anarchy,” so
             people will see that government and other hierarchical social relationships
             are both harmful and unnecessary:
                   “Change opinion, convince the public that government is not only
                   unnecessary, but extremely harmful, and then the word anarchy, just
                   because it means absence of government, will come to mean for
                   everybody: natural order, unity of human needs and the interests of
                   all, complete freedom within complete solidarity.” [Op. Cit., pp. 16]
               This FAQ is part of the process of changing the commonly-held ideas
             regarding anarchism and the meaning of anarchy. But that is not all. As well

             as combating the distortions produced by the “common-sense” idea of
             “anarchy”, we also have to combat the distortions that anarchism and
             anarchists have been subjected to over the years by our political and social
             enemies. For, as Bartolomeo Vanzetti put it, anarchists are “the radical of the
             radical — the black cats, the terrors of many, of all the bigots, exploiters,
             charlatans, fakers and oppressors. Consequently we are also the more
             slandered, misrepresented, misunderstood and persecuted of all.” [Nicola
             Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti, p. 274]
               Vanzetti knew what he was talking about. He and his comrade Nicola Sacco
             were framed by the US state for a crime they did not commit and were,
             eﬀectively, electrocuted for being foreign anarchists in 1927. So this FAQ will
             have to spend some time correcting the slanders and distortions that
             anarchists have been subjected to by the capitalist media, politicians,
             ideologues and bosses (not to mention the distortions by our erstwhile fellow
             radicals like liberals and Marxists). Hopefully once we are ﬁnished you will
             understand why those in power have spent so much time attacking anarchism
             — it is the one idea which can eﬀectively ensure liberty for all and end all
             systems based on a few having power over the many.
             A.1.1 What does “anarchy” mean?
               The word “anarchy” is from the Greek, preﬁx an (or a), meaning “not,”
             “the want of,” “the absence of,” or “the lack of”, plus archos, meaning “a
             ruler,” “director”, “chief,” “person in charge,” or “authority.” Or, as Peter
             Kropotkin put it, Anarchy comes from the Greek words meaning “contrary to
             authority.” [Anarchism, p. 284]
               While the Greek words anarchos and anarchia are often taken to mean
             “having no government” or “being without a government,” as can be seen, the
             strict, original meaning of anarchism was not simply “no government.” “Anarchy” means “without a ruler,” or more generally, “without authority,” and it
             is in this sense that anarchists have continually used the word. For example,
             we ﬁnd Kropotkin arguing that anarchism “attacks not only capital, but also
             the main sources of the power of capitalism: law, authority, and the State.”
             [Op. Cit., p. 150] For anarchists, anarchy means “not necessarily absence of
             order, as is generally supposed, but an absence of rule.” [Benjamin Tucker,
             Instead of a Book, p. 13] Hence David Weick’s excellent summary:
                   “Anarchism can be understood as the generic social and political
                   idea that expresses negation of all power, sovereignty, domination,
                   and hierarchical division, and a will to their dissolution… Anarchism
                   is therefore more than anti-statism … [even if] government (the
                   state) … is, appropriately, the central focus of anarchist critique.”
                   [Reinventing Anarchy, p. 139]
               For this reason, rather than being purely anti-government or anti-state,
             anarchism is primarily a movement against hierarchy. Why? Because
             hierarchy is the organisational structure that embodies authority. Since the
             state is the “highest” form of hierarchy, anarchists are, by deﬁnition, antistate; but this is not a suﬀicient deﬁnition of anarchism. This means that real
52 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             anarchists are opposed to all forms of hierarchical organisation, not only the
             state. In the words of Brian Morris:
                   “The term anarchy comes from the Greek, and essentially means ‘no
                   ruler.’ Anarchists are people who reject all forms of government or
                   coercive authority, all forms of hierarchy and domination. They are
                   therefore opposed to what the Mexican anarchist Flores Magon
                   called the ‘sombre trinity’ — state, capital and the church.
                   Anarchists are thus opposed to both capitalism and to the state, as
                   well as to all forms of religious authority. But anarchists also seek to
                   establish or bring about by varying means, a condition of anarchy,
                   that is, a decentralised society without coercive institutions, a
                   society organised through a federation of voluntary associations.”
                   [“Anthropology and Anarchism,” pp. 35–41, Anarchy: A Journal of
                   Desire Armed, no. 45, p. 38]
               Reference to “hierarchy” in this context is a fairly recent development —
             the “classical” anarchists such as Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin did use
             the word, but rarely (they usually preferred “authority,” which was used as
             short-hand for “authoritarian”). However, it’s clear from their writings that
             theirs was a philosophy against hierarchy, against any inequality of power or
             privileges between individuals. Bakunin spoke of this when he attacked
             “oﬀicial” authority but defended “natural inﬂuence,” and also when he said:
                   “Do you want to make it impossible for anyone to oppress his fellow-
## man? Then make sure that no one shall possess power.” [The
                   Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 271]
               As Jeﬀ Draughn notes, “while it has always been a latent part of the
             ‘revolutionary project,’ only recently has this broader concept of antihierarchy arisen for more speciﬁc scrutiny. Nonetheless, the root of this is
             plainly visible in the Greek roots of the word ‘anarchy.’” [Between
             Anarchism and Libertarianism: Deﬁning a New Movement]
               We stress that this opposition to hierarchy is, for anarchists, not limited to
             just the state or government. It includes all authoritarian economic and social
             relationships as well as political ones, particularly those associated with
             capitalist property and wage labour. This can be seen from Proudhon’s
             argument that ”Capital … in the political ﬁeld is analogous to government …
             The economic idea of capitalism, the politics of government or of authority,
             and the theological idea of the Church are three identical ideas, linked in
             various ways. To attack one of them is equivalent to attacking all of them …
             What capital does to labour, and the State to liberty, the Church does to the
             spirit. This trinity of absolutism is as baneful in practice as it is in philosophy.
             The most eﬀective means for oppressing the people would be simultaneously
             to enslave its body, its will and its reason.” [quoted by Max Nettlau, A Short
             History of Anarchism, pp. 43–44] Thus we ﬁnd Emma Goldman opposing
             capitalism as it meant “that man [or woman] must sell his [or her] labour”
             and, therefore, “that his [or her] inclination and judgement are subordinated
             to the will of a master.” [Red Emma Speaks, p. 50] Forty years earlier
             Bakunin made the same point when he argued that under the current system
53 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             “the worker sells his person and his liberty for a given time” to the capitalist
             in exchange for a wage. [Op. Cit., p. 187]
               Thus “anarchy” means more than just “no government,” it means opposition
             to all forms of authoritarian organisation and hierarchy. In Kropotkin’s words,
             “the origin of the anarchist inception of society … [lies in] the criticism … of
             the hierarchical organisations and the authoritarian conceptions of society;
             and … the analysis of the tendencies that are seen in the progressive
             movements of mankind.” [Op. Cit., p. 158] For Malatesta, anarchism “was
             born in a moral revolt against social injustice” and that the “speciﬁc causes of
             social ills” could be found in “capitalistic property and the State.” When the
             oppressed “sought to overthrow both State and property — then it was that
             anarchism was born.” [Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, p. 19]
               Thus any attempt to assert that anarchy is purely anti-state is a
             misrepresentation of the word and the way it has been used by the anarchist
             movement. As Brian Morris argues, “when one examines the writings of
             classical anarchists… as well as the character of anarchist movements… it is
             clearly evident that it has never had this limited vision [of just being against
             the state]. It has always challenged all forms of authority and exploitation,
             and has been equally critical of capitalism and religion as it has been of the
             state.” [Op. Cit., p. 40]
               And, just to state the obvious, anarchy does not mean chaos nor do
             anarchists seek to create chaos or disorder. Instead, we wish to create a
             society based upon individual freedom and voluntary co-operation. In other
             words, order from the bottom up, not disorder imposed from the top down by
             authorities. Such a society would be a true anarchy, a society without rulers.
               While we discuss what an anarchy could look like in section I, Noam
             Chomsky sums up the key aspect when he stated that in a truly free society
             “any interaction among human beings that is more than personal — meaning
             that takes institutional forms of one kind or another — in community, or
             workplace, family, larger society, whatever it may be, should be under direct
             control of its participants. So that would mean workers’ councils in industry,
             popular democracy in communities, interaction between them, free
             associations in larger groups, up to organisation of international society.”
             [Anarchism Interview] Society would no longer be divided into a hierarchy
             of bosses and workers, governors and governed. Rather, an anarchist society
             would be based on free association in participatory organisations and run
             from the bottom up. Anarchists, it should be noted, try to create as much of
             this society today, in their organisations, struggles and activities, as they can.
             A.1.2 What does “anarchism” mean?
               To quote Peter Kropotkin, Anarchism is “the no-government system of
             socialism.” [Anarchism, p. 46] In other words, “the abolition of exploitation
             and oppression of man by man, that is the abolition of private property [i.e.
             capitalism] and government.” [Errico Malatesta, Towards Anarchism,”, p.
             75]
               Anarchism, therefore, is a political theory that aims to create a society
             which is without political, economic or social hierarchies. Anarchists maintain
54 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             that anarchy, the absence of rulers, is a viable form of social system and so
             work for the maximisation of individual liberty and social equality. They see
             the goals of liberty and equality as mutually self-supporting. Or, in Bakunin’s
             famous dictum:
                   “We are convinced that freedom without Socialism is privilege and
                   injustice, and that Socialism without freedom is slavery and
                   brutality.” [The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 269]
               The history of human society proves this point. Liberty without equality is
             only liberty for the powerful, and equality without liberty is impossible and a
             justiﬁcation for slavery.
               While there are many diﬀerent types of anarchism (from individualist
             anarchism to communist-anarchism — see section A.3 for more details), there
             has always been two common positions at the core of all of them — opposition
             to government and opposition to capitalism. In the words of the individualistanarchist Benjamin Tucker, anarchism insists “on the abolition of the State
             and the abolition of usury; on no more government of man by man, and no
             more exploitation of man by man.” [cited by Eunice Schuster, Native
             American Anarchism, p. 140] All anarchists view proﬁt, interest and rent as
             usury (i.e. as exploitation) and so oppose them and the conditions that create
             them just as much as they oppose government and the State.
               More generally, in the words of L. Susan Brown, the “unifying link” within
             anarchism “is a universal condemnation of hierarchy and domination and a
             willingness to ﬁght for the freedom of the human individual.” [The Politics of
             Individualism, p. 108] For anarchists, a person cannot be free if they are
             subject to state or capitalist authority. As Voltairine de Cleyre summarised:
                   “Anarchism … teaches the possibility of a society in which the needs
                   of life may be fully supplied for all, and in which the opportunities
                   for complete development of mind and body shall be the heritage of
                   all … [It] teaches that the present unjust organisation of the
                   production and distribution of wealth must ﬁnally be completely
                   destroyed, and replaced by a system which will insure to each the
                   liberty to work, without ﬁrst seeking a master to whom he [or she]
                   must surrender a tithe of his [or her] product, which will guarantee
                   his liberty of access to the sources and means of production… Out of
                   the blindly submissive, it makes the discontented; out of the
                   unconsciously dissatisﬁed, it makes the consciously dissatisﬁed …
                   Anarchism seeks to arouse the consciousness of oppression, the
                   desire for a better society, and a sense of the necessity for
                   unceasing warfare against capitalism and the State.” [Anarchy! An
                   Anthology of Emma Goldman’s Mother Earth, pp. 23–4]
               So Anarchism is a political theory which advocates the creation of anarchy,
             a society based on the maxim of “no rulers.” To achieve this, ”[i]n common
             with all socialists, the anarchists hold that the private ownership of land,
             capital, and machinery has had its time; that it is condemned to disappear:
             and that all requisites for production must, and will, become the common
             property of society, and be managed in common by the producers of wealth.
55 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             And… they maintain that the ideal of the political organisation of society is a
             condition of things where the functions of government are reduced to
             minimum… [and] that the ultimate aim of society is the reduction of the
             functions of government to nil — that is, to a society without government, to
             an-archy” [Peter Kropotkin, Op. Cit., p. 46]
               Thus anarchism is both positive and negative. It analyses and critiques
             current society while at the same time oﬀering a vision of a potential new
             society — a society that fulﬁls certain human needs which the current one
             denies. These needs, at their most basic, are liberty, equality and solidarity,
             which will be discussed in section A.2.
               Anarchism unites critical analysis with hope, for, as Bakunin (in his preanarchist days) pointed out, “the urge to destroy is a creative urge.” One
             cannot build a better society without understanding what is wrong with the
             present one.
               However, it must be stressed that anarchism is more than just a means of
             analysis or a vision of a better society. It is also rooted in struggle, the
             struggle of the oppressed for their freedom. In other words, it provides a
             means of achieving a new system based on the needs of people, not power,
             and which places the planet before proﬁt. To quote Scottish anarchist Stuart
             Christie:

## “Anarchism is a movement for human freedom. It is concrete,
                   democratic and egalitarian … Anarchism began — and remains — a
                   direct challenge by the underprivileged to their oppression and
                   exploitation. It opposes both the insidious growth of state power and
                   the pernicious ethos of possessive individualism, which, together or
                   separately, ultimately serve only the interests of the few at the
## expense of the rest.

                   “Anarchism is both a theory and practice of life. Philosophically, it
                   aims for the maximum accord between the individual, society and
                   nature. Practically, it aims for us to organise and live our lives in
                   such a way as to make politicians, governments, states and their
                   oﬀicials superﬂuous. In an anarchist society, mutually respectful
## sovereign individuals would be organised in non-coercive
                   relationships within naturally deﬁned communities in which the
## means of production and distribution are held in common.

                   “Anarchists are not dreamers obsessed with abstract principles and
                   theoretical constructs … Anarchists are well aware that a perfect
                   society cannot be won tomorrow. Indeed, the struggle lasts forever!
                   However, it is the vision that provides the spur to struggle against
## things as they are, and for things that might be …

## “Ultimately, only struggle determines outcome, and progress
                   towards a more meaningful community must begin with the will to
                   resist every form of injustice. In general terms, this means
                   challenging all exploitation and defying the legitimacy of all
                   coercive authority. If anarchists have one article of unshakeable
                   faith, it is that, once the habit of deferring to politicians or
56 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   ideologues is lost, and that of resistance to domination and
                   exploitation acquired, then ordinary people have a capacity to
                   organise every aspect of their lives in their own interests, anywhere
## and at any time, both freely and fairly.

                   “Anarchists do not stand aside from popular struggle, nor do they
                   attempt to dominate it. They seek to contribute practically whatever
                   they can, and also to assist within it the highest possible levels of
                   both individual self-development and of group solidarity. It is
## possible to recognise anarchist ideas concerning voluntary
                   relationships, egalitarian participation in decision-making
                   processes, mutual aid and a related critique of all forms of
                   domination in philosophical, social and revolutionary movements in
## all times and places.” [My Granny made me an Anarchist, pp.
                   162–3]
               Anarchism, anarchists argue, is simply the theoretical expression of our
             capacity to organise ourselves and run society without bosses or politicians. It
             allows working class and other oppressed people to become conscious of our
             power as a class, defend our immediate interests, and ﬁght to revolutionise
             society as a whole. Only by doing this can we create a society ﬁt for human
             beings to live in.
               It is no abstract philosophy. Anarchist ideas are put into practice everyday.
             Wherever oppressed people stand up for their rights, take action to defend
             their freedom, practice solidarity and co-operation, ﬁght against oppression,
             organise themselves without leaders and bosses, the spirit of anarchism lives.
             Anarchists simply seek to strengthen these libertarian tendencies and bring
             them to their full fruition. As we discuss in section J, anarchists apply their
             ideas in many ways within capitalism in order to change it for the better until
             such time as we get rid of it completely. Section I discusses what we aim to
             replace it with, i.e. what anarchism aims for.
             A.1.3 Why is anarchism also called libertarian
             socialism?
               Many anarchists, seeing the negative nature of the deﬁnition of
             “anarchism,” have used other terms to emphasise the inherently positive and
             constructive aspect of their ideas. The most common terms used are “free
             socialism,” “free communism,” “libertarian socialism,” and “libertarian
             communism.” For anarchists, libertarian socialism, libertarian communism,
             and anarchism are virtually interchangeable. As Vanzetti put it:
                   “After all we are socialists as the social-democrats, the socialists,
                   the communists, and the I.W.W. are all Socialists. The diﬀerence —
                   the fundamental one — between us and all the other is that they are
                   authoritarian while we are libertarian; they believe in a State or
                   Government of their own; we believe in no State or Government.”
                   [Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, The Letters of Sacco and
                   Vanzetti, p. 274]
57 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              But is this correct? Considering deﬁnitions from the American Heritage
             Dictionary, we ﬁnd:
                   LIBERTARIAN: one who believes in freedom of action and thought;
## one who believes in free will.

                   SOCIALISM: a social system in which the producers possess both
                   political power and the means of producing and distributing goods.
              Just taking those two ﬁrst deﬁnitions and fusing them yields:
                   LIBERTARIAN SOCIALISM: a social system which believes in
                   freedom of action and thought and free will, in which the producers
## possess both political power and the means of producing and
## distributing goods.

                (Although we must add that our usual comments on the lack of political
             sophistication of dictionaries still holds. We only use these deﬁnitions to show
             that “libertarian” does not imply “free market” capitalism nor “socialism”
             state ownership. Other dictionaries, obviously, will have diﬀerent deﬁnitions
             — particularly for socialism. Those wanting to debate dictionary deﬁnitions
             are free to pursue this unending and politically useless hobby but we will not).
                However, due to the creation of the Libertarian Party in the USA, many
             people now consider the idea of “libertarian socialism” to be a contradiction
             in terms. Indeed, many “Libertarians” think anarchists are just attempting to
             associate the “anti-libertarian” ideas of “socialism” (as Libertarians conceive
             it) with Libertarian ideology in order to make those “socialist” ideas more
             “acceptable” — in other words, trying to steal the “libertarian” label from its
             rightful possessors.
                Nothing could be further from the truth. Anarchists have been using the
             term “libertarian” to describe themselves and their ideas since the 1850’s.
             According to anarchist historian Max Nettlau, the revolutionary anarchist
             Joseph Dejacque published Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social in
             New York between 1858 and 1861 while the use of the term “libertarian
             communism” dates from November, 1880 when a French anarchist congress
             adopted it. [Max Nettlau, A Short History of Anarchism, p. 75 and p. 145]
             The use of the term “Libertarian” by anarchists became more popular from
             the 1890s onward after it was used in France in an attempt to get round antianarchist laws and to avoid the negative associations of the word “anarchy” in
             the popular mind (Sebastien Faure and Louise Michel published the paper Le
             Libertaire — The Libertarian — in France in 1895, for example). Since
             then, particularly outside America, it has always been associated with
             anarchist ideas and movements. Taking a more recent example, in the USA,
             anarchists organised “The Libertarian League” in July 1954, which had
             staunch anarcho-syndicalist principles and lasted until 1965. The US-based
             “Libertarian” Party, on the other hand has only existed since the early 1970’s,
             well over 100 years after anarchists ﬁrst used the term to describe their
             political ideas (and 90 years after the expression “libertarian communism”
             was ﬁrst adopted). It is that party, not the anarchists, who have “stolen” the
             word. Later, in Section B, we will discuss why the idea of a “libertarian”
58 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             capitalism (as desired by the Libertarian Party) is a contradiction in terms.
                As we will also explain in Section I, only a libertarian-socialist system of
             ownership can maximise individual freedom. Needless to say, state ownership
             — what is commonly called “socialism” — is, for anarchists, not socialism at
             all. In fact, as we will elaborate in Section H, state “socialism” is just a form of
             capitalism, with no socialist content whatever. As Rudolf Rocker noted, for
             anarchists, socialism is “not a simple question of a full belly, but a question of
             culture that would have to enlist the sense of personality and the free
             initiative of the individual; without freedom it would lead only to a dismal
             state capitalism which would sacriﬁce all individual thought and feeling to a
             ﬁctitious collective interest.” [quoted by Colin Ward, “Introduction”, Rudolf
             Rocker, The London Years, p. 1]
                Given the anarchist pedigree of the word “libertarian,” few anarchists are
             happy to see it stolen by an ideology which shares little with our ideas. In the
             United States, as Murray Bookchin noted, the “term ‘libertarian’ itself, to be
             sure, raises a problem, notably, the specious identiﬁcation of an antiauthoritarian ideology with a straggling movement for ‘pure capitalism’ and
             ‘free trade.’ This movement never created the word: it appropriated it from
             the anarchist movement of the [nineteenth] century. And it should be
             recovered by those anti-authoritarians … who try to speak for dominated
             people as a whole, not for personal egotists who identify freedom with
             entrepreneurship and proﬁt.” Thus anarchists in America should “restore in
             practice a tradition that has been denatured by” the free-market right. [The
             Modern Crisis, pp. 154–5] And as we do that, we will continue to call our
             ideas libertarian socialism.
             A.1.4 Are anarchists socialists?
               Yes. All branches of anarchism are opposed to capitalism. This is because
             capitalism is based upon oppression and exploitation (see sections B and C).
             Anarchists reject the “notion that men cannot work together unless they have
             a driving-master to take a percentage of their product” and think that in an
             anarchist society “the real workmen will make their own regulations, decide
             when and where and how things shall be done.” By so doing workers would
             free themselves “from the terrible bondage of capitalism.” [Voltairine de
             Cleyre, “Anarchism”, Exquisite Rebel, p. 75 and p. 79]
               (We must stress here that anarchists are opposed to all economic forms
             which are based on domination and exploitation, including feudalism, Sovietstyle “socialism” — better called “state capitalism” --, slavery and so on. We
             concentrate on capitalism because that is what is dominating the world just
             now).
               Individualists like Benjamin Tucker along with social anarchists like
             Proudhon and Bakunin proclaimed themselves “socialists.” They did so
             because, as Kropotkin put it in his classic essay “Modern Science and
             Anarchism,” ”[s]o long as Socialism was understood in its wide, generic, and
             true sense — as an eﬀort to abolish the exploitation of Labour by Capital —
             the Anarchists were marching hand-in-hands with the Socialists of that time.”
             [Evolution and Environment, p. 81] Or, in Tucker’s words, “the bottom
59 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             claim of Socialism [is] that labour should be put in possession of its own,” a
             claim that both “the two schools of Socialistic thought … State Socialism and
             Anarchism” agreed upon. [The Anarchist Reader, p. 144] Hence the word
             “socialist” was originally deﬁned to include “all those who believed in the
             individual’s right to possess what he or she produced.” [Lance Klafta, “Ayn
             Rand and the Perversion of Libertarianism,” in Anarchy: A Journal of
             Desire Armed, no. 34] This opposition to exploitation (or usury) is shared by
             all true anarchists and places them under the socialist banner.
               For most socialists, “the only guarantee not to be robbed of the fruits of
             your labour is to possess the instruments of labour.” [Peter Kropotkin, The
             Conquest of Bread, p. 145] For this reason Proudhon, for example,
             supported workers’ co-operatives, where “every individual employed in the
             association … has an undivided share in the property of the company”
             because by “participation in losses and gains … the collective force [i.e.
             surplus] ceases to be a source of proﬁts for a small number of managers: it
             becomes the property of all workers.” [The General Idea of the Revolution,
             p. 222 and p. 223] Thus, in addition to desiring the end of exploitation of
             labour by capital, true socialists also desire a society within which the
             producers own and control the means of production (including, it should be
             stressed, those workplaces which supply services). The means by which the
             producers will do this is a moot point in anarchist and other socialist circles,
             but the desire remains a common one. Anarchists favour direct workers’
             control and either ownership by workers’ associations or by the commune
             (see section A.3 on the diﬀerent types of anarchists).
               Moreover, anarchists also reject capitalism for being authoritarian as well
             as exploitative. Under capitalism, workers do not govern themselves during
             the production process nor have control over the product of their labour. Such
             a situation is hardly based on equal freedom for all, nor can it be nonexploitative, and is so opposed by anarchists. This perspective can best be
             found in the work of Proudhon’s (who inspired both Tucker and Bakunin)
             where he argues that anarchism would see ”[c]apitalistic and proprietary
             exploitation stopped everywhere [and] the wage system abolished” for “either
             the workman.. . will be simply the employee of the proprietor-capitalistpromoter; or he will participate … In the ﬁrst case the workman is
             subordinated, exploited: his permanent condition is one of obedience… In the
             second case he resumes his dignity as a man and citizen… he forms part of
             the producing organisation, of which he was before but the slave … we need
             not hesitate, for we have no choice… it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION
             among workers … because without that, they would remain related as
             subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two… castes of masters
             and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society.” [Op.
             Cit., p. 233 and pp. 215–216]
               Therefore all anarchists are anti-capitalist (“If labour owned the wealth it
             produced, there would be no capitalism” [Alexander Berkman, What is
             Anarchism?, p. 44]). Benjamin Tucker, for example — the anarchist most
             inﬂuenced by liberalism (as we will discuss later) — called his ideas
             “Anarchistic-Socialism” and denounced capitalism as a system based upon
             “the usurer, the receiver of interest, rent and proﬁt.” Tucker held that in an
             anarchist, non-capitalist, free-market society, capitalists will become
60 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             redundant and exploitation of labour by capital would cease, since “labour…
             will… secure its natural wage, its entire product.” [The Individualist
             Anarchists, p. 82 and p. 85] Such an economy will be based on mutual
             banking and the free exchange of products between co-operatives, artisans
             and peasants. For Tucker, and other Individualist anarchists, capitalism is not
             a true free market, being marked by various laws and monopolies which
             ensure that capitalists have the advantage over working people, so ensuring
             the latter’s exploitation via proﬁt, interest and rent (see section G for a fuller
             discussion). Even Max Stirner, the arch-egoist, had nothing but scorn for
             capitalist society and its various “spooks,” which for him meant ideas that are
             treated as sacred or religious, such as private property, competition, division
             of labour, and so forth.
               So anarchists consider themselves as socialists, but socialists of a speciﬁc
             kind — libertarian socialists. As the individualist anarchist Joseph A.
             Labadie puts it (echoing both Tucker and Bakunin):
                   “It is said that Anarchism is not socialism. This is a mistake.
                   Anarchism is voluntary Socialism. There are two kinds of Socialism,
                   archistic and anarchistic, authoritarian and libertarian, state and
                   free. Indeed, every proposition for social betterment is either to
                   increase or decrease the powers of external wills and forces over
                   the individual. As they increase they are archistic; as they decrease
                   they are anarchistic.” [Anarchism: What It Is and What It Is
                   Not]
               Labadie stated on many occasions that “all anarchists are socialists, but not
             all socialists are anarchists.” Therefore, Daniel Guerin’s comment that
             “Anarchism is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a
             socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man” is echoed
             throughout the history of the anarchist movement, be it the social or
             individualist wings. [Anarchism, p. 12] Indeed, the Haymarket Martyr Adolph
             Fischer used almost exactly the same words as Labadie to express the same
             fact — “every anarchist is a socialist, but every socialist is not necessarily an
             anarchist” — while acknowledging that the movement was “divided into two
             factions; the communistic anarchists and the Proudhon or middle-class
             anarchists.” [The Autobiographies of the Haymarket Martyrs, p. 81]
               So while social and individualist anarchists do disagree on many issues —
             for example, whether a true, that is non-capitalist, free market would be the
             best means of maximising liberty — they agree that capitalism is to be
             opposed as exploitative and oppressive and that an anarchist society must, by
             deﬁnition, be based on associated, not wage, labour. Only associated labour
             will “decrease the powers of external wills and forces over the individual”
             during working hours and such self-management of work by those who do it is
             the core ideal of real socialism. This perspective can be seen when Joseph
             Labadie argued that the trade union was “the exempliﬁcation of gaining
             freedom by association” and that ”[w]ithout his union, the workman is much
             more the slave of his employer than he is with it.” [Diﬀerent Phases of the
             Labour Question]
               However, the meanings of words change over time. Today “socialism”
             almost always refers to state socialism, a system that all anarchists have
61 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             opposed as a denial of freedom and genuine socialist ideals. All anarchists
             would agree with Noam Chomsky’s statement on this issue:
                   “If the left is understood to include ‘Bolshevism,’ then I would ﬂatly
                   dissociate myself from the left. Lenin was one of the greatest
## enemies of socialism.” [Marxism, Anarchism, and Alternative
                   Futures, p. 779]
                Anarchism developed in constant opposition to the ideas of Marxism, social
             democracy and Leninism. Long before Lenin rose to power, Mikhail Bakunin
             warned the followers of Marx against the “Red bureaucracy” that would
             institute “the worst of all despotic governments” if Marx’s state-socialist ideas
             were ever implemented. Indeed, the works of Stirner, Proudhon and especially
             Bakunin all predict the horror of state Socialism with great accuracy. In
             addition, the anarchists were among the ﬁrst and most vocal critics and
             opposition to the Bolshevik regime in Russia.
                Nevertheless, being socialists, anarchists do share some ideas with some
             Marxists (though none with Leninists). Both Bakunin and Tucker accepted
             Marx’s analysis and critique of capitalism as well as his labour theory of value
             (see section C). Marx himself was heavily inﬂuenced by Max Stirner’s book
             The Ego and Its Own, which contains a brilliant critique of what Marx called
             “vulgar” communism as well as state socialism. There have also been
             elements of the Marxist movement holding views very similar to social
             anarchism (particularly the anarcho-syndicalist branch of social anarchism) —
             for example, Anton Pannekoek, Rosa Luxembourg, Paul Mattick and others,
             who are very far from Lenin. Karl Korsch and others wrote sympathetically of
             the anarchist revolution in Spain. There are many continuities from Marx to
             Lenin, but there are also continuities from Marx to more libertarian Marxists,
             who were harshly critical of Lenin and Bolshevism and whose ideas
             approximate anarchism’s desire for the free association of equals.
                Therefore anarchism is basically a form of socialism, one that stands in
             direct opposition to what is usually deﬁned as “socialism” (i.e. state
             ownership and control). Instead of “central planning,” which many people
             associate with the word “socialism,” anarchists advocate free association and
             co-operation between individuals, workplaces and communities and so oppose
             “state” socialism as a form of state capitalism in which ”[e]very man [and
             woman] will be a wage-receiver, and the State the only wage payer.”
             [Benjamin Tucker, The Individualist Anarchists, p. 81] Thus anarchists
             reject Marxism (what most people think of as “socialism”) as just ”[t]he idea
             of the State as Capitalist, to which the Social-Democratic fraction of the great
             Socialist Party is now trying to reduce Socialism.” [Peter Kropotkin, The
             Great French Revolution, vol. 1, p. 31] The anarchist objection to the
             identiﬁcation of Marxism, “central planning” and State Socialism/Capitalism
             with socialism will be discussed in section H.
                It is because of these diﬀerences with state socialists, and to reduce
             confusion, most anarchists just call themselves “anarchists,” as it is taken for
             granted that anarchists are socialists. However, with the rise of the so-called
             “libertarian” right in the USA, some pro-capitalists have taken to calling
             themselves “anarchists” and that is why we have laboured the point
             somewhat here. Historically, and logically, anarchism implies anti-capitalism,
62 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             i.e. socialism, which is something, we stress, that all anarchists have agreed
             upon (for a fuller discuss of why “anarcho”-capitalism is not anarchist see
             section F).
             A.1.5 Where does anarchism come from?
               Where does anarchism come from? We can do no better than quote The
             Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists produced by
             participants of the Makhnovist movement in the Russian Revolution (see
             Section A.5.4). They point out that:
                   “The class struggle created by the enslavement of workers and their
                   aspirations to liberty gave birth, in the oppression, to the idea of
                   anarchism: the idea of the total negation of a social system based on
                   the principles of classes and the State, and its replacement by a free
## non-statist society of workers under self-management.

                   “So anarchism does not derive from the abstract reﬂections of an
                   intellectual or a philosopher, but from the direct struggle of workers
                   against capitalism, from the needs and necessities of the workers,
                   from their aspirations to liberty and equality, aspirations which
                   become particularly alive in the best heroic period of the life and
## struggle of the working masses.

                   “The outstanding anarchist thinkers, Bakunin, Kropotkin and others,
                   did not invent the idea of anarchism, but, having discovered it in the
## masses, simply helped by the strength of their thought and
                   knowledge to specify and spread it.” [pp. 15–16]
               Like the anarchist movement in general, the Makhnovists were a mass
             movement of working class people resisting the forces of authority, both Red
             (Communist) and White (Tsarist/Capitalist) in the Ukraine from 1917 to 1921.
             As Peter Marshall notes “anarchism … has traditionally found its chief
             supporters amongst workers and peasants.” [Demanding the Impossible, p.
             652]
               Anarchism was created in, and by, the struggle of the oppressed for
             freedom. For Kropotkin, for example, “Anarchism … originated in everyday
             struggles” and “the Anarchist movement was renewed each time it received
             an impression from some great practical lesson: it derived its origin from the
             teachings of life itself.” [Evolution and Environment, p. 58 and p. 57] For
             Proudhon, “the proof” of his mutualist ideas lay in the “current practice,
             revolutionary practice” of “those labour associations … which have
             spontaneously … been formed in Paris and Lyon … [show that the]
             organisation of credit and organisation of labour amount to one and the
             same.” [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, pp. 59–60] Indeed, as one historian
             argues, there was “close similarity between the associational ideal of
             Proudhon … and the program of the Lyon Mutualists” and that there was “a
             remarkable convergence [between the ideas], and it is likely that Proudhon
             was able to articulate his positive program more coherently because of the
63 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             example of the silk workers of Lyon. The socialist ideal that he championed
             was already being realised, to a certain extent, by such workers.” [K. Steven
             Vincent, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican
             Socialism, p. 164]
               Thus anarchism comes from the ﬁght for liberty and our desires to lead a
             fully human life, one in which we have time to live, to love and to play. It was
             not created by a few people divorced from life, in ivory towers looking down
             upon society and making judgements upon it based on their notions of what is
             right and wrong. Rather, it was a product of working class struggle and
             resistance to authority, oppression and exploitation. As Albert Meltzer put it:
                   “There were never theoreticians of Anarchism as such, though it
                   produced a number of theoreticians who discussed aspects of its
                   philosophy. Anarchism has remained a creed that has been worked
                   out in action rather than as the putting into practice of an
                   intellectual idea. Very often, a bourgeois writer comes along and
## writes down what has already been worked out in practice by
                   workers and peasants; he [or she] is attributed by bourgeois
                   historians as being a leader, and by successive bourgeois writers
                   (citing the bourgeois historians) as being one more case that proves
                   the working class relies on bourgeois leadership.” [Anarchism:
                   Arguments for and against, p. 18]
               In Kropotkin’s eyes, “Anarchism had its origins in the same creative,
             constructive activity of the masses which has worked out in times past all the
             social institutions of mankind — and in the revolts … against the
             representatives of force, external to these social institutions, who had laid
             their hands on these institutions and used them for their own advantage.”
             More recently, “Anarchy was brought forth by the same critical and
             revolutionary protest which gave birth to Socialism in general.” Anarchism,
             unlike other forms of socialism, “lifted its sacrilegious arm, not only against
             Capitalism, but also against these pillars of Capitalism: Law, Authority, and
             the State.” All anarchist writers did was to “work out a general expression of
             [anarchism’s] principles, and the theoretical and scientiﬁc basis of its
             teachings” derived from the experiences of working class people in struggle
             as well as analysing the evolutionary tendencies of society in general. [Op.
             Cit., p. 19 and p. 57]
               However, anarchistic tendencies and organisations in society have existed
             long before Proudhon put pen to paper in 1840 and declared himself an
             anarchist. While anarchism, as a speciﬁc political theory, was born with the
             rise of capitalism (Anarchism “emerged at the end of the eighteenth century
             …[and] took up the dual challenge of overthrowing both Capital and the
             State.” [Peter Marshall, Op. Cit., p. 4]) anarchist writers have analysed
             history for libertarian tendencies. Kropotkin argued, for example, that “from
             all times there have been Anarchists and Statists.” [Op. Cit., p. 16] In
             Mutual Aid (and elsewhere) Kropotkin analysed the libertarian aspects of
             previous societies and noted those that successfully implemented (to some
             degree) anarchist organisation or aspects of anarchism. He recognised this
             tendency of actual examples of anarchistic ideas to predate the creation of the
             “oﬀicial” anarchist movement and argued that:
64 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   “From the remotest, stone-age antiquity, men [and women] have
                   realised the evils that resulted from letting some of them acquire
                   personal authority… Consequently they developed in the primitive
                   clan, the village community, the medieval guild … and ﬁnally in the
                   free medieval city, such institutions as enabled them to resist the
                   encroachments upon their life and fortunes both of those strangers
## who conquered them, and those clansmen of their own who
                   endeavoured to establish their personal authority.” [Anarchism, pp.
                   158–9]
               Kropotkin placed the struggle of working class people (from which modern
             anarchism sprung) on par with these older forms of popular organisation. He
             argued that “the labour combinations… were an outcome of the same popular
             resistance to the growing power of the few — the capitalists in this case” as
             were the clan, the village community and so on, as were “the strikingly
             independent, freely federated activity of the ‘Sections’ of Paris and all great
             cities and many small ‘Communes’ during the French Revolution” in 1793.
             [Op. Cit., p. 159]
               Thus, while anarchism as a political theory is an expression of working class
             struggle and self-activity against capitalism and the modern state, the ideas of
             anarchism have continually expressed themselves in action throughout human
             existence. Many indigenous peoples in North America and elsewhere, for
             example, practised anarchism for thousands of years before anarchism as a
             speciﬁc political theory existed. Similarly, anarchistic tendencies and
             organisations have existed in every major revolution — the New England
             Town Meetings during the American Revolution, the Parisian ‘Sections’ during
             the French Revolution, the workers’ councils and factory committees during
             the Russian Revolution to name just a few examples (see Murray Bookchin’s
             The Third Revolution for details). This is to be expected if anarchism is, as
             we argue, a product of resistance to authority then any society with
             authorities will provoke resistance to them and generate anarchistic
             tendencies (and, of course, any societies without authorities cannot help but
             being anarchistic).
               In other words, anarchism is an expression of the struggle against
             oppression and exploitation, a generalisation of working people’s experiences
             and analyses of what is wrong with the current system and an expression of
             our hopes and dreams for a better future. This struggle existed before it was
             called anarchism, but the historic anarchist movement (i.e. groups of people
             calling their ideas anarchism and aiming for an anarchist society) is
             essentially a product of working class struggle against capitalism and the
             state, against oppression and exploitation, and for a free society of free and
             equal individuals.
             A.2 What does anarchism stand for?
               These words by Percy Bysshe Shelley gives an idea of what anarchism
             stands for in practice and what ideals drive it:
## The man
             Of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys:
65 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             Power, like a desolating pestilence,
             Pollutes whate’er it touches, and obedience,
             Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth,
             Makes slaves of men, and, of the human frame,
             A mechanised automaton.
                As Shelley’s lines suggest, anarchists place a high priority on liberty,
             desiring it both for themselves and others. They also consider individuality —
             that which makes one a unique person — to be a most important aspect of
             humanity. They recognise, however, that individuality does not exist in a
             vacuum but is a social phenomenon. Outside of society, individuality is
             impossible, since one needs other people in order to develop, expand, and
             grow.
                Moreover, between individual and social development there is a reciprocal
             eﬀect: individuals grow within and are shaped by a particular society, while at
             the same time they help shape and change aspects of that society (as well as
             themselves and other individuals) by their actions and thoughts. A society not
             based on free individuals, their hopes, dreams and ideas would be hollow and
             dead. Thus, “the making of a human being… is a collective process, a process
             in which both community and the individual participate.” [Murray Bookchin,
             The Modern Crisis, p. 79] Consequently, any political theory which bases
             itself purely on the social or the individual is false.
                In order for individuality to develop to the fullest possible extent, anarchists
             consider it essential to create a society based on three principles: liberty,
             equality and solidarity. These principles are shared by all anarchists. Thus
             we ﬁnd, the communist-anarchist Peter Kropotkin talking about a revolution
             inspired by “the beautiful words, Liberty, Equality and Solidarity.” [The
             Conquest of Bread, p. 128] Individualist-anarchist Benjamin Tucker wrote of
             a similar vision, arguing that anarchism “insists on Socialism … on true
             Socialism, Anarchistic Socialism: the prevalance on earth of Liberty, Equality,
             and Solidarity.” [Instead of a Book, p. 363] All three principles are
             interdependent.
                Liberty is essential for the full ﬂowering of human intelligence, creativity,
             and dignity. To be dominated by another is to be denied the chance to think
             and act for oneself, which is the only way to grow and develop one’s
             individuality. Domination also stiﬂes innovation and personal responsibility,
             leading to conformity and mediocrity. Thus the society that maximises the
             growth of individuality will necessarily be based on voluntary association, not
             coercion and authority. To quote Proudhon, “All associated and all free.” Or, as
             Luigi Galleani puts it, anarchism is “the autonomy of the individual within the
             freedom of association” [The End of Anarchism?, p. 35] (See further section
             A.2.2 — Why do anarchists emphasise liberty?).
                If liberty is essential for the fullest development of individuality, then
             equality is essential for genuine liberty to exist. There can be no real freedom
             in a class-stratiﬁed, hierarchical society riddled with gross inequalities of
             power, wealth, and privilege. For in such a society only a few — those at the
             top of the hierarchy — are relatively free, while the rest are semi-slaves.
             Hence without equality, liberty becomes a mockery — at best the “freedom” to
             choose one’s master (boss), as under capitalism. Moreover, even the elite
             under such conditions are not really free, because they must live in a stunted
66 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             society made ugly and barren by the tyranny and alienation of the majority.
             And since individuality develops to the fullest only with the widest contact
             with other free individuals, members of the elite are restricted in the
             possibilities for their own development by the scarcity of free individuals with
             whom to interact. (See also section A.2.5 — Why are anarchists in favour of
             equality?)
               Finally, solidarity means mutual aid: working voluntarily and co-operatively
             with others who share the same goals and interests. But without liberty and
             equality, society becomes a pyramid of competing classes based on the
             domination of the lower by the higher strata. In such a society, as we know
             from our own, it’s “dominate or be dominated,” “dog eat dog,” and “everyone
             for themselves.” Thus “rugged individualism” is promoted at the expense of
             community feeling, with those on the bottom resenting those above them and
             those on the top fearing those below them. Under such conditions, there can
             be no society-wide solidarity, but only a partial form of solidarity within
             classes whose interests are opposed, which weakens society as a whole. (See
             also section A.2.6 — Why is solidarity important to anarchists?)
               It should be noted that solidarity does not imply self-sacriﬁce or selfnegation. As Errico Malatesta makes clear:
                   “we are all egoists, we all seek our own satisfaction. But the
                   anarchist ﬁnds his greatest satisfaction in struggling for the good of
                   all, for the achievement of a society in which he [sic] can be a
                   brother among brothers, and among healthy, intelligent, educated,
                   and happy people. But he who is adaptable, who is satisﬁed to live
                   among slaves and draw proﬁt from the labour of slaves, is not, and
                   cannot be, an anarchist.” [Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas,
                   p. 23]
               For anarchists, real wealth is other people and the planet on which we live.
             Or, in the words of Emma Goldman, it “consists in things of utility and beauty,
             in things which help to create strong, beautiful bodies and surroundings
             inspiring to live in … [Our] goal is the freest possible expression of all the
             latent powers of the individual . .. Such free display of human energy being
             possible only under complete individual and social freedom,” in other words
             “social equality.” [Red Emma Speaks, pp. 67–8]
               Also, honouring individuality does not mean that anarchists are idealists,
             thinking that people or ideas develop outside of society. Individuality and
             ideas grow and develop within society, in response to material and intellectual
             interactions and experiences, which people actively analyse and interpret.
             Anarchism, therefore, is a materialist theory, recognising that ideas develop
             and grow from social interaction and individuals’ mental activity (see Michael
             Bakunin’s God and the State for the classic discussion of materialism versus
             idealism).
               This means that an anarchist society will be the creation of human beings,
             not some deity or other transcendental principle, since ”[n]othing ever
             arranges itself, least of all in human relations. It is men [sic] who do the
             arranging, and they do it according to their attitudes and understanding of
             things.” [Alexander Berkman, What is Anarchism?, p. 185]
               Therefore, anarchism bases itself upon the power of ideas and the ability of
67 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             people to act and transform their lives based on what they consider to be
             right. In other words, liberty.
             A.2.1 What is the essence of anarchism?
               As we have seen, “an-archy” implies “without rulers” or “without
             (hierarchical) authority.” Anarchists are not against “authorities” in the sense
             of experts who are particularly knowledgeable, skilful, or wise, though they
             believe that such authorities should have no power to force others to follow
             their recommendations (see section B.1 for more on this distinction). In a
             nutshell, then, anarchism is anti-authoritarianism.
               Anarchists are anti-authoritarians because they believe that no human
             being should dominate another. Anarchists, in L. Susan Brown’s words,
             “believe in the inherent dignity and worth of the human individual.” [The
             Politics of Individualism, p. 107] Domination is inherently degrading and
             demeaning, since it submerges the will and judgement of the dominated to
             the will and judgement of the dominators, thus destroying the dignity and selfrespect that comes only from personal autonomy. Moreover, domination
             makes possible and generally leads to exploitation, which is the root of
             inequality, poverty, and social breakdown.
               In other words, then, the essence of anarchism (to express it positively) is
             free co-operation between equals to maximise their liberty and individuality.
               Co-operation between equals is the key to anti-authoritarianism. By cooperation we can develop and protect our own intrinsic value as unique
             individuals as well as enriching our lives and liberty for ”[n]o individual can
             recognise his own humanity, and consequently realise it in his lifetime, if not
             by recognising it in others and co-operating in its realisation for others … My
             freedom is the freedom of all since I am not truly free in thought and in fact,
             except when my freedom and my rights are conﬁrmed and approved in the
             freedom and rights of all men [and women] who are my equals.” [Michael
             Bakunin, quoted by Errico Malatesta, Anarchy, p. 30]
               While being anti-authoritarians, anarchists recognise that human beings
             have a social nature and that they mutually inﬂuence each other. We cannot
             escape the “authority” of this mutual inﬂuence, because, as Bakunin reminds
             us:
                   “The abolition of this mutual inﬂuence would be death. And when
## we advocate the freedom of the masses, we are by no means
                   suggesting the abolition of any of the natural inﬂuences that
                   individuals or groups of individuals exert on them. What we want is
                   the abolition of inﬂuences which are artiﬁcial, privileged, legal,
                   oﬀicial.” [quoted by Malatesta, Anarchy, p. 51]
               In other words, those inﬂuences which stem from hierarchical authority.
               This is because hierarchical systems like capitalism deny liberty and, as a
             result, people’s “mental, moral, intellectual and physical qualities are
             dwarfed, stunted and crushed” (see section B.1 for more details). Thus one of
             “the grand truths of Anarchism” is that “to be really free is to allow each one
             to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same.”
68 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             This is why anarchists ﬁght for a better society, for a society which respects
             individuals and their freedom. Under capitalism, ”[e]verything is upon the
             market for sale: all is merchandise and commerce” but there are “certain
             things that are priceless. Among these are life, liberty and happiness, and
             these are things which the society of the future, the free society, will
             guarantee to all.” Anarchists, as a result, seek to make people aware of their
             dignity, individuality and liberty and to encourage the spirit of revolt,
             resistance and solidarity in those subject to authority. This gets us denounced
             by the powerful as being breakers of the peace, but anarchists consider the
             struggle for freedom as inﬁnitely better than the peace of slavery. Anarchists,
             as a result of our ideals, “believe in peace at any price — except at the price
             of liberty. But this precious gift the wealth-producers already seem to have
             lost. Life … they have; but what is life worth when it lacks those elements
             which make for enjoyment?” [Lucy Parsons, Liberty, Equality & Solidarity,
             p. 103, p. 131, p. 103 and p. 134]
               So, in a nutshell, Anarchists seek a society in which people interact in ways
             which enhance the liberty of all rather than crush the liberty (and so
             potential) of the many for the beneﬁt of a few. Anarchists do not want to give
             others power over themselves, the power to tell them what to do under the
             threat of punishment if they do not obey. Perhaps non-anarchists, rather than
             be puzzled why anarchists are anarchists, would be better oﬀ asking what it
             says about themselves that they feel this attitude needs any sort of
             explanation.
             A.2.2 Why do anarchists emphasise liberty?
               An anarchist can be regarded, in Bakunin’s words, as a “fanatic lover of
             freedom, considering it as the unique environment within which the
             intelligence, dignity and happiness of mankind can develop and increase.”
             [Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings, p. 196] Because human beings are
             thinking creatures, to deny them liberty is to deny them the opportunity to
             think for themselves, which is to deny their very existence as humans. For
             anarchists, freedom is a product of our humanity, because:
                   “The very fact… that a person has a consciousness of self, of being
                   diﬀerent from others, creates a desire to act freely. The craving for
                   liberty and self-expression is a very fundamental and dominant
                   trait.” [Emma Goldman, Red Emma Speaks, p. 439]
               For this reason, anarchism “proposes to rescue the self-respect and
             independence of the individual from all restraint and invasion by authority.
             Only in freedom can man [sic!] grow to his full stature. Only in freedom will
             he learn to think and move, and give the very best of himself. Only in freedom
             will he realise the true force of the social bonds which tie men together, and
             which are the true foundations of a normal social life.” [Op. Cit., pp. 72–3]
               Thus, for anarchists, freedom is basically individuals pursuing their own
             good in their own way. Doing so calls forth the activity and power of
             individuals as they make decisions for and about themselves and their lives.
             Only liberty can ensure individual development and diversity. This is because
69 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             when individuals govern themselves and make their own decisions they have
             to exercise their minds and this can have no other eﬀect than expanding and
             stimulating the individuals involved. As Malatesta put it, ”[f]or people to
             become educated to freedom and the management of their own interests, they
             must be left to act for themselves, to feel responsibility for their own actions
             in the good or bad that comes from them. They’d make mistakes, but they’d
             understand from the consequences where they’d gone wrong and try out new
             ways.” [Fra Contadini, p. 26]
               So, liberty is the precondition for the maximum development of one’s
             individual potential, which is also a social product and can be achieved only in
             and through community. A healthy, free community will produce free
             individuals, who in turn will shape the community and enrich the social
             relationships between the people of whom it is composed. Liberties, being
             socially produced, “do not exist because they have been legally set down on a
             piece of paper, but only when they have become the ingrown habit of a
             people, and when any attempt to impair them will meet with the violent
             resistance of the populace … One compels respect from others when one
             knows how to defend one’s dignity as a human being. This is not only true in
             private life; it has always been the same in political life as well.” In fact, we
             “owe all the political rights and privileges which we enjoy today in greater or
             lesser measures, not to the good will of their governments, but to their own
             strength.” [Rudolf Rocker, Anarcho-syndicalism, p. 75]
               It is for this reason anarchists support the tactic of “Direct Action” (see
             section J.2) for, as Emma Goldman argued, we have “as much liberty as [we
             are] willing to take. Anarchism therefore stands for direct action, the open
             deﬁance of, and resistance to, all laws and restrictions, economic, social, and
             moral.” It requires “integrity, self-reliance, and courage. In short, it calls for
             free, independent spirits” and “only persistent resistance” can “ﬁnally set [us]
             free. Direct action against the authority in the shop, direct action against the
             authority of the law, direct action against the invasive, meddlesome authority
             of our moral code, is the logical, consistent method of Anarchism.” [Red
             Emma Speaks, pp. 76–7]
               Direct action is, in other words, the application of liberty, used to resist
             oppression in the here and now as well as the means of creating a free
             society. It creates the necessary individual mentality and social conditions in
             which liberty ﬂourishes. Both are essential as liberty develops only within
             society, not in opposition to it. Thus Murray Bookchin writes:

## “What freedom, independence, and autonomy people have in a
                   given historical period is the product of long social traditions and …
                   a collective development — which is not to deny that individuals
                   play an important role in that development, indeed are ultimately
                   obliged to do so if they wish to be free.” [Social Anarchism or
                   Lifestyle Anarchism, p. 15]
               But freedom requires the right kind of social environment in which to grow
             and develop. Such an environment must be decentralised and based on the
             direct management of work by those who do it. For centralisation means
             coercive authority (hierarchy), whereas self-management is the essence of
             freedom. Self-management ensures that the individuals involved use (and so

             develop) all their abilities — particularly their mental ones. Hierarchy, in
             contrast, substitutes the activities and thoughts of a few for the activities and
             thoughts of all the individuals involved. Thus, rather than developing their
             abilities to the full, hierarchy marginalises the many and ensures that their
             development is blunted (see also section B.1).
                It is for this reason that anarchists oppose both capitalism and statism. As
             the French anarchist Sebastien Faure noted, authority “dresses itself in two
             principal forms: the political form, that is the State; and the economic form,
             that is private property.” [cited by Peter Marshall, Demanding the
             Impossible, p. 43] Capitalism, like the state, is based on centralised authority
             (i.e. of the boss over the worker), the very purpose of which is to keep the
             management of work out of the hands of those who do it. This means “that the
             serious, ﬁnal, complete liberation of the workers is possible only upon one
             condition: that of the appropriation of capital, that is, of raw material and all
             the tools of labour, including land, by the whole body of the workers.”
             [Michael Bakunin, quoted by Rudolf Rocker, Op. Cit., p. 50]
                Hence, as Noam Chomsky argues, a “consistent anarchist must oppose
             private ownership of the means of production and the wage slavery which is a
             component of this system, as incompatible with the principle that labour must
             be freely undertaken and under the control of the producer.” [“Notes on
             Anarchism”, For Reasons of State, p. 158]
                Thus, liberty for anarchists means a non-authoritarian society in which
             individuals and groups practice self-management, i.e. they govern themselves.
             The implications of this are important. First, it implies that an anarchist
             society will be non-coercive, that is, one in which violence or the threat of
             violence will not be used to “convince” individuals to do anything. Second, it
             implies that anarchists are ﬁrm supporters of individual sovereignty, and that,
             because of this support, they also oppose institutions based on coercive
             authority, i.e. hierarchy. And ﬁnally, it implies that anarchists’ opposition to
             “government” means only that they oppose centralised, hierarchical,
             bureaucratic organisations or government. They do not oppose selfgovernment through confederations of decentralised, grassroots
             organisations, so long as these are based on direct democracy rather than the
             delegation of power to “representatives” (see section A.2.9 for more on
             anarchist organisation). For authority is the opposite of liberty, and hence any
             form of organisation based on the delegation of power is a threat to the
             liberty and dignity of the people subjected to that power.
                Anarchists consider freedom to be the only social environment within which
             human dignity and diversity can ﬂower. Under capitalism and statism,
             however, there is no freedom for the majority, as private property and
             hierarchy ensure that the inclination and judgement of most individuals will
             be subordinated to the will of a master, severely restricting their liberty and
             making impossible the “full development of all the material, intellectual and
             moral capacities that are latent in every one of us.” [Michael Bakunin,
             Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 261] That is why anarchists seek to ensure “that
             real justice and real liberty might come on earth” for it is “all false, all
             unnecessary, this wild waste of human life, of bone and sinew and brain and
             heart, this turning of people into human rags, ghosts, piteous caricatures of
             the creatures they had it in them to be, on the day they were born; that what
71 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             is called ‘economy’, the massing up of things, is in reality the most frightful
             spending — the sacriﬁce of the maker to the made — the lose of all the ﬁner
             and nobler instincts in the gain of one revolting attribute, the power to count
             and calculate.” [Voltairine de Cleyre, The First Mayday: The Haymarket
             Speeches 1895–1910, pp, 17–18]
               (See section B for further discussion of the hierarchical and authoritarian
             nature of capitalism and statism).
             A.2.3 Are anarchists in favour of organisation?
               Yes. Without association, a truly human life is impossible. Liberty cannot
             exist without society and organisation. As George Barrett pointed out:
                   “To get the full meaning out of life we must co-operate, and to co-
## operate we must make agreements with our fellow-men. But to
                   suppose that such agreements mean a limitation of freedom is
                   surely an absurdity; on the contrary, they are the exercise of our
## freedom.

                   “If we are going to invent a dogma that to make agreements is to
                   damage freedom, then at once freedom becomes tyrannical, for it
                   forbids men to take the most ordinary everyday pleasures. For
                   example, I cannot go for a walk with my friend because it is against
                   the principle of Liberty that I should agree to be at a certain place
                   at a certain time to meet him. I cannot in the least extend my own
                   power beyond myself, because to do so I must co-operate with
                   someone else, and co-operation implies an agreement, and that is
                   against Liberty. It will be seen at once that this argument is absurd.
                   I do not limit my liberty, but simply exercise it, when I agree with
## my friend to go for a walk.

                   “If, on the other hand, I decide from my superior knowledge that it
                   is good for my friend to take exercise, and therefore I attempt to
                   compel him to go for a walk, then I begin to limit freedom. This is
## the diﬀerence between free agreement and government.”
                   [Objections to Anarchism, pp. 348–9]
               As far as organisation goes, anarchists think that “far from creating
             authority, [it] is the only cure for it and the only means whereby each of us
             will get used to taking an active and conscious part in collective work, and
             cease being passive instruments in the hands of leaders.” [Errico Malatesta,
             Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, p. 86] Thus anarchists are well
             aware of the need to organise in a structured and open manner. As Carole
             Ehrlich points out, while anarchists “aren’t opposed to structure” and simply
             “want to abolish hierarchical structure” they are “almost always stereotyped
             as wanting no structure at all.” This is not the case, for “organisations that
             would build in accountability, diﬀusion of power among the maximum number
             of persons, task rotation, skill-sharing, and the spread of information and
             resources” are based on “good social anarchist principles of organisation!”
72 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             [“Socialism, Anarchism and Feminism”, Quiet Rumours: An AnarchaFeminist Reader, p. 47 and p. 46]
                The fact that anarchists are in favour of organisation may seem strange at
             ﬁrst, but it is understandable. “For those with experience only of authoritarian
             organisation,” argue two British anarchists, “it appears that organisation can
             only be totalitarian or democratic, and that those who disbelieve in
             government must by that token disbelieve in organisation at all. That is not
             so.” [Stuart Christie and Albert Meltzer, The Floodgates of Anarchy, p. 122]
             In other words, because we live in a society in which virtually all forms of
             organisation are authoritarian, this makes them appear to be the only kind
             possible. What is usually not recognised is that this mode of organisation is
             historically conditioned, arising within a speciﬁc kind of society — one whose
             motive principles are domination and exploitation. According to
             archaeologists and anthropologists, this kind of society has only existed for
             about 5,000 years, having appeared with the ﬁrst primitive states based on
             conquest and slavery, in which the labour of slaves created a surplus which
             supported a ruling class.
                Prior to that time, for hundreds of thousands of years, human and protohuman societies were what Murray Bookchin calls “organic,” that is, based on
             co-operative forms of economic activity involving mutual aid, free access to
             productive resources, and a sharing of the products of communal labour
             according to need. Although such societies probably had status rankings
             based on age, there were no hierarchies in the sense of institutionalised
             dominance-subordination relations enforced by coercive sanctions and
             resulting in class-stratiﬁcation involving the economic exploitation of one
             class by another (see Murray Bookchin, The Ecology of Freedom).
                It must be emphasised, however, that anarchists do not advocate going
             “back to the Stone Age.” We merely note that since the hierarchicalauthoritarian mode of organisation is a relatively recent development in the
             course of human social evolution, there is no reason to suppose that it is
             somehow “fated” to be permanent. We do not think that human beings are
             genetically “programmed” for authoritarian, competitive, and aggressive
             behaviour, as there is no credible evidence to support this claim. On the
             contrary, such behaviour is socially conditioned, or learned, and as such, can
             be unlearned (see Ashley Montagu, The Nature of Human Aggression).
             We are not fatalists or genetic determinists, but believe in free will, which
             means that people can change the way they do things, including the way they
             organise society.
                And there is no doubt that society needs to be better organised, because
             presently most of its wealth — which is produced by the majority — and
             power gets distributed to a small, elite minority at the top of the social
             pyramid, causing deprivation and suﬀering for the rest, particularly for those
             at the bottom. Yet because this elite controls the means of coercion through
             its control of the state (see section B.2.3), it is able to suppress the majority
             and ignore its suﬀering — a phenomenon that occurs on a smaller scale within
             all hierarchies. Little wonder, then, that people within authoritarian and
             centralised structures come to hate them as a denial of their freedom. As
             Alexander Berkman puts it:
73 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   “Any one who tells you that Anarchists don’t believe in organisation
                   is talking nonsense. Organisation is everything, and everything is
                   organisation. The whole of life is organisation, conscious or
                   unconscious … But there is organisation and organisation. Capitalist
                   society is so badly organised that its various members suﬀer: just as
                   when you have a pain in some part of you, your whole body aches
                   and you are ill… , not a single member of the organisation or union
                   may with impunity be discriminated against, suppressed or ignored.
                   To do so would be the same as to ignore an aching tooth: you would
                   be sick all over.” [Op. Cit., p. 198]
                Yet this is precisely what happens in capitalist society, with the result that it
             is, indeed, “sick all over.”
                For these reasons, anarchists reject authoritarian forms of organisation and
             instead support associations based on free agreement. Free agreement is
             important because, in Berkman’s words, ”[o]nly when each is a free and
             independent unit, co-operating with others from his own choice because of
             mutual interests, can the world work successfully and become powerful.” [Op.
             Cit., p. 199] As we discuss in section A.2.14, anarchists stress that free
             agreement has to be complemented by direct democracy (or, as it is usually
             called by anarchists, self-management) within the association itself otherwise
             “freedom” become little more than picking masters.
                Anarchist organisation is based on a massive decentralisation of power back
             into the hands of the people, i.e. those who are directly aﬀected by the
             decisions being made. To quote Proudhon:
                   “Unless democracy is a fraud and the sovereignty of the People a
                   joke, it must be admitted that each citizen in the sphere of his [or
                   her] industry, each municipal, district or provincial council within its
                   own territory … should act directly and by itself in administering the
                   interests which it includes, and should exercise full sovereignty in
                   relation to them.” [The General Idea of the Revolution, p. 276]
                It also implies a need for federalism to co-ordinate joint interests. For
             anarchism, federalism is the natural complement to self-management. With
             the abolition of the State, society “can, and must, organise itself in a diﬀerent
             fashion, but not from top to bottom … The future social organisation must be
             made solely from the bottom upwards, by the free association or federation of
             workers, ﬁrstly in their unions, then in the communes, regions, nations and
             ﬁnally in a great federation, international and universal. Then alone will be
             realised the true and life-giving order of freedom and the common good, that
             order which, far from denying, on the contrary aﬀirms and brings into
             harmony the interests of individuals and of society.” [Bakunin, Michael
             Bakunin: Selected Writings, pp. 205–6] Because a “truly popular
             organisation begins … from below” and so “federalism becomes a political
             institution of Socialism, the free and spontaneous organisation of popular
             life.” Thus libertarian socialism “is federalistic in character.” [Bakunin, The
             Political Philosophy of Bakunin, pp. 273–4 and p. 272]
                Therefore, anarchist organisation is based on direct democracy (or selfmanagement) and federalism (or confederation). These are the expression and
74 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             environment of liberty. Direct (or participatory) democracy is essential
             because liberty and equality imply the need for forums within which people
             can discuss and debate as equals and which allow for the free exercise of
             what Murray Bookchin calls “the creative role of dissent.” Federalism is
             necessary to ensure that common interests are discussed and joint activity
             organised in a way which reﬂects the wishes of all those aﬀected by them. To
             ensure that decisions ﬂow from the bottom up rather than being imposed
             from the top down by a few rulers.
               Anarchist ideas on libertarian organisation and the need for direct
             democracy and confederation will be discussed further in sections A.2.9 and
             A.2.11.
             A.2.4 Are anarchists in favour of “absolute” liberty?
               No. Anarchists do not believe that everyone should be able to “do whatever
             they like,” because some actions invariably involve the denial of the liberty of
             others.
               For example, anarchists do not support the “freedom” to rape, to exploit, or
             to coerce others. Neither do we tolerate authority. On the contrary, since
             authority is a threat to liberty, equality, and solidarity (not to mention human
             dignity), anarchists recognise the need to resist and overthrow it.
               The exercise of authority is not freedom. No one has a “right” to rule others.
             As Malatesta points out, anarchism supports “freedom for everybody … with
             the only limit of the equal freedom for others; which does not mean … that we
             recognise, and wish to respect, the ‘freedom’ to exploit, to oppress, to
             command, which is oppression and certainly not freedom.” [Errico
             Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, p. 53]
               In a capitalist society, resistance to all forms of hierarchical authority is the
             mark of a free person — be it private (the boss) or public (the state). As Henry
             David Thoreau pointed out in his essay on “Civil Disobedience” (1847)
                   “Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient must
## be slaves.”

             A.2.5 Why are anarchists in favour of equality?
                As mentioned in above, anarchists are dedicated to social equality because
             it is the only context in which individual liberty can ﬂourish. However, there
             has been much nonsense written about “equality,” and much of what is
             commonly believed about it is very strange indeed. Before discussing what
             anarchist do mean by equality, we have to indicate what we do not mean by
             it.
                Anarchists do not believe in “equality of endowment,” which is not only
             non-existent but would be very undesirable if it could be brought about.
             Everyone is unique. Biologically determined human diﬀerences not only exist
             but are “a cause for joy, not fear or regret.” Why? Because “life among clones
             would not be worth living, and a sane person will only rejoice that others have
             abilities that they do not share.” [Noam Chomsky, Marxism, Anarchism, and
75 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             Alternative Futures, p. 782]
               That some people seriously suggest that anarchists means by “equality”
             that everyone should be identical is a sad reﬂection on the state of presentday intellectual culture and the corruption of words — a corruption used to
             divert attention from an unjust and authoritarian system and side-track
             people into discussions of biology. “The uniqueness of the self in no way
             contradicts the principle of equality,” noted Erich Fromm, “The thesis that
             men are born equal implies that they all share the same fundamental human
             qualities, that they share the same basic fate of human beings, that they all
             have the same inalienable claim on freedom and happiness. It furthermore
             means that their relationship is one of solidarity, not one of dominationsubmission. What the concept of equality does not mean is that all men are
             alike.” [The Fear of Freedom, p. 228] Thus it would be fairer to say that
             anarchists seek equality because we recognise that everyone is diﬀerent and,
             consequently, seek the full aﬀirmation and development of that uniqueness.
               Nor are anarchists in favour of so-called “equality of outcome.” We have no
             desire to live in a society were everyone gets the same goods, lives in the
             same kind of house, wears the same uniform, etc. Part of the reason for the
             anarchist revolt against capitalism and statism is that they standardise so
             much of life (see George Reitzer’s The McDonaldisation of Society on why
             capitalism is driven towards standardisation and conformity). In the words of
             Alexander Berkman:
                   “The spirit of authority, law, written and unwritten, tradition and
                   custom force us into a common grove and make a man [or woman] a
                   will-less automation without independence or individuality… All of
                   us are its victims, and only the exceptionally strong succeed in
                   breaking its chains, and that only partly.” [What is Anarchism?, p.
                   165]
               Anarchists, therefore, have little to desire to make this “common grove”
             even deeper. Rather, we desire to destroy it and every social relationship and
             institution that creates it in the ﬁrst place.
               “Equality of outcome” can only be introduced and maintained by force,
             which would not be equality anyway, as some would have more power than
             others! “Equality of outcome” is particularly hated by anarchists, as we
             recognise that every individual has diﬀerent needs, abilities, desires and
             interests. To make all consume the same would be tyranny. Obviously, if one
             person needs medical treatment and another does not, they do not receive an
             “equal” amount of medical care. The same is true of other human needs. As
             Alexander Berkman put it:
                   “equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity…
                   Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the
                   forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies
                   freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat,
                   drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the
                   same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact.”
                   “Individual needs and tastes diﬀer, as appetites diﬀer. It is equal

## opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality.

                   “Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest
                   possible variety of activity and development. For human character is
                   diverse … Free opportunity of expressing and acting out your
                   individuality means development of natural dissimilarities and
                   variations.” [Op. Cit., pp. 164–5]
               For anarchists, the “concepts” of “equality” as “equality of outcome” or
             “equality of endowment” are meaningless. However, in a hierarchical society,
             “equality of opportunity” and “equality of outcome” are related. Under
             capitalism, for example, the opportunities each generation face are dependent
             on the outcomes of the previous ones. This means that under capitalism
             “equality of opportunity” without a rough “equality of outcome” (in the sense
             of income and resources) becomes meaningless, as there is no real equality of
             opportunity for the oﬀ-spring of a millionaire and that of a road sweeper.
             Those who argue for “equality of opportunity” while ignoring the barriers
             created by previous outcomes indicate that they do not know what they are
             talking about — opportunity in a hierarchical society depends not only on an
             open road but also upon an equal start. From this obvious fact springs the
             misconception that anarchists desire “equality of outcome” — but this applies
             to a hierarchical system, in a free society this would not the case (as we will
             see).
               Equality, in anarchist theory, does not mean denying individual diversity or
             uniqueness. As Bakunin observes:
                   “once equality has triumphed and is well established, will various
                   individuals’ abilities and their levels of energy cease to diﬀer? Some
                   will exist, perhaps not so many as now, but certainly some will
                   always exist. It is proverbial that the same tree never bears two
                   identical leaves, and this will probably be always be true. And it is
                   even more truer with regard to human beings, who are much more
                   complex than leaves. But this diversity is hardly an evil. On the
                   contrary… it is a resource of the human race. Thanks to this
                   diversity, humanity is a collective whole in which the one individual
                   complements all the others and needs them. As a result, this inﬁnite
                   diversity of human individuals is the fundamental cause and the
                   very basis of their solidarity. It is all-powerful argument for
                   equality.” [“All-Round Education”, The Basic Bakunin, pp. 117–8]
               Equality for anarchists means social equality, or, to use Murray Bookchin’s
             term, the “equality of unequals” (some like Malatesta used the term
             “equality of conditions” to express the same idea). By this he means that an
             anarchist society recognises the diﬀerences in ability and need of individuals
             but does not allow these diﬀerences to be turned into power. Individual
             diﬀerences, in other words, “would be of no consequence, because inequality
             in fact is lost in the collectivity when it cannot cling to some legal ﬁction or
             institution.” [Michael Bakunin, God and the State, p. 53]
               If hierarchical social relationships, and the forces that create them, are
             abolished in favour of ones that encourage participation and are based on the
77 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             principle of “one person, one vote” then natural diﬀerences would not be able
             to be turned into hierarchical power. For example, without capitalist property
             rights there would not be means by which a minority could monopolise the
             means of life (machinery and land) and enrich themselves by the work of
             others via the wages system and usury (proﬁts, rent and interest). Similarly, if
             workers manage their own work, there is no class of capitalists to grow rich
             oﬀ their labour. Thus Proudhon:

## “Now, what can be the origin of this inequality?

                   “As we see it, … that origin is the realisation within society of this
                   triple abstraction: capital, labour and talent.
                   “It is because society has divided itself into three categories of
                   citizen corresponding to the three terms of the formula… that caste
                   distinctions have always been arrived at, and one half of the human
                   race enslaved to the other… socialism thus consists of reducing the
                   aristocratic formula of capital-labour-talent into the simpler formula
                   of labour!… in order to make every citizen simultaneously, equally
                   and to the same extent capitalist, labourer and expert or artist.” [No
                   Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, pp. 57–8]
                Like all anarchists, Proudhon saw this integration of functions as the key to
             equality and freedom and proposed self-management as the means to achieve
             it. Thus self-management is the key to social equality. Social equality in the
             workplace, for example, means that everyone has an equal say in the policy
             decisions on how the workplace develops and changes. Anarchists are strong
             believers in the maxim “that which touches all, is decided by all.”
                This does not mean, of course, that expertise will be ignored or that
             everyone will decide everything. As far as expertise goes, diﬀerent people
             have diﬀerent interests, talents, and abilities, so obviously they will want to
             study diﬀerent things and do diﬀerent kinds of work. It is also obvious that
             when people are ill they consult a doctor — an expert — who manages his or
             her own work rather than being directed by a committee. We are sorry to
             have to bring these points up, but once the topics of social equality and
             workers’ self-management come up, some people start to talk nonsense. It is
             common sense that a hospital managed in a socially equal way will not
             involve non-medical staﬀ voting on how doctors should perform an operation!
                In fact, social equality and individual liberty are inseparable. Without the
             collective self-management of decisions that aﬀect a group (equality) to
             complement the individual self-management of decisions that aﬀect the
             individual (liberty), a free society is impossible. For without both, some will
             have power over others, making decisions for them (i.e. governing them), and
             thus some will be more free than others. Which implies, just to state the
             obvious, anarchists seek equality in all aspects of life, not just in terms of
             wealth. Anarchists “demand for every person not just his [or her] entire
             measure of the wealth of society but also his [or her] portion of social power.”
             [Malatesta and Hamon, No Gods, No Masters, vol. 2, p. 20] Thus selfmanagement is needed to ensure both liberty and equality.
                Social equality is required for individuals to both govern and express
78 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             themselves, for the self-management it implies means “people working in
             face-to-face relations with their fellows in order to bring the uniqueness of
             their own perspective to the business of solving common problems and
             achieving common goals.” [George Benello, From the Ground Up, p. 160]
             Thus equality allows the expression of individuality and so is a necessary base
             for individual liberty.
                Section F.3 (“Why do ‘anarcho’-capitalists place little or no value on
             equality?”) discusses anarchist ideas on equality further. Noam Chomsky’s
             essay “Equality” (contained in The Chomsky Reader) is a good summary of
             libertarian ideas on the subject.
             A.2.6 Why is solidarity important to anarchists?
               Solidarity, or mutual aid, is a key idea of anarchism. It is the link between
             the individual and society, the means by which individuals can work together
             to meet their common interests in an environment that supports and nurtures
             both liberty and equality. For anarchists, mutual aid is a fundamental feature
             of human life, a source of both strength and happiness and a fundamental
             requirement for a fully human existence.
               Erich Fromm, noted psychologist and socialist humanist, points out that the
             “human desire to experience union with others is rooted in the speciﬁc
             conditions of existence that characterise the human species and is one of the
             strongest motivations of human behaviour.” [To Be or To Have, p.107]
               Therefore anarchists consider the desire to form “unions” (to use Max
             Stirner’s term) with other people to be a natural need. These unions, or
             associations, must be based on equality and individuality in order to be fully
             satisfying to those who join them — i.e. they must be organised in an
             anarchist manner, i.e. voluntary, decentralised, and non-hierarchical.
               Solidarity — co-operation between individuals — is necessary for life and is
             far from a denial of liberty. Solidarity, observed Errico Malatesta, “is the only
             environment in which Man can express his personality and achieve his
             optimum development and enjoy the greatest possible wellbeing.” This
             “coming together of individuals for the wellbeing of all, and of all for the
             wellbeing of each,” results in “the freedom of each not being limited by, but
             complemented — indeed ﬁnding the necessary raison d’etre in — the
             freedom of others.” [Anarchy, p. 29] In other words, solidarity and cooperation means treating each other as equals, refusing to treat others as
             means to an end and creating relationships which support freedom for all
             rather than a few dominating the many. Emma Goldman reiterated this theme,
             noting “what wonderful results this unique force of man’s individuality has
             achieved when strengthened by co-operation with other individualities . .. cooperation — as opposed to internecine strife and struggle — has worked for
             the survival and evolution of the species… . only mutual aid and voluntary cooperation … can create the basis for a free individual and associational life.”
             [Red Emma Speaks, p. 118]
               Solidarity means associating together as equals in order to satisfy our
             common interests and needs. Forms of association not based on solidarity (i.e.
             those based on inequality) will crush the individuality of those subjected to
79 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             them. As Ret Marut points out, liberty needs solidarity, the recognition of
             common interests:
                   “The most noble, pure and true love of mankind is the love of
                   oneself. I want to be free! I hope to be happy! I want to appreciate
                   all the beauties of the world. But my freedom is secured only when
                   all other people around me are free. I can only be happy when all
                   other people around me are happy. I can only be joyful when all the
                   people I see and meet look at the world with joy-ﬁlled eyes. And
                   only then can I eat my ﬁll with pure enjoyment when I have the
                   secure knowledge that other people, too, can eat their ﬁll as I do.
                   And for that reason it is a question of my own contentment, only
                   of my own self, when I rebel against every danger which threatens
                   my freedom and my happiness…” [Ret Marut (a.k.a. B. Traven), The
                   BrickBurner magazine quoted by Karl S. Guthke, B. Traven: The
                   life behind the legends, pp. 133–4]
               To practice solidarity means that we recognise, as in the slogan of
             Industrial Workers of the World, that “an injury to one is an injury to all.”
             Solidarity, therefore, is the means to protect individuality and liberty and so is
             an expression of self-interest. As Alﬁe Kohn points out:

## “when we think about co-operation… we tend to associate the
## concept with fuzzy-minded idealism… This may result from
                   confusing co-operation with altruism… Structural co-operation
                   deﬁes the usual egoism/altruism dichotomy. It sets things up so that
                   by helping you I am helping myself at the same time. Even if my
                   motive initially may have been selﬁsh, our fates now are linked. We
## sink or swim together. Co-operation is a shrewd and highly
                   successful strategy — a pragmatic choice that gets things done at
                   work and at school even more eﬀectively than competition does…
                   There is also good evidence that co-operation is more conductive to
                   psychological health and to liking one another.” [No Contest: The
                   Case Against Competition, p. 7]
               And, within a hierarchical society, solidarity is important not only because of
             the satisfaction it gives us, but also because it is necessary to resist those in
             power. Malatesta’s words are relevant here:

## “the oppressed masses who have never completely resigned
                   themselves to oppress and poverty, and who … show themselves
                   thirsting for justice, freedom and wellbeing, are beginning to
                   understand that they will not be able to achieve their emancipation
                   except by union and solidarity with all the oppressed, with the
                   exploited everywhere in the world.” [Anarchy, p. 33]
               By standing together, we can increase our strength and get what we want.
             Eventually, by organising into groups, we can start to manage our own
             collective aﬀairs together and so replace the boss once and for all. ”Unions
             will… multiply the individual’s means and secure his assailed property.” [Max
80 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             Stirner, The Ego and Its Own, p. 258] By acting in solidarity, we can also
             replace the current system with one more to our liking: “in union there is
             strength.” [Alexander Berkman, What is Anarchism?, p. 74]
                Solidarity is thus the means by which we can obtain and ensure our own
             freedom. We agree to work together so that we will not have to work for
             another. By agreeing to share with each other we increase our options so
             that we may enjoy more, not less. Mutual aid is in my self-interest — that is, I
             see that it is to my advantage to reach agreements with others based on
             mutual respect and social equality; for if I dominate someone, this means that
             the conditions exist which allow domination, and so in all probability I too will
             be dominated in turn.
                As Max Stirner saw, solidarity is the means by which we ensure that our
             liberty is strengthened and defended from those in power who want to rule
             us: “Do you yourself count for nothing then?”, he asks. “Are you bound to let
             anyone do anything he wants to you? Defend yourself and no one will touch
             you. If millions of people are behind you, supporting you, then you are a
             formidable force and you will win without diﬀiculty.” [quoted in Luigi
             Galleani’s The End of Anarchism?, p. 79 — diﬀerent translation in The Ego
             and Its Own, p. 197]
                Solidarity, therefore, is important to anarchists because it is the means by
             which liberty can be created and defended against power. Solidarity is
             strength and a product of our nature as social beings. However, solidarity
             should not be confused with “herdism,” which implies passively following a
             leader. In order to be eﬀective, solidarity must be created by free people, cooperating together as equals. The “big WE” is not solidarity, although the
             desire for “herdism” is a product of our need for solidarity and union. It is a
             “solidarity” corrupted by hierarchical society, in which people are conditioned
             to blindly obey leaders.
             A.2.7 Why do anarchists argue for self-liberation?
               Liberty, by its very nature, cannot be given. An individual cannot be freed by
             another, but must break his or her own chains through their own eﬀort. Of
             course, self-eﬀort can also be part of collective action, and in many cases it
             has to be in order to attain its ends. As Emma Goldman points out:
                   “History tells us that every oppressed class [or group or individual]
                   gained true liberation from its masters by its own eﬀorts.” [Red
                   Emma Speaks, p. 167]
               This is because anarchists recognise that hierarchical systems, like any
             social relationship, shapes those subject to them. As Bookchin argued, “class
             societies organise our psychic structures for command or obedience.” This
             means that people internalise the values of hierarchical and class society
             and, as such, “the State is not merely a constellation of bureaucratic and
             coercive instituions. It is also a state of mind, an instilled mentality for
             ordering reality … Its capacity to rule by brute force has always been limited
             … Without a high degree of co-operation from even the most victimised
             classes of society such as chattel slaves and serfs, its authority would
81 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             eventually dissipate. Awe and apathy in the face of State power are products
             of social conditioning that renders this very power possible.” [The Ecology of
             Freedom, p. 159 and pp. 164–5] Self-liberation is the means by which we
             break down both internal and external chains, freeing ourselves mentally as
             well as physically.
                Anarchists have long argued that people can only free themselves by their
             own actions. The various methods anarchists suggest to aid this process will
             be discussed in section J (“What Do Anarchists Do?”) and will not be
             discussed here. However, these methods all involve people organising
             themselves, setting their own agendas, and acting in ways that empower them
             and eliminate their dependence on leaders to do things for them. Anarchism is
             based on people “acting for themselves” (performing what anarchists call
             “direct action” — see section J.2 for details).
                Direct action has an empowering and liberating eﬀect on those involved in
             it. Self-activity is the means by which the creativity, initiative, imagination and
             critical thought of those subjected to authority can be developed. It is the
             means by which society can be changed. As Errico Malatesta pointed out:
                   “Between man and his social environment there is a reciprocal
                   action. Men make society what it is and society makes men what
                   they are, and the result is therefore a kind of vicious circle. To
                   transform society men [and women] must be changed, and to
                   transform men, society must be changed … Fortunately existing
                   society has not been created by the inspired will of a dominating
                   class, which has succeeded in reducing all its subjects to passive
                   and unconscious instruments of its interests. It is the result of a
                   thousand internecine struggles, of a thousand human and natural
## factors …

                   “From this the possibility of progress … We must take advantage of
                   all the means, all the possibilities and the opportunities that the
## present environment allows us to act on our fellow men [and
                   women] and to develop their consciences and their demands … to
                   claim and to impose those major social transformations which are
                   possible and which eﬀectively serve to open the way to further
                   advances later … We must seek to get all the people … to make
                   demands, and impose itself and take for itself all the improvements
                   and freedoms it desires as and when it reaches the state of wanting
                   them, and the power to demand them … we must push the people to
                   want always more and to increase its pressures [on the ruling elite],
                   until it has achieved complete emancipation.” [Errico Malatesta:
                   His Life and Ideas, pp. 188–9]
               Society, while shaping all individuals, is also created by them, through their
             actions, thoughts, and ideals. Challenging institutions that limit one’s freedom
             is mentally liberating, as it sets in motion the process of questioning
             authoritarian relationships in general. This process gives us insight into how
             society works, changing our ideas and creating new ideals. To quote Emma
             Goldman again: “True emancipation begins… in woman’s soul.” And in a
             man’s too, we might add. It is only here that we can “begin [our] inner

             regeneration, [cutting] loose from the weight of prejudices, traditions and
             customs.” [Op. Cit., p. 167] But this process must be self-directed, for as Max
             Stirner notes, “the man who is set free is nothing but a freed man… a dog
             dragging a piece of chain with him.” [The Ego and Its Own, p. 168] By
             changing the world, even in a small way, we change ourselves.
               In an interview during the Spanish Revolution, the Spanish anarchist
             militant Durutti said, “we have a new world in our hearts.” Only self-activity
             and self-liberation allows us to create such a vision and gives us the
             conﬁdence to try to actualise it in the real world.
               Anarchists, however, do not think that self-liberation must wait for the
             future, after the “glorious revolution.” The personal is political, and given the
             nature of society, how we act in the here and now will inﬂuence the future of
             our society and our lives. Therefore, even in pre-anarchist society anarchists
             try to create, as Bakunin puts it, “not only the ideas but also the facts of the
             future itself.” We can do so by creating alternative social relationships and
             organisations, acting as free people in a non-free society. Only by our actions
             in the here and now can we lay the foundation for a free society. Moreover,
             this process of self-liberation goes on all the time:
                   “Subordinates of all kinds exercise their capacity for critical selfreﬂection every day — that is why masters are thwarted, frustrated
                   and, sometimes, overthrown. But unless masters are overthrown,
                   unless subordinates engage in political activity, no amount of critical
                   reﬂection will end their subjection and bring them freedom.”
                   [Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract, p. 205]
                Anarchists aim to encourage these tendencies in everyday life to reject,
             resist and thwart authority and bring them to their logical conclusion — a
             society of free individuals, co-operating as equals in free, self-managed
             associations. Without this process of critical self-reﬂection, resistance and
             self-liberation a free society is impossible. Thus, for anarchists, anarchism
             comes from the natural resistance of subordinated people striving to act as
             free individuals within a hierarchical world. This process of resistance is
             called by many anarchists the “class struggle” (as it is working class people
             who are generally the most subordinated group within society) or, more
             generally, “social struggle.” It is this everyday resistance to authority (in all
             its forms) and the desire for freedom which is the key to the anarchist
             revolution. It is for this reason that “anarchists emphasise over and over that
             the class struggle provides the only means for the workers [and other
             oppressed groups] to achieve control over their destiny.” [Marie-Louise
             Berneri, Neither East Nor West, p. 32]
                Revolution is a process, not an event, and every “spontaneous revolutionary
             action” usually results from and is based upon the patient work of many years
             of organisation and education by people with “utopian” ideas. The process of
             “creating the new world in the shell of the old” (to use another I.W.W.
             expression), by building alternative institutions and relationships, is but one
             component of what must be a long tradition of revolutionary commitment and
             militancy.
                As Malatesta made clear, “to encourage popular organisations of all kinds is
             the logical consequence of our basic ideas, and should therefore be an
83 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             integral part of our programme… anarchists do not want to emancipate the
             people; we want the people to emancipate themselves… , we want the new
             way of life to emerge from the body of the people and correspond to the state
             of their development and advance as they advance.” [Op. Cit., p. 90]
               Unless a process of self-emancipation occurs, a free society is impossible.
             Only when individuals free themselves, both materially (by abolishing the
             state and capitalism) and intellectually (by freeing themselves of submissive
             attitudes towards authority), can a free society be possible. We should not
             forget that capitalist and state power, to a great extent, is power over the
             minds of those subject to them (backed up, of course, with sizeable force if
             the mental domination fails and people start rebelling and resisting). In eﬀect,
             a spiritual power as the ideas of the ruling class dominate society and
             permeate the minds of the oppressed. As long as this holds, the working class
             will acquiesce to authority, oppression and exploitation as the normal
             condition of life. Minds submissive to the doctrines and positions of their
             masters cannot hope to win freedom, to revolt and ﬁght. Thus the oppressed
             must overcome the mental domination of the existing system before they can
             throw oﬀ its yoke (and, anarchists argue, direct action is the means of doing
             both — see sections J.2 and J.4). Capitalism and statism must be beaten
             spiritually and theoretically before it is beaten materially (many anarchists
             call this mental liberation “class consciousness” — see section B.7.4). And
             self-liberation through struggle against oppression is the only way this can be
             done. Thus anarchists encourage (to use Kropotkin’s term) “the spirit of
             revolt.”
               Self-liberation is a product of struggle, of self-organisation, solidarity and
             direct action. Direct action is the means of creating anarchists, free people,
             and so “Anarchists have always advised taking an active part in those
             workers’ organisations which carry on the direct struggle of Labour against
             Capital and its protector, — the State.” This is because ”[s]uch a struggle …
             better than any indirect means, permits the worker to obtain some temporary
             improvements in the present conditions of work, while it opens his [or her]
             eyes to the evil that is done by Capitalism and the State that supports it, and
             wakes up his [or her] thoughts concerning the possibility of organising
             consumption, production and exchange without the intervention of the
             capitalist and the state,” that is, see the possibility of a free society.
             Kropotkin, like many anarchists, pointed to the Syndicalist and Trade Union
             movements as a means of developing libertarian ideas within existing society
             (although he, like most anarchists, did not limit anarchist activity exclusively
             to them). Indeed, any movement which “permit[s] the working men [and
             women] to realise their solidarity and to feel the community of their interests
             … prepare[s] the way for these conceptions” of communist-anarchism, i.e. the
             overcoming the spiritual domination of existing society within the minds of
             the oppressed. [Evolution and Environment, p. 83 and p. 85]
               For anarchists, in the words of a Scottish Anarchist militant, the “history of
             human progress [is] seen as the history of rebellion and disobedience, with
             the individual debased by subservience to authority in its many forms and
             able to retain his/her dignity only through rebellion and disobedience.”
             [Robert Lynn, Not a Life Story, Just a Leaf from It, p. 77] This is why
             anarchists stress self-liberation (and self-organisation, self-management and
84 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             self-activity). Little wonder Bakunin considered “rebellion” as one of the
             “three fundamental principles [which] constitute the essential conditions of all
             human development, collective or individual, in history.” [God and the State,
             p. 12] This is simply because individuals and groups cannot be freed by
             others, only by themselves. Such rebellion (self-liberation) is the only means
             by which existing society becomes more libertarian and an anarchist society a
             possibility.
             A.2.8 Is it possible to be an anarchist without
             opposing hierarchy?
               No. We have seen that anarchists abhor authoritarianism. But if one is an
             anti-authoritarian, one must oppose all hierarchical institutions, since they
             embody the principle of authority. For, as Emma Goldman argued, “it is not
             only government in the sense of the state which is destructive of every
             individual value and quality. It is the whole complex authority and institutional
             domination which strangles life. It is the superstition, myth, pretence,
             evasions, and subservience which support authority and institutional
             domination.” [Red Emma Speaks, p. 435] This means that “there is and will
             always be a need to discover and overcome structures of hierarchy, authority
             and domination and constraints on freedom: slavery, wage-slavery [i.e.
             capitalism], racism, sexism, authoritarian schools, etc.” [Noam Chomsky,
             Language and Politics, p. 364]
               Thus the consistent anarchist must oppose hierarchical relationships as well
             as the state. Whether economic, social or political, to be an anarchist means
             to oppose hierarchy. The argument for this (if anybody needs one) is as
             follows:
                   “All authoritarian institutions are organised as pyramids: the state,
                   the private or public corporation, the army, the police, the church,
                   the university, the hospital: they are all pyramidal structures with a
                   small group of decision-makers at the top and a broad base of
## people whose decisions are made for them at the bottom.
                   Anarchism does not demand the changing of labels on the layers, it
                   doesn’t want diﬀerent people on top, it wants us to clamber out
                   from underneath.” [Colin Ward, Anarchy in Action, p. 22]
               Hierarchies “share a common feature: they are organised systems of
             command and obedience” and so anarchists seek “to eliminate hierarchy per
             se, not simply replace one form of hierarchy with another.” [Bookchin, The
             Ecology of Freedom, p. 27] A hierarchy is a pyramidally-structured
             organisation composed of a series of grades, ranks, or oﬀices of increasing
             power, prestige, and (usually) remuneration. Scholars who have investigated
             the hierarchical form have found that the two primary principles it embodies
             are domination and exploitation. For example, in his classic article “What Do
             Bosses Do?” (Review of Radical Political Economy, Vol. 6, No. 2), a study
             of the modern factory, Steven Marglin found that the main function of the
             corporate hierarchy is not greater productive eﬀiciency (as capitalists claim),
85 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             but greater control over workers, the purpose of such control being more
             eﬀective exploitation.
                Control in a hierarchy is maintained by coercion, that is, by the threat of
             negative sanctions of one kind or another: physical, economic, psychological,
             social, etc. Such control, including the repression of dissent and rebellion,
             therefore necessitates centralisation: a set of power relations in which the
             greatest control is exercised by the few at the top (particularly the head of the
             organisation), while those in the middle ranks have much less control and the
             many at the bottom have virtually none.
                Since domination, coercion, and centralisation are essential features of
             authoritarianism, and as those features are embodied in hierarchies, all
             hierarchical institutions are authoritarian. Moreover, for anarchists, any
             organisation marked by hierarchy, centralism and authoritarianism is statelike, or “statist.” And as anarchists oppose both the state and authoritarian
             relations, anyone who does not seek to dismantle all forms of hierarchy
             cannot be called an anarchist. This applies to capitalist ﬁrms. As Noam
             Chomsky points out, the structure of the capitalist ﬁrm is extremely
             hierarchical, indeed fascist, in nature:
                   “a fascist system… [is] absolutist — power goes from top down …
                   the ideal state is top down control with the public essentially
## following orders.

                   “Let’s take a look at a corporation… [I]f you look at what they are,
                   power goes strictly top down, from the board of directors to
                   managers to lower managers to ultimately the people on the shop
                   ﬂoor, typing messages, and so on. There’s no ﬂow of power or
## planning from the bottom up. People can disrupt and make
                   suggestions, but the same is true of a slave society. The structure of
                   power is linear, from the top down.” [Keeping the Rabble in Line,
                   p. 237]
               David Deleon indicates these similarities between the company and the
             state well when he writes:
                   “Most factories are like military dictatorships. Those at the bottom
                   are privates, the supervisors are sergeants, and on up through the
                   hierarchy. The organisation can dictate everything from our clothing
                   and hair style to how we spend a large portion of our lives, during
                   work. It can compel overtime; it can require us to see a company
                   doctor if we have a medical complaint; it can forbid us free time to
                   engage in political activity; it can suppress freedom of speech, press
                   and assembly — it can use ID cards and armed security police, along
                   with closed-circuit TVs to watch us; it can punish dissenters with
                   ‘disciplinary layoﬀs’ (as GM calls them), or it can ﬁre us. We are
                   forced, by circumstances, to accept much of this, or join the millions
                   of unemployed… In almost every job, we have only the ‘right’ to
                   quit. Major decisions are made at the top and we are expected to
                   obey, whether we work in an ivory tower or a mine shaft.” [“For

## management”, Reinventing Anarchy, Again, Howard J. Ehrlich
                   (ed.), pp. 193–4]
                Thus the consistent anarchist must oppose hierarchy in all its forms,
             including the capitalist ﬁrm. Not to do so is to support archy — which an
             anarchist, by deﬁnition, cannot do. In other words, for anarchists, ”[p]romises
             to obey, contracts of (wage) slavery, agreements requiring the acceptance of a
             subordinate status, are all illegitimate because they do restrict and restrain
             individual autonomy.” [Robert Graham, “The Anarchist Contract,
             Reinventing Anarchy, Again, Howard J. Ehrlich (ed.), p. 77] Hierarchy,
             therefore, is against the basic principles which drive anarchism. It denies
             what makes us human and “divest[s] the personality of its most integral traits;
             it denies the very notion that the individual is competent to deal not only
             with the management of his or her personal life but with its most important
             context: the social context.” [Murray Bookchin, Op. Cit., p. 202]
                Some argue that as long as an association is voluntary, whether it has a
             hierarchical structure is irrelevant. Anarchists disagree. This is for two
             reasons. Firstly, under capitalism workers are driven by economic necessity to
             sell their labour (and so liberty) to those who own the means of life. This
             process re-enforces the economic conditions workers face by creating
             “massive disparities in wealth … [as] workers… sell their labour to the
             capitalist at a price which does not reﬂect its real value.” Therefore:
                   “To portray the parties to an employment contract, for example, as
                   free and equal to each other is to ignore the serious inequality of
## bargaining power which exists between the worker and the
                   employer. To then go on to portray the relationship of subordination
                   and exploitation which naturally results as the epitome of freedom is
                   to make a mockery of both individual liberty and social justice.”
                   [Robert Graham, Op. Cit., p. 70]
                It is for this reason that anarchists support collective action and
             organisation: it increases the bargaining power of working people and allows
             them to assert their autonomy (see section J).
                Secondly, if we take the key element as being whether an association is
             voluntary or not we would have to argue that the current state system must
             be considered as “anarchy.” In a modern democracy no one forces an
             individual to live in a speciﬁc state. We are free to leave and go somewhere
             else. By ignoring the hierarchical nature of an association, you can end up
             supporting organisations based upon the denial of freedom (including
             capitalist companies, the armed forces, states even) all because they are
             “voluntary.” As Bob Black argues, ”[t]o demonise state authoritarianism while
             ignoring identical albeit contract-consecrated subservient arrangements in
             the large-scale corporations which control the world economy is fetishism at
             its worst.” [The Libertarian as Conservative, The Abolition of Work and
             other essays, p. 142] Anarchy is more than being free to pick a master.
                Therefore opposition to hierarchy is a key anarchist position, otherwise you
             just become a “voluntary archist” — which is hardly anarchistic. For more on
             this see section A.2.14 ( Why is voluntarism not enough?).
                Anarchists argue that organisations do not need to be hierarchical, they can
87 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             be based upon co-operation between equals who manage their own aﬀairs
             directly. In this way we can do without hierarchical structures (i.e. the
             delegation of power in the hands of a few). Only when an association is selfmanaged by its members can it be considered truly anarchistic.
               We are sorry to belabour this point, but some capitalist apologists,
             apparently wanting to appropriate the “anarchist” name because of its
             association with freedom, have recently claimed that one can be both a
             capitalist and an anarchist at the same time (as in so-called “anarcho”
             capitalism). It should now be clear that since capitalism is based on hierarchy
             (not to mention statism and exploitation), “anarcho”-capitalism is a
             contradiction in terms. (For more on this, see Section F)
             A.2.9 What sort of society do anarchists want?
                Anarchists desire a decentralised society, based on free association. We
             consider this form of society the best one for maximising the values we have
             outlined above — liberty, equality and solidarity. Only by a rational
             decentralisation of power, both structurally and territorially, can individual
             liberty be fostered and encouraged. The delegation of power into the hands of
             a minority is an obvious denial of individual liberty and dignity. Rather than
             taking the management of their own aﬀairs away from people and putting it in
             the hands of others, anarchists favour organisations which minimise authority,
             keeping power at the base, in the hands of those who are aﬀected by any
             decisions reached.
                Free association is the cornerstone of an anarchist society. Individuals must
             be free to join together as they see ﬁt, for this is the basis of freedom and
             human dignity. However, any such free agreement must be based on
             decentralisation of power; otherwise it will be a sham (as in capitalism), as
             only equality provides the necessary social context for freedom to grow and
             development. Therefore anarchists support directly democratic collectives,
             based on “one person one vote” (for the rationale of direct democracy as the
             political counterpart of free agreement, see section A.2.11 — Why do most
             anarchists support direct democracy?).
                We should point out here that an anarchist society does not imply some sort
             of idyllic state of harmony within which everyone agrees. Far from it! As Luigi
             Galleani points out, ”[d]isagreements and friction will always exist. In fact
             they are an essential condition of unlimited progress. But once the bloody
             area of sheer animal competition — the struggle for food — has been
             eliminated, problems of disagreement could be solved without the slightest
             threat to the social order and individual liberty.” [The End of Anarchism?, p.
             28] Anarchism aims to “rouse the spirit of initiative in individuals and in
             groups.” These will “create in their mutual relations a movement and a life
             based on the principles of free understanding” and recognise that ”variety,
             conﬂict even, is life and that uniformity is death.” [Peter Kropotkin,
             Anarchism, p. 143]
                Therefore, an anarchist society will be based upon co-operative conﬂict as
             ”[c]onﬂict, per se, is not harmful… disagreements exist [and should not be
             hidden] … What makes disagreement destructive is not the fact of conﬂict
88 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             itself but the addition of competition.” Indeed, “a rigid demand for agreement
             means that people will eﬀectively be prevented from contributing their
             wisdom to a group eﬀort.” [Alﬁe Kohn, No Contest: The Case Against
             Competition, p. 156] It is for this reason that most anarchists reject
             consensus decision making in large groups (see section A.2.12).
                So, in an anarchist society associations would be run by mass assemblies of
             all involved, based upon extensive discussion, debate and co-operative conﬂict
             between equals, with purely administrative tasks being handled by elected
             committees. These committees would be made up of mandated, recallable and
             temporary delegates who carry out their tasks under the watchful eyes of the
             assembly which elected them. Thus in an anarchist society, “we’ll look after
             our aﬀairs ourselves and decide what to do about them. And when, to put our
             ideas into action, there is a need to put someone in charge of a project, we’ll
             tell them to do [it] in such and such a way and no other … nothing would be
             done without our decision. So our delegates, instead of people being
             individuals whom we’ve given the right to order us about, would be people …
             [with] no authority, only the duty to carry out what everyone involved
             wanted.” [Errico Malatesta, Fra Contadini, p. 34] If the delegates act against
             their mandate or try to extend their inﬂuence or work beyond that already
             decided by the assembly (i.e. if they start to make policy decisions), they can
             be instantly recalled and their decisions abolished. In this way, the
             organisation remains in the hands of the union of individuals who created it.
                This self-management by the members of a group at the base and the power
             of recall are essential tenets of any anarchist organisation. The key diﬀerence
             between a statist or hierarchical system and an anarchist community is who
             wields power. In a parliamentary system, for example, people give power to a
             group of representatives to make decisions for them for a ﬁxed period of time.
             Whether they carry out their promises is irrelevant as people cannot recall
             them till the next election. Power lies at the top and those at the base are
             expected to obey. Similarly, in the capitalist workplace, power is held by an
             unelected minority of bosses and managers at the top and the workers are
             expected to obey.
                In an anarchist society this relationship is reversed. No one individual or
             group (elected or unelected) holds power in an anarchist community. Instead
             decisions are made using direct democratic principles and, when required,
             the community can elect or appoint delegates to carry out these decisions.
             There is a clear distinction between policy making (which lies with everyone
             who is aﬀected) and the co-ordination and administration of any adopted
             policy (which is the job for delegates).
                These egalitarian communities, founded by free agreement, also freely
             associate together in confederations. Such a free confederation would be run
             from the bottom up, with decisions following from the elemental assemblies
             upwards. The confederations would be run in the same manner as the
             collectives. There would be regular local regional, “national” and
             international conferences in which all important issues and problems aﬀecting
             the collectives involved would be discussed. In addition, the fundamental,
             guiding principles and ideas of society would be debated and policy decisions
             made, put into practice, reviewed, and co-ordinated. The delegates would
             simply “take their given mandates to the relative meetings and try to
89 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             harmonise their various needs and desires. The deliberations would always be
             subject to the control and approval of those who delegated them” and so
             “there would be no danger than the interest of the people [would] be
             forgotten.” [Malatesta, Op. Cit., p. 36]
               Action committees would be formed, if required, to co-ordinate and
             administer the decisions of the assemblies and their congresses, under strict
             control from below as discussed above. Delegates to such bodies would have a
             limited tenure and, like the delegates to the congresses, have a ﬁxed mandate
             — they are not able to make decisions on behalf of the people they are
             delegates for. In addition, like the delegates to conferences and congresses,
             they would be subject to instant recall by the assemblies and congresses from
             which they emerged in the ﬁrst place. In this way any committees required to
             co-ordinate join activities would be, to quote Malatesta’s words, “always
             under the direct control of the population” and so express the “decisions
             taken at popular assemblies.” [Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, p. 175
             and p. 129]
               Most importantly, the basic community assemblies can overturn any
             decisions reached by the conferences and withdraw from any confederation.
             Any compromises that are made by a delegate during negotiations have to go
             back to a general assembly for ratiﬁcation. Without that ratiﬁcation any
             compromises that are made by a delegate are not binding on the community
             that has delegated a particular task to a particular individual or committee. In
             addition, they can call confederal conferences to discuss new developments
             and to inform action committees about changing wishes and to instruct them
             on what to do about any developments and ideas.
               In other words, any delegates required within an anarchist organisation or
             society are not representatives (as they are in a democratic government).
             Kropotkin makes the diﬀerence clear:
                   “The question of true delegation versus representation can be
                   better understood if one imagines a hundred or two hundred men
                   [and women], who meet each day in their work and share common
                   concerns … who have discussed every aspect of the question that
## concerns them and have reached a decision. They then choose
                   someone and send him [or her] to reach an agreement with other
                   delegates of the same kind… The delegate is not authorised to do
                   more than explain to other delegates the considerations that have
                   led his [or her] colleagues to their conclusion. Not being able to
                   impose anything, he [or she] will seek an understanding and will
                   return with a simple proposition which his mandatories can accept
                   or refuse. This is what happens when true delegation comes into
                   being.” [Words of a Rebel, p. 132]
               Unlike in a representative system, power is not delegated into the hands of
             the few. Rather, any delegate is simply a mouthpiece for the association that
             elected (or otherwise selected) them in the ﬁrst place. All delegates and
             action committees would be mandated and subject to instant recall to ensure
             they express the wishes of the assemblies they came from rather than their
             own. In this way government is replaced by anarchy, a network of free
             associations and communities co-operating as equals based on a system of
90 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             mandated delegates, instant recall, free agreement and free federation from
             the bottom up.
                Only this system would ensure the “free organisation of the people, an
             organisation from below upwards.” This “free federation from below upward”
             would start with the basic “association” and their federation “ﬁrst into a
             commune, then a federation of communes into regions, of regions into
             nations, and of nations into an international fraternal association.” [Michael
             Bakunin, The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 298] This network of
             anarchist communities would work on three levels. There would be
             “independent Communes for the territorial organisation, and of federations of
             Trade Unions [i.e. workplace associations] for the organisation of men [and
             women] in accordance with their diﬀerent functions… [and] free combines
             and societies … for the satisfaction of all possible and imaginable needs,
             economic, sanitary, and educational; for mutual protection, for the
             propaganda of ideas, for arts, for amusement, and so on.” [Peter Kropotkin,
             Evolution and Environment, p. 79] All would be based on self-management,
             free association, free federation and self-organisation from the bottom up.
                By organising in this manner, hierarchy is abolished in all aspects of life,
             because the people at the base of the organisation are in control, not their
             delegates. Only this form of organisation can replace government (the
             initiative and empowerment of the few) with anarchy (the initiative and
             empowerment of all). This form of organisation would exist in all activities
             which required group work and the co-ordination of many people. It would be,
             as Bakunin said, the means “to integrate individuals into structures which
             they could understand and control.” [quoted by Cornelius Castoriadis,
             Political and Social Writings, vol. 2, p. 97] For individual initiatives, the
             individual involved would manage them.
                As can be seen, anarchists wish to create a society based upon structures
             that ensure that no individual or group is able to wield power over others.
             Free agreement, confederation and the power of recall, ﬁxed mandates and
             limited tenure are mechanisms by which power is removed from the hands of
             governments and placed in the hands of those directly aﬀected by the
             decisions.
                For a fuller discussion on what an anarchist society would look like see
             section I. Anarchy, however, is not some distant goal but rather an aspect of
             current struggles against oppression and exploitation. Means and ends are
             linked, with direct action generating mass participatory organisations and
             preparing people to directly manage their own personal and collective
             interests. This is because anarchists, as we discuss in section I.2.3, see the
             framework of a free society being based on the organisations created by the
             oppressed in their struggle against capitalism in the here and now. In this
             sense, collective struggle creates the organisations as well as the individual
             attitudes anarchism needs to work. The struggle against oppression is the
             school of anarchy. It teaches us not only how to be anarchists but also gives us
             a glimpse of what an anarchist society would be like, what its initial
             organisational framework could be and the experience of managing our own
             activities which is required for such a society to work. As such, anarchists try
             to create the kind of world we want in our current struggles and do not think
             our ideas are only applicable “after the revolution.” Indeed, by applying our
91 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             principles today we bring anarchy that much nearer.
             A.2.10 What will abolishing hierarchy mean and
             achieve?
                The creation of a new society based upon libertarian organisations will have
             an incalculable eﬀect on everyday life. The empowerment of millions of people
             will transform society in ways we can only guess at now.
                However, many consider these forms of organisation as impractical and
             doomed to failure. To those who say that such confederal, non-authoritarian
             organisations would produce confusion and disunity, anarchists maintain that
             the statist, centralised and hierarchical form of organisation produces
             indiﬀerence instead of involvement, heartlessness instead of solidarity,
             uniformity instead of unity, and privileged elites instead of equality. More
             importantly, such organisations destroy individual initiative and crush
             independent action and critical thinking. (For more on hierarchy, see section
             B.1 — “Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?”).
                That libertarian organisation can work and is based upon (and promotes)
             liberty was demonstrated in the Spanish Anarchist movement. Fenner
             Brockway, Secretary of the British Independent Labour Party, when visiting
             Barcelona during the 1936 revolution, noted that “the great solidarity that
             existed among the Anarchists was due to each individual relying on his [sic]
             own strength and not depending upon leadership… . The organisations must,
             to be successful, be combined with free-thinking people; not a mass, but free
             individuals” [quoted by Rudolf Rocker, Anarcho-syndicalism, p. 67f]
                As suﬀiciently indicated already, hierarchical, centralised structures restrict
             freedom. As Proudhon noted: “the centralist system is all very well as regards
             size, simplicity and construction: it lacks but one thing — the individual no
             longer belongs to himself in such a system, he cannot feel his worth, his life,
             and no account is taken of him at all.” [quoted by Martin Buber, Paths in
             Utopia, p. 33]
                The eﬀects of hierarchy can be seen all around us. It does not work.
             Hierarchy and authority exist everywhere, in the workplace, at home, in the
             street. As Bob Black puts it, ”[i]f you spend most of your waking life taking
             orders or kissing ass, if you get habituated to hierarchy, you will become
             passive-aggressive, sado-masochistic, servile and stupeﬁed, and you will carry
             that load into every aspect of the balance of your life.” [“The Libertarian as
             Conservative,” The Abolition of Work and other essays, pp. 147–8]
                This means that the end of hierarchy will mean a massive transformation in
             everyday life. It will involve the creation of individual-centred organisations
             within which all can exercise, and so develop, their abilities to the fullest. By
             involving themselves and participating in the decisions that aﬀect them, their
             workplace, their community and society, they can ensure the full development
             of their individual capacities.
                With the free participation of all in social life, we would quickly see the end
             of inequality and injustice. Rather than people existing to make ends meet
             and being used to increase the wealth and power of the few as under
             capitalism, the end of hierarchy would see (to quote Kropotkin) “the well92 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM
An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             being of all” and it is “high time for the worker to assert his [or her] right to
             the common inheritance, and to enter into possession of it.” [The Conquest
             of Bread, p. 35 and p. 44] For only taking possession of the means of life
             (workplaces, housing, the land, etc.) can ensure “liberty and justice, for
             liberty and justice are not decreed but are the result of economic
             independence. They spring from the fact that the individual is able to live
             without depending on a master, and to enjoy … the product of his [or her]
             toil.” [Ricardo Flores Magon, Land and Liberty, p. 62] Therefore liberty
             requires the abolition of capitalist private property rights in favour of “use
             rights.” (see section B.3 for more details). Ironically, the “abolition of
             property will free the people from homelessness and nonpossession.” [Max
             Baginski, “Without Government,” Anarchy! An Anthology of Emma
             Goldman’s Mother Earth, p. 11] Thus anarchism promises “both requisites
             of happiness — liberty and wealth.” In anarchy, “mankind will live in freedom
             and in comfort.” [Benjamin Tucker, Why I am an Anarchist, p. 135 and p.
             136]
                Only self-determination and free agreement on every level of society can
             develop the responsibility, initiative, intellect and solidarity of individuals and
             society as a whole. Only anarchist organisation allows the vast talent which
             exists within humanity to be accessed and used, enriching society by the very
             process of enriching and developing the individual. Only by involving
             everyone in the process of thinking, planning, co-ordinating and implementing
             the decisions that aﬀect them can freedom blossom and individuality be fully
             developed and protected. Anarchy will release the creativity and talent of the
             mass of people enslaved by hierarchy.
                Anarchy will even be of beneﬁt for those who are said to beneﬁt from
             capitalism and its authority relations. Anarchists “maintain that both rulers
             and ruled are spoiled by authority; both exploiters and exploited are spoiled
             by exploitation.” [Peter Kropotkin, Act for Yourselves, p. 83] This is because
             ”[i]n any hierarchical relationship the dominator as well as the submissive
             pays his dues. The price paid for the ‘glory of command’ is indeed heavy.
             Every tyrant resents his duties. He is relegated to drag the dead weight of the
             dormant creative potential of the submissive all along the road of his
             hierarchical excursion.” [For Ourselves, The Right to Be Greedy, Thesis 95]
             A.2.11 Why are most anarchists in favour of direct
             democracy?
                For most anarchists, direct democratic voting on policy decisions within free
             associations is the political counterpart of free agreement (this is also known
             as “self-management”). The reason is that “many forms of domination can
             be carried out in a ‘free.’ non-coercive, contractual manner… and it is naive…
             to think that mere opposition to political control will in itself lead to an end of
             oppression.” [John P. Clark, Max Stirner’s Egoism, p. 93] Thus the
             relationships we create within an organisation is as important in determining
             its libertarian nature as its voluntary nature (see section A.2.14 for more
             discussion).
                It is obvious that individuals must work together in order to lead a fully

             human life. And so, ”[h]aving to join with others humans” the individual has
             three options: “he [or she] must submit to the will of others (be enslaved) or
             subject others to his will (be in authority) or live with others in fraternal
             agreement in the interests of the greatest good of all (be an associate).
             Nobody can escape from this necessity.” [Errico Malatesta, Life and Ideas, p.
             85]
               Anarchists obviously pick the last option, association, as the only means by
             which individuals can work together as free and equal human beings,
             respecting the uniqueness and liberty of one another. Only within direct
             democracy can individuals express themselves, practice critical thought and
             self-government, so developing their intellectual and ethical capacities to the
             full. In terms of increasing an individual’s freedom and their intellectual,
             ethical and social faculties, it is far better to be sometimes in a minority than
             be subject to the will of a boss all the time. So what is the theory behind
             anarchist direct democracy?
               As Bertrand Russell noted, the anarchist “does not wish to abolish
             government in the sense of collective decisions: what he does wish to abolish
             is the system by which a decision is enforced upon those who oppose it.”
             [Roads to Freedom, p. 85] Anarchists see self-management as the means to
             achieve this. Once an individual joins a community or workplace, he or she
             becomes a “citizen” (for want of a better word) of that association. The
             association is organised around an assembly of all its members (in the case of
             large workplaces and towns, this may be a functional sub-group such as a
             speciﬁc oﬀice or neighbourhood). In this assembly, in concert with others, the
             contents of his or her political obligations are deﬁned. In acting within the
             association, people must exercise critical judgement and choice, i.e. manage
             their own activity. Rather than promising to obey (as in hierarchical
             organisations like the state or capitalist ﬁrm), individuals participate in
             making their own collective decisions, their own commitments to their
             fellows. This means that political obligation is not owed to a separate entity
             above the group or society, such as the state or company, but to one’s fellow
             “citizens.”
               Although the assembled people collectively legislate the rules governing
             their association, and are bound by them as individuals, they are also superior
             to them in the sense that these rules can always be modiﬁed or repealed.
             Collectively, the associated “citizens” constitute a political “authority”, but as
             this “authority” is based on horizontal relationships between themselves
             rather than vertical ones between themselves and an elite, the “authority” is
             non-hierarchical (“rational” or “natural,” see section B.1 — “Why are
             anarchists against authority and hierarchy?” — for more on this). Thus
             Proudhon:
                   “In place of laws, we will put contracts [i.e. free agreement]. — No
                   more laws voted by a majority, nor even unanimously; each citizen,
## each town, each industrial union, makes its own laws.” [The
                   General Idea of the Revolution, pp. 245–6]
               Such a system does not mean, of course, that everyone participates in every
             decision needed, no matter how trivial. While any decision can be put to the
             assembly (if the assembly so decides, perhaps prompted by some of its
94 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             members), in practice certain activities (and so purely functional decisions)
             will be handled by the association’s elected administration. This is because, to
             quote a Spanish anarchist activist, “a collectivity as such cannot write a letter
             or add up a list of ﬁgures or do hundreds of chores which only an individual
             can perform.” Thus the need “to organise the administration.” Supposing
             an association is “organised without any directive council or any hierarchical
             oﬀices” which “meets in general assembly once a week or more often, when it
             settles all matters needful for its progress” it still “nominates a commission
             with strictly administrative functions.” However, the assembly “prescribes
             a deﬁnite line of conduct for this commission or gives it an imperative
             mandate” and so “would be perfectly anarchist.” As it “follows that
             delegating these tasks to qualiﬁed individuals, who are instructed in
             advance how to proceed, … does not mean an abdication of that
             collectivity’s own liberty.” [Jose Llunas Pujols, quoted by Max Nettlau, A
             Short History of Anarchism, p. 187] This, it should be noted, follows
             Proudhon’s ideas that within the workers’ associations “all positions are
             elective, and the by-laws subject to the approval of the members.” [Proudhon,
             Op. Cit., p. 222]
               Instead of capitalist or statist hierarchy, self-management (i.e. direct
             democracy) would be the guiding principle of the freely joined associations
             that make up a free society. This would apply to the federations of
             associations an anarchist society would need to function. “All the commissions
             or delegations nominated in an anarchist society,” correctly argued Jose
             Llunas Pujols, “must be subject to replacement and recall at any time by the
             permanent suﬀrage of the section or sections that elected them.” Combined
             with the “imperative mandate” and “purely administrative functions,” this
             “make[s] it thereby impossible for anyone to arrogate to himself [or herself] a
             scintilla of authority.” [quoted by Max Nettlau, Op. Cit., pp. 188–9] Again,
             Pujols follows Proudhon who demanded twenty years previously the
             “implementation of the binding mandate” to ensure the people do not “adjure
             their sovereignty.” [No Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p. 63]
               By means of a federalism based on mandates and elections, anarchists
             ensure that decisions ﬂow from the bottom-up. By making our own decisions,
             by looking after our joint interests ourselves, we exclude others ruling over
             us. Self-management, for anarchists, is essential to ensure freedom within the
             organisations so needed for any decent human existence.
               Of course it could be argued that if you are in a minority, you are governed
             by others (“Democratic rule is still rule” [L. Susan Brown, The Politics of
             Individualism, p. 53]). Now, the concept of direct democracy as we have
             described it is not necessarily tied to the concept of majority rule. If someone
             ﬁnds themselves in a minority on a particular vote, he or she is confronted
             with the choice of either consenting or refusing to recognise it as binding. To
             deny the minority the opportunity to exercise its judgement and choice is to
             infringe its autonomy and to impose obligation upon it which it has not freely
             accepted. The coercive imposition of the majority will is contrary to the ideal
             of self-assumed obligation, and so is contrary to direct democracy and free
             association. Therefore, far from being a denial of freedom, direct democracy
             within the context of free association and self-assumed obligation is the only
             means by which liberty can be nurtured (“Individual autonomy limited by the
95 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             obligation to hold given promises.” [Malatesta, quoted by quoted by Max
             Nettlau, Errico Malatesta: The Biography of an Anarchist]). Needless to
             say, a minority, if it remains in the association, can argue its case and try to
             convince the majority of the error of its ways.
                And we must point out here that anarchist support for direct democracy
             does not suggest we think that the majority is always right. Far from it! The
             case for democratic participation is not that the majority is always right, but
             that no minority can be trusted not to prefer its own advantage to the good of
             the whole. History proves what common-sense predicts, namely that anyone
             with dictatorial powers (by they a head of state, a boss, a husband, whatever)
             will use their power to enrich and empower themselves at the expense of
             those subject to their decisions.
                Anarchists recognise that majorities can and do make mistakes and that is
             why our theories on association place great importance on minority rights.
             This can be seen from our theory of self-assumed obligation, which bases
             itself on the right of minorities to protest against majority decisions and
             makes dissent a key factor in decision making. Thus Carole Pateman:
                   “If the majority have acted in bad faith… [then the] minority will
                   have to take political action, including politically disobedient action
                   if appropriate, to defend their citizenship and independence, and
                   the political association itself… Political disobedience is merely one
                   possible expression of the active citizenship on which a selfmanaging democracy is based … The social practice of promising
                   involves the right to refuse or change commitments; similarly, the
                   practice of self-assumed political obligation is meaningless without
                   the practical recognition of the right of minorities to refuse or
                   withdraw consent, or where necessary, to disobey.” [The Problem
                   of Political Obligation, p. 162]
                Moving beyond relationships within associations, we must highlight how
             diﬀerent associations work together. As would be imagined, the links between
             associations follow the same outlines as for the associations themselves.
             Instead of individuals joining an association, we have associations joining
             confederations. The links between associations in the confederation are of the
             same horizontal and voluntary nature as within associations, with the same
             rights of “voice and exit” for members and the same rights for minorities. In
             this way society becomes an association of associations, a community of
             communities, a commune of communes, based upon maximising individual
             freedom by maximising participation and self-management.
                The workings of such a confederation are outlined in section A.2.9 ( What
             sort of society do anarchists want?) and discussed in greater detail in section
             I (What would an anarchist society look like?).
                This system of direct democracy ﬁts nicely into anarchist theory. Malatesta
             speaks for all anarchists when he argued that “anarchists deny the right of
             the majority to govern human society in general.” As can be seen, the majority
             has no right to enforce itself on a minority — the minority can leave the
             association at any time and so, to use Malatesta’s words, do not have to
             “submit to the decisions of the majority before they have even heard what
             these might be.” [The Anarchist Revolution, p. 100 and p. 101] Hence,
96 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             direct democracy within voluntary association does not create “majority rule”
             nor assume that the minority must submit to the majority no matter what. In
             eﬀect, anarchist supporters of direct democracy argue that it ﬁts Malatesta’s
             argument that:
                   “Certainly anarchists recognise that where life is lived in common it
                   is often necessary for the minority to come to accept the opinion of
                   the majority. When there is an obvious need or usefulness in doing
                   something and, to do it requires the agreement of all, the few
                   should feel the need to adapt to the wishes of the many … But such
                   adaptation on the one hand by one group must be on the other be
                   reciprocal, voluntary and must stem from an awareness of need and
                   of goodwill to prevent the running of social aﬀairs from being
                   paralysed by obstinacy. It cannot be imposed as a principle and
                   statutory norm…” [Op. Cit., p. 100]
               As the minority has the right to secede from the association as well as
             having extensive rights of action, protest and appeal, majority rule is not
             imposed as a principle. Rather, it is purely a decision making tool which
             allows minority dissent and opinion to be expressed (and acted upon) while
             ensuring that no minority forces its will on the majority. In other words,
             majority decisions are not binding on the minority. After all, as Malatesta
             argued:

## “one cannot expect, or even wish, that someone who is ﬁrmly
                   convinced that the course taken by the majority leads to disaster,
                   should sacriﬁce his [or her] own convictions and passively look on,
                   or even worse, should support a policy he [or she] considers wrong.”
                   [Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, p. 132]
               Even the Individual Anarchist Lysander Spooner acknowledged that direct
             democracy has its uses when he noted that ”[a]ll, or nearly all, voluntary
             associations give a majority, or some other portion of the members less than
             the whole, the right to use some limited discretion as to the means to be
             used to accomplish the ends in view.” However, only the unanimous decision
             of a jury (which would “judge the law, and the justice of the law”) could
             determine individual rights as this “tribunal fairly represent[s] the whole
             people” as “no law can rightfully be enforced by the association in its
             corporate capacity, against the goods, rights, or person of any individual,
             except it be such as all members of the association agree that it may enforce”
             (his support of juries results from Spooner acknowledging that it “would be
             impossible in practice” for all members of an association to agree) [Trial by
             Jury, p. 130-1f, p. 134, p. 214, p. 152 and p. 132]
               Thus direct democracy and individual/minority rights need not clash. In
             practice, we can imagine direct democracy would be used to make most
             decisions within most associations (perhaps with super-majorities required for
             fundamental decisions) plus some combination of a jury system and minority
             protest/direct action and evaluate/protect minority claims/rights in an
             anarchist society. The actual forms of freedom can only be created through
             practical experience by the people directly involved.

               Lastly, we must stress that anarchist support for direct democracy does not
             mean that this solution is to be favoured in all circumstances. For example,
             many small associations may favour consensus decision making (see the next
             section on consensus and why most anarchists do not think that it is a viable
             alternative to direct democracy). However, most anarchists think that direct
             democracy within free association is the best (and most realistic) form of
             organisation which is consistent with anarchist principles of individual
             freedom, dignity and equality.
             A.2.12 Is consensus an alternative to direct
             democracy?
                The few anarchists who reject direct democracy within free associations
             generally support consensus in decision making. Consensus is based upon
             everyone on a group agreeing to a decision before it can be put into action.
             Thus, it is argued, consensus stops the majority ruling the minority and is
             more consistent with anarchist principles.
                Consensus, although the “best” option in decision making, as all agree, has
             its problems. As Murray Bookchin points out in describing his experience of
             consensus, it can have authoritarian implications:

## “In order… to create full consensus on a decision, minority
                   dissenters were often subtly urged or psychologically coerced to
                   decline to vote on a troubling issue, inasmuch as their dissent would
                   essentially amount to a one-person veto. This practice, called
                   ‘standing aside’ in American consensus processes, all too often
                   involved intimidation of the dissenters, to the point that they
                   completely withdrew from the decision-making process, rather than
                   make an honourable and continuing expression of their dissent by
                   voting, even as a minority, in accordance with their views. Having
                   withdrawn, they ceased to be political beings--so that a ‘decision’
                   could be made… . ‘consensus’ was ultimately achieved only after
                   dissenting members nulliﬁed themselves as participants in the
## process.

                   “On a more theoretical level, consensus silenced that most vital
## aspect of all dialogue, dissensus. The ongoing dissent, the
                   passionate dialogue that still persists even after a minority accedes
                   temporarily to a majority decision,… [can be] replaced… .by dull
## monologues — and the uncontroverted and deadening tone of
                   consensus. In majority decision-making, the defeated minority can
                   resolve to overturn a decision on which they have been defeated —
                   they are free to openly and persistently articulate reasoned and
                   potentially persuasive disagreements. Consensus, for its part,
                   honours no minorities, but mutes them in favour of the metaphysical
                   ‘one’ of the ‘consensus’ group.” [“Communalism: The Democratic
                   Dimension of Anarchism”, Democracy and Nature, no. 8, p. 8]
              Bookchin does not “deny that consensus may be an appropriate form of
98 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
             decision-making in small groups of people who are thoroughly familiar with
             one another.” But he notes that, in practical terms, his own experience has
             shown him that “when larger groups try to make decisions by consensus, it
             usually obliges them to arrive at the lowest common intellectual denominator
             in their decision-making: the least controversial or even the most mediocre
             decision that a sizeable assembly of people can attain is adopted—precisely
             because everyone must agree with it or else withdraw from voting on that
             issue” [Op. Cit., p.7]
               Therefore, due to its potentially authoritarian nature, most anarchists
             disagree that consensus is the political aspect of free association. While it is
             advantageous to try to reach consensus, it is usually impractical to do so —
             especially in large groups — regardless of its other, negative eﬀects. Often it
             demeans a free society or association by tending to subvert individuality in
             the name of community and dissent in the name of solidarity. Neither true
             community nor solidarity are fostered when the individual’s development and
             self-expression are aborted by public disapproval and pressure. Since
             individuals are all unique, they will have unique viewpoints which they should
             be encouraged to express, as society evolves and is enriched by the actions
             and ideas of individuals.
               In other words, anarchist supporters of direct democracy stress the
             ”creative role of dissent” which, they fear, “tends to fade away in the grey
             uniformity required by consensus.” [Op. Cit., p. 8]
               We must stress that anarchists are not in favour of a mechanical decision
             making process in which the majority just vote the minority away and ignore
             them. Far from it! Anarchists who support direct democracy see it as a
             dynamic debating process in which majority and minority listen to and respect
             each other as far possible and create a decision which all can live with (if
             possible). They see the process of participation within directly democratic
             associations as the means of creating common interests, as a process which
             will encourage diversity, individual and minority expression and reduce any
             tendency for majorities to marginalise or oppress minorities by ensuring
             discussion and debate occurs on important issues.
             A.2.13 Are anarchists individualists or collectivists?
               The short answer is: neither. This can be seen from the fact that liberal
             scholars denounce anarchists like Bakunin for being “collectivists” while
             Marxists attack Bakunin and anarchists in general for being “individualists.”
               This is hardly surprising, as anarchists reject both ideologies as nonsense.
             Whether they like it or not, non-anarchist individualists and collectivists are
             two sides of the same capitalist coin. This can best shown be by considering
             modern capitalism, in which “individualist” and “collectivist” tendencies
             continually interact, often with the political and economic structure swinging
             from one pole to the other. Capitalist collectivism and individualism are both
             one-sided aspects of human existence, and like all manifestations of
             imbalance, deeply ﬂawed.
               For anarchists, the idea that individuals should sacriﬁce themselves for the
             “group” or “greater good” is nonsensical. Groups are made up of individuals,
99 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              and if people think only of what’s best for the group, the group will be a
              lifeless shell. It is only the dynamics of human interaction within groups which
              give them life. “Groups” cannot think, only individuals can. This fact,
              ironically, leads authoritarian “collectivists” to a most particular kind of
              “individualism,” namely the “cult of the personality” and leader worship. This
              is to be expected, since such collectivism lumps individuals into abstract
              groups, denies their individuality, and ends up with the need for someone with
              enough individuality to make decisions — a problem that is “solved” by the
              leader principle. Stalinism and Nazism are excellent examples of this
              phenomenon.
                 Therefore, anarchists recognise that individuals are the basic unit of society
              and that only individuals have interests and feelings. This means they oppose
              “collectivism” and the gloriﬁcation of the group. In anarchist theory the group
              exists only to aid and develop the individuals involved in them. This is why we
              place so much stress on groups structured in a libertarian manner — only a
              libertarian organisation allows the individuals within a group to fully express
              themselves, manage their own interests directly and to create social
              relationships which encourage individuality and individual freedom. So while
              society and the groups they join shapes the individual, the individual is the
              true basis of society. Hence Malatesta:
                   “Much has been said about the respective roles of individual
                   initiative and social action in the life and progress of human
                   societies … [E]verything is maintained and kept going in the human
                   world thanks to individual initiative … The real being is man, the
## individual. Society or the collectivity — and the State or
                   government which claims to represent it — if it is not a hollow
                   abstraction, must be made up of individuals. And it is in the
                   organism of every individual that all thoughts and human actions
                   inevitably have their origin, and from being individual they become
                   collective thoughts and acts when they are or become accepted by
                   many individuals. Social action, therefore, is neither the negation
                   nor the complement of individual initiatives, but is the resultant of
                   initiatives, thoughts and actions of all individuals who make up
                   society … [T]he question is not really changing the relationship
                   between society and the individual … [I]t is a question of preventing
                   some individuals from oppressing others; of giving all individuals
                   the same rights and the same means of action; and of replacing the
                   initiative to the few [which Malatesta deﬁnes as a key aspect of
                   government/hierarchy], which inevitably results in the oppression of
                   everyone else … “ [Anarchy, pp. 38–38]
                These considerations do not mean that “individualism” ﬁnds favour with
              anarchists. As Emma Goldman pointed out, ”‘rugged individualism’… is only a
              masked attempt to repress and defeat the individual and his individuality. Socalled Individualism is the social and economic laissez-faire: the exploitation
              of the masses by the [ruling] classes by means of legal trickery, spiritual
              debasement and systematic indoctrination of the servile spirit … That corrupt
              and perverse ‘individualism’ is the straitjacket of individuality .. [It] has
              inevitably resulted in the greatest modern slavery, the crassest class

              distinctions driving millions to the breadline. ‘Rugged individualism’ has
              meant all the ‘individualism’ for the masters, while the people are regimented
              into a slave caste to serve a handful of self-seeking ‘supermen.’” [Red Emma
              Speaks, p. 112]
                 While groups cannot think, individuals cannot live or discuss by themselves.
              Groups and associations are an essential aspect of individual life. Indeed, as
              groups generate social relationships by their very nature, they help shape
              individuals. In other words, groups structured in an authoritarian way will
              have a negative impact on the freedom and individuality of those within them.
              However, due to the abstract nature of their “individualism,” capitalist
              individualists fail to see any diﬀerence between groups structured in a
              libertarian manner rather than in an authoritarian one — they are both
              “groups”. Because of their one-sided perspective on this issue, “individualists”
              ironically end up supporting some of the most “collectivist” institutions in
              existence — capitalist companies — and, moreover, always ﬁnd a need for the
              state despite their frequent denunciations of it. These contradictions stem
              from capitalist individualism’s dependence on individual contracts in an
              unequal society, i.e. abstract individualism.
                 In contrast, anarchists stress social “individualism” (another, perhaps
              better, term for this concept could be “communal individuality”).
              Anarchism “insists that the centre of gravity in society is the individual — that
              he [sic] must think for himself, act freely, and live fully… . If he is to develop
              freely and fully, he must be relieved from the interference and oppression of
              others… . [T]his has nothing in common with… ‘rugged individualism.’ Such
              predatory individualism is really ﬂabby, not rugged. At the least danger to its
              safety, it runs to cover of the state and wails for protection… .Their ‘rugged
              individualism’ is simply one of the many pretences the ruling class makes to
              mask unbridled business and political extortion.” [Emma Goldman, Op. Cit.,
              pp. 442–3]
                 Anarchism rejects the abstract individualism of capitalism, with its ideas of
              “absolute” freedom of the individual which is constrained by others. This
              theory ignores the social context in which freedom exists and grows. “The
              freedom we want,” Malatesta argued, “for ourselves and for others, is not an
              absolute metaphysical, abstract freedom which in practice is inevitably
              translated into the oppression of the weak; but it is a real freedom, possible
              freedom, which is the conscious community of interests, voluntary solidarity.”
              [Anarchy, p. 43]
                 A society based on abstract individualism results in an inequality of power
              between the contracting individuals and so entails the need for an authority
              based on laws above them and organised coercion to enforce the contracts
              between them. This consequence is evident from capitalism and, most notably,
              in the “social contract” theory of how the state developed. In this theory it is
              assumed that individuals are “free” when they are isolated from each other, as
              they allegedly were originally in the “state of nature.” Once they join society,
              they supposedly create a “contract” and a state to administer it. However,
              besides being a fantasy with no basis in reality (human beings have always
              been social animals), this “theory” is actually a justiﬁcation for the state’s
              having extensive powers over society; and this in turn is a justiﬁcation of the
              capitalist system, which requires a strong state. It also mimics the results of
101 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              the capitalist economic relations upon which this theory is built. Within
              capitalism, individuals “freely” contract together, but in practice the owner
              rules the worker for as long as the contract is in place. (See sections A.2.14
              and B.4 for further details).
                 Thus anarchists reject capitalist “individualism” as being, to quote
              Kropotkin, “a narrow and selﬁsh individualism” which, moreover, is “a foolish
              egoism which belittles the individual” and is “not individualism at all. It will
              not lead to what was established as a goal; that is the complete broad and
              most perfectly attainable development of individuality.” The hierarchy of
              capitalism results in “the impoverishment of individuality” rather than its
              development. To this anarchists contrast “the individuality which attains the
              greatest individual development possible through the highest communist
              sociability in what concerns both its primordial needs and its relationships
              with others in general.” [Selected Writings on Anarchism and Revolution,
              p. 295, p. 296 and p. 297] For anarchists, our freedom is enriched by those
              around us when we work with them as equals and not as master and servant.
                 In practice, both individualism and collectivism lead to a denial of both
              individual liberty and group autonomy and dynamics. In addition, each implies
              the other, with collectivism leading to a particular form of individualism and
              individualism leading to a particular form of collectivism.
                 Collectivism, with its implicit suppression of the individual, ultimately
              impoverishes the community, as groups are only given life by the individuals
              who comprise them. Individualism, with its explicit suppression of community
              (i.e. the people with whom you live), ultimately impoverishes the individual,
              since individuals do not exist apart from society but can only exist within it. In
              addition, individualism ends up denying the “select few” the insights and
              abilities of the individuals who make up the rest of society, and so is a source
              of self-denial. This is Individualism’s fatal ﬂaw (and contradiction), namely
              “the impossibility for the individual to attain a really full development in the
              conditions of oppression of the mass by the ‘beautiful aristocracies’. His [or
              her] development would remain uni-lateral.” [Peter Kropotkin, Anarchism, p.
              293]
## True liberty and community exist elsewhere.

              A.2.14 Why is voluntarism not enough?
                 Voluntarism means that association should be voluntary in order maximise
              liberty. Anarchists are, obviously, voluntarists, thinking that only in free
              association, created by free agreement, can individuals develop, grow, and
              express their liberty. However, it is evident that under capitalism voluntarism
              is not enough in itself to maximise liberty.
                 Voluntarism implies promising (i.e. the freedom to make agreements), and
              promising implies that individuals are capable of independent judgement and
              rational deliberation. In addition, it presupposes that they can evaluate and
              change their actions and relationships. Contracts under capitalism, however,
              contradict these implications of voluntarism. For, while technically
              “voluntary” (though as we show in section B.4, this is not really the case),
              capitalist contracts result in a denial of liberty. This is because the social
102 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              relationship of wage-labour involves promising to obey in return for payment.
              And as Carole Pateman points out, “to promise to obey is to deny or to limit,
              to a greater or lesser degree, individuals’ freedom and equality and their
              ability to exercise these capacities [of independent judgement and rational
              deliberation]. To promise to obey is to state, that in certain areas, the person
              making the promise is no longer free to exercise her capacities and decide
              upon her own actions, and is no longer equal, but subordinate.” [The
              Problem of Political Obligation, p. 19] This results in those obeying no
              longer making their own decisions. Thus the rational for voluntarism (i.e. that
              individuals are capable of thinking for themselves and must be allowed to
              express their individuality and make their own decisions) is violated in a
              hierarchical relationship as some are in charge and the many obey (see also
              section A.2.8). Thus any voluntarism which generates relationships of
              subordination is, by its very nature, incomplete and violates its own
              justiﬁcation.
                This can be seen from capitalist society, in which workers sell their freedom
              to a boss in order to live. In eﬀect, under capitalism you are only free to the
              extent that you can choose whom you will obey! Freedom, however, must
              mean more than the right to change masters. Voluntary servitude is still
              servitude. For if, as Rousseau put it, sovereignty, “for the same reason as
              makes it inalienable, cannot be represented” neither can it be sold nor
              temporarily nulliﬁed by a hiring contract. Rousseau famously argued that the
              “people of England regards itself as free; but it is grossly mistaken; it is free
              only during the election of members of parliament. As soon as they are
              elected, slavery overtakes it, and it is nothing.” [The Social Contract and
              Discourses, p. 266] Anarchists expand on this analysis. To paraphrase
              Rousseau:
                   Under capitalism the worker regards herself as free; but she is
                   grossly mistaken; she is free only when she signs her contract with
                   her boss. As soon as it is signed, slavery overtakes her and she is
## nothing but an order taker.

                To see why, to see the injustice, we need only quote Rousseau:

## “That a rich and powerful man, having acquired immense
                   possessions in land, should impose laws on those who want to
                   establish themselves there, and that he should only allow them to do
                   so on condition that they accept his supreme authority and obey all
                   his wishes; that, I can still conceive … Would not this tyrannical act
                   contain a double usurpation: that on the ownership of the land and
                   that on the liberty of the inhabitants?” [Op. Cit., p. 316]
                Hence Proudhon’s comment that “Man may be made by property a slave or
              a despot by turns.” [What is Property?, p. 371] Little wonder we discover
              Bakunin rejecting “any contract with another individual on any footing but the
              utmost equality and reciprocity” as this would “alienate his [or her] freedom”
              and so would be a “a relationship of voluntary servitude with another
              individual.” Anyone making such a contract in a free society (i.e. anarchist
              society) would be “devoid of any sense of personal dignity.” [Michael
103 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              Bakunin: Selected Writings, pp. 68–9] Only self-managed associations can
              create relationships of equality rather than of subordination between its
              members.
                 Therefore anarchists stress the need for direct democracy in voluntary
              associations in order to ensure that the concept of “freedom” is not a sham
              and a justiﬁcation for domination, as it is under capitalism. Only self-managed
              associations can create relationships of equality rather than of subordination
              between its members.
                 It is for this reason that anarchists have opposed capitalism and urged
              “workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions
              for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism.” [Proudhon, The
              General Idea of the Revolution, p. 277] For similar reasons, anarchists
              (with the notable exception of Proudhon) opposed marriage as it turned
              women into “a bonded slave, who takes her master’s name, her master’s
              bread, her master’s commands, and serves her master’s passions … who can
              control no property, not even her own body, without his consent.” [Voltairine
              de Cleyre, “Sex Slavery”, The Voltairine de Cleyre Reader, p. 94] While
              marriage, due to feminist agitation, in many countries has been reformed
              towards the anarchist ideal of a free union of equals, it still is based on the
              patriarchal principles anarchists like Goldman and de Cleyre identiﬁed and
              condemned (see section A.3.5 for more on feminism and anarchism).
                 Clearly, voluntary entry is a necessary but not a suﬀicient condition to
              defend an individual’s liberty. This is to be expected as it ignores (or takes for
              granted) the social conditions in which agreements are made and, moreover,
              ignores the social relationships created by them (“For the worker who must
              sell his labour, it is impossible to remain free.” [Kropotkin, Selected
              Writings on Anarchism and Revolution, p. 305]). Any social relationships
              based on abstract individualism are likely to be based upon force, power, and
              authority, not liberty. This of course assumes a deﬁnition of liberty according
              to which individuals exercise their capacities and decide their own actions.
              Therefore, voluntarism is not enough to create a society that maximises
              liberty. This is why anarchists think that voluntary association must be
              complemented by self-management (direct democracy) within these
              associations. For anarchists, the assumptions of voluntarism imply selfmanagement. Or, to use Proudhon’s words, “as individualism is the primordial
              fact of humanity, so association is its complementary term.” [System of
              Economical Contradictions, p. 430]
                 To answer the second objection ﬁrst, in a society based on private property
              (and so statism), those with property have more power, which they can use to
              perpetuate their authority. “Wealth is power, poverty is weakness,” in the
              words of Albert Parsons. This means that under capitalism the much praised
              “freedom to choose” is extremely limited. It becomes, for the vast majority,
              the freedom to pick a master (under slavery, quipped Parsons, the master
              “selected … his own slaves. Under the wage slavery system the wage slave
              selects his master.”). Under capitalism, Parsons stressed, “those disinherited
              of their natural rights must hire out and serve and obey the oppressing class
              or starve. There is no other alternative. Some things are priceless, chief
              among which are life and liberty. A freeman [or woman] is not for sale or
              hire.” [Anarchism, p. 99 and p. 98] And why should we excuse servitude or
104 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              tolerate those who desire to restrict the liberty of others? The “liberty” to
              command is the liberty to enslave, and so is actually a denial of liberty.
                Regarding the ﬁrst objection, anarchists plead guilty. We are prejudiced
              against the reduction of human beings to the status of robots. We are
              prejudiced in favour of human dignity and freedom. We are prejudiced, in fact,
              in favour of humanity and individuality.
                ( Section A.2.11 discusses why direct democracy is the necessary social
              counterpart to voluntarism (i.e. free agreement). Section B.4 discusses why
              capitalism cannot be based on equal bargaining power between property
              owners and the propertyless).
              A.2.15 What about “human nature”?
                Anarchists, far from ignoring “human nature,” have the only political theory
              that gives this concept deep thought and reﬂection. Too often, “human
              nature” is ﬂung up as the last line of defence in an argument against
              anarchism, because it is thought to be beyond reply. This is not the case,
              however. First of all, human nature is a complex thing. If, by human nature, it
              is meant “what humans do,” it is obvious that human nature is contradictory
              — love and hate, compassion and heartlessness, peace and violence, and so
              on, have all been expressed by people and so are all products of “human
              nature.” Of course, what is considered “human nature” can change with
              changing social circumstances. For example, slavery was considered part of
              “human nature” and “normal” for thousands of years. Homosexuality was
              considered perfectly normal by the ancient Greeks yet thousands of years
              later the Christian church denounced it as unnatural. War only become part of
              “human nature” once states developed. Hence Chomsky:
                   “Individuals are certainly capable of evil … But individuals are
                   capable of all sorts of things. Human nature has lots of ways of
                   realising itself, humans have lots of capacities and options. Which
## ones reveal themselves depends to a large extent on the
                   institutional structures. If we had institutions which permitted
                   pathological killers free rein, they’d be running the place. The only
                   way to survive would be to let those elements of your nature
## manifest themselves.

                   “If we have institutions which make greed the sole property of
                   human beings and encourage pure greed at the expense of other
                   human emotions and commitments, we’re going to have a society
                   based on greed, with all that follows. A diﬀerent society might be
                   organised in such a way that human feelings and emotions of other
                   sorts, say, solidarity, support, sympathy become dominant. Then
                   you’ll have diﬀerent aspects of human nature and personality
                   revealing themselves.” [Chronicles of Dissent, pp. 158]
                Therefore, environment plays an important part in deﬁning what “human
              nature” is, how it develops and what aspects of it are expressed. Indeed, one
              of the greatest myths about anarchism is the idea that we think human nature
105 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              is inherently good (rather, we think it is inherently sociable). How it develops
              and expresses itself is dependent on the kind of society we live in and create.
              A hierarchical society will shape people in certain (negative) ways and
              produce a “human nature” radically diﬀerent from a libertarian one. So “when
              we hear men [and women] saying that Anarchists imagine men [and women]
              much better than they really are, we merely wonder how intelligent people
              can repeat that nonsense. Do we not say continually that the only means of
              rendering men [and women] less rapacious and egotistic, less ambitious and
              less slavish at the same time, is to eliminate those conditions which favour the
              growth of egotism and rapacity, of slavishness and ambition?” [Peter
              Kropotkin, Act for Yourselves, p. 83]
                 As such, the use of “human nature” as an argument against anarchism is
              simply superﬁcial and, ultimately, an evasion. It is an excuse not to think.
              “Every fool,” as Emma Goldman put it, “from king to policemen, from the
              ﬂatheaded parson to the visionless dabbler in science, presumes to speak
              authoritatively of human nature. The greater the mental charlatan, the more
              deﬁnite his insistence on the wickedness and weakness of human nature. Yet
              how can any one speak of it to-day, with every soul in prison, with every heart
              fettered, wounded, and maimed?” Change society, create a better social
              environment and then we can judge what is a product of our natures and what
              is the product of an authoritarian system. For this reason, anarchism “stands
              for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the
              liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from
              the shackles and restraint of government.” For ”[f]reedom, expansion,
              opportunity, and above all, peace and repose, alone can teach us the real
              dominant factors of human nature and all its wonderful possibilities.” [Red
              Emma Speaks, p. 73]
                 This does not mean that human beings are inﬁnitely plastic, with each
              individual born a tabula rasa (blank slate) waiting to be formed by “society”
              (which in practice means those who run it). As Noam Chomsky argues, “I
              don’t think its possible to give a rational account of the concept of alienated
              labour on that assumption [that human nature is nothing but a historical
              product], nor is it possible to produce something like a moral justiﬁcation for
              the commitment to some kind of social change, except on the basis of
              assumptions about human nature and how modiﬁcations in the structure of
              society will be better able to conform to some of the fundamental needs that
              are part of our essential nature.” [Language and Politics, p. 215] We do not
              wish to enter the debate about what human characteristics are and are not
              “innate.” All we will say is that human beings have an innate ability to think
              and learn — that much is obvious, we feel — and that humans are sociable
              creatures, needing the company of others to feel complete and to prosper.
              Moreover, they have the ability to recognise and oppose injustice and
              oppression (Bakunin rightly considered ”the power to think and the desire
              to rebel” as “precious faculties.” [God and the State, p. 9]).
                 These three features, we think, suggest the viability of an anarchist society.
              The innate ability to think for oneself automatically makes all forms of
              hierarchy illegitimate, and our need for social relationships implies that we
              can organise without the state. The deep unhappiness and alienation aﬄicting
              modern society reveals that the centralisation and authoritarianism of
106 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              capitalism and the state are denying some innate needs within us. In fact, as
              mentioned earlier, for the great majority of its existence the human race has
              lived in anarchic communities, with little or no hierarchy. That modern society
              calls such people “savages” or “primitive” is pure arrogance. So who can tell
              whether anarchism is against “human nature”? Anarchists have accumulated
              much evidence to suggest that it may not be.
                 As for the charge the anarchists demand too much of “human nature,” it is
              often non anarchists who make the greatest claims on it. For “while our
              opponents seem to admit there is a kind of salt of the earth — the rulers, the
              employers, the leaders — who, happily enough, prevent those bad men — the
              ruled, the exploited, the led — from becoming still worse than they are” we
              anarchists “maintain that both rulers and ruled are spoiled by authority” and
              ”both exploiters and exploited are spoiled by exploitation.” So “there is [a]
              diﬀerence, and a very important one. We admit the imperfections of human
              nature, but we make no exception for the rulers. They make it, although
              sometimes unconsciously, and because we make no such exception, they say
              that we are dreamers.” [Peter Kropotkin, Op. Cit., p. 83] If human nature is
              so bad, then giving some people power over others and hoping this will lead
              to justice and freedom is hopelessly utopian.
                 Moreover, as noted, Anarchists argue that hierarchical organisations bring
              out the worse in human nature. Both the oppressor and the oppressed are
              negatively aﬀected by the authoritarian relationships so produced. “It is a
              characteristic of privilege and of every kind of privilege,” argued Bakunin, “to
              kill the mind and heart of man … That is a social law which admits no
              exceptions … It is the law of equality and humanity.” [God and the State, p.
              31] And while the privileged become corrupted by power, the powerless (in
              general) become servile in heart and mind (luckily the human spirit is such
              that there will always be rebels no matter the oppression for where there is
              oppression, there is resistance and, consequently, hope). As such, it seems
              strange for anarchists to hear non-anarchists justify hierarchy in terms of the
              (distorted) “human nature” it produces.
                 Sadly, too many have done precisely this. It continues to this day. For
              example, with the rise of “sociobiology,” some claim (with very little real
              evidence) that capitalism is a product of our “nature,” which is determined by
              our genes. These claims are simply a new variation of the “human nature”
              argument and have, unsurprisingly, been leapt upon by the powers that be.
              Considering the dearth of evidence, their support for this “new” doctrine must
              be purely the result of its utility to those in power — i.e. the fact that it is
              useful to have an “objective” and “scientiﬁc” basis to rationalise inequalities
              in wealth and power (for a discussion of this process see Not in Our Genes:
              Biology, Ideology and Human Nature by Steven Rose, R.C. Lewontin and
              Leon J. Kamin).
                 This is not to say that it does not hold a grain of truth. As scientist Stephen
              Jay Gould notes, “the range of our potential behaviour is circumscribed by our
              biology” and if this is what sociobiology means “by genetic control, then we
              can scarcely disagree.” However, this is not what is meant. Rather, it is a form
              of “biological determinism” that sociobiology argues for. Saying that there are
              speciﬁc genes for speciﬁc human traits says little for while ”[v]iolence,
              sexism, and general nastiness are biological since they represent one subset
107 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              of a possible range of behaviours” so are “peacefulness, equality, and
              kindness.” And so “we may see their inﬂuence increase if we can create social
              structures that permit them to ﬂourish.” That this may be the case can be
              seen from the works of sociobiologists themselves, who “acknowledge
              diversity” in human cultures while “often dismiss[ing] the uncomfortable
              ‘exceptions’ as temporary and unimportant aberrations.” This is surprising,
              for if you believe that “repeated, often genocidal warfare has shaped our
              genetic destiny, the existence of nonaggressive peoples is embarrassing.”
              [Ever Since Darwin, p. 252, p. 257 and p. 254]
                 Like the social Darwinism that preceded it, sociobiology proceeds by ﬁrst
              projecting the dominant ideas of current society onto nature (often
              unconsciously, so that scientists mistakenly consider the ideas in question as
              both “normal” and “natural”). Bookchin refers to this as “the subtle projection
              of historically conditioned human values” onto nature rather than “scientiﬁc
              objectivity.” Then the theories of nature produced in this manner are
              transferred back onto society and history, being used to “prove” that the
              principles of capitalism (hierarchy, authority, competition, etc.) are eternal
              laws, which are then appealed to as a justiﬁcation for the status quo! “What
              this procedure does accomplish,” notes Bookchin, “is reinforce human social
              hierarchies by justifying the command of men and women as innate features
              of the ‘natural order.’ Human domination is thereby transcribed into the
              genetic code as biologically immutable.” [The Ecology of Freedom, p. 95
              and p. 92] Amazingly, there are many supposedly intelligent people who take
              this sleight-of-hand seriously.
                 This can be seen when “hierarchies” in nature are used to explain, and so
              justify, hierarchies in human societies. Such analogies are misleading for they
              forget the institutional nature of human life. As Murray Bookchin notes in his
              critique of sociobiology, a “weak, enfeebled, unnerved, and sick ape is hardly
              likely to become an ‘alpha’ male, much less retain this highly ephemeral
              ‘status.’ By contrast, the most physically and mentally pathological human
              rulers have exercised authority with devastating eﬀect in the course of
              history.” This “expresses a power of hierarchical institutions over persons
              that is completely reversed in so-called ‘animal hierarchies’ where the
              absence of institutions is precisely the only intelligible way of talking about
              ‘alpha males’ or ‘queen bees.’” [“Sociobiology or Social Ecology”, Which way
              for the Ecology Movement?, p. 58] Thus what makes human society unique
              is conveniently ignored and the real sources of power in society are hidden
              under a genetic screen.
                 The sort of apologetics associated with appeals to “human nature” (or
              sociobiology at its worse) are natural, of course, because every ruling class
              needs to justify their right to rule. Hence they support doctrines that deﬁned
              the latter in ways appearing to justify elite power — be it sociobiology, divine
              right, original sin, etc. Obviously, such doctrines have always been wrong …
              until now, of course, as it is obvious our current society truly conforms to
              “human nature” and it has been scientiﬁcally proven by our current scientiﬁc
              priesthood!
                 The arrogance of this claim is truly amazing. History hasn’t stopped. One
              thousand years from now, society will be completely diﬀerent from what it is
              presently or from what anyone has imagined. No government in place at the
108 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              moment will still be around, and the current economic system will not exist.
              The only thing that may remain the same is that people will still be claiming
              that their new society is the “One True System” that completely conforms to
              human nature, even though all past systems did not.
                Of course, it does not cross the minds of supporters of capitalism that
              people from diﬀerent cultures may draw diﬀerent conclusions from the same
              facts — conclusions that may be more valid. Nor does it occur to capitalist
              apologists that the theories of the “objective” scientists may be framed in the
              context of the dominant ideas of the society they live in. It comes as no
              surprise to anarchists, however, that scientists working in Tsarist Russia
              developed a theory of evolution based on cooperation within species, quite
              unlike their counterparts in capitalist Britain, who developed a theory based
              on competitive struggle within and between species. That the latter theory
              reﬂected the dominant political and economic theories of British society
              (notably competitive individualism) is pure coincidence, of course.
                Kropotkin’s classic work Mutual Aid, for example, was written in response
              to the obvious inaccuracies that British representatives of Darwinism had
              projected onto nature and human life. Building upon the mainstream Russian
              criticism of the British Darwinism of the time, Kropotkin showed (with
              substantial empirical evidence) that “mutual aid” within a group or species
              played as important a role as “mutual struggle” between individuals within
              those groups or species (see Stephan Jay Gould’s essay “Kropotkin was no
              Crackpot” in his book Bully for Brontosaurus for details and an evaluation).
              It was, he stressed, a “factor” in evolution along with competition, a factor
              which, in most circumstances, was far more important to survival. Thus cooperation is just as “natural” as competition so proving that “human nature”
              was not a barrier to anarchism as co-operation between members of a species
              can be the best pathway to advantage individuals.
                To conclude. Anarchists argue that anarchy is not against “human nature”
              for two main reasons. Firstly, what is considered as being “human nature” is
              shaped by the society we live in and the relationships we create. This means a
              hierarchical society will encourage certain personality traits to dominate
              while an anarchist one would encourage others. As such, anarchists “do not
              so much rely on the fact that human nature will change as they do upon the
              theory that the same nature will act diﬀerently under diﬀerent
              circumstances.” Secondly, change “seems to be one of the fundamental laws
              of existence” so “who can say that man [sic!] has reached the limits of his
              possibilities.” [George Barrett, Objections to Anarchism, pp. 360–1 and p.
              360]
                For useful discussions on anarchist ideas on human nature, both of which
              refute the idea that anarchists think human beings are naturally good, see
              Peter Marshall’s “Human nature and anarchism” [David Goodway (ed.), For
              Anarchism: History, Theory and Practice, pp. 127–149] and David
              Hartley’s “Communitarian Anarchism and Human Nature”. [Anarchist
              Studies, vol. 3, no. 2, Autumn 1995, pp. 145–164]
              A.2.16 Does anarchism require “perfect” people to
              work?
109 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
               No. Anarchy is not a utopia, a “perfect” society. It will be a human society,
              with all the problems, hopes, and fears associated with human beings.
              Anarchists do not think that human beings need to be “perfect” for anarchy to
              work. They only need to be free. Thus Christie and Meltzer:
                   ”[A] common fallacy [is] that revolutionary socialism [i.e. anarchism]
                   is an ‘idealisation’ of the workers and [so] the mere recital of their
                   present faults is a refutation of the class struggle … it seems
                   morally unreasonable that a free society … could exist without
                   moral or ethical perfection. But so far as the overthrow of [existing]
## society is concerned, we may ignore the fact of people’s
## shortcomings and prejudices, so long as they do not become
                   institutionalised. One may view without concern the fact … that the
                   workers might achieve control of their places of work long before
                   they had acquired the social graces of the ‘intellectual’ or shed all
                   the prejudices of the present society from family discipline to
                   xenophobia. What does it matter, so long as they can run industry
                   without masters? Prejudices wither in freedom and only ﬂourish
                   while the social climate is favourable to them … What we say is …
                   that once life can continue without imposed authority from above,
                   and imposed authority cannot survive the withdrawal of labour from
                   its service, the prejudices of authoritarianism will disappear. There
                   is no cure for them other than the free process of education.” [The
                   Floodgates of Anarchy, pp. 36–7]
                Obviously, though, we think that a free society will produce people who are
              more in tune with both their own and others individuality and needs, thus
              reducing individual conﬂict. Remaining disputes would be solved by
              reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or
              community and workplace assemblies (see section I.5.8 for a discussion of
              how could be done for anti-social activities as well as disputes).
                Like the “anarchism-is-against-human-nature” argument (see section
              A.2.15), opponents of anarchism usually assume “perfect” people — people
              who are not corrupted by power when placed in positions of authority, people
              who are strangely unaﬀected by the distorting eﬀects of hierarchy, privilege,
              and so forth. However, anarchists make no such claims about human
              perfection. We simply recognise that vesting power in the hands of one person
              or an elite is never a good idea, as people are not perfect.
                It should be noted that the idea that anarchism requires a “new” (perfect)
              man or woman is often raised by the opponents of anarchism to discredit it
              (and, usually, to justify the retention of hierarchical authority, particularly
              capitalist relations of production). After all, people are not perfect and are
              unlikely ever to be. As such, they pounce on every example of a government
              falling and the resulting chaos to dismiss anarchism as unrealistic. The media
              loves to proclaim a country to be falling into “anarchy” whenever there is a
              disruption in “law and order” and looting takes place.
                Anarchists are not impressed by this argument. A moment’s reﬂection
              shows why, for the detractors make the basic mistake of assuming an
              anarchist society without anarchists! (A variation of such claims is raised by
              the right-wing “anarcho”-capitalists to discredit real anarchism. However,
110 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              their “objection” discredits their own claim to be anarchists for they implicitly
              assume an anarchist society without anarchists!). Needless to say, an
              “anarchy” made up of people who still saw the need for authority, property
              and statism would soon become authoritarian (i.e. non-anarchist) again. This
              is because even if the government disappeared tomorrow, the same system
              would soon grow up again, because “the strength of the government rests not
              with itself, but with the people. A great tyrant may be a fool, and not a
              superman. His strength lies not in himself, but in the superstition of the
              people who think that it is right to obey him. So long as that superstition
              exists it is useless for some liberator to cut oﬀ the head of tyranny; the people
              will create another, for they have grown accustomed to rely on something
              outside themselves.” [George Barrett, Objections to Anarchism, p. 355]
                Hence Alexander Berkman:
                   “Our social institutions are founded on certain ideas; as long as the
                   latter are generally believed, the institutions built on them are safe.
                   Government remains strong because people think political authority
                   and legal compulsion necessary. Capitalism will continue as long as
                   such an economic system is considered adequate and just. The
                   weakening of the ideas which support the evil and oppressive
## present day conditions means the ultimate breakdown of
                   government and capitalism.” [What is Anarchism?, p. xii]
                In other words, anarchy needs anarchists in order to be created and
              survive. But these anarchists need not be perfect, just people who have freed
              themselves, by their own eﬀorts, of the superstition that command-andobedience relations and capitalist property rights are necessary. The implicit
              assumption in the idea that anarchy needs “perfect” people is that freedom
              will be given, not taken; hence the obvious conclusion follows that an anarchy
              requiring “perfect” people will fail. But this argument ignores the need for
              self-activity and self-liberation in order to create a free society. For anarchists,
              “history is nothing but a struggle between the rulers and the ruled, the
              oppressors and the oppressed.” [Peter Kropotkin, Act for Yourselves, p. 85]
              Ideas change through struggle and, consequently, in the struggle against
              oppression and exploitation, we not only change the world, we change
              ourselves at the same time. So it is the struggle for freedom which creates
              people capable of taking the responsibility for their own lives, communities
              and planet. People capable of living as equals in a free society, so making
              anarchy possible.
                As such, the chaos which often results when a government disappears is not
              anarchy nor, in fact, a case against anarchism. It simple means that the
              necessary preconditions for creating an anarchist society do not exist.
              Anarchy would be the product of collective struggle at the heart of society, not
              the product of external shocks. Nor, we should note, do anarchists think that
              such a society will appear “overnight.” Rather, we see the creation of an
              anarchist system as a process, not an event. The ins-and-outs of how it would
              function will evolve over time in the light of experience and objective
              circumstances, not appear in a perfect form immediately (see section H.2.5
              for a discussion of Marxist claims otherwise).
                Therefore, anarchists do not conclude that “perfect” people are necessary
111 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              anarchism to work because the anarchist is “no liberator with a divine mission
              to free humanity, but he is a part of that humanity struggling onwards
              towards liberty.” As such, ”[i]f, then, by some external means an Anarchist
              Revolution could be, so to speak, supplied ready-made and thrust upon the
              people, it is true that they would reject it and rebuild the old society. If, on the
              other hand, the people develop their ideas of freedom, and they themselves
              get rid of the last stronghold of tyranny — the government — then indeed the
              revolution will be permanently accomplished.” [George Barrett, Op. Cit., p.
              355]
                 This is not to suggest that an anarchist society must wait until everyone is
              an anarchist. Far from it. It is highly unlikely, for example, that the rich and
              powerful will suddenly see the errors of their ways and voluntarily renounce
              their privileges. Faced with a large and growing anarchist movement, the
              ruling elite has always used repression to defend its position in society. The
              use of fascism in Spain (see section A.5.6) and Italy (see section A.5.5) show
              the depths the capitalist class can sink to. Anarchism will be created in the
              face of opposition by the ruling minorities and, consequently, will need to
              defend itself against attempts to recreate authority (see section H.2.1 for a
              refutation of Marxist claims anarchists reject the need to defend an anarchist
              society against counter-revolution).
                 Instead anarchists argue that we should focus our activity on convincing
              those subject to oppression and exploitation that they have the power to resist
              both and, ultimately, can end both by destroying the social institutions that
              cause them. As Malatesta argued, “we need the support of the masses to build
              a force of suﬀicient strength to achieve our speciﬁc task of radical change in
              the social organism by the direct action of the masses, we must get closer to
              them, accept them as they are, and from within their ranks seek to ‘push’
              them forward as much as possible.” [Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas,
              pp. 155–6] This would create the conditions that make possible a rapid
              evolution towards anarchism as what was initially accepted by a minority “but
              increasingly ﬁnding popular expression, will make its way among the mass of
              the people” and “the minority will become the People, the great mass, and
              that mass rising up against property and the State, will march forward
              towards anarchist communism.” [Kropotkin, Words of a Rebel, p. 75] Hence
              the importance anarchists attach to spreading our ideas and arguing the case
              for anarchism. This creates conscious anarchists from those questioning the
              injustices of capitalism and the state.
                 This process is helped by the nature of hierarchical society and the
              resistance it naturally developed in those subject to it. Anarchist ideas
              develop spontaneously through struggle. As we discuss in section I.2.3,
              anarchistic organisations are often created as part of the resistance against
              oppression and exploitation which marks every hierarchical system and can.,
              potentially, be the framework of a few society. As such, the creation of
              libertarian institutions is, therefore, always a possibility in any situation. A
              peoples’ experiences may push them towards anarchist conclusions, namely
              the awareness that the state exists to protect the wealthy and powerful few
              and to disempower the many. That while it is needed to maintain class and
              hierarchical society, it is not needed to organise society nor can it do so in a
              just and fair way for all. This is possible. However, without a conscious
112 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              anarchist presence any libertarian tendencies are likely to be used, abused
              and ﬁnally destroyed by parties or religious groups seeking political power
              over the masses (the Russian Revolution is the most famous example of this
              process). It is for that reason anarchists organise to inﬂuence the struggle
              and spread our ideas (see section J.3 for details). For it is the case that only
              when anarchist ideas “acquire a predominating inﬂuence” and are “accepted
              by a suﬀiciently large section of the population” will we “have achieved
              anarchy, or taken a step towards anarchy.” For anarchy “cannot be imposed
              against the wishes of the people.” [Malatesta, Op. Cit., p. 159 and p. 163]
                So, to conclude, the creation of an anarchist society is not dependent on
              people being perfect but it is dependent on a large majority being anarchists
              and wanting to reorganise society in a libertarian manner. This will not
              eliminate conﬂict between individuals nor create a fully formed anarchist
              humanity overnight but it will lay the ground for the gradual elimination of
              whatever prejudices and anti-social behaviour that remain after the struggle
              to change society has revolutionised those doing it.
              A.2.17 Aren’t most people too stupid for a free society
              to work?
                We are sorry to have to include this question in an anarchist FAQ, but we
              know that many political ideologies explicitly assume that ordinary people are
              too stupid to be able to manage their own lives and run society. All aspects of
              the capitalist political agenda, from Left to Right, contain people who make
              this claim. Be it Leninists, fascists, Fabians or Objectivists, it is assumed that
              only a select few are creative and intelligent and that these people should
              govern others. Usually, this elitism is masked by ﬁne, ﬂowing rhetoric about
              “freedom,” “democracy” and other platitudes with which the ideologues
              attempt to dull people’s critical thought by telling them want they want to
              hear.
                It is, of course, also no surprise that those who believe in “natural” elites
              always class themselves at the top. We have yet to discover an “objectivist”,
              for example, who considers themselves part of the great mass of “secondhanders” (it is always amusing to hear people who simply parrot the ideas of
              Ayn Rand dismissing other people so!) or who will be a toilet cleaner in the
              unknown “ideal” of “real” capitalism. Everybody reading an elitist text will
              consider him or herself to be part of the “select few.” It’s “natural” in an elitist
              society to consider elites to be natural and yourself a potential member of
              one!
                Examination of history shows that there is a basic elitist ideology which has
              been the essential rationalisation of all states and ruling classes since their
              emergence at the beginning of the Bronze Age (“if the legacy of domination
              had had any broader purpose than the support of hierarchical and class
              interests, it has been the attemp to exorcise the belief in public competence
              from social discourse itself.” [Bookchin, The Ecology of Freedom, p. 206]).
              This ideology merely changes its outer garments, not its basic inner content
              over time.
                During the Dark Ages, for example, it was coloured by Christianity, being
113 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              adapted to the needs of the Church hierarchy. The most useful “divinely
              revealed” dogma to the priestly elite was “original sin”: the notion that human
              beings are basically depraved and incompetent creatures who need “direction
              from above,” with priests as the conveniently necessary mediators between
              ordinary humans and “God.” The idea that average people are basically stupid
              and thus incapable of governing themselves is a carry over from this doctrine,
              a relic of the Dark Ages.
                In reply to all those who claim that most people are “second-handers” or
              cannot develop anything more than “trade union consciousness,” all we can
              say is that it is an absurdity that cannot withstand even a superﬁcial look at
              history, particularly the labour movement. The creative powers of those
              struggling for freedom is often truly amazing, and if this intellectual power
              and inspiration is not seen in “normal” society, this is the clearest indictment
              possible of the deadening eﬀects of hierarchy and the conformity produced by
              authority. (See also section B.1 for more on the eﬀects of hierarchy). As Bob
              Black points outs:
                   “You are what you do. If you do boring, stupid, monotonous work,
                   chances are you’ll end up boring, stupid, and monotonous. Work is a
                   much better explanation for the creeping cretinisation all around us
                   than even such signiﬁcant moronising mechanisms as television and
                   education. People who are regimented all their lives, handed to
                   work from school and bracketed by the family in the beginning and
                   the nursing home in the end, are habituated to hierarchy and
## psychologically enslaved. Their aptitude for autonomy is so
                   atrophied that their fear of freedom is among their few rationally
                   grounded phobias. Their obedience training at work carries over
                   into the families they start, thus reproducing the system in more
                   ways than one, and into politics, culture and everything else. Once
                   you drain the vitality from people at work, they’ll likely submit to
                   hierarchy and expertise in everything. They’re used to it.” [The
                   Abolition of Work and other essays, pp. 21–2]
                When elitists try to conceive of liberation, they can only think of it being
              given to the oppressed by kind (for Leninists) or stupid (for Objectivists)
              elites. It is hardly surprising, then, that it fails. Only self-liberation can
              produce a free society. The crushing and distorting eﬀects of authority can
              only be overcome by self-activity. The few examples of such self-liberation
              prove that most people, once considered incapable of freedom by others, are
              more than up for the task.
                Those who proclaim their “superiority” often do so out of fear that their
              authority and power will be destroyed once people free themselves from the
              debilitating hands of authority and come to realise that, in the words of Max
              Stirner, “the great are great only because we are on our knees. Let us rise”
                As Emma Goldman remarks about women’s equality, ”[t]he extraordinary
              achievements of women in every walk of life have silenced forever the loose
              talk of women’s inferiority. Those who still cling to this fetish do so because
              they hate nothing so much as to see their authority challenged. This is the
              characteristic of all authority, whether the master over his economic slaves or
              man over women. However, everywhere woman is escaping her cage,
114 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              everywhere she is going ahead with free, large strides.” [Vision on Fire, p.
              256] The same comments are applicable, for example, to the very successful
              experiments in workers’ self-management during the Spanish Revolution.
                 Then, of course, the notion that people are too stupid for anarchism to work
              also backﬁres on those who argue it. Take, for example, those who use this
              argument to advocate democratic government rather than anarchy.
              Democracy, as Luigi Galleani noted, means “acknowledging the right and the
              competence of the people to select their rulers.” However, “whoever has the
              political competence to choose his [or her] own rulers is, by implication, also
              competent to do without them, especially when the causes of economic enmity
              are uprooted.” [The End of Anarchism?, p. 37] Thus the argument for
              democracy against anarchism undermines itself, for “if you consider these
              worthy electors as unable to look after their own interests themselves, how is
              it that they know how to choose for themselves the shepherds who must guide
              them? And how will they be able to solve this problem of social alchemy, of
              producing the election of a genius from the votes of a mass of fools?”
              [Malatesta, Anarchy, pp. 53–4]
                 As for those who consider dictatorship as the solution to human stupidity,
              the question arises why are these dictators immune to this apparently
              universal human trait? And, as Malatesta noted, “who are the best? And who
              will recognise these qualities in them?” [Op. Cit., p. 53] If they impose
              themselves on the “stupid” masses, why assume they will not exploit and
              oppress the many for their own beneﬁt? Or, for that matter, that they are any
              more intelligent than the masses? The history of dictatorial and monarchical
              government suggests a clear answer to those questions. A similar argument
              applies for other non-democratic systems, such as those based on limited
              suﬀrage. For example, the Lockean (i.e. classical liberal or right-wing
              libertarian) ideal of a state based on the rule of property owners is doomed to
              be little more than a regime which oppresses the majority to maintain the
              power and privilege of the wealthy few. Equally, the idea of near universal
              stupidity bar an elite of capitalists (the “objectivist” vision) implies a system
              somewhat less ideal than the perfect system presented in the literature. This
              is because most people would tolerate oppressive bosses who treat them as
              means to an end rather than an end in themselves. For how can you expect
              people to recognise and pursue their own self-interest if you consider them
              fundamentally as the “uncivilised hordes”? You cannot have it both ways and
              the “unknown ideal” of pure capitalism would be as grubby, oppressive and
              alienating as “actually existing” capitalism.
                 As such, anarchists are ﬁrmly convinced that arguments against anarchy
              based on the lack of ability of the mass of people are inherently selfcontradictory (when not blatantly self-servicing). If people are too stupid for
              anarchism then they are too stupid for any system you care to mention.
              Ultimately, anarchists argue that such a perspective simply reﬂects the servile
              mentality produced by a hierarchical society rather than a genuine analysis of
              humanity and our history as a species. To quote Rousseau:
                   “when I see multitudes of entirely naked savages scorn European
                   voluptuousness and endure hunger, ﬁre, the sword, and death to
                   preserve only their independence, I feel that it does not behove

              A.2.18 Do anarchists support terrorism?

## No. This is for three reasons.
                 Terrorism means either targeting or not worrying about killing innocent
              people. For anarchy to exist, it must be created by the mass of people. One
              does not convince people of one’s ideas by blowing them up. Secondly,
              anarchism is about self-liberation. One cannot blow up a social relationship.
              Freedom cannot be created by the actions of an elite few destroying rulers on
              behalf of the majority. Simply put, a “structure based on centuries of history
              cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of explosives.” [Kropotkin, quoted by
              Martin A. Millar, Kropotkin, p. 174] For so long as people feel the need for
              rulers, hierarchy will exist (see section A.2.16 for more on this). As we have
              stressed earlier, freedom cannot be given, only taken. Lastly, anarchism aims
              for freedom. Hence Bakunin’s comment that “when one is carrying out a
              revolution for the liberation of humanity, one should respect the life and
              liberty of men [and women].” [quoted by K.J. Kenaﬁck, Michael Bakunin and
              Karl Marx, p. 125] For anarchists, means determine the ends and terrorism
              by its very nature violates life and liberty of individuals and so cannot be used
              to create an anarchist society. The history of, say, the Russian Revolution,
              conﬁrmed Kropotkin’s insight that ”[v]ery sad would be the future revolution
              if it could only triumph by terror.” [quoted by Millar, Op. Cit., p. 175]
                 Moreover anarchists are not against individuals but the institutions and
              social relationships that cause certain individuals to have power over others
              and abuse (i.e. use) that power. Therefore the anarchist revolution is about
              destroying structures, not people. As Bakunin pointed out, “we wish not to kill
              persons, but to abolish status and its perquisites” and anarchism “does not
              mean the death of the individuals who make up the bourgeoisie, but the death
              of the bourgeoisie as a political and social entity economically distinct from
              the working class.” [The Basic Bakunin, p. 71 and p. 70] In other words,
              “You can’t blow up a social relationship” (to quote the title of an anarchist
              pamphlet which presents the anarchist case against terrorism).
                 How is it, then, that anarchism is associated with violence? Partly this is
              because the state and media insist on referring to terrorists who are not
              anarchists as anarchists. For example, the German Baader-Meinhoﬀ gang
              were often called “anarchists” despite their self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninism.
              Smears, unfortunately, work. Similarly, as Emma Goldman pointed out, “it is a
              known fact known to almost everyone familiar with the Anarchist movement
              that a great number of [violent] acts, for which Anarchists had to suﬀer, either
              originated with the capitalist press or were instigated, if not directly
              perpetrated, by the police.” [Red Emma Speaks, p. 262]
                 An example of this process at work can be seen from the current antiglobalisation movement. In Seattle, for example, the media reported
              “violence” by protestors (particularly anarchist ones) yet this amounted to a
              few broken windows. The much greater actual violence of the police against
              protestors (which, incidentally, started before the breaking of a single
116 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              window) was not considered worthy of comment. Subsequent media coverage
              of anti-globalisation demonstrations followed this pattern, ﬁrmly connecting
              anarchism with violence in spite of that the protesters have been the ones to
              suﬀer the greatest violence at the hands of the state. As anarchist activist
              Starhawk notes, “if breaking windows and ﬁghting back when the cops attack
              is ‘violence,’ then give me a new word, a word a thousand times stronger, to
              use when the cops are beating non-resisting people into comas.” [Staying on
              the Streets, p. 130]
                Similarly, at the Genoa protests in 2001 the mainstream media presented
              the protestors as violent even though it was the state who killed one of them
              and hospitalised many thousands more. The presence of police agent
              provocateurs in creating the violence was unmentioned by the media. As
              Starhawk noted afterwards, in Genoa “we encountered a carefully
              orchestrated political campaign of state terrorism. The campaign included
              disinformation, the use of inﬁltrators and provocateurs, collusion with avowed
              Fascist groups … , the deliberate targeting of non-violent groups for tear gas
              and beating, endemic police brutality, the torture of prisoners, the political
              persecution of organisers … They did all those openly, in a way that indicates
              they had no fear of repercussions and expected political protection from the
              highest sources.” [Op. Cit., pp. 128–9] This was, unsurprisingly, not reported
              by the media.
                Subsequent protests have seen the media indulge in yet more anti-anarchist
              hype, inventing stories to present anarchists are hate-ﬁlled individuals
              planning mass violence. For example, in Ireland in 2004 the media reported
              that anarchists were planning to use poison gas during EU related
              celebrations in Dublin. Of course, evidence of such a plan was not
              forthcoming and no such action happened. Neither did the riot the media said
              anarchists were organising. A similar process of misinformation accompanied
              the anti-capitalist May Day demonstrations in London and the protests against
              the Republican National Congress in New York. In spite of being constantly
              proved wrong after the event, the media always prints the scare stories of
              anarchist violence (even inventing events at, say Seattle, to justify their
              articles and to demonise anarchism further). Thus the myth that anarchism
              equals violence is perpetrated. Needless to say, the same papers that hyped
              the (non-existent) threat of anarchist violence remained silent on the actual
              violence of, and repression by, the police against demonstrators which
              occurred at these events. Neither did they run apologies after their (evidenceless) stories of doom were exposed as the nonsense they were by subsequent
              events.
                This does not mean that Anarchists have not committed acts of violence.
              They have (as have members of other political and religious movements). The
              main reason for the association of terrorism with anarchism is because of the
              “propaganda by the deed” period in the anarchist movement.
                This period — roughly from 1880 to 1900 — was marked by a small number
              of anarchists assassinating members of the ruling class (royalty, politicians
              and so forth). At its worse, this period saw theatres and shops frequented by
              members of the bourgeoisie targeted. These acts were termed “propaganda
              by the deed.” Anarchist support for the tactic was galvanised by the
              assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881 by Russian Populists (this event
117 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              prompted Johann Most’s famous editorial in Freiheit, entitled “At Last!”,
              celebrating regicide and the assassination of tyrants). However, there were
              deeper reasons for anarchist support of this tactic: ﬁrstly, in revenge for acts
              of repression directed towards working class people; and secondly, as a
              means to encourage people to revolt by showing that their oppressors could
              be defeated.
                Considering these reasons it is no coincidence that propaganda by the deed
              began in France after the 20 000-plus deaths due to the French state’s brutal
              suppression of the Paris Commune, in which many anarchists were killed. It is
              interesting to note that while the anarchist violence in revenge for the
              Commune is relatively well known, the state’s mass murder of the
              Communards is relatively unknown. Similarly, it may be known that the Italian
              Anarchist Gaetano Bresci assassinated King Umberto of Italy in 1900 or that
              Alexander Berkman tried to kill Carnegie Steel Corporation manager Henry
              Clay Frick in 1892. What is often unknown is that Umberto’s troops had ﬁred
              upon and killed protesting peasants or that Frick’s Pinkertons had also
              murdered locked-out workers at Homestead.
                Such downplaying of statist and capitalist violence is hardly surprising.
              “The State’s behaviour is violence,” points out Max Stirner, “and it calls its
              violence ‘law’; that of the individual, ‘crime.’” [The Ego and Its Own, p. 197]
              Little wonder, then, that anarchist violence is condemned but the repression
              (and often worse violence) that provoked it ignored and forgotten. Anarchists
              point to the hypocrisy of the accusation that anarchists are “violent” given
              that such claims come from either supporters of government or the actual
              governments themselves, governments “which came into being through
              violence, which maintain themselves in power through violence, and which
              use violence constantly to keep down rebellion and to bully other nations.”
              [Howard Zinn, The Zinn Reader, p. 652]
                We can get a feel of the hypocrisy surrounding condemnation of anarchist
              violence by non-anarchists by considering their response to state violence. For
              example, many capitalist papers and individuals in the 1920s and 1930s
              celebrated Fascism as well as Mussolini and Hitler. Anarchists, in contrast,
              fought Fascism to the death and tried to assassinate both Mussolini and
              Hitler. Obviously supporting murderous dictatorships is not “violence” and
              “terrorism” but resisting such regimes is! Similarly, non-anarchists can
              support repressive and authoritarian states, war and the suppression of
              strikes and unrest by violence (“restoring law and order”) and not be
              considered “violent.” Anarchists, in contrast, are condemned as “violent” and
              “terrorist” because a few of them tried to revenge such acts of oppression and
              state/capitalist violence! Similarly, it seems the height of hypocrisy for
              someone to denounce the anarchist “violence” which produces a few broken
              windows in, say, Seattle while supporting the actual violence of the police in
              imposing the state’s rule or, even worse, supporting the American invasion of
              Iraq in 2003. If anyone should be considered violent it is the supporter of
              state and its actions yet people do not see the obvious and “deplore the type
              of violence that the state deplores, and applaud the violence that the state
              practises.” [Christie and Meltzer, The Floodgates of Anarchy, p. 132]
                It must be noted that the majority of anarchists did not support this tactic.
              Of those who committed “propaganda by the deed” (sometimes called
118 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              “attentats”), as Murray Bookchin points out, only a “few … were members of
              Anarchist groups. The majority … were soloists.” [The Spanish Anarchists,
              p. 102] Needless to say, the state and media painted all anarchists with the
              same brush. They still do, usually inaccurately (such as blaming Bakunin for
              such acts even though he had been dead years before the tactic was even
              discussed in anarchist circles or by labelling non-anarchist groups
              anarchists!).
                All in all, the “propaganda by the deed” phase of anarchism was a failure, as
              the vast majority of anarchists soon came to see. Kropotkin can be considered
              typical. He “never liked the slogan propaganda by deed, and did not use it
              to describe his own ideas of revolutionary action.” However, in 1879 while
              still “urg[ing] the importance of collective action” he started “expressing
              considerable sympathy and interest in attentats” (these “collective forms of
              action” were seen as acting “at the trade union and communal level”). In 1880
              he “became less preoccupied with collective action and this enthusiasm for
              acts of revolt by individuals and small groups increased.” This did not last and
              Kropotkin soon attached “progressively less importance to isolated acts of
              revolt” particularly once “he saw greater opportunities for developing
              collective action in the new militant trade unionism.” [Caroline Cahm,
              Kropotkin and the Rise of Revolutionary Anarchism, p. 92, p. 115, p.
              129, pp. 129–30, p. 205] By the late 1880s and early 1890s he came to
              disapprove of such acts of violence. This was partly due to simple revulsion at
              the worse of the acts (such as the Barcelona Theatre bombing in response to
              the state murder of anarchists involved in the Jerez uprising of 1892 and
              Emile Henry’s bombing of a cafe in response to state repression) and partly
              due to the awareness that it was hindering the anarchist cause.
                Kropotkin recognised that the “spate of terrorist acts” of the 1880s had
              caused “the authorities into taking repressive action against the movement”
              and were “not in his view consistent with the anarchist ideal and did little or
              nothing to promote popular revolt.” In addition, he was “anxious about the
              isolation of the movement from the masses” which “had increased rather than
              diminished as a result of the preoccupation with” propaganda by deed. He
              “saw the best possibility for popular revolution in the … development of the
              new militancy in the labour movement. From now on he focussed his attention
              increasingly on the importance of revolutionary minorities working among the
              masses to develop the spirit of revolt.” However, even during the early 1880s
              when his support for individual acts of revolt (if not for propaganda by the
              deed) was highest, he saw the need for collective class struggle and,
              therefore, “Kropotkin always insisted on the importance of the labour
              movement in the struggles leading up to the revolution.” [Op. Cit., pp. 205–6,
              p. 208 and p. 280]
                Kropotkin was not alone. More and more anarchists came to see
              “propaganda by the deed” as giving the state an excuse to clamp down on
              both the anarchist and labour movements. Moreover, it gave the media (and
              opponents of anarchism) a chance to associate anarchism with mindless
              violence, thus alienating much of the population from the movement. This
              false association is renewed at every opportunity, regardless of the facts (for
              example, even though Individualist Anarchists rejected “propaganda by the
              deed” totally, they were also smeared by the press as “violent” and

              “terrorists”).
                In addition, as Kropotkin pointed out, the assumption behind propaganda by
              the deed, i.e. that everyone was waiting for a chance to rebel, was false. In
              fact, people are products of the system in which they live; hence they
              accepted most of the myths used to keep that system going. With the failure
              of propaganda by deed, anarchists turned back to what most of the movement
              had been doing anyway: encouraging the class struggle and the process of
              self-liberation. This turn back to the roots of anarchism can be seen from the
              rise in anarcho-syndicalist unions after 1890 (see section A.5.3). This position
              ﬂows naturally from anarchist theory, unlike the idea of individual acts of
              violence:
                   “to bring about a revolution, and specially the Anarchist revolution[,
                   it] is necessary that the people be conscious of their rights and their
                   strength; it is necessary that they be ready to ﬁght and ready to
                   take the conduct of their aﬀairs into their own hands. It must be the
                   constant preoccupation of the revolutionists, the point towards
                   which all their activity must aim, to bring about this state of mind
                   among the masses … Who expects the emancipation of mankind to
                   come, not from the persistent and harmonious co-operation of all
                   men [and women] of progress, but from the accidental or
                   providential happening of some acts of heroism, is not better
                   advised that one who expected it from the intervention of an
                   ingenious legislator or of a victorious general … our ideas oblige us
                   to put all our hopes in the masses, because we do not believe in the
                   possibility of imposing good by force and we do not want to be
                   commanded … Today, that which … was the logical outcome of our
                   ideas, the condition which our conception of the revolution and
                   reorganisation of society imposes on us … [is] to live among the
                   people and to win them over to our ideas by actively taking part in
                   their struggles and suﬀerings.” [Errico Malatesta, “The Duties of
                   the Present Hour”, pp. 181–3, Anarchism, Robert Graham (ed.), pp.
                   180–1]
                Despite most anarchists’ tactical disagreement with propaganda by deed,
              few would consider it to be terrorism or rule out assassination under all
              circumstances. Bombing a village during a war because there might be an
              enemy in it is terrorism, whereas assassinating a murdering dictator or head
              of a repressive state is defence at best and revenge at worst. As anarchists
              have long pointed out, if by terrorism it is meant “killing innocent people”
              then the state is the greatest terrorist of them all (as well as having the
              biggest bombs and other weapons of destruction available on the planet). If
              the people committing “acts of terror” are really anarchists, they would do
              everything possible to avoid harming innocent people and never use the
              statist line that “collateral damage” is regrettable but inevitable. This is why
              the vast majority of “propaganda by the deed” acts were directed towards
              individuals of the ruling class, such as Presidents and Royalty, and were the
              result of previous acts of state and capitalist violence.
                So “terrorist” acts have been committed by anarchists. This is a fact.
              However, it has nothing to do with anarchism as a socio-political theory. As
120 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              Emma Goldman argued, it was “not Anarchism, as such, but the brutal
              slaughter of the eleven steel workers [that] was the urge for Alexander
              Berkman’s act.” [Op. Cit., p. 268] Equally, members of other political and
              religious groups have also committed such acts. As the Freedom Group of
              London argued:
                   “There is a truism that the man [or woman] in the street seems
                   always to forget, when he is abusing the Anarchists, or whatever
                   party happens to be his bete noire for the moment, as the cause of
                   some outrage just perpetrated. This indisputable fact is that
                   homicidal outrages have, from time immemorial, been the reply of
## goaded and desperate classes, and goaded and desperate
                   individuals, to wrongs from their fellowmen [and women], which
                   they felt to be intolerable. Such acts are the violent recoil from
                   violence, whether aggressive or repressive … their cause lies not in
                   any special conviction, but in the depths of .. . human nature itself.
                   The whole course of history, political and social, is strewn with
                   evidence of this.” [quoted by Emma Goldman, Op. Cit., p. 259]
                Terrorism has been used by many other political, social and religious groups
              and parties. For example, Christians, Marxists, Hindus, Nationalists,
              Republicans, Moslems, Sikhs, Fascists, Jews and Patriots have all committed
              acts of terrorism. Few of these movements or ideas have been labelled as
              “terrorist by nature” or continually associated with violence — which shows
              anarchism’s threat to the status quo. There is nothing more likely to discredit
              and marginalise an idea than for malicious and/or ill-informed persons to
              portray those who believe and practice it as “mad bombers” with no opinions
              or ideals at all, just an insane urge to destroy.
                Of course, the vast majority of Christians and so on have opposed terrorism
              as morally repugnant and counter-productive. As have the vast majority of
              anarchists, at all times and places. However, it seems that in our case it is
              necessary to state our opposition to terrorism time and time again.
                So, to summarise — only a small minority of terrorists have ever been
              anarchists, and only a small minority of anarchists have ever been terrorists.
              The anarchist movement as a whole has always recognised that social
              relationships cannot be assassinated or bombed out of existence. Compared
              to the violence of the state and capitalism, anarchist violence is a drop in the
              ocean. Unfortunately most people remember the acts of the few anarchists
              who have committed violence rather than the acts of violence and repression
              by the state and capital that prompted those acts.
              A.2.19 What ethical views do anarchists hold?
                Anarchist viewpoints on ethics vary considerably, although all share a
              common belief in the need for an individual to develop within themselves their
              own sense of ethics. All anarchists agree with Max Stirner that an individual
              must free themselves from the conﬁnes of existing morality and question that
              morality — “I decide whether it is the right thing for me; there is no right
              outside me.” [The Ego and Its Own, p. 189]
121 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                Few anarchists, however, would go so far as Stirner and reject any concept
              of social ethics at all (saying that, Stirner does value some universal concepts
              although they are egoistic ones). Such extreme moral relativism is almost as
              bad as moral absolutism for most anarchists (moral relativism is the view that
              there is no right or wrong beyond what suits an individual while moral
              absolutism is that view that what is right and wrong is independent of what
              individuals think).
                It is often claimed that modern society is breaking up because of excessive
              “egoism” or moral relativism. This is false. As far as moral relativism goes,
              this is a step forward from the moral absolutism urged upon society by
              various Moralists and true-believers because it bases itself, however slimly,
              upon the idea of individual reason. However, as it denies the existence (or
              desirability) of ethics it is but the mirror image of what it is rebelling against.
              Neither option empowers the individual or is liberating.
                Consequently, both of these attitudes hold enormous attraction to
              authoritarians, as a populace that is either unable to form an opinion about
              things (and will tolerate anything) or who blindly follow the commands of the
              ruling elite are of great value to those in power. Both are rejected by most
              anarchists in favour of an evolutionary approach to ethics based upon human
              reason to develop the ethical concepts and interpersonal empathy to
              generalise these concepts into ethical attitudes within society as well as
              within individuals. An anarchistic approach to ethics therefore shares the
              critical individual investigation implied in moral relativism but grounds itself
              into common feelings of right and wrong. As Proudhon argued:
                   “All progress begins by abolishing something; every reform rests
                   upon denunciation of some abuse; each new idea is based upon the
## proved insuﬀiciency of the old idea.”

                Most anarchists take the viewpoint that ethical standards, like life itself, are
              in a constant process of evolution. This leads them to reject the various
              notions of “God’s Law,” “Natural Law,” and so on in favour of a theory of
              ethical development based upon the idea that individuals are entirely
              empowered to question and assess the world around them — in fact, they
              require it in order to be truly free. You cannot be an anarchist and blindly
              accept anything! Michael Bakunin, one of the founding anarchist thinkers,
              expressed this radical scepticism as so:
                   “No theory, no ready-made system, no book that has ever been
                   written will save the world. I cleave to no system. I am a true
## seeker.”

                Any system of ethics which is not based on individual questioning can only
              be authoritarian. Erich Fromm explains why:
                   “Formally, authoritarian ethics denies man’s capacity to know what
                   is good or bad; the norm giver is always an authority transcending
                   the individual. Such a system is based not on reason and knowledge
                   but on awe of the authority and on the subject’s feeling of weakness
                   and dependence; the surrender of decision making to the authority
122 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   results from the latter’s magic power; its decisions can not and must
## not be questioned. Materially, or according to content,
                   authoritarian ethics answers the question of what is good or bad
                   primarily in terms of the interests of the authority, not the interests
                   of the subject; it is exploitative, although the subject may derive
                   considerable beneﬁts, psychic or material, from it.” [Man For
                   Himself, p. 10]
                Therefore Anarchists take, essentially, a scientiﬁc approach to problems.
              Anarchists arrive at ethical judgements without relying on the mythology of
              spiritual aid, but on the merits of their own minds. This is done through logic
              and reason, and is a far better route to resolving moral questions than
              obsolete, authoritarian systems like orthodox religion and certainly better
              than the “there is no wrong or right” of moral relativism.
                So, what are the source of ethical concepts? For Kropotkin, “nature has thus
              to be recognised as the ﬁrst ethical teacher of man. The social instinct,
              innate in men as well as in all the social animals, — this is the origin of all
              ethical conceptions and all subsequent development of morality.” [Ethics, p.
              45]
                Life, in other words, is the basis of anarchist ethics. This means that,
              essentially (according to anarchists), an individual’s ethical viewpoints are
              derived from three basic sources:
                   1) from the society an individual lives in. As Kropotkin pointed out,
                   “Man’s conceptions of morality are completely dependent upon the
                   form that their social life assumed at a given time in a given locality
                   … this [social life] is reﬂected in the moral conceptions of men and
                   in the moral teachings of the given epoch.” [Op. Cit., p. 315] In
## other words, experience of life and of living.

                   2) A critical evaluation by individuals of their society’s ethical
                   norms, as indicated above. This is the core of Erich Fromm’s
                   argument that “Man must accept the responsibility for himself and
                   the fact that only using his own powers can he give meaning to his
## life …there is no meaning to life except the meaning man
## gives his life by the unfolding of his powers, by living
                   productively.” [Man for Himself, p. 45] In other words, individual
## thought and development.

                   3) The feeling of empathy — “the true origin of the moral sentiment
                   .. . [is] simply in the feeling of sympathy.” [“Anarchist Morality”,
                   Anarchism, p. 94] In other words, an individual’s ability to feel and
## share experiences and concepts with others.

                This last factor is very important for the development of a sense of ethics.
              As Kropotkin argued, ”[t]he more powerful your imagination, the better you
              can picture to yourself what any being feels when it is made to suﬀer, and the
              more intense and delicate will your moral sense be.. . And the more you are
              accustomed by circumstances, by those surrounding you, or by the intensity
              of your own thought and your imagination, to act as your own thought and
123 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              imagination urge, the more will the moral sentiment grow in you, the more
              will it became habitual.” [Op. Cit., p. 95]
                 So, anarchism is based (essentially) upon the ethical maxim “treat others as
              you would like them to treat you under similar circumstances.” Anarchists are
              neither egoists nor altruists when it come to moral stands, they are simply
              human.
                 As Kropotkin noted, “egoism” and “altruism” both have their roots in the
              same motive — “however great the diﬀerence between the two actions in
              their result of humanity, the motive is the same. It is the quest for pleasure.”
              [Op. Cit., p. 85]
                 For anarchists, a person’s sense of ethics must be developed by themselves
              and requires the full use of an individual’s mental abilities as part of a social
              grouping, as part of a community. As capitalism and other forms of authority
              weaken the individual’s imagination and reduce the number of outlets for
              them to exercise their reason under the dead weight of hierarchy as well as
              disrupting community, little wonder that life under capitalism is marked by a
              stark disregard for others and lack of ethical behaviour.
                 Combined with these factors is the role played by inequality within society.
              Without equality, there can be no real ethics for “Justice implies Equality…
              only those who consider others as their equals can obey the rule: ‘Do not do
              to others what you do not wish them to do to you.’ A serf-owner and a slave
              merchant can evidently not recognise … the ‘categorial imperative’ [of
              treating people as ends in themselves and not as means] as regards serfs [or
              slaves] because they do not look upon them as equals.” Hence the “greatest
              obstacle to the maintenance of a certain moral level in our present societies
              lies in the absence of social equality. Without real equality, the sense of
              justice can never be universally developed, because Justice implies the
              recognition of Equality.” [Peter Kropotkin, Evolution and Environment,
              p. 88 and p. 79]
                 Capitalism, like any society, gets the ethical behaviour it deserves..
                 In a society which moves between moral relativism and absolutism it is little
              wonder that egoism becomes confused with egotism. By disempowering
              individuals from developing their own ethical ideas and instead encouraging
              blind obedience to external authority (and so moral relativism once
              individuals think that they are without that authority’s power), capitalist
              society ensures an impoverishment of individuality and ego. As Erich Fromm
              puts it:

## “The failure of modern culture lies not in its principle of
                   individualism, not in the idea that moral virtue is the same as the
                   pursuit of self-interest, but in the deterioration of the meaning of
                   self-interest; not in the fact that people are too much concerned
                   with their self-interest, but that they are not concerned enough
                   with the interest of their real self; not in the fact that they
## are too selﬁsh, but that they do not love themselves.” [Man
                   for Himself, p. 139]
                Therefore, strictly speaking, anarchism is based upon an egoistic frame of
              reference — ethical ideas must be an expression of what gives us pleasure as
              a whole individual (both rational and emotional, reason and empathy). This
124 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              leads all anarchists to reject the false division between egoism and altruism
              and recognise that what many people (for example, capitalists) call “egoism”
              results in individual self-negation and a reduction of individual self-interest.
              As Kropotkin argues:
                   “What was it that morality, evolving in animal and human societies,
                   was striving for, if not for the opposition to the promptings of
                   narrow egoism, and bringing up humanity in the spirit of the
## development of altruism? The very expressions ‘egoism’ and
                   ‘altruism’ are incorrect, because there can be no pure altruism
                   without an admixture of personal pleasure — and consequently,
                   without egoism. It would therefore be more nearly correct to say
                   that ethics aims at the development of social habits and the
                   weakening of the narrowly personal habits. These last make the
                   individual lose sight of society through his regard for his own
                   person, and therefore they even fail to attain their object, i.e. the
                   welfare of the individual, whereas the development of habits of work
                   in common, and of mutual aid in general, leads to a series of
                   beneﬁcial consequences in the family as well as society.” [Ethics,
                   pp. 307–8]
                 Therefore anarchism is based upon the rejection of moral absolutism (i.e.
              “God’s Law,” “Natural Law,” “Man’s Nature,” “A is A”) and the narrow egotism
              which moral relativism so easily lends itself to. Instead, anarchists recognise
              that there exists concepts of right and wrong which exist outside of an
              individual’s evaluation of their own acts.
                 This is because of the social nature of humanity. The interactions between
              individuals do develop into a social maxim which, according to Kropotkin, can
              be summarised as ”[i]s it useful to society? Then it is good. Is it hurtful? Then
              it is bad.” Which acts human beings think of as right or wrong is not, however,
              unchanging and the “estimate of what is useful or harmful … changes, but the
              foundation remains the same.” [“Anarchist Morality”, Op. Cit., p. 91 and p.
              92]
                 This sense of empathy, based upon a critical mind, is the fundamental basis
              of social ethics — the ‘what-should-be’ can be seen as an ethical criterion for
              the truth or validity of an objective ‘what-is.’ So, while recognising the root of
              ethics in nature, anarchists consider ethics as fundamentally a human idea —
              the product of life, thought and evolution created by individuals and
              generalised by social living and community.
                 So what, for anarchists, is unethical behaviour? Essentially anything that
              denies the most precious achievement of history: the liberty, uniqueness and
              dignity of the individual.
                 Individuals can see what actions are unethical because, due to empathy,
              they can place themselves into the position of those suﬀering the behaviour.
              Acts which restrict individuality can be considered unethical for two
              (interrelated) reasons.
                 Firstly, the protection and development of individuality in all enriches the
              life of every individual and it gives pleasure to individuals because of the
              diversity it produces. This egoist basis of ethics reinforces the second (social)
              reason, namely that individuality is good for society for it enriches the
125 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              community and social life, strengthening it and allowing it to grow and evolve.
              As Bakunin constantly argued, progress is marked by a movement from “the
              simple to the complex” or, in the words of Herbert Read, it “is measured by
              the degree of diﬀerentiation within a society. If the individual is a unit in a
              corporate mass, his [or her] life will be limited, dull, and mechanical. If the
              individual is a unit on his [or her] own, with space and potentiality for
              separate action …he can develop — develop in the only real meaning of the
              word — develop in consciousness of strength, vitality, and joy.” [“The
              Philosophy of Anarchism,” Anarchy and Order, p. 37]
                This defence of individuality is learned from nature. In an ecosystem,
              diversity is strength and so biodiversity becomes a source of basic ethical
              insight. In its most basic form, it provides a guide to “help us distinguish
              which of our actions serve the thrust of natural evolution and which of them
              impede them.” [Murray Bookchin, The Ecology of Freedom, p. 442]
                So, the ethical concept “lies in the feeling of sociality, inherent in the entire
              animal world and in the conceptions of equity, which constitutes one of the
              fundamental primary judgements of human reason.” Therefore anarchists
              embrace “the permanent presence of a double tendency — towards greater
              development on the one side, of sociality, and, on the other side, of a
              consequent increase of the intensity of life which results in an increase of
              happiness for the individuals, and in progress — physical, intellectual, and
              moral.” [Kropotkin, Ethics, pp. 311–2 and pp. 19–20]
                Anarchist attitudes to authority, the state, capitalism, private property and
              so on all come from our ethical belief that the liberty of individuals is of prime
              concern and that our ability to empathise with others, to see ourselves in
              others (our basic equality and common individuality, in other words).
                Thus anarchism combines the subjective evaluation by individuals of a given
              set of circumstances and actions with the drawing of objective interpersonal
              conclusions of these evaluations based upon empathic bounds and discussion
              between equals. Anarchism is based on a humanistic approach to ethical
              ideas, one that evolves along with society and individual development. Hence
              an ethical society is one in which ”[d]iﬀerence among people will be
              respected, indeed fostered, as elements that enrich the unity of experience
              and phenomenon … [the diﬀerent] will be conceived of as individual parts of a
              whole all the richer because of its complexity.” [Murray Bookchin, Post
              Scarcity Anarchism, p. 82]
              A.2.20 Why are most anarchists atheists?
                It is a fact that most anarchists are atheists. They reject the idea of god and
              oppose all forms of religion, particularly organised religion. Today, in
              secularised western European countries, religion has lost its once dominant
              place in society. This often makes the militant atheism of anarchism seem
              strange. However, once the negative role of religion is understood the
              importance of libertarian atheism becomes obvious. It is because of the role of
              religion and its institutions that anarchists have spent some time refuting the
              idea of religion as well as propagandising against it.
                So why do so many anarchists embrace atheism? The simplest answer is
126 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              that most anarchists are atheists because it is a logical extension of anarchist
              ideas. If anarchism is the rejection of illegitimate authorities, then it follows
              that it is the rejection of the so-called Ultimate Authority, God. Anarchism is
              grounded in reason, logic, and scientiﬁc thinking, not religious thinking.
              Anarchists tend to be sceptics, and not believers. Most anarchists consider
              the Church to be steeped in hypocrisy and the Bible a work of ﬁction, riddled
              with contradictions, absurdities and horrors. It is notorious in its debasement
              of women and its sexism is infamous. Yet men are treated little better.
              Nowhere in the bible is there an acknowledgement that human beings have
              inherent rights to life, liberty, happiness, dignity, fairness, or self-government.
              In the bible, humans are sinners, worms, and slaves (ﬁguratively and literally,
              as it condones slavery). God has all the rights, humanity is nothing.
                This is unsurprisingly, given the nature of religion. Bakunin put it best:

## "The idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and
                   justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and
                   necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, both in theory and
## in practice.

## “Unless, then, we desire the enslavement and degradation of
                   mankind .. . we may not, must not make the slightest concession
                   either to the God of theology or to the God of metaphysics. He who,
                   in this mystical alphabet, begins with A will inevitably end with Z;
                   he who desires to worship God must harbour no childish illusions
                   about the matter, but bravely renounce his liberty and humanity.
                   “If God is, man is a slave; now, man can and must be free; then, God
                   does not exist.” [God and the State, p. 25]
                For most anarchists, then, atheism is required due to the nature of religion.
              “To proclaim as divine all that is grand, just, noble, and beautiful in
              humanity,” Bakunin argued, “is to tacitly admit that humanity of itself would
              have been unable to produce it — that is, that, abandoned to itself, its own
              nature is miserable, iniquitous, base, and ugly. Thus we come back to the
              essence of all religion — in other words, to the disparagement of humanity for
              the greater glory of divinity.” As such, to do justice to our humanity and the
              potential it has, anarchists argue that we must do without the harmful myth of
              god and all it entails and so on behalf of “human liberty, dignity, and
              prosperity, we believe it our duty to recover from heaven the goods which it
              has stolen and return them to earth.” [Op. Cit., p. 37 and p. 36]
                As well as the theoretical degrading of humanity and its liberty, religion has
              other, more practical, problems with it from an anarchist point of view. Firstly,
              religions have been a source of inequality and oppression. Christianity (like
              Islam), for example, has always been a force for repression whenever it holds
              any political or social sway (believing you have a direct line to god is a sure
              way of creating an authoritarian society). The Church has been a force of
              social repression, genocide, and the justiﬁcation for every tyrant for nearly
              two millennia. When given the chance it has ruled as cruelly as any monarch
              or dictator. This is unsurprising:

                   “God being everything, the real world and man are nothing. God
                   being truth, justice, goodness, beauty, power and life, man is
                   falsehood, iniquity, evil, ugliness, impotence, and death. God being
                   master, man is the slave. Incapable of ﬁnding justice, truth, and
                   eternal life by his own eﬀort, he can attain them only through a
                   divine revelation. But whoever says revelation, says revealers,
                   messiahs, prophets, priests, and legislators inspired by God himself;
                   and these, as the holy instructors of humanity, chosen by God
                   himself to direct it in the path of salvation, necessarily exercise
                   absolute power. All men owe them passive and unlimited obedience;
                   for against the divine reason there is no human reason, and against
                   the justice of God no terrestrial justice holds.” [Bakunin, Op. Cit., p.
                   24]
                Christianity has only turned tolerant and peace-loving when it is powerless
              and even then it has continued its role as apologist for the powerful. This is
              the second reason why anarchists oppose the church for when not being the
              source of oppression, the church has justiﬁed it and ensured its continuation.
              It has kept the working class in bondage for generations by sanctioning the
              rule of earthly authorities and teaching working people that it is wrong to
              ﬁght against those same authorities. Earthly rulers received their
              legitimisation from the heavenly lord, whether political (claiming that rulers
              are in power due to god’s will) or economic (the rich having been rewarded by
              god). The bible praises obedience, raising it to a great virtue. More recent
              innovations like the Protestant work ethic also contribute to the subjugation
              of working people.
                That religion is used to further the interests of the powerful can quickly be
              seen from most of history. It conditions the oppressed to humbly accept their
              place in life by urging the oppressed to be meek and await their reward in
              heaven. As Emma Goldman argued, Christianity (like religion in general)
              “contains nothing dangerous to the regime of authority and wealth; it stands
              for self-denial and self-abnegation, for penance and regret, and is absolutely
              inert in the face of every [in]dignity, every outrage imposed upon mankind.”
              [Red Emma Speaks, p. 234]
                Thirdly, religion has always been a conservative force in society. This is
              unsurprising, as it bases itself not on investigation and analysis of the real
              world but rather in repeating the truths handed down from above and
              contained in a few holy books. Theism is then “the theory of speculation”
              while atheism is “the science of demonstration.” The “one hangs in the
              metaphysical clouds of the Beyond, while the other has its roots ﬁrmly in the
              soil. It is the earth, not heaven, which man must rescue if he is truly to be
              saved.” Atheism, then, “expresses the expansion and growth of the human
              mind” while theism “is static and ﬁxed.” It is “the absolutism of theism, its
              pernicious inﬂuence upon humanity, its paralysing eﬀect upon thought and
              action, which Atheism is ﬁghting with all its power.” [Emma Goldman, Op.
              Cit., p. 243, p. 245 and pp. 246–7]
                As the Bible says, “By their fruits shall ye know them.” We anarchists agree
              but unlike the church we apply this truth to religion as well. That is why we
              are, in the main, atheists. We recognise the destructive role played by the
128 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              Church, and the harmful eﬀects of organised monotheism, particularly
              Christianity, on people. As Goldman summaries, religion “is the conspiracy of
              ignorance against reason, of darkness against light, of submission and slavery
              against independence and freedom; of the denial of strength and beauty,
              against the aﬀirmation of the joy and glory of life.” [Op. Cit., p. 240]
                 So, given the fruits of the Church, anarchists argue that it is time to uproot
              it and plant new trees, the trees of reason and liberty.
                 That said, anarchists do not deny that religions contain important ethical
              ideas or truths. Moreover, religions can be the base for strong and loving
              communities and groups. They can oﬀer a sanctuary from the alienation and
              oppression of everyday life and oﬀer a guide to action in a world where
              everything is for sale. Many aspects of, say, Jesus’ or Buddha’s life and
              teachings are inspiring and worth following. If this were not the case, if
              religions were simply a tool of the powerful, they would have long ago been
              rejected. Rather, they have a dual-nature in that contain both ideas necessary
              to live a good life as well as apologetics for power. If they did not, the
              oppressed would not believe and the powerful would suppress them as
              dangerous heresies.
                 And, indeed, repression has been the fate of any group that has preached a
              radical message. In the middle ages numerous revolutionary Christian
              movements and sects were crushed by the earthly powers that be with the
              ﬁrm support of the mainstream church. During the Spanish Civil War the
              Catholic church supported Franco’s fascists, denouncing the killing of proFranco priests by supporters of the republic while remaining silent about
              Franco’s murder of Basque priests who had supported the democratically
              elected government (Pope John Paul II is seeking to turn the dead pro-Franco
              priests into saints while the pro-Republican priests remain unmentioned). The
              Archbishop of El Salvador, Oscar Arnulfo Romero, started out as a
              conservative but after seeing the way in which the political and economic
              powers were exploiting the people became their outspoken champion. He was
              assassinated by right-wing paramilitaries in 1980 because of this, a fate which
              has befallen many other supporters of liberation theology, a radical
              interpretation of the Gospels which tries to reconcile socialist ideas and
              Christian social thinking.
                 Nor does the anarchist case against religion imply that religious people do
              not take part in social struggles to improve society. Far from it. Religious
              people, including members of the church hierarchy, played a key role in the
              US civil rights movement of the 1960s. The religious belief within Zapata’s
              army of peasants during the Mexican revolution did not stop anarchists taking
              part in it (indeed, it had already been heavily inﬂuenced by the ideas of
              anarchist militant Ricardo Flores Magon). It is the dual-nature of religion
              which explains why many popular movements and revolts (particularly by
              peasants) have used the rhetoric of religion, seeking to keep the good aspects
              of their faith will ﬁghting the earthly injustice its oﬀicial representatives
              sanctify. For anarchists, it is the willingness to ﬁght against injustice which
              counts, not whether someone believes in god or not. We just think that the
              social role of religion is to dampen down revolt, not encourage it. The tiny
              number of radical priests compared to those in the mainstream or on the right
              suggests the validity of our analysis.
129 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                It should be stressed that anarchists, while overwhelmingly hostile to the
              idea of the Church and an established religion, do not object to people
              practising religious belief on their own or in groups, so long as that practice
              doesn’t impinge on the liberties of others. For example, a cult that required
              human sacriﬁce or slavery would be antithetical to anarchist ideas, and would
              be opposed. But peaceful systems of belief could exist in harmony within in
              anarchist society. The anarchist view is that religion is a personal matter,
              above all else — if people want to believe in something, that’s their business,
              and nobody else’s as long as they do not impose those ideas on others. All we
              can do is discuss their ideas and try and convince them of their errors.
                To end, it should noted that we are not suggesting that atheism is somehow
              mandatory for an anarchist. Far from it. As we discuss in section A.3.7, there
              are anarchists who do believe in god or some form of religion. For example,
              Tolstoy combined libertarian ideas with a devote Christian belief. His ideas,
              along with Proudhon’s, inﬂuences the Catholic Worker organisation, founded
              by anarchists Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933 and still active today.
              The anarchist activist Starhawk, active in the current anti-globalisation
              movement, has no problems also being a leading Pagan. However, for most
              anarchists, their ideas lead them logically to atheism for, as Emma Goldman
              put it, “in its negation of gods is at the same time the strongest aﬀirmation of
              man, and through man, the eternal yea to life, purpose, and beauty.” [Red
              Emma Speaks, p. 248]
              A.3 What types of anarchism are there?
                One thing that soon becomes clear to any one interested in anarchism is
              that there is not one single form of anarchism. Rather, there are diﬀerent
              schools of anarchist thought, diﬀerent types of anarchism which have many
              disagreements with each other on numerous issues. These types are usually
              distinguished by tactics and/or goals, with the latter (the vision of a free
              society) being the major division.
                This means that anarchists, while all sharing a few key ideas, can be
              grouped into broad categories, depending on the economic arrangements that
              they consider to be most suitable to human freedom. However, all types of
              anarchists share a basic approach. To quote Rudolf Rocker:
                   “In common with the founders of Socialism, Anarchists demand the
                   abolition of all economic monopolies and the common ownership of
                   the soil and all other means of production, the use of which must be
                   available to all without distinction; for personal and social freedom
                   is conceivable only on the basis of equal economic advantages for
                   everybody. Within the Socialist movement itself the Anarchists
                   represent the viewpoint that the war against capitalism must be at
                   the same time a war against all institutions of political power, for in
                   history economic exploitation has always gone hand in hand with
                   political and social oppression. The exploitation of man by man and
                   the domination of man over man are inseparable, and each is the
                   condition of the other.” [Anarcho-Syndicalism, pp. 62–3]
130 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                It is within this general context that anarchists disagree. The main
              diﬀerences are between “individualist” and “social” anarchists, although
              the economic arrangements each desire are not mutually exclusive. Of the
              two, social anarchists (communist-anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists and so on)
              have always been the vast majority, with individualist anarchism being
              restricted mostly to the United States. In this section we indicate the
              diﬀerences between these main trends within the anarchist movement. As will
              soon become clear, while social and individualist anarchists both oppose the
              state and capitalism, they disagree on the nature of a free society (and how to
              get there). In a nutshell, social anarchists prefer communal solutions to social
              problems and a communal vision of the good society (i.e. a society that
              protects and encourages individual freedom). Individualist anarchists, as their
              name suggests, prefer individual solutions and have a more individualistic
              vision of the good society. However, we must not let these diﬀerence cloud
              what both schools have in common, namely a desire to maximise individual
              freedom and end state and capitalist domination and exploitation.
                In addition to this major disagreement, anarchists also disagree over such
              issues as syndicalism, paciﬁsm, “lifestylism,” animal rights and a whole host
              of other ideas, but these, while important, are only diﬀerent aspects of
              anarchism. Beyond a few key ideas, the anarchist movement (like life itself) is
              in a constant state of change, discussion and thought — as would be expected
              in a movement that values freedom so highly.
                The most obvious thing to note about the diﬀerent types of anarchism is
              that ”[n]one are named after some Great Thinker; instead, they are invariably
              named either after some kind of practice, or, most often, organisational
              principle … Anarchists like to distinguish themselves by what they do, and
              how they organise themselves to go about doing it.” [David Graeber,
              Fragments of An Anarchist Anthropology, p. 5] This does not mean that
              anarchism does not have individuals who have contributed signiﬁcantly to
              anarchist theory. Far from it, as can be seen in section A.4 there are many
              such people. Anarchists simply recognise that to call your theory after an
              individual is a kind of idolatry. Anarchists know that even the greatest thinker
              is only human and, consequently, can make mistakes, fail to live up to their
              ideals or have a partial understanding of certain issues (see section H.2 for
              more discussion on this). Moreover, we see that the world changes and,
              obviously, what was a suitable practice or programme in, say, industrialising
              France of the 1840s may have its limitations in 21st century France!
                Consequently, it is to be expected that a social theory like anarchism would
              have numerous schools of thought and practice associated with it. Anarchism,
              as we noted in section A.5, has its roots in the struggles of working class
              people against oppression. Anarchist ideas have developed in many diﬀerent
              social situations and, consequently, have reﬂected those circumstances. Most
              obviously, individualist anarchism initially developed in pre-industrial America
              and as a result has a diﬀerent perspective on many issues than social
              anarchism. As America changed, going from a predominantly pre-capitalist
              rural society to an industrialised capitalist one, American anarchism changed:
                   “Originally the American movement, the native creation which arose
                   with Josiah Warren in 1829, was purely individualistic; the student

                   of economy will easily understand the material and historical causes
## for such development. But within the last twenty years the
                   communist idea has made great progress, owning primarily to that
## concentration in capitalist production which has driven the
                   American workingman [and woman] to grasp at the idea of
                   solidarity, and, secondly, to the expulsion of active communist
                   propagandists from Europe.” [Voltairine de Cleyre, The Voltairine
                   de Cleyre Reader, p. 110]
                Thus rather than the numerous types of anarchism being an expression of
              some sort of “incoherence” within anarchism, it simply shows a movement
              which has its roots in real life rather than the books of long dead thinkers. It
              also shows a healthy recognition that people are diﬀerent and that one
              person’s dream may be another’s nightmare and that diﬀerent tactics and
              organisations may be required at diﬀerent social periods and struggles. So
              while anarchists have their preferences on how they think a free society will,
              in general, be like and be created they are aware that other forms of
              anarchism and libertarian tactics may be more suitable for other people and
              social circumstances. However, just because someone calls themselves or
              their theory anarchism does not make it so. Any genuine type of anarchism
              must share the fundamental perspectives of the movement, in other words be
              anti-state and anti-capitalist.
                Moreover, claims of anarchist “incoherence” by its critics are usually
              overblown. After all, being followers of Marx and/or Lenin has not stopped
              Marxists from splitting into numerous parties, groups and sects. Nor has it
              stopped sectarian conﬂict between them based on whose interpretation of the
              holy writings are the “correct” ones or who has used the “correct” quotes to
              bolster attempts to adjust their ideas and practice to a world signiﬁcantly
              diﬀerent from Europe in the 1850s or Russia in the 1900s. At least anarchists
              are honest about their diﬀerences!
                Lastly, to put our cards on the table, the writers of this FAQ place
              themselves ﬁrmly in the “social” strand of anarchism. This does not mean that
              we ignore the many important ideas associated with individualist anarchism,
              only that we think social anarchism is more appropriate for modern society,
              that it creates a stronger base for individual freedom, and that it more closely
              reﬂects the sort of society we would like to live in.
              A.3.1 What are the diﬀerences between individualist
              and social anarchists?
                While there is a tendency for individuals in both camps to claim that the
              proposals of the other camp would lead to the creation of some kind of state,
              the diﬀerences between individualists and social anarchists are not very
              great. Both are anti-state, anti-authority and anti-capitalist. The major
              diﬀerences are twofold.
                The ﬁrst is in regard to the means of action in the here and now (and so the
              manner in which anarchy will come about). Individualists generally prefer
              education and the creation of alternative institutions, such as mutual banks,

              unions, communes, etc. They usually support strikes and other non-violent
              forms of social protest (such as rent strikes, the non-payment of taxes and so
              on). Such activity, they argue, will ensure that present society will gradually
              develop out of government into an anarchist one. They are primarily
              evolutionists, not revolutionists, and dislike social anarchists’ use of direct
              action to create revolutionary situations. They consider revolution as being in
              contradiction to anarchist principles as it involves the expropriation of
              capitalist property and, therefore, authoritarian means. Rather they seek to
              return to society the wealth taken out of society by property by means of an
              new, alternative, system of economics (based around mutual banks and cooperatives). In this way a general “social liquidation” would be rendered easy,
              with anarchism coming about by reform and not by expropriation.
                Most social anarchists recognise the need for education and to create
              alternatives (such as libertarian unions), but most disagree that this is enough
              in itself. They do not think capitalism can be reformed piece by piece into
              anarchy, although they do not ignore the importance of reforms by social
              struggle that increase libertarian tendencies within capitalism. Nor do they
              think revolution is in contradiction with anarchist principles as it is not
              authoritarian to destroy authority (be it state or capitalist). Thus the
              expropriation of the capitalist class and the destruction of the state by social
              revolution is a libertarian, not authoritarian, act by its very nature as it is
              directed against those who govern and exploit the vast majority. In short,
              social anarchists are usually evolutionists and revolutionists, trying to
              strengthen libertarian tendencies within capitalism while trying to abolish
              that system by social revolution. However, as some social anarchists are
              purely evolutionists too, this diﬀerence is not the most important one dividing
              social anarchists from individualists.
                The second major diﬀerence concerns the form of anarchist economy
              proposed. Individualists prefer a market-based system of distribution to the
              social anarchists need-based system. Both agree that the current system of
              capitalist property rights must be abolished and that use rights must replace
              property rights in the means of life (i.e. the abolition of rent, interest and
              proﬁts — “usury,” to use the individualist anarchists’ preferred term for this
              unholy trinity). In eﬀect, both schools follow Proudhon’s classic work What is
              Property? and argue that possession must replace property in a free society
              (see section B.3 for a discussion of anarchist viewpoints on property). Thus
              property “will lose a certain attribute which sanctiﬁes it now. The absolute
              ownership of it — ‘the right to use or abuse’ — will be abolished, and
              possession, use, will be the only title. It will be seen how impossible it would
              be for one person to ‘own’ a million acres of land, without a title deed, backed
              by a government ready to protect the title at all hazards.” [Lucy Parsons,
              Freedom, Equality & Solidarity, p. 33
                However, within this use-rights framework, the two schools of anarchism
              propose diﬀerent systems. The social anarchist generally argues for
              communal (or social) ownership and use. This would involve social ownership
              of the means of production and distribution, with personal possessions
              remaining for things you use, but not what was used to create them. Thus
              “your watch is your own, but the watch factory belongs to the people.” “Actual
              use,” continues Berkman, “will be considered the only title — not to
133 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              ownership but to possession. The organisation of the coal miners, for
              example, will be in charge of the coal mines, not as owners but as the
              operating agency … Collective possession, co-operatively managed in the
              interests of the community, will take the place of personal ownership privately
              conducted for proﬁt.” [What is Anarchism?, p. 217]
                 This system would be based on workers’ self-management of their work and
              (for most social anarchists) the free sharing of the product of that labour (i.e.
              an economic system without money). This is because “in the present state of
              industry, when everything is interdependent, when each branch of production
              is knit up with all the rest, the attempt to claim an individualist origin for the
              products of industry is untenable.” Given this, it is impossible to “estimate the
              share of each in the riches which all contribute to amass” and, moreover, the
              “common possession of the instruments of labour must necessarily bring with
              it the enjoyment in common of the fruits of common labour.” [Kropotkin, The
              Conquest of Bread, p. 45 and p. 46] By this social anarchists simply mean
              that the social product which is produced by all would be available to all and
              each individual who has contributed productively to society can take what
              they need (how quickly we can reach such an ideal is a moot point, as we
              discuss in section I.2.2). Some social anarchists, like mutualists for example,
              are against such a system of libertarian (or free) communism, but, in general,
              the vast majority of social anarchists look forward to the end of money and,
              therefore, of buying and selling. All agree, however, that anarchy will see
              “Capitalistic and proprietary exploitation stopped everywhere” and “the wage
              system abolished” whether by “equal and just exchange” (like Proudhon) or
              by the free sharing (like Kropotkin). [Proudhon, The General Idea of the
              Revolution, p. 281]
                 In contrast, the individualist anarchist (like the mutualist) denies that this
              system of use-rights should include the product of the workers labour. Instead
              of social ownership, individualist anarchists propose a more market based
              system in which workers would possess their own means of production and
              exchange the product of their labour freely with other workers. They argue
              that capitalism is not, in fact, a truly free market. Rather, by means of the
              state, capitalists have placed fetters on the market to create and protect their
              economic and social power (market discipline for the working class, state aid
              for the ruling class in other words). These state created monopolies (of money,
              land, tariﬀs and patents) and state enforcement of capitalist property rights
              are the source of economic inequality and exploitation. With the abolition of
              government, real free competition would result and ensure the end of
              capitalism and capitalist exploitation (see Benjamin Tucker’s essay State
              Socialism and Anarchism for an excellent summary of this argument).
                 The Individualist anarchists argue that the means of production (bar land)
              are the product of individual labour and so they accept that people should be
              able to sell the means of production they use, if they so desire. However, they
              reject capitalist property rights and instead favour an “occupancy and use”
              system. If the means of production, say land, is not in use, it reverts back to
              common ownership and is available to others for use. They think this system,
              called mutualism, will result in workers control of production and the end of
              capitalist exploitation and usury. This is because, logically and practically, a
              regime of “occupancy and use” cannot be squared with wage labour. If a
134 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              workplace needs a group to operate it then it must be owned by the group
              who use it. If one individual claims to own it and it is, in fact, used by more
              than that person then, obviously, “occupancy and use” is violated. Equally, if
              an owner employs others to use the workplace then the boss can appropriate
              the product of the workers’ labour, so violating the maxim that labour should
              receive its full product. Thus the principles of individualist anarchism point to
              anti-capitalist conclusions (see section G.3).
                This second diﬀerence is the most important. The individualist fears being
              forced to join a community and thus losing his or her freedom (including the
              freedom to exchange freely with others). Max Stirner puts this position well
              when he argues that “Communism, by the abolition of all personal property,
              only presses me back still more into dependence on another, to wit, on the
              generality or collectivity … [which is] a condition hindering my free
              movement, a sovereign power over me. Communism rightly revolts against
              the pressure that I experience from individual proprietors; but still more
              horrible is the might that it puts in the hands of the collectivity.” [The Ego
              and Its Own, p. 257] Proudhon also argued against communism, stating that
              the community becomes the proprietor under communism and so capitalism
              and communism are based on property and so authority (see the section
              “Characteristics of communism and of property” in What is Property?). Thus
              the Individualist anarchist argues that social ownership places the individual’s
              freedom in danger as any form of communism subjects the individual to
              society or the commune. They fear that as well as dictating individual
              morality, socialisation would eﬀectively eliminate workers’ control as
              “society” would tell workers what to produce and take the product of their
              labour. In eﬀect, they argue that communism (or social ownership in general)
              would be similar to capitalism, with the exploitation and authority of the boss
              replaced with that of “society.”
                Needless to say, social anarchists disagree. They argue that Stirner’s and
              Proudhon’s comments are totally correct — but only about authoritarian
              communism. As Kropotkin argued, “before and in 1848, the theory [of
              communism] was put forward in such a shape as to fully account for
              Proudhon’s distrust as to its eﬀect upon liberty. The old idea of Communism
              was the idea of monastic communities under the severe rule of elders or of
              men of science for directing priests. The last vestiges of liberty and of
              individual energy would be destroyed, if humanity ever had to go through
              such a communism.” [Act for Yourselves, p. 98] Kropotkin always argued
              that communist-anarchism was a new development and given that it dates
              from the 1870s, Proudhon’s and Stirner’s remarks cannot be considered as
              being directed against it as they could not be familiar with it.
                Rather than subject the individual to the community, social anarchists argue
              that communal ownership would provide the necessary framework to protect
              individual liberty in all aspects of life by abolishing the power of the property
              owner, in whatever form it takes. In addition, rather than abolish all
              individual “property,” communist anarchism acknowledges the importance of
              individual possessions and individual space. Thus we ﬁnd Kropotkin arguing
              against forms of communism that “desire to manage the community after the
              model of a family … [to live] all in the same house and … thus forced to
              continuously meet the same ‘brethren and sisters’ … [it is] a fundamental
135 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              error to impose on all the ‘great family’ instead of trying, on the contrary, to
              guarantee as much freedom and home life to each individual.” [Small
              Communal Experiments and Why They Fail, pp. 8–9] The aim of anarchistcommunism is, to again quote Kropotkin, to place “the product reaped or
              manufactured at the disposal of all, leaving to each the liberty to consume
              them as he pleases in his own home.” [The Place of Anarchism in the
              Evolution of Socialist Thought, p. 7] This ensures individual expression of
              tastes and desires and so individuality — both in consumption and in
              production, as social anarchists are ﬁrm supporters of workers’ selfmanagement.
                Thus, for social anarchists, the Individualist Anarchist opposition to
              communism is only valid for state or authoritarian communism and ignores
              the fundamental nature of communist-anarchism. Communist anarchists do
              not replace individuality with community but rather use community to defend
              individuality. Rather than have “society” control the individual, as the
              Individualist Anarchist fears, social anarchism is based on importance of
              individuality and individual expression:

## “Anarchist Communism maintains that most valuable of all
                   conquests — individual liberty — and moreover extends it and gives
                   it a solid basis — economic liberty — without which political liberty
                   is delusive; it does not ask the individual who has rejected god, the
                   universal tyrant, god the king, and god the parliament, to give unto
                   himself a god more terrible than any of the proceeding — god the
                   Community, or to abdicate upon its altar his [or her] independence,
                   his [or her] will, his [or her] tastes, and to renew the vow of
                   asceticism which he formally made before the cruciﬁed god. It says
                   to him, on the contrary, ‘No society is free so long as the individual
                   is not so! …’” [Op. Cit., pp. 14–15]
                In addition, social anarchists have always recognised the need for voluntary
              collectivisation. If people desire to work by themselves, this is not seen as a
              problem (see Kropotkin’s The Conquest of Bread, p. 61 and Act for
              Yourselves, pp. 104–5 as well as Malatesta’s Errico Malatesta: His Life
              and Ideas, p. 99 and p. 103). This, social anarchists, stress does not in any
              way contradict their principles or the communist nature of their desired
              society as such exceptions are rooted in the “use rights” system both are
              based in (see section I.6.2 for a full discussion). In addition, for social
              anarchists an association exists solely for the beneﬁt of the individuals that
              compose it; it is the means by which people co-operate to meet their common
              needs. Therefore, all anarchists emphasise the importance of free agreement
              as the basis of an anarchist society. Thus all anarchists agree with Bakunin:
                   “Collectivism could only imposed only on slaves, and this kind of
                   collectivism would then be the negation of humanity. In a free
                   community, collectivism can only come about through the pressure
                   of circumstances, not by imposition from above but by a free
## spontaneous movement from below.” [Bakunin on Anarchism, p.
                   200]
136 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                If individualists desire to work for themselves and exchange goods with
              others, social anarchists have no objection. Hence our comments that the two
              forms of anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Social anarchists support the
              right of individuals not to join a commune while Individualist Anarchists
              support the rights of individuals to pool their possessions as they see ﬁt,
              including communistic associations. However, if, in the name of freedom, an
              individual wished to claim property rights so as to exploit the labour of others,
              social anarchists would quickly resist this attempt to recreate statism in the
              name of “liberty.” Anarchists do not respect the “freedom” to be a ruler! In
              the words of Luigi Galleani:
                   “No less sophistical is the tendency of those who, under the
                   comfortable cloak of anarchist individualism, would welcome the
                   idea of domination … But the heralds of domination presume to
                   practice individualism in the name of their ego, over the obedient,
                   resigned, or inert ego of others.” [The End of Anarchism?, p. 40]
                 Moreover, for social anarchists, the idea that the means of production can
              be sold implies that private property could be reintroduced in an anarchist
              society. In a free market, some succeed and others fail. As Proudhon argued,
              in competition victory goes to the strongest. When one’s bargaining power is
              weaker than another then any “free exchange” will beneﬁt the stronger party.
              Thus the market, even a non-capitalist one, will tend to magnify inequalities of
              wealth and power over time rather than equalising them. Under capitalism
              this is more obvious as those with only their labour power to sell are in a
              weaker position than those with capital but individualist anarchism would also
              be aﬀected.
                 Thus, social anarchists argue, much against its will an individualist
              anarchist society would evolve away from fair exchanges back into capitalism.
              If, as seems likely, the “unsuccessful” competitors are forced into
              unemployment they may have to sell their labour to the “successful” in order
              to survive. This would create authoritarian social relationships and the
              domination of the few over the many via “free contracts.” The enforcement of
              such contracts (and others like them), in all likelihood, “opens … the way for
              reconstituting under the heading of ‘defence’ all the functions of the State.”
              [Peter Kropotkin, Anarchism, p. 297]
                 Benjamin Tucker, the anarchist most inﬂuenced by liberalism and free
              market ideas, also faced the problems associated with all schools of abstract
              individualism — in particular, the acceptance of authoritarian social relations
              as an expression of “liberty.” This is due to the similarity of property to the
              state. Tucker argued that the state was marked by two things, aggression and
              “the assumption of authority over a given area and all within it, exercised
              generally for the double purpose of more complete oppression of its subjects
              and extension of its boundaries.” [Instead of a Book, p. 22] However, the
              boss and landlord also has authority over a given area (the property in
              question) and all within it (workers and tenants). The former control the
              actions of the latter just as the state rules the citizen or subject. In other
              words, individual ownership produces the same social relationships as that
              created by the state, as it comes from the same source (monopoly of power
              over a given area and those who use it).

                 Social anarchists argue that the Individualist Anarchists acceptance of
              individual ownership and their individualistic conception of individual
              freedom can lead to the denial of individual freedom by the creation of social
              relationships which are essentially authoritarian/statist in nature. “The
              individualists,” argued Malatesta, “give the greatest importance to an
              abstract concept of freedom and fail to take into account, or dwell on the fact
              that real, concrete freedom is the outcome of solidarity and voluntary cooperation.” [The Anarchist Revolution, p. 16] Thus wage labour, for
              example, places the worker in the same relationship to the boss as citizenship
              places the citizen to the state, namely of one of domination and subjection.
              Similarly with the tenant and the landlord.
                 Such a social relationship cannot help but produce the other aspects of the
              state. As Albert Meltzer points out, this can have nothing but statist
              implications, because “the school of Benjamin Tucker — by virtue of their
              individualism — accepted the need for police to break strikes so as to
              guarantee the employer’s ‘freedom.’ All this school of so-called Individualists
              accept … the necessity of the police force, hence for government, and the
              prime deﬁnition of anarchism is no government.” [Anarchism: Arguments
              For and Against, p. 8] It is partly for this reason social anarchists support
              social ownership as the best means of protecting individual liberty.
                 Accepting individual ownership this problem can only be “got round” by
              accepting, along with Proudhon (the source of many of Tucker’s economic
              ideas), the need for co-operatives to run workplaces that require more than
              one worker. This naturally complements their support for “occupancy and
              use” for land, which would eﬀectively abolish landlords. Without cooperatives, workers will be exploited for “it is well enough to talk of [the
              worker] buying hand tools, or small machinery which can be moved about; but
              what about the gigantic machinery necessary to the operation of a mine, or a
              mill? It requires many to work it. If one owns it, will he not make the others
              pay tribute for using it?” This is because “no man would employ another to
              work for him unless he could get more for his product than he had to pay for
              it, and that being the case, the inevitable course of exchange and re-exchange
              would be that the man having received less than the full amount.”
              [Voltairine de Cleyre, “Why I am an Anarchist”, Exquisite Rebel, p. 61 and p.
              60] Only when the people who use a resource own it can individual ownership
              not result in hierarchical authority or exploitation (i.e. statism/capitalism).
              Only when an industry is co-operatively owned, can the workers ensure that
              they govern themselves during work and can get the full value of the goods
              they make once they are sold.
                 This solution is the one Individualist Anarchists do seem to accept and the
              only one consistent with all their declared principles (as well as anarchism).
              This can be seen when French individualist E. Armand argued that the key
              diﬀerence between his school of anarchism and communist-anarchism is that
              as well as seeing “ownership of the consumer goods representing an
              extension of [the worker’s] personality” it also “regards ownership of the
              means of production and free disposal of his produce as the quintessential
              guarantee of the autonomy of the individual. The understanding is that such
              ownership boils down to the chance to deploy (as individuals, couples, family
              groups, etc.) the requisite plot of soil or machinery of production to meet the
138 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              requirements of the social unit, provided that the proprietor does not transfer
              it to someone else or reply upon the services of someone else in operating it.”
              Thus the individualist anarchist could “defend himself against … the
              exploitation of anyone by one of his neighbours who will set him to work in his
              employ and for his beneﬁt” and “greed, which is to say the opportunity for an
              individual, couple or family group to own more than strictly required for their
              normal upkeep.” [“Mini-Manual of the Anarchist Individualist”, pp. 145–9,
              Anarchism, Robert Graham (ed.), p. 147 and pp. 147–8]
                 The ideas of the American individualist anarchists logically ﬂow to the same
              conclusions. “Occupancy and Use” automatically excludes wage labour and so
              exploitation and oppression. As Wm. Gary Kline correctly points out, the US
              Individualist anarchists “expected a society of largely self-employed workmen
              with no signiﬁcant disparity of wealth between any of them.” [The
              Individualist Anarchists, p. 104] It is this vision of a self-employed society
              that logically ﬂows from their principles which ensures that their ideas are
              truly anarchist. As it is, their belief that their system would ensure the
              elimination of proﬁt, rent and interest place them squarely in the anticapitalist camp alongside social anarchists.
                 Needless to say, social anarchists disagree with individualist anarchism,
              arguing that there are undesirable features of even non-capitalist markets
              which would undermine freedom and equality. Moreover, the development of
              industry has resulted in natural barriers of entry into markets and this not
              only makes it almost impossible to abolish capitalism by competing against it,
              it also makes the possibility of recreating usury in new forms likely. Combine
              this with the diﬀiculty in determining the exact contribution of each worker to
              a product in a modern economy and you see why social anarchists argue that
              the only real solution to capitalism is to ensure community ownership and
              management of the economy. It is this recognition of the developments within
              the capitalist economy which make social anarchists reject individualist
              anarchism in favour of communalising, and so decentralising, production by
              freely associated and co-operative labour on a large-scale rather than just in
              the workplace.
                 For more discussion on the ideas of the Individualist anarchists, and why
              social anarchists reject them, see section G — “Is individualist anarchism
              capitalistic?”
              A.3.2 Are there diﬀerent types of social anarchism?
                Yes. Social anarchism has four major trends — mutualism, collectivism,
              communism and syndicalism. The diﬀerences are not great and simply involve
              diﬀerences in strategy. The one major diﬀerence that does exist is between
              mutualism and the other kinds of social anarchism. Mutualism is based
              around a form of market socialism — workers’ co-operatives exchanging the
              product of their labour via a system of community banks. This mutual bank
              network would be “formed by the whole community, not for the especial
              advantage of any individual or class, but for the beneﬁt of all … [with] no
              interest … exacted on loans, except enough to cover risks and expenses.”
              Such a system would end capitalist exploitation and oppression for by
139 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              “introducing mutualism into exchange and credit we introduce it everywhere,
              and labour will assume a new aspect and become truly democratic.” [Charles
              A. Dana, Proudhon and his “Bank of the People”, pp. 44–45 and p. 45]
                The social anarchist version of mutualism diﬀers from the individualist form
              by having the mutual banks owned by the local community (or commune)
              instead of being independent co-operatives. This would ensure that they
              provided investment funds to co-operatives rather than to capitalistic
              enterprises. Another diﬀerence is that some social anarchist mutualists
              support the creation of what Proudhon termed an “agro-industrial
              federation” to complement the federation of libertarian communities (called
              communes by Proudhon). This is a “confederation … intended to provide
              reciprocal security in commerce and industry” and large scale developments
              such as roads, railways and so on. The purpose of “speciﬁc federal
              arrangements is to protect the citizens of the federated states [sic!] from
              capitalist and ﬁnancial feudalism, both within them and from the outside.”
              This is because “political right requires to be buttressed by economic right.”
              Thus the agro-industrial federation would be required to ensure the anarchist
              nature of society from the destabilising eﬀects of market exchanges (which
              can generate increasing inequalities in wealth and so power). Such a system
              would be a practical example of solidarity, as “industries are sisters; they are
              parts of the same body; one cannot suﬀer without the others sharing in its
              suﬀering. They should therefore federate, not to be absorbed and confused
              together, but in order to guarantee mutually the conditions of common
              prosperity … Making such an agreement will not detract from their liberty; it
              will simply give their liberty more security and force.” [The Principle of
              Federation, p. 70, p. 67 and p. 72]
                The other forms of social anarchism do not share the mutualists support for
              markets, even non-capitalist ones. Instead they think that freedom is best
              served by communalising production and sharing information and products
              freely between co-operatives. In other words, the other forms of social
              anarchism are based upon common (or social) ownership by federations of
              producers’ associations and communes rather than mutualism’s system of
              individual co-operatives. In Bakunin’s words, the “future social organisation
              must be made solely from the bottom upwards, by the free association or
              federation of workers, ﬁrstly in their unions, then in the communes, regions,
              nations and ﬁnally in a great federation, international and universal” and “the
              land, the instruments of work and all other capital may become the collective
              property of the whole of society and be utilised only by the workers, in other
              words by the agricultural and industrial associations.” [Michael Bakunin:
              Selected Writings, p. 206 and p. 174] Only by extending the principle of cooperation beyond individual workplaces can individual liberty be maximised
              and protected (see section I.1.3 for why most anarchists are opposed to
              markets). In this they share some ground with Proudhon, as can be seen. The
              industrial confederations would “guarantee the mutual use of the tools of
              production which are the property of each of these groups and which will by a
              reciprocal contract become the collective property of the whole … federation.
              In this way, the federation of groups will be able to … regulate the rate of
              production to meet the ﬂuctuating needs of society.” [James Guillaume,
              Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 376]
140 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                These anarchists share the mutualists support for workers’ selfmanagement of production within co-operatives but see confederations of
              these associations as being the focal point for expressing mutual aid, not a
              market. Workplace autonomy and self-management would be the basis of any
              federation, for “the workers in the various factories have not the slightest
              intention of handing over their hard-won control of the tools of production to
              a superior power calling itself the ‘corporation.’” [Guillaume, Op. Cit., p. 364]
              In addition to this industry-wide federation, there would also be crossindustry and community confederations to look after tasks which are not
              within the exclusive jurisdiction or capacity of any particular industrial
              federation or are of a social nature. Again, this has similarities to Proudhon’s
              mutualist ideas.
                Social anarchists share a ﬁrm commitment to common ownership of the
              means of production (excluding those used purely by individuals) and reject
              the individualist idea that these can be “sold oﬀ” by those who use them. The
              reason, as noted earlier, is because if this could be done, capitalism and
              statism could regain a foothold in the free society. In addition, other social
              anarchists do not agree with the mutualist idea that capitalism can be
              reformed into libertarian socialism by introducing mutual banking. For them
              capitalism can only be replaced by a free society by social revolution.
                The major diﬀerence between collectivists and communists is over the
              question of “money” after a revolution. Anarcho-communists consider the
              abolition of money to be essential, while anarcho-collectivists consider the
              end of private ownership of the means of production to be the key. As
              Kropotkin noted, collectivist anarchism “express[es] a state of things in which
              all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and
              the free communes, while the ways of retribution [i.e. distribution] of labour,
              communist or otherwise, would be settled by each group for itself.”
              [Anarchism, p. 295] Thus, while communism and collectivism both organise
              production in common via producers’ associations, they diﬀer in how the
              goods produced will be distributed. Communism is based on free consumption
              of all while collectivism is more likely to be based on the distribution of goods
              according to the labour contributed. However, most anarcho-collectivists
              think that, over time, as productivity increases and the sense of community
              becomes stronger, money will disappear. Both agree that, in the end, society
              would be run along the lines suggested by the communist maxim: “From
              each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs.”
              They just disagree on how quickly this will come about (see section I.2.2).
                For anarcho-communists, they think that “communism — at least partial —
              has more chances of being established than collectivism” after a revolution.
              [Op. Cit., p. 298] They think that moves towards communism are essential as
              collectivism “begins by abolishing private ownership of the means of
              production and immediately reverses itself by returning to the system of
              remuneration according to work performed which means the re-introduction
              of inequality.” [Alexander Berkman, What is Anarchism?, p. 230] The
              quicker the move to communism, the less chances of new inequalities
              developing. Needless to say, these positions are not that diﬀerent and, in
              practice, the necessities of a social revolution and the level of political
              awareness of those introducing anarchism will determine which system will

              be applied in each area.
                Syndicalism is the other major form of social anarchism. Anarchosyndicalists, like other syndicalists, want to create an industrial union
              movement based on anarchist ideas. Therefore they advocate decentralised,
              federated unions that use direct action to get reforms under capitalism until
              they are strong enough to overthrow it. In many ways anarcho-syndicalism
              can be considered as a new version of collectivist-anarchism, which also
              stressed the importance of anarchists working within the labour movement
              and creating unions which preﬁgure the future free society.
                Thus, even under capitalism, anarcho-syndicalists seek to create “free
              associations of free producers.” They think that these associations would
              serve as “a practical school of anarchism” and they take very seriously
              Bakunin’s remark that the workers’ organisations must create “not only the
              ideas but also the facts of the future itself” in the pre-revolutionary period.
                Anarcho-syndicalists, like all social anarchists, “are convinced that a
              Socialist economic order cannot be created by the decrees and statutes of a
              government, but only by the solidaric collaboration of the workers with hand
              and brain in each special branch of production; that is, through the taking
              over of the management of all plants by the producers themselves under such
              form that the separate groups, plants, and branches of industry are
              independent members of the general economic organism and systematically
              carry on production and the distribution of the products in the interest of the
              community on the basis of free mutual agreements.” [Rudolf Rocker,
              Anarcho-syndicalism, p. 55]
                Again, like all social anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists see the collective
              struggle and organisation implied in unions as the school for anarchism. As
              Eugene Varlin (an anarchist active in the First International who was
              murdered at the end of the Paris Commune) put it, unions have “the enormous
              advantage of making people accustomed to group life and thus preparing
              them for a more extended social organisation. They accustom people not only
              to get along with one another and to understand one another, but also to
              organise themselves, to discuss, and to reason from a collective perspective.”
              Moreover, as well as mitigating capitalist exploitation and oppression in the
              here and now, the unions also “form the natural elements of the social ediﬁce
              of the future; it is they who can be easily transformed into producers
              associations; it is they who can make the social ingredients and the
              organisation of production work.” [quoted by Julian P. W. Archer, The First
              International in France, 1864–1872, p. 196]
                The diﬀerence between syndicalists and other revolutionary social
              anarchists is slight and purely revolves around the question of anarchosyndicalist unions. Collectivist anarchists agree that building libertarian
              unions is important and that work within the labour movement is essential in
              order to ensure “the development and organisation … of the social (and, by
              consequence, anti-political) power of the working masses.” [Bakunin,
              Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings, p. 197] Communist anarchists
              usually also acknowledge the importance of working in the labour movement
              but they generally think that syndicalistic organisations will be created by
              workers in struggle, and so consider encouraging the “spirit of revolt” as
              more important than creating syndicalist unions and hoping workers will join

              them (of course, anarcho-syndicalists support such autonomous struggle and
              organisation, so the diﬀerences are not great). Communist-anarchists also do
              not place as great an emphasis on the workplace, considering struggles
              within it to be equal in importance to other struggles against hierarchy and
              domination outside the workplace (most anarcho-syndicalists would agree
              with this, however, and often it is just a question of emphasis). A few
              communist-anarchists reject the labour movement as hopelessly reformist in
              nature and so refuse to work within it, but these are a small minority.
                Both communist and collectivist anarchists recognise the need for
              anarchists to unite together in purely anarchist organisations. They think it is
              essential that anarchists work together as anarchists to clarify and spread
              their ideas to others. Syndicalists often deny the importance of anarchist
              groups and federations, arguing that revolutionary industrial and community
              unions are enough in themselves. Syndicalists think that the anarchist and
              union movements can be fused into one, but most other anarchists disagree.
              Non-syndicalists point out the reformist nature of unionism and urge that to
              keep syndicalist unions revolutionary, anarchists must work within them as
              part of an anarchist group or federation. Most non-syndicalists consider the
              fusion of anarchism and unionism a source of potential confusion that would
              result in the two movements failing to do their respective work correctly. For
              more details on anarcho-syndicalism see section J.3.8 (and section J.3.9 on
              why many anarchists reject aspects of it). It should be stressed that nonsyndicalist anarchists do not reject the need for collective struggle and
              organisation by workers (see section H.2.8 on that particular Marxist myth).
                In practice, few anarcho-syndicalists totally reject the need for an anarchist
              federation, while few anarchists are totally anti-syndicalist. For example,
              Bakunin inspired both anarcho-communist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas, and
              anarcho-communists like Kropotkin, Malatesta, Berkman and Goldman were
              all sympathetic to anarcho-syndicalist movements and ideas.
                For further reading on the various types of social anarchism, we would
              recommend the following: mutualism is usually associated with the works of
              Proudhon, collectivism with Bakunin’s, communism with Kropotkin’s,
              Malatesta’s, Goldman’s and Berkman’s. Syndicalism is somewhat diﬀerent, as
              it was far more the product of workers’ in struggle than the work of a
              “famous” name (although this does not stop academics calling George Sorel
              the father of syndicalism, even though he wrote about a syndicalist movement
              that already existed. The idea that working class people can develop their
              own ideas, by themselves, is usually lost on them). However, Rudolf Rocker is
              often considered a leading anarcho-syndicalist theorist and the works of
              Fernand Pelloutier and Emile Pouget are essential reading to understand
              anarcho-syndicalism. For an overview of the development of social anarchism
              and key works by its leading lights, Daniel Guerin’s excellent anthology No
              Gods No Masters cannot be bettered.
              A.3.3 What kinds of green anarchism are there?
                An emphasis on anarchist ideas as a solution to the ecological crisis is a
              common thread in most forms of anarchism today. The trend goes back to the

              late nineteenth century and the works of Peter Kropotkin and Elisee Reclus.
              The latter, for example, argued that a “secret harmony exists between the
              earth and the people whom it nourishes, and when imprudent societies let
              themselves violate this harmony, they always end up regretting it.” Similarly,
              no contemporary ecologist would disagree with his comments that the “truly
              civilised man [and women] understands that his [or her] nature is bound up
              with the interest of all and with that of nature. He [or she] repairs the damage
              caused by his predecessors and works to improve his domain.” [quoted by
              George Woodcock, “Introduction”, Marie Fleming, The Geography of
              Freedom, p. 15]
                 With regards Kropotkin, he argued that an anarchist society would be based
              on a confederation of communities that would integrate manual and brain
              work as well as decentralising and integrating industry and agriculture (see
              his classic work Fields, Factories, and Workshops). This idea of an
              economy in which “small is beautiful” (to use the title of E.F. Schumacher’s
              Green classic) was proposed nearly 70 years before it was taken up by what
              was to become the green movement. In addition, in Mutual Aid Kropotkin
              documented how co-operation within species and between them and their
              environment is usually of more beneﬁt to them than competition. Kropotkin’s
              work, combined with that of William Morris, the Reclus brothers (both of
              whom, like Kropotkin, were world-renowned geographers), and many others
              laid the foundations for the current anarchist interest in ecological issues.
                 However, while there are many themes of an ecological nature within
              classical anarchism, it is only relatively recently that the similarities between
              ecological thought and anarchism has come to the fore (essentially from the
              publication of Murray Bookchin’s classic essay “Ecology and Revolutionary
              Thought” in 1965). Indeed, it would be no exaggeration to state that it is the
              ideas and work of Murray Bookchin that has placed ecology and ecological
              issues at the heart of anarchism and anarchist ideals and analysis into many
              aspects of the green movement.
                 Before discussing the types of green anarchism (also called eco-anarchism)
              it would be worthwhile to explain exactly what anarchism and ecology have in
              common. To quote Murray Bookchin, “both the ecologist and the anarchist
              place a strong emphasis on spontaneity” and “to both the ecologist and the
              anarchist, an ever-increasing unity is achieved by growing diﬀerentiation. An
              expanding whole is created by the diversiﬁcation and enrichment of its
              parts.” Moreover, ”[j]ust as the ecologist seeks to expand the range of an ecosystem and promote free interplay between species, so the anarchist seeks to
              expand the range of social experiments and remove all fetters to its
              development.” [Post-Scarcity Anarchism, p. 36]
                 Thus the anarchist concern with free development, decentralisation,
              diversity and spontaneity is reﬂected in ecological ideas and concerns.
              Hierarchy, centralisation, the state and concentrations of wealth reduce
              diversity and the free development of individuals and their communities by
              their very nature, and so weakens the social eco-system as well as the actual
              eco-systems human societies are part of. As Bookchin argues, “the
              reconstructive message of ecology… [is that] we must conserve and promote
              variety” but within modern capitalist society ”[a]ll that is spontaneous,
              creative and individuated is circumscribed by the standardised, the regulated

              and the massiﬁed.” [Op. Cit., p. 35 and p. 26] So, in many ways, anarchism
              can be considered the application of ecological ideas to society, as anarchism
              aims to empower individuals and communities, decentralise political, social
              and economic power so ensuring that individuals and social life develops
              freely and so becomes increasingly diverse in nature. It is for this reason
              Brian Morris argues that “the only political tradition that complements and,
              as it were, integrally connects with ecology — in a genuine and authentic way
              — is that of anarchism.” [Ecology and Anarchism, p. 132]
                So what kinds of green anarchism are there? While almost all forms of
              modern anarchism consider themselves to have an ecological dimension, the
              speciﬁcally eco-anarchist thread within anarchism has two main focal points,
              Social Ecology and “primitivist”. In addition, some anarchists are
              inﬂuenced by Deep Ecology, although not many. Undoubtedly Social Ecology
              is the most inﬂuential and numerous current. Social Ecology is associated
              with the ideas and works of Murray Bookchin, who has been writing on
              ecological matters since the 1950’s and, from the 1960s, has combined these
              issues with revolutionary social anarchism. His works include Post-Scarcity
              Anarchism, Toward an Ecological Society, The Ecology of Freedom and
              a host of others.
                Social Ecology locates the roots of the ecological crisis ﬁrmly in relations of
              domination between people. The domination of nature is seen as a product of
              domination within society, but this domination only reaches crisis proportions
              under capitalism. In the words of Murray Bookchin:
                   “The notion that man must dominate nature emerges directly from
## the domination of man by man… But it was not until organic
                   community relations… dissolved into market relationships that the
                   planet itself was reduced to a resource for exploitation. This
                   centuries-long tendency ﬁnds its most exacerbating development in
                   modern capitalism. Owing to its inherently competitive nature,
                   bourgeois society not only pits humans against each other, it also
                   pits the mass of humanity against the natural world. Just as men are
                   converted into commodities, so every aspect of nature is converted
                   into a commodity, a resource to be manufactured and merchandised
                   wantonly … The plundering of the human spirit by the market place
                   is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital.” [Op. Cit.,
                   pp. 24–5]
                “Only insofar,” Bookchin stresses, “as the ecology consciously cultivates an
              anti-hierarchical and a non-domineering sensibility, structure, and strategy for
              social change can it retain its very identity as the voice for a new balance
              between humanity and nature and its goal for a truly ecological society.”
              Social ecologists contrast this to what Bookchin labels “environmentalism” for
              while social ecology “seeks to eliminate the concept of the domination of
              nature by humanity by eliminating domination of human by human,
              environmentalism reﬂects an ‘instrumentalist’ or technical sensibility in which
              nature is viewed merely as a passive habit, an agglomeration of external
              objects and forces, that must be made more ‘serviceable’ for human use,
              irrespective of what these uses may be. Environmentalism .. . does not bring
              into question the underlying notions of the present society, notably that man

              must dominate nature. On the contrary, it seeks to facilitate that domination
              by developing techniques for diminishing the hazards caused by domination.”
              [Murray Bookchin, Towards an Ecological Society, p. 77]
                Social ecology oﬀers the vision of a society in harmony with nature, one
              which “involves a fundamental reversal of all the trends that mark the historic
              development of capitalist technology and bourgeois society — the minute
              specialisation of machines and labour, the concentration of resources and
              people in gigantic industrial enterprises and urban entities, the stratiﬁcation
              and bureaucratisation of nature and human beings.” Such an ecotopia
              “establish entirely new eco-communities that are artistically moulded to the
              eco-systems in which they are located.” Echoing Kropotkin, Bookchin argues
              that ”[s]uch an eco-community … would heal the split between town and
              country, between mind and body by fusing intellectual with physical work,
              industry with agricultural in a rotation or diversiﬁcation of vocational tasks.”
              This society would be based on the use of appropriate and green technology, a
              “new kind of technology — or eco-technology — one composed of ﬂexible,
              versatile machinery whose productive applications would emphasise
              durability and quality, not built in obsolescence, and insensate quantitative
              output of shoddy goods, and a rapid circulation of expendable commodities …
              Such an eco-technology would use the inexhaustible energy capacities of
              nature — the sun and wind, the tides and waterways, the temperature
              diﬀerentials of the earth and the abundance of hydrogen around us as fuels —
              to provide the eco-community with non-polluting materials or wastes that
              could be recycled.” [Bookchin, Op. Cit., pp. 68–9]
                However, this is not all. As Bookchin stresses an ecological society “is more
              than a society that tries to check the mounting disequilibrium that exists
              between humanity and the natural world. Reduced to simple technical or
              political issues, this anaemic view of such a society’s function degrades the
              issues raised by an ecological critique and leads them to purely technical and
              instrumental approaches to ecological problems. Social ecology is, ﬁrst of all,
              a sensibility that includes not only a critique of hierarchy and domination but
              a reconstructive outlook … guided by an ethics that emphasises variety
              without structuring diﬀerences into a hierarchical order … the precepts for
              such an ethics … [are] participation and diﬀerentiation.” [The Modern
              Crisis, pp. 24–5]
                Therefore social ecologists consider it essential to attack hierarchy and
              capitalism, not civilisation as such as the root cause of ecological problems.
              This is one of the key areas in which they disagree with “Primitivist”
              Anarchist ideas, who tend to be far more critical of all aspects of modern life,
              with some going so far as calling for “the end of civilisation” including,
              apparently, all forms of technology and large scale organisation. We discuss
              these ideas in section A.3.9.
                We must note here that other anarchists, while generally agreeing with its
              analysis and suggestions, are deeply critical of Social Ecology’s support for
              running candidates in municipal elections. While Social Ecologists see this as
              a means of creating popular self-managing assemblies and creating a counter
              power to the state, few anarchists agree. Rather they see it as inherently
              reformist as well as being hopelessly naive about the possibilities of using
              elections to bring about social change (see section J.5.14 for a fuller
146 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              discussion of this). Instead they propose direct action as the means to forward
              anarchist and ecological ideas, rejecting electioneering as a dead-end which
              ends up watering down radical ideas and corrupting the people involved (see
              section J.2 — What is Direct Action?).
                Lastly, there is “deep ecology,” which, because of its bio-centric nature,
              many anarchists reject as anti-human. There are few anarchists who think
              that people, as people, are the cause of the ecological crisis, which many
              deep ecologists seem to suggest. Murray Bookchin, for example, has been
              particularly outspoken in his criticism of deep ecology and the anti-human
              ideas that are often associated with it (see Which Way for the Ecology
              Movement?, for example). David Watson has also argued against Deep
              Ecology (see his How Deep is Deep Ecology? written under the name
              George Bradford). Most anarchists would argue that it is not people but the
              current system which is the problem, and that only people can change it. In
              the words of Murray Bookchin:
                   ”[Deep Ecology’s problems] stem from an authoritarian streak in a
## crude biologism that uses ‘natural law’ to conceal an ever-
## diminishing sense of humanity and papers over a profound
                   ignorance of social reality by ignoring the fact it is capitalism we
## are talking about, not an abstraction called ‘Humanity’ and
                   ‘Society.’” [The Philosophy of Social Ecology, p. 160]
                Thus, as Morris stresses, “by focusing entirely on the category of ‘humanity’
              the Deep Ecologists ignore or completely obscure the social origins of
              ecological problems, or alternatively, biologise what are essentially social
              problems.” To submerge ecological critique and analysis into a simplistic
              protest against the human race ignores the real causes and dynamics of
              ecological destruction and, therefore, ensures an end to this destruction
              cannot be found. Simply put, it is hardly “people” who are to blame when the
              vast majority have no real say in the decisions that aﬀect their lives,
              communities, industries and eco-systems. Rather, it is an economic and social
              system that places proﬁts and power above people and planet. By focusing on
              “Humanity” (and so failing to distinguish between rich and poor, men and
              women, whites and people of colour, exploiters and exploited, oppressors and
              oppressed) the system we live under is eﬀectively ignored, and so are the
              institutional causes of ecological problems. This can be “both reactionary and
              authoritarian in its implications, and substitutes a naive understanding of
              ‘nature’ for a critical study of real social issues and concerns.” [Morris, Op.
              Cit., p. 135]
                Faced with a constant anarchist critique of certain of their spokes-persons
              ideas, many Deep Ecologists have turned away from the anti-human ideas
              associated with their movement. Deep ecology, particularly the organisation
              Earth First! (EF!), has changed considerably over time, and EF! now has a
              close working relationship with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW),
              a syndicalist union. While deep ecology is not a thread of eco-anarchism, it
              shares many ideas and is becoming more accepted by anarchists as EF!
              rejects its few misanthropic ideas and starts to see that hierarchy, not the
              human race, is the problem (for a discussion between Murray Bookchin and
              leading Earth Firster! Dave Foreman see the book Defending the Earth).

              A.3.4 Is anarchism paciﬁstic?
                A paciﬁst strand has long existed in anarchism, with Leo Tolstoy being one
              of its major ﬁgures. This strand is usually called “anarcho-paciﬁsm” (the
              term “non-violent anarchist” is sometimes used, but this term is
              unfortunate because it implies the rest of the movement are “violent,” which
              is not the case!). The union of anarchism and paciﬁsm is not surprising given
              the fundamental ideals and arguments of anarchism. After all, violence, or the
              threat of violence or harm, is a key means by which individual freedom is
              destroyed. As Peter Marshall points out, ”[g]iven the anarchist’s respect for
              the sovereignty of the individual, in the long run it is non-violence and not
              violence which is implied by anarchist values.” [Demanding the Impossible,
              p.637] Malatesta is even more explicit when he wrote that the “main plank of
              anarchism is the removal of violence from human relations” and that
              anarchists “are opposed to violence.” [Errico Malatesta: His Life and
              Ideas, p. 53]
                However, although many anarchists reject violence and proclaim paciﬁsm,
              the movement, in general, is not essentially paciﬁstic (in the sense of opposed
              all forms of violence at all times). Rather, it is anti-militarist, being against the
              organised violence of the state but recognising that there are important
              diﬀerences between the violence of the oppressor and the violence of the
              oppressed. This explains why the anarchist movement has always placed a lot
              of time and energy in opposing the military machine and capitalist wars while,
              at the same time, supporting and organising armed resistance against
              oppression (as in the case of the Makhnovist army during the Russian
              Revolution which resisted both Red and White armies and the militias the
              anarchists organised to resist the fascists during the Spanish Revolution —
              see sections A.5.4 and A.5.6, respectively).
                On the question of non-violence, as a rough rule of thumb, the movement
              divides along Individualist and Social lines. Most Individualist anarchists
              support purely non-violent tactics of social change, as do the Mutualists.
              However, Individualist anarchism is not paciﬁst as such, as many support the
              idea of violence in self-defence against aggression. Most social anarchists, on
              the other hand, do support the use of revolutionary violence, holding that
              physical force will be required to overthrow entrenched power and to resist
              state and capitalist aggression (although it was an anarcho-syndicalist, Bart
              de Ligt, who wrote the paciﬁst classic, The Conquest of Violence). As
              Malatesta put it, violence, while being “in itself an evil,” is “justiﬁable only
              when it is necessary to defend oneself and others from violence” and that a
              “slave is always in a state of legitimate defence and consequently, his violence
              against the boss, against the oppressor, is always morally justiﬁable.” [Op.
              Cit., p. 55 and pp. 53–54] Moreover, they stress that, to use the words of
              Bakunin, since social oppression “stems far less from individuals than from
              the organisation of things and from social positions” anarchists aim to
              “ruthlessly destroy positions and things” rather than people, since the aim of
              an anarchist revolution is to see the end of privileged classes “not as
              individuals, but as classes.” [quoted by Richard B. Saltman, The Social and
              Political Thought of Michael Bakunin p. 121, p. 124 and p. 122]
                Indeed, the question of violence is relatively unimportant to most

              anarchists, as they do not glorify it and think that it should be kept to a
              minimum during any social struggle or revolution. All anarchists would agree
              with the Dutch paciﬁst anarcho-syndicalist Bart de Ligt when he argued that
              “the violence and warfare which are characteristic conditions of the capitalist
              world do not go with the liberation of the individual, which is the historic
              mission of the exploited classes. The greater the violence, the weaker the
              revolution, even where violence has deliberately been put at the service of the
              revolution.” [The Conquest of Violence, p. 75]
                Similarly, all anarchists would agree with de Ligt on, to use the name of one
              of his book’s chapters, “the absurdity of bourgeois paciﬁsm.” For de Ligt, and
              all anarchists, violence is inherent in the capitalist system and any attempt to
              make capitalism paciﬁstic is doomed to failure. This is because, on the one
              hand, war is often just economic competition carried out by other means.
              Nations often go to war when they face an economic crisis, what they cannot
              gain in economic struggle they attempt to get by conﬂict. On the other hand,
              “violence is indispensable in modern society… [because] without it the ruling
              class would be completely unable to maintain its privileged position with
              regard to the exploited masses in each country. The army is used ﬁrst and
              foremost to hold down the workers… when they become discontented.” [Bart
              de Ligt, Op. Cit., p. 62] As long as the state and capitalism exist, violence is
              inevitable and so, for anarcho-paciﬁsts, the consistent paciﬁst must be an
              anarchist just as the consistent anarchist must be a paciﬁst.
                For those anarchists who are non-paciﬁsts, violence is seen as an
              unavoidable and unfortunate result of oppression and exploitation as well as
              the only means by which the privileged classes will renounce their power and
              wealth. Those in authority rarely give up their power and so must be forced.
              Hence the need for “transitional” violence “to put an end to the far greater,
              and permanent, violence which keeps the majority of mankind in servitude.”
              [Malatesta, Op. Cit., p. 55] To concentrate on the issue of violence versus
              non-violence is to ignore the real issue, namely how do we change society for
              the better. As Alexander Berkman pointed out, those anarchists who are
              paciﬁsts confuse the issue, like those who think “it’s the same as if rolling up
              your sleeves for work should be considered the work itself.” To the contrary,
              ”[t]he ﬁghting part of revolution is merely rolling up your sleeves. The real,
              actual task is ahead.” [What is Anarchism?, p. 183] And, indeed, most social
              struggle and revolutions start relatively peaceful (via strikes, occupations and
              so on) and only degenerate into violence when those in power try to maintain
              their position (a classic example of this is in Italy, in 1920, when the
              occupation of factories by their workers was followed by fascist terror — see
              section A.5.5).
                As noted above, all anarchists are anti-militarists and oppose both the
              military machine (and so the “defence” industry) as well as statist/capitalist
              wars (although a few anarchists, like Rudolf Rocker and Sam Dolgoﬀ,
              supported the anti-fascist capitalist side during the second world war as the
              lesser evil). The anti-war machine message of anarchists and anarchosyndicalists was propagated long before the start of the ﬁrst world war, with
              syndicalists and anarchists in Britain and North America reprinting a French
              CGT leaﬂet urging soldiers not to follow orders and repress their striking
              fellow workers. Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were both arrested

              and deported from America for organising a “No-Conscription League” in
              1917 while many anarchists in Europe were jailed for refusing to join the
              armed forces in the ﬁrst and second world wars. The anarcho-syndicalist
              inﬂuenced IWW was crushed by a ruthless wave of government repression
              due to the threat its organising and anti-war message presented to the
              powerful elites who favoured war. More recently, anarchists, (including people
              like Noam Chomsky and Paul Goodman) have been active in the peace
              movement as well as contributing to the resistance to conscription where it
              still exists. Anarchists took an active part in opposing such wars as the
              Vietnam War, the Falklands war as well as the Gulf wars of 1991 and 2003
              (including, in Italy and Spain, helping to organise strikes in protest against it).
              And it was during the 1991 Gulf War when many anarchists raised the slogan
              “No war but the class war” which nicely sums up the anarchist opposition
              to war — namely an evil consequence of any class system, in which the
              oppressed classes of diﬀerent countries kill each other for the power and
              proﬁts of their rulers. Rather than take part in this organised slaughter,
              anarchists urge working people to ﬁght for their own interests, not those of
              their masters:

## “More than ever we must avoid compromise; deepen the chasm
                   between capitalists and wage slaves, between rulers and ruled;
                   preach expropriation of private property and the destruction of
                   states such as the only means of guaranteeing fraternity between
                   peoples and Justice and Liberty for all; and we must prepare to
                   accomplish these things.” [Malatesta, Op. Cit., p. 251]
                We must note here that Malatesta’s words were written in part against
              Peter Kropotkin who, for reasons best known to himself, rejected everything
              he had argued for decades and supported the allies in the First World War as
              a lesser evil against German authoritarianism and Imperialism. Of course, as
              Malatesta pointed out, “all Governments and all capitalist classes” do
              “misdeeds … against the workers and rebels of their own countries.” [Op.
              Cit., p. 246] He, along with Berkman, Goldman and a host of other anarchists,
              put their name to International Anarchist Manifesto against the First World
              War. It expressed the opinion of the bulk of the anarchist movement (at the
              time and consequently) on war and how to stop it. It is worth quoting from:
                   “The truth is that the cause of wars … rests solely in the existence
                   of the State, which is the form of privilege … Whatever the form it
                   may assume, the State is nothing but organised oppression for the
## advantage of a privileged minority …

                   “The misfortune of the peoples, who were deeply attached to peace,
                   is that, in order to avoid war, they placed their conﬁdence in the
                   State with its intriguing diplomatists, in democracy, and in political
                   parties … This conﬁdence has been deliberately betrayed, and
                   continues to be so, when governments, with the aid of the whole of
                   the press, persuade their respective people that this war is a war of
## liberation.

                   “We are resolutely against all wars between peoples, and … have
                   been, are, and ever will be most energetically opposed to war.
                   “The role of the Anarchists … is to continue to proclaim that there is
                   only one war of liberation: that which in all countries is waged by
                   the oppressed against the oppressors, by the exploited against the
                   exploiters. Our part is to summon the slaves to revolt against their
## masters.

## “Anarchist action and propaganda should assiduously and
                   perseveringly aim at weakening and dissolving the various States, at
                   cultivating the spirit of revolt, and arousing discontent in peoples
## and armies…

                   “We must take advantage of all the movements of revolt, of all the
                   discontent, in order to foment insurrection, and to organise the
                   revolution which we look to put end to all social wrongs… Social
                   justice realised through the free organisation of producers: war and
                   militarism done away with forever; and complete freedom won, by
## the abolition of the State and its organs of destruction.”
                   [“International Anarchist Manifesto on the War,” Anarchy! An
                   Anthology of Emma Goldman’s Mother Earth, pp. 386–8]
                Thus, the attraction of paciﬁsm to anarchists is clear. Violence is
              authoritarian and coercive, and so its use does contradict anarchist principles.
              That is why anarchists would agree with Malatesta when he argues that ”[w]e
              are on principle opposed to violence and for this reason wish that the social
              struggle should be conducted as humanely as possible.” [Malatesta, Op. Cit.,
              p. 57] Most, if not all, anarchists who are not strict paciﬁsts agree with
              paciﬁst-anarchists when they argue that violence can often be
              counterproductive, alienating people and giving the state an excuse to repress
              both the anarchist movement and popular movements for social change. All
              anarchists support non-violent direct action and civil disobedience, which
              often provide better roads to radical change.
                So, to sum up, anarchists who are pure paciﬁsts are rare. Most accept the
              use of violence as a necessary evil and advocate minimising its use. All agree
              that a revolution which institutionalises violence will just recreate the state
              in a new form. They argue, however, that it is not authoritarian to destroy
              authority or to use violence to resist violence. Therefore, although most
              anarchists are not paciﬁsts, most reject violence except in self-defence and
              even then kept to the minimum.
              A.3.5 What is Anarcha-Feminism?
                Although opposition to the state and all forms of authority had a strong
              voice among the early feminists of the 19th century, the more recent feminist
              movement which began in the 1960’s was founded upon anarchist practice.
              This is where the term anarcha-feminism came from, referring to women
              anarchists who act within the larger feminist and anarchist movements to
151 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              remind them of their principles.
                 The modern anarcha-feminists built upon the feminist ideas of previous
              anarchists, both male and female. Indeed, anarchism and feminism have
              always been closely linked. Many outstanding feminists have also been
              anarchists, including the pioneering Mary Wollstonecraft (author of A
              Vindication of the Rights of Woman), the Communard Louise Michel, and
              the American anarchists (and tireless champions of women’s freedom)
              Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman (for the former, see her essays “Sex
              Slavery”, “Gates of Freedom”, “The Case of Woman vs. Orthodoxy”, “Those
              Who Marry Do Ill”; for the latter see “The Traﬀic in Women”, “Woman
              Suﬀrage”, “The Tragedy of Woman’s Emancipation”, “Marriage and Love” and
              “Victims of Morality”, for example). Freedom, the world’s oldest anarchist
              newspaper, was founded by Charlotte Wilson in 1886. Anarchist women like
              Virgilia D’Andrea and Rose Pesota played important roles in both the
              libertarian and labour movements. The “Mujeres Libres” (“Free Women”)
              movement in Spain during the Spanish revolution is a classic example of
              women anarchists organising themselves to defend their basic freedoms and
              create a society based on women’s freedom and equality (see Free Women of
              Spain by Martha Ackelsberg for more details on this important organisation).
              In addition, all the male major anarchist thinkers (bar Proudhon) were ﬁrm
              supporters of women’s equality. For example, Bakunin opposed patriarchy and
              how the law “subjects [women] to the absolute domination of the man.” He
              argued that ”[e]qual rights must belong to men and women” so that women
              can “become independent and be free to forge their own way of life.” He
              looked forward to the end of “the authoritarian juridical family” and “the full
              sexual freedom of women.” [Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 396 and p. 397]
                 Thus anarchism has since the 1860s combined a radical critique of
              capitalism and the state with an equally powerful critique of patriarchy (rule
              by men). Anarchists, particularly female ones, recognised that modern society
              was dominated by men. As Ana Maria Mozzoni (an Italian anarchist immigrant
              in Buenos Aires) put it, women “will ﬁnd that the priest who damns you is a
              man; that the legislator who oppresses you is a man, that the husband who
              reduces you to an object is a man; that the libertine who harasses you is a
              man; that the capitalist who enriches himself with your ill-paid work and the
              speculator who calmly pockets the price of your body, are men.” Little has
              changed since then. Patriarchy still exists and, to quote the anarchist paper
              La Questione Sociale, it is still usually the case that women “are slaves both
              in social and private life. If you are a proletarian, you have two tyrants: the
              man and the boss. If bourgeois, the only sovereignty left to you is that of
              frivolity and coquetry.” [quoted by Jose Moya, Italians in Buenos Aires’s
              Anarchist Movement, pp. 197–8 and p. 200]
                 Anarchism, therefore, is based on an awareness that ﬁghting patriarchy is
              as important as ﬁghting against the state or capitalism. For ”[y]ou can have
              no free, or just, or equal society, nor anything approaching it, so long as
              womanhood is bought, sold, housed, clothed, fed, and protected, as a
              chattel.” [Voltairine de Cleyre, “The Gates of Freedom”, pp. 235–250, Eugenia
              C. Delamotte, Gates of Freedom, p. 242] To quote Louise Michel:
                   “The ﬁrst thing that must change is the relationship between the
152 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   sexes. Humanity has two parts, men and women, and we ought to be
                   walking hand in hand; instead there is antagonism, and it will last as
                   long as the ‘stronger’ half controls, or think its controls, the
                   ‘weaker’ half.” [The Red Virgin: Memoirs of Louise Michel, p.
                   139]
                Thus anarchism, like feminism, ﬁghts patriarchy and for women’s equality.
              Both share much common history and a concern about individual freedom,
              equality and dignity for members of the female sex (although, as we will
              explain in more depth below, anarchists have always been very critical of
              mainstream/liberal feminism as not going far enough). Therefore, it is
              unsurprising that the new wave of feminism of the sixties expressed itself in
              an anarchistic manner and drew much inspiration from anarchist ﬁgures such
              as Emma Goldman. Cathy Levine points out that, during this time,
              “independent groups of women began functioning without the structure,
              leaders, and other factotums of the male left, creating, independently and
              simultaneously, organisations similar to those of anarchists of many decades
              and regions. No accident, either.” [“The Tyranny of Tyranny,” Quiet
              Rumours: An Anarcha-Feminist Reader, p. 66] It is no accident because,
              as feminist scholars have noted, women were among the ﬁrst victims of
              hierarchical society, which is thought to have begun with the rise of
              patriarchy and ideologies of domination during the late Neolithic era. Marilyn
              French argues (in Beyond Power) that the ﬁrst major social stratiﬁcation of
              the human race occurred when men began dominating women, with women
              becoming in eﬀect a “lower” and “inferior” social class.
                The links between anarchism and modern feminism exist in both ideas and
              action. Leading feminist thinker Carole Pateman notes that her “discussion
              [on contract theory and its authoritarian and patriarchal basis] owes
              something to” libertarian ideas, that is the “anarchist wing of the socialist
              movement.” [The Sexual Contract, p. 14] Moreover, she noted in the 1980s
              how the “major locus of criticism of authoritarian, hierarchical, undemocratic
              forms of organisation for the last twenty years has been the women’s
              movement … After Marx defeated Bakunin in the First International, the
              prevailing form of organisation in the labour movement, the nationalised
              industries and in the left sects has mimicked the hierarchy of the state … The
              women’s movement has rescued and put into practice the long-submerged
              idea [of anarchists like Bakunin] that movements for, and experiments in,
              social change must ‘preﬁgure’ the future form of social organisation.” [The
              Disorder of Women, p. 201]
                Peggy Kornegger has drawn attention to these strong connections between
              feminism and anarchism, both in theory and practice. “The radical feminist
              perspective is almost pure anarchism,” she writes. “The basic theory
              postulates the nuclear family as the basis of all authoritarian systems. The
              lesson the child learns, from father to teacher to boss to god, is to obey the
              great anonymous voice of Authority. To graduate from childhood to adulthood
              is to become a full-ﬂedged automaton, incapable of questioning or even of
              thinking clearly.” [“Anarchism: The Feminist Connection,” Quiet Rumours:
              An Anarcha-Feminist Reader, p. 26] Similarly, the Zero Collective argues
              that Anarcha-feminism “consists in recognising the anarchism of feminism
153 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              and consciously developing it.” [“Anarchism/Feminism,” pp. 3–7, The Raven,
              no. 21, p. 6]
                Anarcha-feminists point out that authoritarian traits and values, for
              example, domination, exploitation, aggressiveness, competitiveness,
              desensitisation etc., are highly valued in hierarchical civilisations and are
              traditionally referred to as “masculine.” In contrast, non-authoritarian traits
              and values such as co-operation, sharing, compassion, sensitivity, warmth,
              etc., are traditionally regarded as “feminine” and are devalued. Feminist
              scholars have traced this phenomenon back to the growth of patriarchal
              societies during the early Bronze Age and their conquest of co-operatively
              based “organic” societies in which “feminine” traits and values were
              prevalent and respected. Following these conquests, however, such values
              came to be regarded as “inferior,” especially for a man, since men were in
              charge of domination and exploitation under patriarchy. (See e.g. Riane Eisler,
              The Chalice and the Blade; Elise Boulding, The Underside of History).
              Hence anarcha-feminists have referred to the creation of a non-authoritarian,
              anarchist society based on co-operation, sharing, mutual aid, etc. as the
              “feminisation of society.”
                Anarcha-feminists have noted that “feminising” society cannot be achieved
              without both self-management and decentralisation. This is because the
              patriarchal-authoritarian values and traditions they wish to overthrow are
              embodied and reproduced in hierarchies. Thus feminism implies
              decentralisation, which in turn implies self-management. Many feminists have
              recognised this, as reﬂected in their experiments with collective forms of
              feminist organisations that eliminate hierarchical structure and competitive
              forms of decision making. Some feminists have even argued that directly
              democratic organisations are speciﬁcally female political forms. [see e.g.
              Nancy Hartsock “Feminist Theory and the Development of Revolutionary
              Strategy,” in Zeila Eisenstein, ed., Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for
              Socialist Feminism, pp. 56–77] Like all anarchists, anarcha-feminists
              recognise that self-liberation is the key to women’s equality and thus,
              freedom. Thus Emma Goldman:
                   “Her development, her freedom, her independence, must come from
                   and through herself. First, by asserting herself as a personality, and
                   not as a sex commodity. Second, by refusing the right of anyone
                   over her body; by refusing to bear children, unless she wants them,
                   by refusing to be a servant to God, the State, society, the husband,
                   the family, etc., by making her life simpler, but deeper and richer.
                   That is, by trying to learn the meaning and substance of life in all its
                   complexities; by freeing herself from the fear of public opinion and
                   public condemnation.” [Anarchism and Other Essays, p. 211]
                Anarcha-feminism tries to keep feminism from becoming inﬂuenced and
              dominated by authoritarian ideologies of either the right or left. It proposes
              direct action and self-help instead of the mass reformist campaigns favoured
              by the “oﬀicial” feminist movement, with its creation of hierarchical and
              centralist organisations and its illusion that having more women bosses,
              politicians, and soldiers is a move towards “equality.” Anarcha-feminists
              would point out that the so-called “management science” which women have

              to learn in order to become mangers in capitalist companies is essentially a
              set of techniques for controlling and exploiting wage workers in corporate
              hierarchies, whereas “feminising” society requires the elimination of capitalist
              wage-slavery and managerial domination altogether. Anarcha-feminists realise
              that learning how to become an eﬀective exploiter or oppressor is not the
              path to equality (as one member of the Mujeres Libres put it, ”[w]e did not
              want to substitute a feminist hierarchy for a masculine one” [quoted by
              Martha A. Ackelsberg, Free Women of Spain, pp. 22–3] — also see section
              B.1.4 for a further discussion on patriarchy and hierarchy).
                Hence anarchism’s traditional hostility to liberal (or mainstream) feminism,
              while supporting women’s liberation and equality. Federica Montseny (a
              leading ﬁgure in the Spanish Anarchist movement) argued that such feminism
              advocated equality for women, but did not challenge existing institutions. She
              argued that (mainstream) feminism’s only ambition is to give to women of a
              particular class the opportunity to participate more fully in the existing
              system of privilege and if these institutions “are unjust when men take
              advantage of them, they will still be unjust if women take advantage of them.”
              [quoted by Martha A. Ackelsberg, Op. Cit., p. 119] Thus, for anarchists,
              women’s freedom did not mean an equal chance to become a boss or a wage
              slave, a voter or a politician, but rather to be a free and equal individual cooperating as equals in free associations. “Feminism,” stressed Peggy
              Kornegger, “doesn’t mean female corporate power or a woman President; it
              means no corporate power and no Presidents. The Equal Rights Amendment
              will not transform society; it only gives women the ‘right’ to plug into a
              hierarchical economy. Challenging sexism means challenging all hierarchy —
              economic, political, and personal. And that means an anarcha-feminist
              revolution.” [Op. Cit., p. 27]
                Anarchism, as can be seen, included a class and economic analysis which is
              missing from mainstream feminism while, at the same time, showing an
              awareness to domestic and sex-based power relations which eluded the
              mainstream socialist movement. This ﬂows from our hatred of hierarchy. As
              Mozzoni put it, “Anarchy defends the cause of all the oppressed, and because
              of this, and in a special way, it defends your [women’s] cause, oh! women,
              doubly oppressed by present society in both the social and private spheres.”
              [quoted by Moya, Op. Cit., p. 203] This means that, to quote a Chinese
              anarchist, what anarchists “mean by equality between the sexes is not just
              that the men will no longer oppress women. We also want men to no longer to
              be oppressed by other men, and women no longer to be oppressed by other
              women.” Thus women should “completely overthrow rulership, force men to
              abandon all their special privileges and become equal to women, and make a
              world with neither the oppression of women nor the oppression of men.” [He
              Zhen, quoted by Peter Zarrow, Anarchism and Chinese Political Culture,
              p. 147]
                So, in the historic anarchist movement, as Martha Ackelsberg notes, liberal/
              mainstream feminism was considered as being “too narrowly focused as a
              strategy for women’s emancipation; sexual struggle could not be separated
              from class struggle or from the anarchist project as a whole.” [Op. Cit., p.
              119] Anarcha-feminism continues this tradition by arguing that all forms of
              hierarchy are wrong, not just patriarchy, and that feminism is in conﬂict with

              its own ideals if it desires simply to allow women to have the same chance of
              being a boss as a man does. They simply state the obvious, namely that they
              “do not believe that power in the hands of women could possibly lead to a
              non-coercive society” nor do they “believe that anything good can come out of
              a mass movement with a leadership elite.” The “central issues are always
              power and social hierarchy” and so people “are free only when they have
              power over their own lives.” [Carole Ehrlich, “Socialism, Anarchism and
              Feminism”, Quiet Rumours: An Anarcha-Feminist Reader, p. 44] For if, as
              Louise Michel put it, “a proletarian is a slave; the wife of a proletarian is even
              more a slave” ensuring that the wife experiences an equal level of oppression
              as the husband misses the point. [Op. Cit., p. 141]
                 Anarcha-feminists, therefore, like all anarchists oppose capitalism as a
              denial of liberty. Their critique of hierarchy in the society does not start and
              end with patriarchy. It is a case of wanting freedom everywhere, of wanting to
              ”[b]reak up … every home that rests in slavery! Every marriage that
              represents the sale and transfer of the individuality of one of its parties to the
              other! Every institution, social or civil, that stands between man and his right;
              every tie that renders one a master, another a serf.” [Voltairine de Cleyre,
              “The Economic Tendency of Freethought”, The Voltairine de Cleyre
              Reader, p. 72] The ideal that an “equal opportunity” capitalism would free
              women ignores the fact that any such system would still see working class
              women oppressed by bosses (be they male or female). For anarcha-feminists,
              the struggle for women’s liberation cannot be separated from the struggle
              against hierarchy as such. As L. Susan Brown puts it:
                   “Anarchist-feminism, as an expression of the anarchist sensibility
                   applied to feminist concerns, takes the individual as its starting
## point and, in opposition to relations of domination and
                   subordination, argues for non-instrumental economic forms that
                   preserve individual existential freedom, for both men and women.”
                   [The Politics of Individualism, p. 144]
                Anarcha-feminists have much to contribute to our understanding of the
              origins of the ecological crisis in the authoritarian values of hierarchical
              civilisation. For example, a number of feminist scholars have argued that the
              domination of nature has paralleled the domination of women, who have been
              identiﬁed with nature throughout history (See, for example, Caroline
              Merchant, The Death of Nature, 1980). Both women and nature are victims
              of the obsession with control that characterises the authoritarian personality.
              For this reason, a growing number of both radical ecologists and feminists are
              recognising that hierarchies must be dismantled in order to achieve their
              respective goals.
                In addition, anarcha-feminism reminds us of the importance of treating
              women equally with men while, at the same time, respecting women’s
              diﬀerences from men. In other words, that recognising and respecting
              diversity includes women as well as men. Too often many male anarchists
              assume that, because they are (in theory) opposed to sexism, they are not
              sexist in practice. Such an assumption is false. Anarcha-feminism brings the
              question of consistency between theory and practice to the front of social
              activism and reminds us all that we must ﬁght not only external constraints
156 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              but also internal ones.
                This means that anarcha-feminism urges us to practice what we preach. As
              Voltairine de Cleyre argued, “I never expect men to give us liberty. No,
              Women, we are not worth it, until we take it.” This involves “insisting on a
              new code of ethics founded on the law of equal freedom: a code recognising
              the complete individuality of woman. By making rebels wherever we can. By
              ourselves living our beliefs . … We are revolutionists. And we shall use
              propaganda by speech, deed, and most of all life — being what we teach.”
              Thus anarcha-feminists, like all anarchists, see the struggle against patriarchy
              as being a struggle of the oppressed for their own self-liberation, for ”as a
              class I have nothing to hope from men . .. No tyrant ever renounced his
              tyranny until he had to. If history ever teaches us anything it teaches this.
              Therefore my hope lies in creating rebellion in the breasts of women.” [“The
              Gates of Freedom”, pp. 235–250, Eugenia C. Delamotte, Gates of Freedom,
              p. 249 and p. 239] This was sadly as applicable within the anarchist
              movement as it was outside it in patriarchal society.
                Faced with the sexism of male anarchists who spoke of sexual equality,
              women anarchists in Spain organised themselves into the Mujeres Libres
              organisation to combat it. They did not believe in leaving their liberation to
              some day after the revolution. Their liberation was a integral part of that
              revolution and had to be started today. In this they repeated the conclusions
              of anarchist women in Illinois Coal towns who grew tried of hearing their
              male comrades “shout in favour” of sexual equality “in the future society”
              while doing nothing about it in the here and now. They used a particularly
              insulting analogy, comparing their male comrades to priests who “make false
              promises to the starving masses … [that] there will be rewards in paradise.”
              The argued that mothers should make their daughters “understand that the
              diﬀerence in sex does not imply inequality in rights” and that as well as being
              “rebels against the social system of today,” they “should ﬁght especially
              against the oppression of men who would like to retain women as their moral
              and material inferior.” [Ersilia Grandi, quoted by Caroline Waldron Merithew,
              Anarchist Motherhood, p. 227] They formed the “Luisa Michel” group to
              ﬁght against capitalism and patriarchy in the upper Illinois valley coal towns
              over three decades before their Spanish comrades organised themselves.
                For anarcha-feminists, combating sexism is a key aspect of the struggle for
              freedom. It is not, as many Marxist socialists argued before the rise of
              feminism, a diversion from the “real” struggle against capitalism which would
              somehow be automatically solved after the revolution. It is an essential part of
              the struggle:
                   “We do not need any of your titles … We want none of them. What
                   we do want is knowledge and education and liberty. We know what
                   our rights are and we demand them. Are we not standing next to
                   you ﬁghting the supreme ﬁght? Are you not strong enough, men, to
                   make part of that supreme ﬁght a struggle for the rights of women?
## And then men and women together will gain the rights of all
                   humanity.” [Louise Michel, Op. Cit., p. 142]
                A key part of this revolutionising modern society is the transformation of
              the current relationship between the sexes. Marriage is a particular evil for
157 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              “the old form of marriage, based on the Bible, ‘till death doth part,’ … [is] an
              institution that stands for the sovereignty of the man over the women, of her
              complete submission to his whims and commands.” Women are reduced “to
              the function of man’s servant and bearer of his children.” [Goldman, Op. Cit.,
              pp. 220–1] Instead of this, anarchists proposed “free love,” that is couples
              and families based on free agreement between equals than one partner being
              in authority and the other simply obeying. Such unions would be without
              sanction of church or state for “two beings who love each other do not need
              permission from a third to go to bed.” [Mozzoni, quoted by Moya, Op. Cit., p.
              200]
                 Equality and freedom apply to more than just relationships. For “if social
              progress consists in a constant tendency towards the equalisation of the
              liberties of social units, then the demands of progress are not satisﬁed so long
              as half society, Women, is in subjection… . Woman … is beginning to feel her
              servitude; that there is a requisite acknowledgement to be won from her
              master before he is put down and she exalted to — Equality. This
              acknowledgement is, the freedom to control her own person. “ [Voltairine
              de Cleyre, “The Gates of Freedom”, Op. Cit., p. 242] Neither men nor state
              nor church should say what a woman does with her body. A logical extension
              of this is that women must have control over their own reproductive organs.
              Thus anarcha-feminists, like anarchists in general, are pro-choice and proreproductive rights (i.e. the right of a woman to control her own reproductive
              decisions). This is a long standing position. Emma Goldman was persecuted
              and incarcerated because of her public advocacy of birth control methods and
              the extremist notion that women should decide when they become pregnant
              (as feminist writer Margaret Anderson put it, “In 1916, Emma Goldman was
              sent to prison for advocating that ‘women need not always keep their mouth
              shut and their wombs open.’”).
                 Anarcha-feminism does not stop there. Like anarchism in general, it aims at
              changing all aspects of society not just what happens in the home. For, as
              Goldman asked, “how much independence is gained if the narrowness and
              lack of freedom of the home is exchanged for the narrowness and lack of
              freedom of the factory, sweat-shop, department store, or oﬀice?” Thus
              women’s equality and freedom had to be fought everywhere and defended
              against all forms of hierarchy. Nor can they be achieved by voting. Real
              liberation, argue anarcha-feminists, is only possible by direct action and
              anarcha-feminism is based on women’s self-activity and self-liberation for
              while the “right to vote, or equal civil rights, may be good demands … true
              emancipation begins neither at the polls nor in the courts. It begins in
              woman’s soul … her freedom will reach as far as her power to achieve
              freedom reaches.” [Goldman, Op. Cit., p. 216 and p. 224]
                 The history of the women’s movement proves this. Every gain has come
              from below, by the action of women themselves. As Louise Michel put it, ”[w]e
              women are not bad revolutionaries. Without begging anyone, we are taking
              our place in the struggles; otherwise, we could go ahead and pass motions
              until the world ends and gain nothing.” [Op. Cit., p. 139] If women waited for
              others to act for them their social position would never have changed. This
              includes getting the vote in the ﬁrst place. Faced with the militant suﬀrage
              movement for women’s votes, British anarchist Rose Witcop recognised that it
158 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              was “true that this movement shows us that women who so far have been so
              submissive to their masters, the men, are beginning to wake up at last to the
              fact they are not inferior to those masters.” Yet she argued that women would
              not be freed by votes but “by their own strength.” [quoted by Sheila
              Rowbotham, Hidden from History, pp. 100–1 and p. 101] The women’s
              movement of the 1960s and 1970s showed the truth of that analysis. In spite
              of equal voting rights, women’s social place had remained unchanged since
              the 1920s.
                Ultimately, as Anarchist Lily Gair Wilkinson stressed, the “call for ‘votes’
              can never be a call to freedom. For what is it to vote? To vote is to register
              assent to being ruled by one legislator or another?” [quoted by Sheila
              Rowbotham, Op. Cit., p. 102] It does not get to the heart of the problem,
              namely hierarchy and the authoritarian social relationships it creates of which
              patriarchy is only a subset of. Only by getting rid of all bosses, political,
              economic, social and sexual can genuine freedom for women be achieved and
              “make it possible for women to be human in the truest sense. Everything
              within her that craves assertion and activity should reach its fullest
              expression; all artiﬁcial barriers should be broken, and the road towards
              greater freedom cleared of every trace of centuries of submission and
              slavery.” [Emma Goldman, Op. Cit., p. 214]
              A.3.6 What is Cultural Anarchism?
                For our purposes, we will deﬁne cultural anarchism as the promotion of
              anti-authoritarian values through those aspects of society traditionally
              regarded as belonging to the sphere of “culture” rather than “economics” or
              “politics” — for example, through art, music, drama, literature, education,
              child-rearing practices, sexual morality, technology, and so forth.
                Cultural expressions are anarchistic to the extent that they deliberately
              attack, weaken, or subvert the tendency of most traditional cultural forms to
              promote authoritarian values and attitudes, particularly domination and
              exploitation. Thus a novel that portrays the evils of militarism can be
              considered as cultural anarchism if it goes beyond the simple “war-is-hell”
              model and allows the reader to see how militarism is connected with
              authoritarian institutions (e.g. capitalism and statism) or methods of
              authoritarian conditioning (e.g. upbringing in the traditional patriarchal
              family). Or, as John Clark expresses it, cultural anarchism implies “the
              development of arts, media, and other symbolic forms that expose various
              aspects of the system of domination and contrast them with a system of values
              based on freedom and community.” This ”cultural struggle” would be part of
              a general struggle “to combat the material and ideological power of all
              dominating classes, whether economic, political, racial, religious, or sexual,
              with a multi-dimensional practice of liberation.” In other words, an “expanded
              conception of class analysis” and “an ampliﬁed practice of class struggle”
              which includes, but is not limited to, ”economic actions like strikes, boycotts,
              job actions, occupation, organisations of direct action groups and federations
              of libertarian workers’ groups and development of workers’ assemblies,
              collectives and co-operatives” and ”political activity” like the “active

              interference with implementation of repressive governmental policies,” the
              “non-compliance and resistance against regimentation and bureaucratisation
              of society” and “participation in movements for increasing direct participation
              in decision-making and local control.” [The Anarchist Moment, p. 31]
                Cultural anarchism is important — indeed essential — because authoritarian
              values are embedded in a total system of domination with many aspects
              besides the political and economic. Hence those values cannot be eradicated
              even by a combined economic and political revolution if there it is not also
              accompanied by profound psychological changes in the majority of the
              population. For mass acquiescence in the current system is rooted in the
              psychic structure of human beings (their “character structure,” to use
              Wilhelm Reich’s expression), which is produced by many forms of
              conditioning and socialisation that have developed with patriarchalauthoritarian civilisation during the past ﬁve or six thousand years.
                In other words, even if capitalism and the state were overthrown tomorrow,
              people would soon create new forms of authority in their place. For authority
              — a strong leader, a chain of command, someone to give orders and relieve
              one of the responsibility of thinking for oneself — are what the submissive/
              authoritarian personality feels most comfortable with. Unfortunately, the
              majority of human beings fear real freedom, and indeed, do not know what to
              do with it — as is shown by a long string of failed revolutions and freedom
              movements in which the revolutionary ideals of freedom, democracy, and
              equality were betrayed and a new hierarchy and ruling class were quickly
              created. These failures are generally attributed to the machinations of
              reactionary politicians and capitalists, and to the perﬁdy of revolutionary
              leaders; but reactionary politicians only attract followers because they ﬁnd a
              favourable soil for the growth of their authoritarian ideals in the character
              structure of ordinary people.
                Hence the prerequisite of an anarchist revolution is a period of
              consciousness-raising in which people gradually become aware of submissive/
              authoritarian traits within themselves, see how those traits are reproduced by
              conditioning, and understand how they can be mitigated or eliminated
              through new forms of culture, particularly new child-rearing and educational
              methods. We will explore this issue more fully in section B.1.5 (What is the
              mass-psychological basis for authoritarian civilisation?), J.6 (What methods of
              child rearing do anarchists advocate?), and J.5.13 (What are Modern
              Schools?)
                Cultural anarchist ideas are shared by almost all schools of anarchist
              thought and consciousness-raising is considered an essential part of any
              anarchist movement. For anarchists, its important to “build the new world in
              the shell of the old” in all aspects of our lives and creating an anarchist
              culture is part of that activity. Few anarchists, however, consider
              consciousness-raising as enough in itself and so combine cultural anarchist
              activities with organising, using direct action and building libertarian
              alternatives in capitalist society. The anarchist movement is one that
              combines practical self-activity with cultural work, with both activities feeding
              into and supporting the other.
              A.3.7 Are there religious anarchists?
160 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                 Yes, there are. While most anarchists have opposed religion and the idea of
              God as deeply anti-human and a justiﬁcation for earthly authority and slavery,
              a few believers in religion have taken their ideas to anarchist conclusions.
              Like all anarchists, these religious anarchists have combined an opposition to
              the state with a critical position with regards to private property and
              inequality. In other words, anarchism is not necessarily atheistic. Indeed,
              according to Jacques Ellul, “biblical thought leads directly to anarchism, and
              that this is the only ‘political anti-political’ position in accord with Christian
              thinkers.” [quoted by Peter Marshall, Demanding the Impossible, p. 75]
                 There are many diﬀerent types of anarchism inspired by religious ideas. As
              Peter Marshall notes, the “ﬁrst clear expression of an anarchist sensibility
              may be traced back to the Taoists in ancient China from about the sixth
              century BC” and “Buddhism, particularly in its Zen form, … has … a strong
              libertarian spirit.” [Op. Cit., p. 53 and p. 65] Some, like the anti-globalisation
              activist Starhawk, combine their anarchist ideas with Pagan and Spiritualist
              inﬂuences. However, religious anarchism usually takes the form of Christian
              Anarchism, which we will concentrate on here.
                 Christian Anarchists take seriously Jesus’ words to his followers that “kings
              and governors have domination over men; let there be none like that among
              you.” Similarly, Paul’s dictum that there “is no authority except God” is taken
              to its obvious conclusion with the denial of state authority within society.
              Thus, for a true Christian, the state is usurping God’s authority and it is up to
              each individual to govern themselves and discover that (to use the title of
              Tolstoy’s famous book) The Kingdom of God is within you.
                 Similarly, the voluntary poverty of Jesus, his comments on the corrupting
              eﬀects of wealth and the Biblical claim that the world was created for
              humanity to be enjoyed in common have all been taken as the basis of a
              socialistic critique of private property and capitalism. Indeed, the early
              Christian church (which could be considered as a liberation movement of
              slaves, although one that was later co-opted into a state religion) was based
              upon communistic sharing of material goods, a theme which has continually
              appeared within radical Christian movements inspired, no doubt, by such
              comments as “all that believed were together, and had all things in common,
              and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them all, according as
              every man has need” and “the multitude of them that believed were of one
              heart and of one soul, not one of them said that all of the things which he
              possessed was his own; but they had all things in common.” (Acts, 2:44,45;
              4:32)
                 Unsurprisingly, the Bible would have been used to express radical
              libertarian aspirations of the oppressed, which, in later times, would have
              taken the form of anarchist or Marxist terminology). As Bookchin notes in his
              discussion of Christianity’s contributions to “the legacy of freedom,” ”[b]y
              spawning nonconformity, heretical conventicles, and issues of authority over
              person and belief, Christianity created not merely a centralised authoritarian
              Papacy, but also its very antithesis: a quasi-religious anarchism.” Thus
              “Christianity’s mixed message can be grouped into two broad and highly
              conﬂicting systems of belief. On one side there was a radical, activistic,
              communistic, and libertarian vision of the Christian life” and “on the other
              side there was a conservative, quietistic, materially unwordly, and

              hierarchical vision.” [The Ecology of Freedom, p. 266 and pp. 274–5]
                Thus clergyman’s John Ball’s egalitarian comments (as quoted by Peter
              Marshall [Op. Cit., p. 89]) during the Peasant Revolt in 1381 in England:
## “When Adam delved and Eve span,
              Who was then a gentleman?” The history of Christian anarchism includes the
              Heresy of the Free Spirit in the Middle Ages, numerous Peasant revolts and
              the Anabaptists in the 16th century. The libertarian tradition within
              Christianity surfaced again in the 18th century in the writings of William Blake
              and the American Adam Ballou reached anarchist conclusions in his Practical
              Christian Socialism in 1854. However, Christian anarchism became a
              clearly deﬁned thread of the anarchist movement with the work of the famous
              Russian author Leo Tolstoy.
                Tolstoy took the message of the Bible seriously and came to consider that a
              true Christian must oppose the state. From his reading of the Bible, Tolstoy
              drew anarchist conclusions:
                   “ruling means using force, and using force means doing to him
                   whom force is used, what he does not like and what he who uses
                   force would certainly not like done to himself. Consequently ruling
                   means doing to others what we would not they should do unto us,
                   that is, doing wrong.” [The Kingdom of God is Within You, p.
                   242]
                Thus a true Christian must refrain from governing others. From this antistatist position he naturally argued in favour of a society self-organised from
              below:
                   “Why think that non-oﬀicial people could not arrange their life for
                   themselves, as well as Government people can arrange it nor for
                   themselves but for others?” [The Slavery of Our Times, p. 46]
                This meant that “people can only be freed from slavery by the abolition of
              Governments.” [Op. Cit., p. 49] Tolstoy urged non-violent action against
              oppression, seeing a spiritual transformation of individuals as the key to
              creating an anarchist society. As Max Nettlau argues, the “great truth
              stressed by Tolstoy is that the recognition of the power of the good, of
              goodness, of solidarity — and of all that is called love — lies within ourselves,
              and that it can and must be awakened, developed and exercised in our own
              behaviour.” [A Short History of Anarchism, pp. 251–2] Unsurprisngly,
              Tolstoy thought the “anarchists are right in everything … They are mistaken
              only in thinking that anarchy can be instituted by a revolution.” [quoted by
              Peter Marshall, Op. Cit., p. 375]
                Like all anarchists, Tolstoy was critical of private property and capitalism.
              He greatly admired and was heavily inﬂuenced by Proudhon, considering the
              latter’s “property is theft” as “an absolute truth” which would “survive as long
              as humanity.” [quoted by Jack Hayward, After the French Revolution, p.
              213] Like Henry George (whose ideas, like those of Proudhon, had a strong
              impact on him) he opposed private property in land, arguing that “were it not
              for the defence of landed property, and its consequent rise in price, people
              would not be crowded into such narrow spaces, but would scatter over the
162 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              free land of which there is still so much in the world.” Moreover, “in this
              struggle [for landed property] it is not those who work in the land, but always
              those who take part in government violence, who have the advantage.” Thus
              Tolstoy recognised that property rights in anything beyond use require state
              violence to protect them as possession is “always protected by custom, public
              opinion, by feelings of justice and reciprocity, and they do not need to be
              protected by violence.” [The Slavery of Our Times, p. 47] Indeed, he argues
              that:
                   “Tens of thousands of acres of forest lands belonging to one
                   proprietor — while thousands of people close by have no fuel —
                   need protection by violence. So, too, do factories and works where
                   several generations of workmen have been defrauded and are still
                   being defrauded. Yet more do the hundreds of thousands of bushels
                   of grain, belonging to one owner, who has held them back to sell at
                   triple price in time of famine.” [Op. Cit., pp. 47–8]
                As with other anarchists, Tolstoy recognised that under capitalism,
              economic conditions “compel [the worker] to go into temporary or perpetual
              slavery to a capitalist” and so is “obliged to sell his liberty.” This applied to
              both rural and urban workers, for the “slaves of our times are not only all
              those factory and workshop hands, who must sell themselves completely into
              the power of the factory and foundry owners in order to exist; but nearly all
              the agricultural labourers are slaves, working as they do unceasingly to grow
              another’s corn on another’s ﬁeld.” Such a system could only be maintained by
              violence, for “ﬁrst, the fruit of their toil is unjustly and violently taken form
              the workers, and then the law steps in, and these very articles which have
              been taken from the workmen — unjustly and by violence — are declared to
              be the absolute property of those who have stolen them.” [Op. Cit., p. 34, p.
              31 and p. 38]
                Tolstoy argued that capitalism morally and physically ruined individuals and
              that capitalists were “slave-drivers.” He considered it impossible for a true
              Christian to be a capitalist, for a “manufacturer is a man whose income
              consists of value squeezed out of the workers, and whose whole occupation is
              based on forced, unnatural labour” and therefore, “he must ﬁrst give up
              ruining human lives for his own proﬁt.” [The Kingdom Of God is Within
              You, p. 338 and p. 339] Unsurprisingly, Tolstoy argued that co-operatives
              were the “only social activity which a moral, self-respecting person who
              doesn’t want to be a party of violence can take part in.” [quoted by Peter
              Marshall, Op. Cit., p. 378]
                So, for Tolstoy, “taxes, or land-owning or property in articles of use or in the
              means of production” produces “the slavery of our times.” However, he
              rejected the state socialist solution to the social problem as political power
              would create a new form of slavery on the ruins of the old. This was because
              “the fundamental cause of slavery is legislation: the fact that there are people
              who have the power to make laws.” This requires “organised violence used by
              people who have power, in order to compel others to obey the laws they (the
              powerful) have made — in other words, to do their will.” Handing over
              economic life to the state would simply mean “there will be people to whom
              power will be given to regulate all these matters. Some people will decide
163 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              these questions, and others will obey them.” [Tolstoy, Op. Cit., p. 40, p. 41, p.
              43 and p. 25] He correctly prophetised that “the only thing that will happen”
              with the victory of Marxism would be “that despotism will be passed on. Now
              the capitalists are ruling, but then the directors of the working class will
              rule.” [quoted by Marshall, Op. Cit., p. 379]
                From his opposition to violence, Tolstoy rejects both state and private
              property and urged paciﬁst tactics to end violence within society and create a
              just society. For Tolstoy, government could only be destroyed by a mass
              refusal to obey, by non-participation in govermmental violence and by
              exposing fraud of statism to the world. He rejected the idea that force should
              be used to resist or end the force of the state. In Nettlau’s words, he
              “asserted … resistance to evil; and to one of the ways of resistance — by
              active force — he added another way: resistance through disobedience,
              the passive force.” [Op. Cit., p. 251] In his ideas of a free society, Tolstoy
              was clearly inﬂuenced by rural Russian life and aimed for a society based on
              peasant farming of communal land, artisans and small-scale co-operatives. He
              rejected industrialisation as the product of state violence, arguing that “such
              division of labour as now exists will … be impossible in a free society.”
              [Tolstoy, Op. Cit., p. 26]
                Tolstoy’s ideas had a strong inﬂuence on Gandhi, who inspired his fellow
              country people to use non-violent resistance to kick Britain out of India.
              Moreover, Gandhi’s vision of a free India as a federation of peasant communes
              is similar to Tolstoy’s anarchist vision of a free society (although we must
              stress that Gandhi was not an anarchist). The Catholic Worker Group in the
              United States was also heavily inﬂuenced by Tolstoy (and Proudhon), as was
              Dorothy Day a staunch Christian paciﬁst and anarchist who founded it in
              1933. The inﬂuence of Tolstoy and religious anarchism in general can also be
              found in Liberation Theology movements in Latin and South America who
              combine Christian ideas with social activism amongst the working class and
              peasantry (although we should note that Liberation Theology is more
              generally inspired by state socialist ideas rather than anarchist ones).
                So there is a minority tradition within anarchism which draws anarchist
              conclusions from religion. However, as we noted in section A.2.20, most
              anarchists disagree, arguing that anarchism implies atheism and it is no
              coincidence that the biblical thought has, historically, been associated with
              hierarchy and defence of earthly rulers. Thus the vast majority of anarchists
              have been and are atheists, for “to worship or revere any being, natural or
              supernatural, will always be a form of self-subjugation and servitude that will
              give rise to social domination. As [Bookchin] writes: ‘The moment that human
              beings fall on their knees before anything that is ‘higher’ than themselves,
              hierarchy will have made its ﬁrst triumph over freedom.’” [Brian Morris,
              Ecology and Anarchism, p. 137] This means that most anarchists agree with
              Bakunin that if God existed it would be necessary, for human freedom and
              dignity, to abolish it. Given what the Bible says, few anarchists think it can be
              used to justify libertarian ideas rather than support authoritarian ones and
              are not surprised that the hierarchical side of Christianity has predominated
              in its long (and generally oppressive) history.
                Atheist anarchists point to the fact that the Bible is notorious for advocating
              all kinds of abuses. How does the Christian anarchist reconcile this? Are they
164 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              a Christian ﬁrst, or an anarchist? Equality, or adherence to the Scripture? For
              a believer, it seems no choice at all. If the Bible is the word of God, how can
              an anarchist support the more extreme positions it takes while claiming to
              believe in God, his authority and his laws?
                 For example, no capitalist nation would implement the no working on the
              Sabbath law which the Bible expounds. Most Christian bosses have been
              happy to force their fellow believers to work on the seventh day in spite of the
              Biblical penalty of being stoned to death (“Six days shall work be done, but on
              the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the
              Lord: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.” Exodus 35:2).
              Would a Christian anarchist advocate such a punishment for breaking God’s
              law? Equally, a nation which allowed a woman to be stoned to death for not
              being a virgin on her wedding night would, rightly, be considered utterly evil.
              Yet this is the fate speciﬁed in the “good book” (Deuteronomy 22:13–21).
              Would premarital sex by women be considered a capital crime by a Christian
              anarchist? Or, for that matter, should “a stubborn and rebellious son, which
              will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother” also suﬀer the
              fate of having “all the men of his city … stone him with stones, that he die”?
              (Deuteronomy 21:18–21) Or what of the Bible’s treatment of women: “Wives,
              submit yourselves unto your own husbands.” (Colossians 3:18) They are also
              ordered to “keep silence in the churches.” (I Corinthians 14:34–35). Male rule
              is explicitly stated: “I would have you know that the head of every man is
              Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.”
              (I Corinthians 11:3)
                 Clearly, a Christian anarchist would have to be as highly selective as nonanarchist believers when it comes to applying the teachings of the Bible. The
              rich rarely proclaim the need for poverty (at least for themselves) and seem
              happy to forgot (like the churches) the diﬀiculty a rich man apparently has
              entering heaven, for example. They seem happy to ignore Jesus’ admonition
              that “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,
              and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.” (Matthew
              19:21). The followers of the Christian right do not apply this to their political
              leaders, or, for that matter, their spiritual ones. Few apply the maxim to “Give
              to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask
              them not again.” (Luke 6:30, repeated in Matthew 5:42) Nor do they hold “all
              things common” as practised by the ﬁrst Christian believers. (Acts 4:32) So if
              non-anarchist believers are to be considered as ignoring the teachings of the
              Bible by anarchist ones, the same can be said of them by those they attack.
                 Moreover idea that Christianity is basically anarchism is hard to reconcile
              with its history. The Bible has been used to defend injustice far more than it
              has been to combat it. In countries where Churches hold de facto political
              power, such as in Ireland, in parts of South America, in nineteenth and early
              twentieth century Spain and so forth, typically anarchists are strongly antireligious because the Church has the power to suppress dissent and class
              struggle. Thus the actual role of the Church belies the claim that the Bible is
              an anarchist text.
                 In addition, most social anarchists consider Tolstoyian paciﬁsm as dogmatic
              and extreme, seeing the need (sometimes) for violence to resist greater evils.
              However, most anarchists would agree with Tolstoyians on the need for

              individual transformation of values as a key aspect of creating an anarchist
              society and on the importance of non-violence as a general tactic (although,
              we must stress, that few anarchists totally reject the use of violence in selfdefence, when no other option is available).
              A.3.8 What is “anarchism without adjectives”?
                In the words of historian George Richard Esenwein, “anarchism without
              adjectives” in its broadest sense “referred to an unhyphenated form of
              anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as
              communist, collectivist, mutualist, or individualist. For others, … [it] was
              simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of diﬀerent
              anarchist schools.” [Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class
              Movement in Spain, 1868–1898, p. 135]
                The originator of the expression was Cuban born Fernando Tarrida del
              Marmol who used it in November, 1889, in Barcelona. He directed his
              comments towards the communist and collectivist anarchists in Spain who at
              the time were having an intense debate over the merits of their two theories.
              “Anarchism without adjectives” was an attempt to show greater tolerance
              between anarchist tendencies and to be clear that anarchists should not
              impose a preconceived economic plan on anyone — even in theory. Thus the
              economic preferences of anarchists should be of “secondary importance” to
              abolishing capitalism and the state, with free experimentation the one rule of
              a free society.
                Thus the theoretical perspective known as “anarquismo sin adjetives”
              (“anarchism without adjectives”) was one of the by-products of a intense
              debate within the movement itself. The roots of the argument can be found in
              the development of Communist Anarchism after Bakunin’s death in 1876.
              While not entirely dissimilar to Collectivist Anarchism (as can be seen from
              James Guillaume’s famous work “On Building the New Social Order” within
              Bakunin on Anarchism, the collectivists did see their economic system
              evolving into free communism), Communist Anarchists developed, deepened
              and enriched Bakunin’s work just as Bakunin had developed, deepened and
              enriched Proudhon’s. Communist Anarchism was associated with such
              anarchists as Elisee Reclus, Carlo Caﬁero, Errico Malatesta and (most
              famously) Peter Kropotkin.
                Quickly Communist-Anarchist ideas replaced Collectivist Anarchism as the
              main anarchist tendency in Europe, except in Spain. Here the major issue was
              not the question of communism (although for Ricardo Mella this played a
              part) but a question of the modiﬁcation of strategy and tactics implied by
              Communist Anarchism. At this time (the 1880s), the Communist Anarchists
              stressed local (pure) cells of anarchist militants, generally opposed trade
              unionism (although Kropotkin was not one of these as he saw the importance
              of militant workers organisations) as well as being somewhat antiorganisation as well. Unsurprisingly, such a change in strategy and tactics
              came in for a lot of discussion from the Spanish Collectivists who strongly
              supported working class organisation and struggle.
                This conﬂict soon spread outside of Spain and the discussion found its way
166 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              into the pages of La Revolte in Paris. This provoked many anarchists to agree
              with Malatesta’s argument that ”[i]t is not right for us, to say the least, to fall
              into strife over mere hypotheses.” [quoted by Max Nettlau, A Short History
              of Anarchism, pp. 198–9] Over time, most anarchists agreed (to use
              Nettlau’s words) that “we cannot foresee the economic development of the
              future” [Op. Cit., p. 201] and so started to stress what they had in common
              (opposition to capitalism and the state) rather than the diﬀerent visions of
              how a free society would operate. As time progressed, most CommunistAnarchists saw that ignoring the labour movement ensured that their ideas
              did not reach the working class while most Collectivist-Anarchists stressed
              their commitment to communist ideals and their arrival sooner, rather than
              later, after a revolution. Thus both groups of anarchists could work together
              as there was “no reason for splitting up into small schools, in our eagerness to
              overemphasise certain features, subject to variation in time and place, of the
              society of the future, which is too remote from us to permit us to envision all
              its adjustments and possible combinations.” Moreover, in a free society “the
              methods and the individual forms of association and agreements, or the
              organisation of labour and of social life, will not be uniform and we cannot, at
              this moment, make and forecasts or determinations concerning them.”
              [Malatesta, quoted by Nettlau, Op. Cit., p. 173]
                 Thus, Malatesta continued, ”[e]ven the question as between anarchistcollectivism and anarchist-communism is a matter of qualiﬁcation, of method
              and agreement” as the key is that, no matter the system, “a new moral
              conscience will come into being, which will make the wage system repugnant
              to men [and women] just as legal slavery and compulsion are now repugnant
              to them.” If this happens then, “whatever the speciﬁc forms of society may
              turn out to be, the basis of social organisation will be communist.” As long as
              we “hold to fundamental principles and … do our utmost to instil them in the
              masses” we need not “quarrel over mere words or triﬂes but give postrevolutionary society a direction towards justice, equality and liberty.”
              [quoted by Nettlau, Op. Cit., p. 173 and p. 174]
                 Similarly, in the United States there was also an intense debate at the same
              time between Individualist and Communist anarchists. There Benjamin Tucker
              was arguing that Communist-Anarchists were not anarchists while John Most
              was saying similar things about Tucker’s ideas. Just as people like Mella and
              Tarrida put forward the idea of tolerance between anarchist groups, so
              anarchists like Voltairine de Cleyre “came to label herself simply ‘Anarchist,’
              and called like Malatesta for an ‘Anarchism without Adjectives,’ since in the
              absence of government many diﬀerent experiments would probably be tried in
              various localities in order to determine the most appropriate form.” [Peter
              Marshall, Demanding the Impossible, p. 393] In her own words, a whole
              range of economic systems would be “advantageously tried in diﬀerent
              localities. I would see the instincts and habits of the people express
              themselves in a free choice in every community; and I am sure that distinct
              environments would call out distinct adaptations.” [“Anarchism”, Exquisite
              Rebel, p. 79] Consequently, individualist and communist anarchist “forms of
              society, as well as many intermediations, would, in the absence of
              government, be tried in various localities, according to the instincts and
              material condition of the people … Liberty and experiment alone can

              determine the best forms of society. Therefore I no longer label myself
              otherwise than ‘Anarchist’ simply.” [“The Making of An Anarchist”, The
              Voltairine de Cleyre Reader, pp. 107–8]
                These debates had a lasting impact on the anarchist movement, with such
              noted anarchists as de Cleyre, Malatesta, Nettlau and Reclus adopting the
              tolerant perspective embodied in the expression “anarchism without
              adjectives” (see Nettlau’s A Short History of Anarchism, pages 195 to 201
              for an excellent summary of this). It is also, we add, the dominant position
              within the anarchist movement today with most anarchists recognising the
              right of other tendencies to the name “anarchist” while, obviously, having
              their own preferences for speciﬁc types of anarchist theory and their own
              arguments why other types are ﬂawed. However, we must stress that the
              diﬀerent forms of anarchism (communism, syndicalism, religious etc) are not
              mutually exclusive and you do not have to support one and hate the others.
              This tolerance is reﬂected in the expression “anarchism without adjectives.”
                One last point, some “anarcho”-capitalists have attempted to use the
              tolerance associated with “anarchism without adjectives” to argue that their
              ideology should be accepted as part of the anarchist movement. After all, they
              argue, anarchism is just about getting rid of the state, economics is of
              secondary importance. However, such a use of “anarchism without adjectives”
              is bogus as it was commonly agreed at the time that the types of economics
              that were being discussed were anti-capitalist (i.e. socialistic). For
              Malatesta, for example, there were “anarchists who foresee and propose
              other solution, other future forms of social organisation” than communist
              anarchism, but they “desire, just as we do, to destroy political power and
              private property.” “Let us do away,” he argued, “with all exclusivism of
              schools of thinking” and let us “come to an understanding on ways and
              means, and go forwards.” [quoted by Nettlau, Op. Cit., p. 175] In other
              words, it was agreed that capitalism had to be abolished along with the state
              and once this was the case free experimentation would develop. Thus the
              struggle against the state was just one part of a wider struggle to end
              oppression and exploitation and could not be isolated from these wider aims.
              As “anarcho”-capitalists do not seek the abolition of capitalism along with the
              state they are not anarchists and so “anarchism without adjectives” does not
              apply to the so-called “anarchist” capitalists (see section F on why “anarcho”-
              capitalism is not anarchist).
                This is not to say that after a revolution “anarcho”-capitalist communities
              would not exist. Far from it. If a group of people wanted to form such a system
              then they could, just as we would expect a community which supported state
              socialism or theocracy to live under that regime. Such enclaves of hierarchy
              would exist simply because it is unlikely that everyone on the planet, or even
              in a given geographical area, will become anarchists all at the same time. The
              key thing to remember is that no such system would be anarchist and,
              consequently, is not “anarchism without adjectives.”
              A.3.9 What is anarcho-primitivism?
               As discussed in section A.3.3, most anarchists would agree with Situationist

              Ken Knabb in arguing that “in a liberated world computers and other modern
              technologies could be used to eliminate dangerous or boring tasks, freeing
              everyone to concentrate on more interesting activities.” Obviously ”[c]ertain
              technologies — nuclear power is the most obvious example — are indeed so
              insanely dangerous that they will no doubt be brought to a prompt halt. Many
              other industries which produce absurd, obsolete or superﬂuous commodities
              will, of course, cease automatically with the disappearance of their
              commercial rationales. But many technologies …, however they may presently
              be misused, have few if any inherent drawbacks. It’s simply a matter of using
              them more sensibly, bringing them under popular control, introducing a few
              ecological improvements, and redesigning them for human rather than
              capitalistic ends.” [Public Secrets, p. 79 and p. 80] Thus most eco-anarchists
              see the use of appropriate technology as the means of creating a society
              which lives in balance with nature.
                However, a small but vocal minority of self-proclaimed Green anarchists
              disagree. Writers such as John Zerzan, John Moore and David Watson have
              expounded a vision of anarchism which, they claim, aims to critique every
              form of power and oppression. This is often called “anarcho-primitivism,”
              which according to Moore, is simply “a shorthand term for a radical current
              that critiques the totality of civilisation from an anarchist perspective, and
              seeks to initiate a comprehensive transformation of human life.” [Primitivist
              Primer]
                How this current expresses itself is diverse, with the most extreme elements
              seeking the end of all forms of technology, division of labour, domestication,
              “Progress”, industrialism, what they call “mass society” and, for some, even
              symbolic culture (i.e. numbers, language, time and art). They tend to call any
              system which includes these features “civilisation” and, consequently, aim for
              “the destruction of civilisation”. How far back they wish to go is a moot point.
              Some see the technological level that existed before the Industrial Revolution
              as acceptable, many go further and reject agriculture and all forms of
              technology beyond the most basic. For them, a return to the wild, to a huntergatherer mode of life, is the only way for anarchy is exist and dismiss out of
              hand the idea that appropriate technology can be used to create an anarchist
              society based on industrial production which minimises its impact on
              ecosystems.
                Thus we ﬁnd the primitivist magazine “Green Anarchy” arguing that
              those, like themselves, “who prioritise the values of personal autonomy or
              wild existence have reason to oppose and reject all large-scale organisations
              and societies on the grounds that they necessitate imperialism, slavery and
              hierarchy, regardless of the purposes they may be designed for.” They oppose
              capitalism as it is “civilisation’s current dominant manifestation.” However,
              they stress that it is “Civilisation, not capitalism per se, was the genesis of
              systemic authoritarianism, compulsory servitude and social isolation. Hence,
              an attack upon capitalism that fails to target civilisation can never abolish the
              institutionalised coercion that fuels society. To attempt to collectivise industry
              for the purpose of democratising it is to fail to recognise that all large-scale
              organisations adopt a direction and form that is independent of its members’
              intentions.” Thus, they argue, genuine anarchists must oppose industry and
              technology for ”[h]ierarchical institutions, territorial expansion, and the
169 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              mechanisation of life are all required for the administration and process of
              mass production to occur.” For primitivists, ”[o]nly small communities of selfsuﬀicient individuals can coexist with other beings, human or not, without
              imposing their authority upon them.” Such communities would share essential
              features with tribal societies, ”[f]or over 99% of human history, humans lived
              within small and egalitarian extended family arrangements, while drawing
              their subsistence directly from the land.” [Against Mass Society]
                 While such tribal communities, which lived in harmony with nature and had
              little or no hierarchies, are seen as inspirational, primitivists look (to use the
              title of a John Zerzan book) forward to seeing the “Future Primitive.” As John
              Moore puts it, “the future envisioned by anarcho-primitivism … is without
              precedent. Although primitive cultures provide intimations of the future, and
              that future may well incorporate elements derived from those cultures, an
              anarcho-primitivist world would likely be quite diﬀerent from previous forms
              of anarchy.” [Op. Cit.]
                 For the primitivist, other forms of anarchism are simply self-managed
              alienation within essentially the same basic system we now endure. Hence
              Moore’s comment that “classical anarchism” wants “to take over civilisation,
              rework its structures to some degree, and remove its worst abuses and
              oppressions. However, 99% of life in civilisation remains unchanged in their
              future scenarios, precisely because the aspects of civilisation they question
              are minimal … overall life patterns wouldn’t change too much.” Thus ”[f]rom
              the perspective of anarcho-primitivism, all other forms of radicalism appear
              as reformist, whether or not they regard themselves as revolutionary.” [Op.
              Cit.]
                 In reply, “classical anarchists” point out three things. Firstly, to claim that
              the “worst abuses and oppressions” account for 1% of capitalist society is
              simply nonsense and, moreover, something an apologist of that system would
              happily agree with. Secondly, it is obvious from reading any “classical”
              anarchist text that Moore’s assertions are nonsense. “Classical” anarchism
              aims to transform society radically from top to bottom, not tinker with minor
              aspects of it. Do primitivists really think that people who went to the eﬀort to
              abolish capitalism would simply continue doing 99% of the same things they
              did before hand? Of course not. In other words, it is not enough to get rid of
              the boss, although this is a necessary ﬁrst step! Thirdly, and most importantly,
              Moore’s argument ensures that his new society would be impossible to reach.
                 So, as can be seen, primitivism has little or no bearing to the traditional
              anarchist movement and its ideas. The visions of both are simply
              incompatible, with the ideas of the latter dismissed as authoritarian by the
              former and anarchists questioning whether primitivism is practical in the
              short term or even desirable in the long. While supporters of primitivism like
              to portray it as the most advanced and radical form of anarchism, others are
              less convinced. They consider it as a confused ideology which draws its
              followers into absurd positions and, moreover, is utterly impractical. They
              would agree with Ken Knabb that primitivism is rooted in “fantasies [which]
              contain so many obvious self-contradictions that it is hardly necessary to
              criticise them in any detail. They have questionable relevance to actual past
              societies and virtually no relevance to present possibilities. Even supposing
              that life was better in one or another previous era, we have to begin from

              where we are now. Modern technology is so interwoven with all aspects of
              our life that it could not be abruptly discontinued without causing a global
              chaos that would wipe out billions of people.” [Op. Cit., p. 79]
                 The reason for this is simply that we live in a highly industrialised and
              interconnected system in which most people do not have the skills required to
              live in a hunter-gatherer or even agricultural society. Moreover, it is extremely
              doubtful that six billion people could survive as hunter-gatherers even if they
              had the necessary skills. As Brian Morris notes, ”[t]he future we are told is
              ‘primitive.’ How this is to be achieved in a world that presently sustains
              almost six billion people (for evidence suggests that the hunter-gatherer
              lifestyle is only able to support 1 or 2 people per sq. mile)” primitivists like
              Zerzan do not tell us. [“Anthropology and Anarchism,” pp. 35–41, Anarchy: A
              Journal of Desire Armed, no. 45, p. 38] Most anarchists, therefore, agree
              with Chomsky’s summation that “I do not think that they are realising that
              what they are calling for is the mass genocide of millions of people because of
              the way society is now structured and organised … If you eliminate these
              structures everybody dies … And, unless one thinks through these things, it’s
              not really serious.” [Chomsky on Anarchism, p. 226]
                 Somewhat ironically, many proponents of primitivsm agree with its critics
              that the earth would be unable to support six billion living as a huntergatherers. This, critics argue, gives primitivism a key problem in that
              population levels will take time to fall and so any “primitivist” rebellion faces
              two options. Either it comes about via some kind of collapse of “civilisation”
              or it involves a lengthy transition period during which “civilisation” and its
              industrial legacies are decommissioned safely, population levels drop
              naturally to an appropriate level and people gain the necessary skills required
              for their new existence.
                 The problems with the ﬁrst option should be obvious but, sadly, it is implied
              by many primitivist writers. Moore, for example, talks about “when
              civilisation collapses” (“through its own volition, through our eﬀorts, or a
              combination of the two”). This implies an extremely speedy process which is
              conﬁrmed when he talks about the need for “positive alternatives” to be built
              now as “the social disruption caused by collapse could easily create the
              psychological insecurity and social vacuum in which fascism and other
              totalitarian dictatorships could ﬂourish.” [Op. Cit.] Social change based on
              “collapse,” “insecurity” and “social disruption” does not sound like a recipe
              for a successful revolution.
                 Then there are the anti-organisation dogmas expounded by primitivism.
              Moore is typical, asserting that ”[o]rganisations, for anarcho-primitivists, are
              just rackets, gangs for putting a particular ideology in power” and reiterates
              the point by saying primitivists stand for “the abolition of all power relations,
              including the State . .. and any kind of party or organisation.” [Op. Cit.] Yet
              without organisation, no modern society could function. There would be a
              total and instant collapse which would see not only mass starvation but also
              ecological destruction as nuclear power stations meltdown, industrial waste
              seeps into the surrounding environment, cities and towns decay and hordes of
              starving people ﬁghting over what vegetables, fruits and animals they could
              ﬁnd in the countryside. Clearly an anti-organisation dogma can only be
              reconciled with the idea of a near overnight “collapse” of civilisation, not with
171 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              a steady progress towards a long term goal. Equally, how many “positive
              alternatives” could exist without organisation?
                Moore dismissed any critique that points out that a collapse would cause
              mass destruction as “just smear tactics,” “weird fantasies spread by some
              commentators hostile to anarcho-primitivism who suggest that the population
              levels envisaged by anarcho-primitivists would have to be achieved by mass
              die-oﬀs or nazi-style death camps.” The “commitment of anarcho-primitivists
              to the abolition of all power relations … means that such orchestrated
              slaughter remains an impossibility as well as just plain horrendous.” [Op.
              Cit.] Yet no critic is suggesting that primitivists desire such a die-oﬀ or seek
              to organise it. They simply point out that the collapse of civilisation would
              result in a mass die-oﬀ due to the fact that most people do not have the skills
              necessary to survive it nor could the Earth provide enough food for six billion
              people trying to live in a primitivist manner. Other primitivists have asserted
              that it can, stating ”[i]t is not possible for all six billion of the planet’s current
              inhabitants to survive as hunter-gatherers, but it is possible for those who
              can’t to grow their own food in signiﬁcantly smaller spaces … as has been
              demonstrated by permaculture, organic gardening, and indigenous
              horticulture techniques.” [Against Mass Society] Unfortunately no evidence
              was provided to show the truth of this assertion nor that people could develop
              the necessary skills in time even if it were. It seems a slim hope to place the
              fate of billions on, so that humanity can be “wild” and free from such
              tyrannies as hospitals, books and electricity.
                Faced with the horrors that such a “collapse” would entail, those
              primitivists who have thought the issue through end up accepting the need for
              a transition period. John Zerzan, for example, argues that it “seems evident
              that industrialisation and the factories could not be gotten rid of instantly, but
              equally clear that their liquidation must be pursued with all the vigour behind
              the rush of break-out.” Even the existence of cities is accepted, for
              ”[c]ultivation within the cities is another aspect of practical transition.” [On
              the Transition: Postscript to Future Primitive]
                However, to accept the necessity of a transition period does little more than
              expose the contradictions within primitivism. Zerzan notes that “the means of
              reproducing the prevailing Death Ship (e.g. its technology) cannot be used to
              fashion a liberated world.” He ponders: “What would we keep? ‘Labour-saving
              devices?’ Unless they involve no division of labour (e.g. a lever or incline), this
              concept is a ﬁction; behind the ‘saving’ is hidden the congealed drudgery of
              many and the despoliation of the natural world.” How this is compatible with
              maintaining “industrialisation and the factories” for a (non-speciﬁed) period is
              unclear. Similarly, he argues that ”[i]nstead of the coercion of work — and
              how much of the present could continue without precisely that coercion? — an
              existence without constraints is an immediate, central objective.” [Op. Cit.]
              How that is compatible with the arguing that industry would be maintained
              for a time is left unasked, never mind unanswered. And if “work” continues,
              how is this compatible with the typical primitivist dismissal of “traditional”
              anarchism, namely that self-management is managing your own alienation
              and that no one will want to work in a factory or in a mine and, therefore,
              coercion will have to be used to make them do so? Does working in a selfmanaged workplace somehow become less alienating and authoritarian

              during a primitivist transition?
                 It is an obvious fact that the human population size cannot be reduced
              signiﬁcantly by voluntary means in a short period of time. For primitivism to
              be viable, world population levels need to drop by something like 90%. This
              implies a drastic reduction of population will take decades, if not centuries, to
              achieve voluntarily. Given that it is unlikely that (almost) everyone on the
              planet will decide not to have children, this time scale will almost certainly be
              centuries and so agriculture and most industries will have to continue (and an
              exodus from the cities would be impossible immediately). Likewise, reliable
              contraceptives are a product of modern technology and, consequently, the
              means of producing them would have to maintained over that time — unless
              primitivists argue that along with refusing to have children, people will also
              refuse to have sex.
                 Then there is the legacy of industrial society, which simply cannot be left to
              decay on its own. To take just one obvious example, leaving nuclear power
              plants to melt down would hardly be eco-friendly. Moreover, it is doubtful that
              the ruling elite will just surrender its power without resistance and,
              consequently, any social revolution would need to defend itself against
              attempts to reintroduce hierarchy. Needless to say, a revolution which
              shunned all organisation and industry as inherently authoritarian would not
              be able to do this (it would have been impossible to produce the necessary
              military supplies to ﬁght Franco’s fascist forces during the Spanish Revolution
              if the workers had not converted and used their workplaces to do so, to note
              another obvious example).
                 Then there is another, key, contradiction. For if you accept that there is a
              need for a transition from ‘here’ to ‘there’ then primitivism automatically
              excludes itself from the anarchist tradition. The reason is simple. Moore
              asserts that “mass society” involves “people working, living in artiﬁcial,
              technologised environments, and [being] subject to forms of coercion and
              control.” [Op. Cit.] So if what primitivists argue about technology, industry
              and mass society are all true, then any primitivist transition would, by
              deﬁnition, not be libertarian. This is because “mass society” will have to
              remain for some time (at the very least decades, more likely centuries) after a
              successful revolution and, consequently from a primitivist perspective, be
              based on “forms of coercion and control.” There is an ideology which
              proclaims the need for a transitional system which will be based on coercion,
              control and hierarchy which will, in time, disappear into a stateless society. It
              also, like primitivism, stresses that industry and large scale organisation is
              impossible without hierarchy and authority. That ideology is Marxism. Thus it
              seems ironic to “classical” anarchists to hear self-proclaimed anarchists
              repeating Engels arguments against Bakunin as arguments for “anarchy” (see
              section H.4 for a discussion of Engels claims that industry excludes
              autonomy).
                 So if, as seems likely, any transition will take centuries to achieve then the
              primivitist critique of “traditional” anarchism becomes little more than a joke
              — and a hindrance to meaningful anarchist practice and social change. It
              shows the contradiction at the heart of primitivism. While its advocates attack
              other anarchists for supporting technology, organisation, self-management of
              work, industrialisation and so on, they are themselves are dependent on the
173 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              things they oppose as part of any humane transition to a primitivist society.
              And given the passion with which they attack other anarchists on these
              matters, unsurprisingly the whole notion of a primitivist transition period
              seems impossible to other anarchists. To denounce technology and
              industrialism as inherently authoritarian and then turn round and advocate
              their use after a revolution simply does not make sense from a logical or
              libertarian perspective.
                 Thus the key problem with primitivism can be seen. It oﬀers no practical
              means of achieving its goals in a libertarian manner. As Knabb summarises,
              ”[w]hat begins as a valid questioning of excessive faith in science and
              technology ends up as a desperate and even less justiﬁed faith in the return of
              a primeval paradise, accompanied by a failure to engage the present system
              in any but an abstract, apocalyptical way.” To avoid this, it is necessary to take
              into account where we are now and, consequently, we will have to “seriously
              consider how we will deal with all the practical problems that will be posed in
              the interim.” [Op. Cit., p. 80 and p. 79] Sadly, primitivist ideology excludes
              this possibility by dismissing the starting point any real revolution would
              begin from as being inherently authoritarian. Moreover, they are blocking
              genuine social change by ensuring that no mass movement would ever be
              revolutionary enough to satisfy their criteria:

## “Those who proudly proclaim their ‘total opposition’ to all
                   compromise, all authority, all organisation, all theory, all technology,
## etc., usually turn out to have no revolutionary perspective
                   whatsoever — no practical conception of how the present system
                   might be overthrown or how a post-revolutionary society might
                   work. Some even attempt to justify this lack by declaring that a
                   mere revolution could never be radical enough to satisfy their
                   eternal ontological rebelliousness. Such all-or-nothing bombast may
                   temporarily impress a few spectators, but its ultimate eﬀect is
                   simply to make people blasé.” [Knabb, Op. Cit., pp. 31–32]
                Then there is the question of the means suggested for achieving
              primitivism. Moore argues that the “kind of world envisaged by anarchoprimitivism is one unprecedented in human experience in terms of the degree
              and types of freedom anticipated ... so there can’t be any limits on the forms
              of resistance and insurgency that might develop.” [Op. Cit.] Non-primitivists
              reply by saying that this implies primitivists don’t know what they want nor
              how to get there. Equally, they stress that there must be limits on what are
              considered acceptable forms of resistance. This is because means shape the
              ends created and so authoritarian means will result in authoritarian ends.
              Tactics are not neutral and support for certain tactics betray an authoritarian
              perspective.
                This can be seen from the UK magazine “Green Anarchist,” part of the
              extreme end of “Primitivism.” Due to its inherent unattractiveness for most
              people, it could never come about by libertarian means (i.e. by the free choice
              of individuals who create it by their own acts) and so cannot be anarchist as
              very few people would actually voluntarily embrace such a situation. This led
              to “Green Anarchist” developing a form of eco-vanguardism in order, to use
              Rousseau’s expression, to “force people to be free.” This was expressed when
174 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              the magazine supported the actions and ideas of the (non-anarchist)
              Unabomber and published an article (“The Irrationalists”) by one its editors
              stating that “the Oklahoma bombers had the right idea. The pity was that they
              did not blast any more government oﬀices … The Tokyo sarin cult had the
              right idea. The pity was that in testing the gas a year prior to the attack they
              gave themselves away.” [Green Anarchist, no. 51, p. 11] A defence of these
              remarks was published in the next issue and a subsequent exchange of letters
              in the US-based Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed magazine (numbers
              48 to 52) saw the other editor justify this sick, authoritarian nonsense as
              simply examples of “unmediated resistance” conducted “under conditions of
              extreme repression.” Whatever happened to the anarchist principle that
              means shape the ends? This means there are “limits” on tactics, as some
              tactics are not and can never be libertarian.
                 However, few primitivists take such an extreme position. Most “primitivist”
              anarchists rather than being anti-technology and anti-civilisation as such
              instead (to use David Watson’s expression) believe it is a case of the
              “aﬀirmation of aboriginal lifeways” and of taking a far more critical approach
              to issues such as technology, rationality and progress than that associated
              with Social Ecology. These eco-anarchists reject “a dogmatic primitivism
              which claims we can return in some linear way to our primordial roots” just as
              much as the idea of “progress,” ”superseding both Enlightenment and
              Counter-Enlightenment” ideas and traditions. For them, Primitivism “reﬂects
              not only a glimpse at life before the rise of the state, but also a legitimate
              response to real conditions of life under civilisation” and so we should respect
              and learn from “palaeolithic and neolithic wisdom traditions” (such as those
              associated with Native American tribes and other aboriginal peoples). While
              we “cannot, and would not want to abandon secular modes of thinking and
              experiencing the world… we cannot reduce the experience of life, and the
              fundamental, inescapable questions why we live, and how we live, to secular
              terms… Moreover, the boundary between the spiritual and the secular is not
              so clear. A dialectical understanding that we are our history would aﬀirm an
              inspirited reason that honours not only atheistic Spanish revolutionaries who
              died for el ideal, but also religious paciﬁst prisoners of conscience, Lakota
              ghost dancers, taoist hermits and executed suﬁ mystics.” [David Watson,
              Beyond Bookchin: Preface for a future social ecology, p. 240, p. 103, p.
              240 and pp. 66–67]
                 Such “primitivist” anarchism is associated with a range of magazines,
              mostly US-based, like Fifth Estate. For example, on the question of
              technology, they argue that ”[w]hile market capitalism was a spark that set
              the ﬁre, and remains at the centre of the complex, it is only part of something
              larger: the forced adaptation of organic human societies to an economicinstrumental civilisation and its mass technics, which are not only hierarchical
              and external but increasingly ‘cellular’ and internal. It makes no sense to
              layer the various elements of this process in a mechanistic hierarchy of ﬁrst
              cause and secondary eﬀects.” [Watson, Op. Cit., pp. 127–8] For this reason
              primitivists are more critical of all aspects of technology, including calls by
              social ecologists for the use of appropriate technology essential in order to
              liberate humanity and the planet:

                   “To speak of technological society is in fact to refer to the technics
                   generated within capitalism, which in turn generate new forms of
                   capital. The notion of a distinct realm of social relations that
                   determine this technology is not only ahistorical and undialectical, it
                   reﬂects a kind of simplistic base/superstructure schema.” [Watson,
                   Op. Cit., p. 124]
                Thus it is not a case of who uses technology which determines its eﬀects,
              rather the eﬀects of technology are determined to a large degree by the
              society that creates it. In other words, technology is selected which tends to
              re-enforce hierarchical power as it is those in power who generally select
              which technology is introduced within society (saying that, oppressed people
              have this excellent habit of turning technology against the powerful and
              technological change and social struggle are inter-related — see section
              D.10). Thus even the use of appropriate technology involves more than
              selecting from the range of available technology at hand, as these
              technologies have certain eﬀects regardless of who uses them. Rather it is a
              question of critically evaluating all aspects of technology and modifying and
              rejecting it as required to maximise individual freedom, empowerment and
              happiness. Few Social Ecologists would disagree with this approach, though,
              and diﬀerences are usually a question of emphasis rather than a deep political
              point.
                However, few anarchists are convinced by an ideology which, as Brian
              Morris notes, dismisses the “last eight thousand years or so of human history”
              as little more than a source “of tyranny, hierarchical control, mechanised
              routine devoid of any spontaneity. All those products of the human creative
              imagination — farming, art, philosophy, technology, science, urban living,
              symbolic culture — are viewed negatively by Zerzan — in a monolithic sense.”
              While there is no reason to worship progress, there is just as little need to
              dismiss all change and development out of hand as oppressive. Nor are they
              convinced by Zerzan’s “selective culling of the anthropological literature.”
              [Op. Cit., p. 38] Most anarchists would concurr with Murray Bookchin:
                   “The ecology movement will never gain any real inﬂuence or have
                   any signiﬁcant impact on society if it advances a message of despair
## rather than hope, of a regressive and impossible return to
                   primordial human cultures, rather than a commitment to human
                   progress and to a unique human empathy for life as a whole … We
## must recover the utopian impulses, the hopefulness, the
                   appreciation of what is good, what is worth rescuing in yumn
                   civilisation, as well as what must be rejected, if the ecology
                   movement is to play a transformative and creative role in human
                   aﬀairs. For without changing society, we will not change the
                   diastrous ecological direction in which capitalism is moving.” [The
                   Ecology of Freedom, p. 63]
                In addition, a position of “turning back the clock” is deeply ﬂawed, for while
              some aboriginal societies are very anarchistic, not all are. As anarchist
              anthropologist David Graeber points out, “we know almost nothing about like
              in Palaeolithic, other than the sort of thing that can be gleaned from studying
176 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              very old skulls … But what we see in the more recent ethnographic records is
              endless variety. There were hunter-gatherer societies with nobles and slaves,
              there are agrarian societies that are ﬁercely egalitarian. Even in … Amazonia,
              one ﬁnds some groups who can justly be described as anarchists, like the
              Piaroa, living alongside others (say, the warlike Sherentre, who are clearly
              anything but.” [Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology, pp. 53–4] Even
              if we speculate, like Zerzan, that if we go back far enough we would ﬁnd all of
              humanity in anarchistic tribes, the fact remains that certain of these societies
              did develop into statist, propertarian ones implying that a future anarchist
              society that is predominantly inspired by and seek to reproduce key elements
              of prehistoric forms of anarchy is not the answer as “civilisation” may develop
              again due to the same social or environmental factors.
                 Primitivism confuses two radically diﬀerent positions, namely support for a
              literal return to primitive lifeways and the use of examples from primitive life
              as a tool for social critique. Few anarchists would disagree with the second
              position as they recognise that current does not equal better and,
              consequently, past cultures and societies can have positive (as well as
              negative) aspects to them which can shed light on what a genuinely human
              society can be like. Similarly if “primitivism” simply involved questioning
              technology along with authority, few would disagree. However, this sensible
              position is, in the main, subsumed within the ﬁrst one, the idea that an
              anarchist society would be a literal return to hunter-gatherer society. That
              this is the case can be seen from primitivist writings (some primitivists say
              that they are not suggesting the Stone Age as a model for their desired
              society nor a return to gathering and hunting, yet they seem to exclude any
              other options by their critique).
                 So to suggest that primitivism is simply a critique or some sort of “anarchist
              speculation” (to use John Moore’s term) seems incredulous. If you demonise
              technology, organisation, “mass society” and “civilisation” as inherently
              authoritarian, you cannot turn round and advocate their use in a transition
              period or even in a free society. As such, the critique points to a mode of
              action and a vision of a free society and to suggest otherwise is simply
              incredulous. Equally, if you praise foraging bands and shifting horticultural
              communities of past and present as examples of anarchy then critics are
              entitled to conclude that primitivists desire a similar system for the future.
              This is reinforced by the critiques of industry, technology, “mass society” and
              agriculture.
                 Until such time as “primitivists” clearly state which of the two forms of
              primitivism they subscribe to, other anarchists will not take their ideas that
              seriously. Given that they fail to answer such basic questions of how they plan
              to deactivate industry safely and avoid mass starvation without the workers’
              control, international links and federal organisation they habitually dismiss
              out of hand as new forms of “governance,” other anarchists do not hold much
              hope that it will happen soon. Ultimately, we are faced with the fact that a
              revolution will start in society as it is. Anarchism recognises this and suggests
              a means of transforming it. Primitivism shies away from such minor problems
              and, consequently, has little to recommend it in most anarchists’ eyes.
                 This is not to suggest, of course, that non-primitivist anarchists think that
              everyone in a free society must have the same level of technology. Far from it.

              An anarchist society would be based on free experimentation. Diﬀerent
              individuals and groups will pick the way of life that best suits them. Those
              who seek less technological ways of living will be free to do so as will those
              who want to apply the beneﬁts of (appropriate) technologies. Similarly, all
              anarchists support the struggles of those in the developing world against the
              onslaught of (capitalist) civilisation and the demands of (capitalist) progress.
                For more on “primitivist” anarchism see John Zerzan’s Future Primitive as
              well as David Watson’s Beyond Bookchin and Against the Mega-Machine.
              Ken Knabb’s essay The Poverty of Primitivism is an excellent critique of
              primitivism as is Brian Oliver Sheppard’s Anarchism vs. Primitivism.
              A.4 Who are the major anarchist thinkers?
                Although Gerard Winstanley (The New Law of Righteousness, 1649) and
              William Godwin (Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, 1793) had begun to
              unfold the philosophy of anarchism in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was not
              until the second half of the 19th century that anarchism emerged as a
              coherent theory with a systematic, developed programme. This work was
              mainly started by four people — a German, Max Stirner (1806–1856), a
              Frenchman, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), and two Russians,
              Michael Bakunin (1814–1876) and Peter Kropotkin (1842–1921). They
              took the ideas in common circulation within sections of the working
              population and expressed them in written form.
                Born in the atmosphere of German romantic philosophy, Stirner’s anarchism
              (set forth in The Ego and Its Own) was an extreme form of individualism, or
              egoism, which placed the unique individual above all else — state, property,
              law or duty. His ideas remain a cornerstone of anarchism. Stirner attacked
              both capitalism and state socialism, laying the foundations of both social and
              individualist anarchism by his egoist critique of capitalism and the state that
              supports it. In place of the state and capitalism, Max Stirner urges the “union
              of egoists,” free associations of unique individuals who co-operate as equals in
              order to maximise their freedom and satisfy their desires (including emotional
              ones for solidarity, or “intercourse” as Stirner called it). Such a union would
              be non-hierarchical, for, as Stirner wonders, “is an association, wherein most
              members allow themselves to be lulled as regards their most natural and most
              obvious interests, actually an Egoist’s association? Can they really be ‘Egoists’
              who have banded together when one is a slave or a serf of the other?” [No
              Gods, No Masters, vol. 1, p. 24]
                Individualism by deﬁnition includes no concrete programme for changing
              social conditions. This was attempted by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the ﬁrst to
              describe himself openly as an anarchist. His theories of mutualism,
              federalism and workers’ self-management and association had a profound
              eﬀect on the growth of anarchism as a mass movement and spelled out clearly
              how an anarchist world could function and be co-ordinated. It would be no
              exaggeration to state that Proudhon’s work deﬁned the fundamental nature of
              anarchism as both an anti-state and anti-capitalist movement and set of ideas.
              Bakunin, Kropotkin and Tucker all claimed inspiration from his ideas and they
              are the immediate source for both social and individualist anarchism, with
              each thread emphasising diﬀerent aspects of mutualism (for example, social
178 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              anarchists stress the associational aspect of them while individualist
              anarchists the non-capitalist market side). Proudhon’s major works include
              What is Property, System of Economical Contradictions, The Principle
              of Federation and, and The Political Capacity of the Working Classes.
              His most detailed discussion of what mutualism would look like can be found
              in his The General Idea of the Revolution. His ideas heavily inﬂuenced
              both the French Labour movement and the Paris Commune of 1871.
                 Proudhon’s ideas were built upon by Michael Bakunin, who humbly
              suggested that his own ideas were simply Proudhon’s “widely developed and
              pushed right to … [their] ﬁnal consequences.” [Michael Bakunin: Selected
              Writings, p. 198] However, he is doing a disservice to his own role in
              developing anarchism. For Bakunin is the central ﬁgure in the development of
              modern anarchist activism and ideas. He emphasised the importance of
              collectivism, mass insurrection, revolution and involvement in the militant
              labour movement as the means of creating a free, classless society.
              Moreover, he repudiated Proudhon’s sexism and added patriarchy to the list
              of social evils anarchism opposes. Bakunin also emphasised the social nature
              of humanity and individuality, rejecting the abstract individualism of
              liberalism as a denial of freedom. His ideas become dominant in the 20th
              century among large sections of the radical labour movement. Indeed, many
              of his ideas are almost identical to what would later be called syndicalism or
              anarcho-syndicalism. Bakunin inﬂuenced many union movements — especially
              in Spain, where a major anarchist social revolution took place in 1936. His
              works include Anarchy and Statism (his only book), God and the State,
              The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State, and many others.
              Bakunin on Anarchism, edited by Sam Dolgoﬀ is an excellent collection of
              his major writings. Brian Morris’ Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom is
              an excellent introduction to Bakunin’s life and ideas.
                 Peter Kropotkin, a scientist by training, fashioned a sophisticated and
              detailed anarchist analysis of modern conditions linked to a thorough-going
              prescription for a future society — communist-anarchism — which
              continues to be the most widely-held theory among anarchists. He identiﬁed
              mutual aid as the best means by which individuals can develop and grow,
              pointing out that competition within humanity (and other species) was often
              not in the best interests of those involved. Like Bakunin, he stressed the
              importance of direct, economic, class struggle and anarchist participation in
              any popular movement, particularly in labour unions. Taking Proudhon’s and
              Bakunin’s idea of the commune, he generalised their insights into a vision of
              how the social, economic and personal life of a free society would function. He
              aimed to base anarchism “on a scientiﬁc basis by the study of the tendencies
              that are apparent now in society and may indicate its further evolution”
              towards anarchy while, at the same time, urging anarchists to “promote their
              ideas directly amongst the labour organisations and to induce those union to a
              direct struggle against capital, without placing their faith in parliamentary
              legislation.” [Anarchism, p. 298 and p. 287] Like Bakunin, he was a
              revolutionary and, like Bakunin, his ideas inspired those struggle for freedom
              across the globe. His major works included Mutual Aid, The Conquest of
              Bread, Field, Factories, and Workshops, Modern Science and
              Anarchism, Act for Yourselves, The State: Its Historic Role, Words of a

              Rebel, and many others. A collection of his revolutionary pamphlets is
              available under the title Anarchism and is essential reading for anyone
              interested in his ideas. In Addition, Graham Purchase’s Evolution and
              Revolution and Kropotkin: The Politics of Community by Brain Morris
              are both excellent evaluations of his ideas and how they are still relevant
              today.
                The various theories proposed by these “founding anarchists” are not,
              however, mutually exclusive: they are interconnected in many ways, and to
              some extent refer to diﬀerent levels of social life. Individualism relates closely
              to the conduct of our private lives: only by recognising the uniqueness and
              freedom of others and forming unions with them can we protect and maximise
              our own uniqueness and liberty; mutualism relates to our general relations
              with others: by mutually working together and co-operating we ensure that
              we do not work for others. Production under anarchism would be collectivist,
              with people working together for their own, and the common, good, and in the
              wider political and social world decisions would be reached communally.
                It should also be stressed that anarchist schools of thought are not named
              after individual anarchists. Thus anarchists are not “Bakuninists”,
              “Proudhonists” or “Kropotkinists” (to name three possibilities). Anarchists, to
              quote Malatesta, “follow ideas and not men, and rebel against this habit of
              embodying a principle in a man.” This did not stop him calling Bakunin “our
              great master and inspiration.” [Errico Malatesta: Life and Ideas, p. 199
              and p. 209] Equally, not everything written by a famous anarchist thinker is
              automatically libertarian. Bakunin, for example, only became an anarchist in
              the last ten years of his life (this does not stop Marxists using his preanarchist days to attack anarchism!). Proudhon turned away from anarchism
              in the 1850s before returning to a more anarchistic (if not strictly anarchist)
              position just before his death in 1865. Similarly, Kropotkin’s or Tucker’s
              arguments in favour of supporting the Allies during the First World War had
              nothing to do with anarchism. Thus to say, for example, that anarchism is
              ﬂawed because Proudhon was a sexist pig simply does not convince
              anarchists. No one would dismiss democracy, for example, because Rousseau
              opinions on women were just as sexist as Proudhon’s. As with anything,
              modern anarchists analyse the writings of previous anarchists to draw
              inspiration, but a dogma. Consequently, we reject the non-libertarian ideas of
              “famous” anarchists while keeping their positive contributions to the
              development of anarchist theory. We are sorry to belabour the point, but much
              of Marxist “criticism” of anarchism basically involves pointing out the
              negative aspects of dead anarchist thinkers and it is best simply to state
              clearly the obvious stupidity of such an approach.
                Anarchist ideas of course did not stop developing when Kropotkin died.
              Neither are they the products of just four men. Anarchism is by its very
              nature an evolving theory, with many diﬀerent thinkers and activists. When
              Bakunin and Kropotkin were alive, for example, they drew aspects of their
              ideas from other libertarian activists. Bakunin, for example, built upon the
              practical activity of the followers of Proudhon in the French labour movement
              in the 1860s. Kropotkin, while the most associated with developing the theory
              communist-anarchism, was simply the most famous expounder of the ideas
              that had developed after Bakunin’s death in the libertarian wing of the First
180 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              International and before he became an anarchist. Thus anarchism is the
              product of tens of thousands of thinkers and activists across the globe, each
              shaping and developing anarchist theory to meet their needs as part of the
              general movement for social change. Of the many other anarchists who could
              be mentioned here, we can mention but a few.
                Stirner is not the only famous anarchist to come from Germany. It also
              produced a number of original anarchist thinkers. Gustav Landauer was
              expelled from the Marxist Social-Democratic Party for his radical views and
              soon after identiﬁed himself as an anarchist. For him, anarchy was “the
              expression of the liberation of man from the idols of state, the church and
              capital” and he fought ”State socialism, levelling from above, bureaucracy” in
              favour of “free association and union, the absence of authority.” His ideas
              were a combination of Proudhon’s and Kropotkin’s and he saw the
              development of self-managed communities and co-operatives as the means of
              changing society. He is most famous for his insight that the “state is a
              condition, a certain relationship among human beings, a mode of behaviour
              between them; we destroy it by contracting other relationships, by behaving
              diﬀerently towards one another.” [quoted by Peter Marshall, Demanding the
              Impossible, p. 410 and p. 411] He took a leading part in the Munich
              revolution of 1919 and was murdered during its crushing by the German
              state. His book For Socialism is an excellent summary of his main ideas.
                Other notable German anarchists include Johann Most, originally a Marxist
              and an elected member of the Reichstag, he saw the futility of voting and
              became an anarchist after being exiled for writing against the Kaiser and
              clergy. He played an important role in the American anarchist movement,
              working for a time with Emma Goldman. More a propagandist than a great
              thinker, his revolutionary message inspired numerous people to become
              anarchists. Then there is Rudolf Rocker, a bookbinder by trade who played an
              important role in the Jewish labour movement in the East End of London (see
              his autobiography, The London Years, for details). He also produced the
              deﬁnite introduction to Anarcho-syndicalism as well as analysing the
              Russian Revolution in articles like Anarchism and Sovietism and defending
              the Spanish revolution in pamphlets like The Tragedy of Spain. His
              Nationalism and Culture is a searching analysis of human culture through
              the ages, with an analysis of both political thinkers and power politics. He
              dissects nationalism and explains how the nation is not the cause but the
              result of the state as well as repudiating race science for the nonsense it is.
                In the United States Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were two of
              the leading anarchist thinkers and activists. Goldman united Stirner’s egoism
              with Kropotkin’s communism into a passionate and powerful theory which
              combined the best of both. She also placed anarchism at the centre of
              feminist theory and activism as well as being an advocate of syndicalism (see
              her book Anarchism and Other Essays and the collection of essays, articles
              and talks entitled Red Emma Speaks). Alexander Berkman, Emma’s lifelong
              companion, produced a classic introduction to anarchist ideas called What is
              Anarchism? (also known as What is Communist Anarchism? and the ABC
              of Anarchism). Like Goldman, he supported anarchist involvement in the
              labour movement was a proliﬁc writer and speaker (the book Life of An
              Anarchist gives an excellent selection of his best articles, books and

              pamphlets). Both were involved in editing anarchist journals, with Goldman
              most associated with Mother Earth (see Anarchy! An Anthology of Emma
              Goldman’s Mother Earth edited by Peter Glassgold) and Berkman The
              Blast (reprinted in full in 2005). Both journals were closed down when the
              two anarchists were arrested in 1917 for their anti-war activism.
                In December 1919, both he and Goldman were expelled by the US
              government to Russia after the 1917 revolution had radicalised signiﬁcant
              parts of the American population. There as they were considered too
              dangerous to be allowed to remain in the land of the free. Exactly two years
              later, their passports arrived to allow them to leave Russia. The Bolshevik
              slaughter of the Kronstadt revolt in March 1921 after the civil war ended had
              ﬁnally convinced them that the Bolshevik dictatorship meant the death of the
              revolution there. The Bolshevik rulers were more than happy to see the back
              of two genuine revolutionaries who stayed true to their principles. Once
              outside Russia, Berkman wrote numerous articles on the fate of the revolution
              (including The Russian Tragedy and The Kronstadt Rebellion) as well as
              publishing his diary in book from as The Bolshevik Myth. Goldman produced
              her classic work My Disillusionment in Russia as well as publishing her
              famous autobiography Living My Life. She also found time to refute
              Trotsky’s lies about the Kronstadt rebellion in Trotsky Protests Too Much.
                As well as Berkman and Goldman, the United States also produced other
              notable activists and thinkers. Voltairine de Cleyre played an important role in
              the US anarchist movement, enriching both US and international anarchist
              theory with her articles, poems and speeches. Her work includes such classics
              as Anarchism and American Traditions, Direct Action, Sex Slavery and
              The Dominant Idea. These are included, along with other articles and some
              of her famous poems, in The Voltairine de Cleyre Reader. These and other
              important essays are included in Exquisite Rebel, another anthology of her
              writings, while Eugenia C. Delamotte’s Gates of Freedom provides an
              excellent overview of her life and ideas as well as selections from her works.
              In addition, the book Anarchy! An Anthology of Emma Goldman’s Mother
              Earth contains a good selection of her writings as well as other anarchists
              active at the time. Also of interest is the collection of the speeches she made
              to mark the state murder of the Chicago Martyrs in 1886 (see the First
              Mayday: The Haymarket Speeches 1895–1910). Every November the 11th,
              except when illness made it impossible, she spoke in their memory. For those
              interested in the ideas of that previous generation of anarchists which the
              Chicago Martyrs represented, Albert Parsons’ Anarchism: Its Philosophy
              and Scientiﬁc Basis is essential reading. His wife, Lucy Parsons, was also an
              outstanding anarchist activist from the 1870s until her death in 1942 and
              selections of her writings and speeches can be found in the book Freedom,
              Equality & Solidarity (edited by Gale Ahrens).
                Elsewhere in the Americas, Ricardo Flores Magon helped lay the ground for
              the Mexican revolution of 1910 by founding the (strangely named) Mexican
              Liberal Party in 1905 which organised two unsuccessful uprising against the
              Diaz dictatorship in 1906 and 1908. Through his paper Tierra y Libertad
              (“Land and Liberty”) he inﬂuenced the developing labour movement as well as
              Zapata’s peasant army. He continually stressed the need to turn the
              revolution into a social revolution which will “give the lands to the people” as
182 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              well as “possession of the factories, mines, etc.” Only this would ensure that
              the people “will not be deceived.” Talking of the Agrarians (the Zapatista
              army), Ricardo’s brother Enrique he notes that they “are more or less inclined
              towards anarchism” and they can work together because both are “direct
              actionists” and “they act perfectly revolutionary. They go after the rich, the
              authorities and the priestcraft” and have “burnt to ashes private property
              deeds as well as all oﬀicial records” as well as having “thrown down the
              fences that marked private properties.” Thus the anarchists “propagate our
              principles” while the Zapatista’s “put them into practice.” [quoted by David
              Poole, Land and Liberty, p. 17 and p. 25] Ricardo died as a political prisoner
              in an American jail and is, ironically, considered a hero of the revolution by
              the Mexican state. A substantial collection of his writings are available in the
              book Dreams of Freedom (which includes an impressive biographical essay
              which discusses his inﬂuence as well as placing his work in historical
              context).
                Italy, with its strong and dynamic anarchist movement, has produced some
              of the best anarchist writers. Errico Malatesta spent over 50 years ﬁghting for
              anarchism across the world and his writings are amongst the best in anarchist
              theory. For those interested in his practical and inspiring ideas then his short
              pamphlet Anarchy cannot be beaten. Collections of his articles can be found
              in The Anarchist Revolution and Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas,
              both edited by Vernon Richards. A favourite writing technique was the use of
              dialogues, such as At the Cafe: Conversations on Anarchism. These, using
              the conversations he had with non-anarchists as their basis, explained
              anarchist ideas in a clear and down to Earth manner. Another dialogue, Fra
              Contadini: A Dialogue on Anarchy, was translated into many languages,
              with 100,000 copies printed in Italy in 1920 when the revolution Malatesta
              had fought for all his life looked likely. At this time Malatesta edited Umanita
              Nova (the ﬁrst Italian daily anarchist paper, it soon gained a circulation of 50
              000) as well as writing the programme for the Unione Anarchica Italiana, a
              national anarchist organisation of some 20 000. For his activities during the
              factory occupations he was arrested at the age of 67 along with 80 other
              anarchists activists. Other Italian anarchists of note include Malatesta’s friend
              Luigi Fabbri (sadly little of his work has been translated into English bar
              Bourgeois Inﬂuences on Anarchism and Anarchy and ‘Scientiﬁc’
              Communism) Luigi Galleani produced a very powerful anti-organisational
              anarchist-communism which proclaimed (in The End of Anarchism?) that
              “Communism is simply the economic foundation by which the individual has
              the opportunity to regulate himself and carry out his functions.” Camillo
              Berneri, before being murdered by the Communists during the Spanish
              Revolution, continued the ﬁne tradition of critical, practical anarchism
              associated with Italian anarchism. His study of Kropotkin’s federalist ideas is
              a classic (Peter Kropotkin: His Federalist Ideas). His daughter MarieLouise Berneri, before her tragic early death, contributed to the British
              anarchist press (see her Neither East Nor West: Selected Writings 1939–
              48 and Journey Through Utopia).
                In Japan, Hatta Shuzo developed Kropotkin’s communist-anarchism in new
              directions between the world wars. Called “true anarchism,” he created an
              anarchism which was a concrete alternative to the mainly peasant country he
183 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              and thousands of his comrades were active in. While rejecting certain aspects
              of syndicalism, they organised workers into unions as well as working with
              the peasantry for the “foundation stones on which to build the new society
              that we long for are none other than the awakening of the tenant farmers”
              who “account for a majority of the population.” Their new society was based
              on decentralised communes which combined industry and agriculture for, as
              one of Hatta’s comrade’s put it, “the village will cease to be a mere
              communist agricultural village and become a co-operative society which is a
              fusion of agriculture and industry.” Hatta rejected the idea that they sought to
              go back to an ideal past, stating that the anarchists were “completely opposite
              to the medievalists. We seek to use machines as means of production and,
              indeed, hope for the invention of yet more ingenious machines.” [quoted by
              John Crump, Hatta Shuzo and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan, p. 122–
              3, and p. 144]
                As far as individualist anarchism goes, the undoubted “pope” was Benjamin
              Tucker. Tucker, in his Instead of Book, used his intellect and wit to attack all
              who he considered enemies of freedom (mostly capitalists, but also a few
              social anarchists as well! For example, Tucker excommunicated Kropotkin
              and the other communist-anarchists from anarchism. Kropotkin did not return
              the favour). Tucker built on the such notable thinkers as Josiah Warren,
              Lysander Spooner, Stephen Pearl Andrews and William B. Greene, adapting
              Proudhon’s mutualism to the conditions of pre-capitalist America (see Rudolf
              Rocker’s Pioneers of American Freedom for details). Defending the worker,
              artisan and small-scale farmer from a state intent on building capitalism by
              means of state intervention, Tucker argued that capitalist exploitation would
              be abolished by creating a totally free non-capitalist market in which the four
              state monopolies used to create capitalism would be struck down by means of
              mutual banking and “occupancy and use” land and resource rights. Placing
              himself ﬁrmly in the socialist camp, he recognised (like Proudhon) that all
              non-labour income was theft and so opposed proﬁt, rent and interest. he
              translated Proudhon’s What is Property and System of Economical
              Contradictions as well as Bakunin’s God and the State. Tucker’s
              compatriot, Joseph Labadie was an active trade unionist as well as contributor
              to Tucker’s paper Liberty. His son, Lawrence Labadie carried the
              individualist-anarchist torch after Tucker’s death, believing that “that
              freedom in every walk of life is the greatest possible means of elevating the
              human race to happier conditions.”
                Undoubtedly the Russian Leo Tolstoy is the most famous writer associated
              with religious anarchism and has had the greatest impact in spreading the
              spiritual and paciﬁstic ideas associated with that tendency. Inﬂuencing such
              notable people as Gandhi and the Catholic Worker Group around Dorothy
              Day, Tolstoy presented a radical interpretation of Christianity which stressed
              individual responsibility and freedom above the mindless authoritarianism
              and hierarchy which marks so much of mainstream Christianity. Tolstoy’s
              works, like those of that other radical libertarian Christian William Blake,
              have inspired many Christians towards a libertarian vision of Jesus’ message
              which has been hidden by the mainstream churches. Thus Christian
              Anarchism maintains, along with Tolstoy, that “Christianity in its true sense
              puts an end to government” (see, for example, Tolstoy’s The Kingdom of
184 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              God is within you and Peter Marshall’s William Blake: Visionary
              Anarchist).
                More recently, Noam Chomsky (in such works as Deterring Democracy,
              Necessary Illusions, World Orders, Old and New, Rogue States,
              Hegemony or Survival and many others) and Murray Bookchin (PostScarcity Anarchism, The Ecology of Freedom, Towards an Ecological
              Society, and Remaking Society, among others) have kept the social
              anarchist movement at the front of political theory and analysis. Bookchin’s
              work has placed anarchism at the centre of green thought and has been a
              constant threat to those wishing to mystify or corrupt the movement to create
              an ecological society. The Murray Bookchin Reader contains a
              representative selection of his writings. Sadly, a few years before his death
              Bookchin distanced himself from the anarchism he spent nearly four decades
              advocating (although he remained a libertarian socialist to the end).
              Chomsky’s well documented critiques of U.S. imperialism and how the media
              operates are his most famous works, but he has also written extensively about
              the anarchist tradition and its ideas, most famously in his essays “Notes on
              Anarchism” (in For Reasons of State) and his defence of the anarchist social
              revolution against bourgeois historians in “Objectivity and Liberal
              Scholarship” (in American Power and the New Mandarins). These and
              others of his more explicitly anarchist essays and interviews can be found in
              the collection Chomsky on Anarchism. Other good sources for his anarchist
              ideas are Radical Priorities, Language and Politics and the pamphlet
              Government in the Future. Both Understanding Power and The
              Chomsky Reader are excellent introductions to his thought.
                Britain has also seen an important series of anarchist thinkers. Hebert Read
              (probably the only anarchist to ever accept a knighthood!) wrote several
              works on anarchist philosophy and theory (see his Anarchy and Order
              compilation of essays). His anarchism ﬂowered directly from his aesthetic
              concerns and he was a committed paciﬁst. As well as giving fresh insight and
              expression to the tradition themes of anarchism, he contributed regularly to
              the anarchist press (see the collection of articles A One-Man Manifesto and
              other writings from Freedom Press). Another paciﬁst anarchist was Alex
              Comfort. As well as writing the Joy of Sex, Comfort was an active paciﬁst and
              anarchist. He wrote particularly on paciﬁsm, psychiatry and sexual politics
              from a libertarian perspective. His most famous anarchist book was
              Authority and Delinquency and a collection of his anarchist pamphlets and
              articles was published under the title Writings against Power and Death.
                However, the most famous and inﬂuential British anarchist must be Colin
              Ward. He became an anarchist when stationed in Glasgow during the Second
              World War and came across the local anarchist group there. Once an
              anarchist, he has contributed to the anarchist press extensively. As well as
              being an editor of Freedom, he also edited the inﬂuential monthly magazine
              Anarchy during the 1960s (a selection of articles picked by Ward can be
              found in the book A Decade of Anarchy). However, his most famous single
              book is Anarchy in Action where he has updated Kropotkin’s Mutual Aid by
              uncovering and documenting the anarchistic nature of everyday life even
              within capitalism. His extensive writing on housing has emphasised the
              importance of collective self-help and social management of housing against
185 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              the twin evils of privatisation and nationalisation (see, for example, his books
              Talking Houses and Housing: An Anarchist Approach). He has cast an
              anarchist eye on numerous other issues, including water use (Reﬂected in
              Water: A Crisis of Social Responsibility), transport (Freedom to go: after the
              motor age) and the welfare state (Social Policy: an anarchist response).
              His Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction is a good starting point for
              discovering anarchism and his particular perspective on it while Talking
              Anarchy provides an excellent overview of both his ideas and life. Lastly we
              must mention both Albert Meltzer and Nicolas Walter, both of whom
              contributed extensively to the anarchist press as well as writing two well
              known short introductions to anarchism (Anarchism: Arguments for and
              against and About Anarchism, respectively).
                 We could go on; there are many more writers we could mention. But besides
              these, there are the thousands of “ordinary” anarchist militants who have
              never written books but whose common sense and activism have encouraged
              the spirit of revolt within society and helped build the new world in the shell
              of the old. As Kropotkin put it, “anarchism was born among the people; and
              it will continue to be full of life and creative power only as long as it remains a
              thing of the people.” [Anarchism, p. 146]
                 So we hope that this concentration on anarchist thinkers should not be
              taken to mean that there is some sort of division between activists and
              intellectuals in the movement. Far from it. Few anarchists are purely thinkers
              or activists. They are usually both. Kropotkin, for example, was jailed for his
              activism, as was Malatesta and Goldman. Makhno, most famous as an active
              participate in the Russian Revolution, also contributed theoretical articles to
              the anarchist press during and after it. The same can be said of Louise
              Michel, whose militant activities during the Paris Commune and in building
              the anarchist movement in France after it did not preclude her writing
              articles for the libertarian press. We are simply indicating key anarchists
              thinkers so that those interested can read about their ideas directly.
              A.4.1 Are there any thinkers close to anarchism?
                 Yes. There are numerous thinkers who are close to anarchism. They come
              from both the liberal and socialist traditions. While this may be considered
              surprising, it is not. Anarchism has links with both ideologies. Obviously the
              individualist anarchists are closest to the liberal tradition while social
              anarchists are closest to the socialist.
                 Indeed, as Nicholas Walter put it, “Anarchism can be seen as a development
              from either liberalism or socialism, or from both liberalism and socialism. Like
              liberals, anarchists want freedom; like socialists, anarchists want equality.”
              However, “anarchism is not just a mixture of liberalism and socialism … we
              diﬀer fundamentally from them.” [About Anarchism, p. 29 and p. 31] In this
              he echoes Rocker’s comments in Anarcho-Syndicalism. And this can be a
              useful tool for seeing the links between anarchism and other theories however
              it must be stressed that anarchism oﬀers an anarchist critique of both
              liberalism and socialism and we should not submerge the uniqueness of
              anarchism into other philosophies.

                Section A.4.2 discusses liberal thinkers who are close to anarchism, while
              section A.4.3 highlights those socialists who are close to anarchism. There are
              even Marxists who inject libertarian ideas into their politics and these are
              discussed in section A.4.4. And, of course, there are thinkers who cannot be
              so easily categorised and will be discussed here.
                Economist David Ellerman has produced an impressive body of work
              arguing for workplace democracy. Explicitly linking his ideas the early British
              Ricardian socialists and Proudhon, in such works as The Democratic
              Worker-Owned Firm and Property and Contract in Economics he has
              presented both a rights based and labour-property based defence of selfmanagement against capitalism. He argues that ”[t]oday’s economic
              democrats are the new abolitionists trying to abolish the whole institution of
              renting people in favour of democratic self-management in the workplace” for
              his “critique is not new; it was developed in the Enlightenment doctrine of
              inalienable rights. It was applied by abolitionists against the voluntary selfenslavement contract and by political democrats against the voluntary
              contraction defence of non-democratic government.” [The Democratic
              Worker-Owned Firm, p. 210] Anyone, like anarchists, interested in producer
              co-operatives as alternatives to wage slavery will ﬁnd his work of immense
              interest.
                Ellerman is not the only person to stress the beneﬁts of co-operation. Alﬁe
              Kohn’s important work on the beneﬁts of co-operation builds upon Kropotkin’s
              studies of mutual aid and is, consequently, of interest to social anarchists. In
              No Contest: the case against competition and Punished by Rewards,
              Kohn discusses (with extensive empirical evidence) the failings and negative
              impact of competition on those subject to it. He addresses both economic and
              social issues in his works and shows that competition is not what it is cracked
              up to be.
                Within feminist theory, Carole Pateman is the most obvious libertarian
              inﬂuenced thinker. Independently of Ellerman, Pateman has produced a
              powerful argument for self-managed association in both the workplace and
              society as a whole. Building upon a libertarian analysis of Rousseau’s
              arguments, her analysis of contract theory is ground breaking. If a theme has
              to be ascribed to Pateman’s work it could be freedom and what it means to be
              free. For her, freedom can only be viewed as self-determination and,
              consequently, the absence of subordination. Consequently, she has advocated
              a participatory form of democracy from her ﬁrst major work, Participation
              and Democratic Theory onwards. In that book, a pioneering study of in
              participatory democracy, she exposed the limitations of liberal democratic
              theory, analysed the works of Rousseau, Mill and Cole and presented
              empirical evidence on the beneﬁts of participation on the individuals involved.
                In the Problem of Political Obligation, Pateman discusses the “liberal”
              arguments on freedom and ﬁnds them wanting. For the liberal, a person must
              consent to be ruled by another but this opens up the “problem” that they
              might not consent and, indeed, may never have consented. Thus the liberal
              state would lack a justiﬁcation. She deepens her analysis to question why
              freedom should be equated to consenting to be ruled and proposed a
              participatory democratic theory in which people collectively make their own
              decisions (a self-assumed obligation to your fellow citizens rather to a state).

              In discussing Kropotkin, she showed her awareness of the social anarchist
              tradition to which her own theory is obviously related.
                 Pateman builds on this analysis in her The Sexual Contract, where she
              dissects the sexism of classical liberal and democratic theory. She analyses
              the weakness of what calls ‘contractarian’ theory (classical liberalism and
              right-wing “libertarianism”) and shows how it leads not to free associations of
              self-governing individuals but rather social relationships based on authority,
              hierarchy and power in which a few rule the many. Her analysis of the state,
              marriage and wage labour are profoundly libertarian, showing that freedom
              must mean more than consenting to be ruled. This is the paradox of capitalist
              liberal, for a person is assumed to be free in order to consent to a contract but
              once within it they face the reality subordination to another’s decisions (see
              section A.4.2 for further discussion).
                 Her ideas challenge some of Western culture’s core beliefs about individual
              freedom and her critiques of the major Enlightenment political philosophers
              are powerful and convincing. Implicit is a critique not just of the conservative
              and liberal tradition, but of the patriarchy and hierarchy contained within the
              Left as well. As well as these works, a collection of her essays is available
              called The Disorder of Women.
                 Within the so-called “anti-globalisation” movement Naomi Klein shows an
              awareness of libertarian ideas and her own work has a libertarian thrust to it
              (we call it “so-called” as its members are internationalists, seeking a
              globalisation from below not one imposed from above by and for a few). She
              ﬁrst came to attention as the author of No Logo, which charts the growth of
              consumer capitalism, exposing the dark reality behind the glossy brands of
              capitalism and, more importantly, highlighting the resistance to it. No distant
              academic, she is an active participant in the movement she reports on in
              Fences and Windows, a collection of essays on globalisation, its
              consequences and the wave of protests against it.
                 Klein’s articles are well written and engaging, covering the reality of
              modern capitalism, the gap, as she puts it, “between rich and power but also
              between rhetoric and reality, between what is said and what is done. Between
              the promise of globalisation and its real eﬀects.” She shows how we live in a
              world where the market (i.e. capital) is made “freer” while people suﬀer
              increased state power and repression. How an unelected Argentine President
              labels that country’s popular assemblies “antidemocratic.” How rhetoric
              about liberty is used as a tool to defend and increase private power (as she
              reminds us, “always missing from [the globalisation] discussion is the issue of
              power. So many of the debates that we have about globalisation theory are
              actually about power: who holds it, who is exercising it and who is disguising
              it, pretending it no longer matters”). [Fences and Windows, pp 83–4 and p.
              83]
                 And how people across the world are resisting. As she puts it, “many [in the
              movement] are tired of being spoken for and about. They are demanding a
              more direct form of political participation.” She reports on a movement which
              she is part of, one which aims for a globalisation from below, one “founded on
              principles of transparency, accountability and self-determination, one that
              frees people instead of liberating capital.” This means being against a
              “corporate-driven globalisation . .. that is centralising power and wealth into
188 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              fewer and fewer hands” while presenting an alternative which is about
              “decentralising power and building community-based decision-making
              potential — whether through unions, neighbourhoods, farms, villages,
              anarchist collectives or aboriginal self-government.” All strong anarchist
              principles and, like anarchists, she wants people to manage their own aﬀairs
              and chronicles attempts around the world to do just that (many of which, as
              Klein notes, are anarchists or inﬂuenced by anarchist ideas, sometimes
              knowing, sometimes not). [Op. Cit., p. 77, p. 79 and p. 16]
                 While not an anarchist, she is aware that real change comes from below, by
              the self-activity of working class people ﬁghting for a better world.
              Decentralisation of power is a key idea in the book. As she puts it, the “goal”
              of the social movements she describes is “not to take power for themselves
              but to challenge power centralisation on principle” and so creating “a new
              culture of vibrant direct democracy … one that is fuelled and strengthened by
              direct participation.” She does not urge the movement to invest itself with
              new leaders and neither does she (like the Left) think that electing a few
              leaders to make decisions for us equals “democracy” (“the goal is not better
              faraway rules and rulers but close-up democracy on the ground”). Klein,
              therefore, gets to the heart of the matter. Real social change is based on
              empowering the grassroots, “the desire for self-determination, economic
              sustainability and participatory democracy.” Given this, Klein has presented
              libertarian ideas to a wide audience. [Op. Cit., p. xxvi, p. xxvi-xxvii, p. 245
              and p. 233]
                 Other notable libertarian thinkers include Henry D. Thoreau, Albert Camus,
              Aldous Huxley, Lewis Mumford, Lewis Mumford and Oscar Wilde. Thus there
              are numerous thinkers who approach anarchist conclusions and who discuss
              subjects of interest to libertarians. As Kropotkin noted a hundred years ago,
              these kinds of writers “are full of ideas which show how closely anarchism is
              interwoven with the work that is going on in modern thought in the same
              direction of enfranchisement of man from the bonds of the state as well as
              from those of capitalism.” [Anarchism, p. 300] The only change since then is
              that more names can be added to the list.
                 Peter Marshall discusses the ideas of most, but not all, of the non-anarchist
              libertarians we mention in this and subsequent sections in his book history of
              anarchism, Demanding the Impossible. Cliﬀord Harper’s Anarchy: A
              Graphic Guide is also a useful guide for ﬁnding out more.
              A.4.2 Are there any liberal thinkers close to
              anarchism?
                As noted in the last section, there are thinkers in both the liberal and
              socialist traditions who approach anarchist theory and ideals. This
              understandable as anarchism shares certain ideas and ideals with both.
                However, as will become clear in sections A.4.3 and A.4.4, anarchism shares
              most common ground with the socialist tradition it is a part of. This is because
              classical liberalism is a profoundly elitist tradition. The works of Locke and
              the tradition he inspired aimed to justify hierarchy, state and private property.
              As Carole Pateman notes, “Locke’s state of nature, with its father-rulers and
189 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              capitalist economy, would certainly not ﬁnd favour with anarchists” any more
              than his vision of the social contract and the liberal state it creates. A state,
              which as Pateman recounts, in which “only males who own substantial
              amounts of material property are [the] politically relevant members of
              society” and exists “precisely to preserve the property relationships of the
              developing capitalist market economy, not to disturb them.” For the majority,
              the non-propertied, they expressed “tacit consent” to be ruled by the few by
              “choosing to remain within the one’s country of birth when reaching
              adulthood.” [The Problem of Political Obligation, p. 141, p. 71, p. 78 and
              p. 73]
                 Thus anarchism is at odds with what can be called the pro-capitalist liberal
              tradition which, ﬂowing from Locke, builds upon his rationales for hierarchy.
              As David Ellerman notes, “there is a whole liberal tradition of apologising for
              non-democratic government based on consent — on a voluntary social
              contract alienating governing rights to a sovereign.” In economics, this is
              reﬂected in their support for wage labour and the capitalist autocracy it
              creates for the “employment contract is the modern limited workplace
              version” of such contracts. [The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm, p. 210]
              This pro-capitalist liberalism essentially boils down to the liberty to pick a
              master or, if you are among the lucky few, to become a master yourself. The
              idea that freedom means self-determination for all at all times is alien to it.
              Rather it is based on the idea of “self-ownership,” that you “own” yourself and
              your rights. Consequently, you can sell (alienate) your rights and liberty on
              the market. As we discuss in section B.4, in practice this means that most
              people are subject to autocratic rule for most of their waking hours (whether
              in work or in marriage).
                 The modern equivalent of classical liberalism is the right-wing “libertarian”
              tradition associated with Milton Friedman, Robert Nozick, von Hayek and so
              forth. As they aim to reduce the state to simply the defender to private
              property and enforcer of the hierarchies that social institution creates, they
              can by no stretch of the imagination be considered near anarchism. What is
              called “liberalism” in, say, the United States is a more democratic liberal
              tradition and has, like anarchism, little in common with the shrill procapitalist defenders of the minimum state. While they may (sometimes) be
              happy to denounce the state’s attacks on individual liberty, they are more than
              happy to defend the “freedom” of the property owner to impose exactly the
              same restrictions on those who use their land or capital.
                 Given that feudalism combined ownership and rulership, that the
              governance of people living on land was an attribute of the ownership of that
              land, it would be no exaggeration to say that the right-wing “libertarian”
              tradition is simply its modern (voluntary) form. It is no more libertarian than
              the feudal lords who combated the powers of the King in order to protect
              their power over their own land and serfs. As Chomsky notes, “the
              ‘libertarian’ doctrines that are fashionable in the US and UK particularly …
              seem to me to reduce to advocacy of one or another form of illegitimate
              authority, quite often real tyranny.” [Marxism, Anarchism, and Alternative
              Futures, p. 777] Moreover, as Benjamin Tucker noted with regards their
              predecessors, while they are happy to attack any state regulation which
              beneﬁts the many or limits their power, they are silent on the laws (and
190 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              regulations and “rights”) which beneﬁt the few.
                However there is another liberal tradition, one which is essentially precapitalist which has more in common with the aspirations of anarchism. As
              Chomsky put it:
                   “These ideas [of anarchism] grow out the Enlightenment; their roots
                   are in Rousseau’s Discourse on Inequality, Humbolt’s The Limits
                   of State Action, Kant’s insistence, in his defence of the French
                   Revolution, that freedom is the precondition for acquiring the
                   maturity for freedom, not a gift to be granted when such maturity is
                   achieved .. . With the development of industrial capitalism, a new
                   and unanticipated system of injustice, it is libertarian socialism that
                   has preserved and extended the radical humanist message of the
                   Enlightenment and the classical liberal ideals that were perverted
                   into an ideology to sustain the emerging social order. In fact, on the
                   very same assumptions that led classical liberalism to oppose the
                   intervention of the state in social life, capitalist social relations are
                   also intolerable. This is clear, for example, from the classic work of
                   [Wilhelm von] Humboldt, The Limits of State Action, which
                   anticipated and perhaps inspired [John Stuart] Mill … This classic of
                   liberal thought, completed in 1792, is in its essence profoundly,
                   though prematurely, anticapitalist. Its ideas must be attenuated
                   beyond recognition to be transmuted into an ideology of industrial
                   capitalism.” [“Notes on Anarchism”, For Reasons of State, p. 156]
                 Chomsky discusses this in more detail in his essay “Language and Freedom”
              (contained in both Reason of State and The Chomsky Reader). As well as
              Humbolt and Mill, such “pre-capitalist” liberals would include such radicals as
              Thomas Paine, who envisioned a society based on artisan and small farmers
              (i.e. a pre-capitalist economy) with a rough level of social equality and, of
              course, a minimal government. His ideas inspired working class radicals
              across the world and, as E.P. Thompson reminds us, Paine’s Rights of Man
              was “a foundation-text of the English [and Scottish] working-class
              movement.” While his ideas on government are “close to a theory of
              anarchism,” his reform proposals “set a source towards the social legislation
              of the twentieth century.” [The Making of the English Working Class, p.
              99, p. 101 and p. 102] His combination of concern for liberty and social justice
              places him close to anarchism.
                 Then there is Adam Smith. While the right (particularly elements of the
              “libertarian” right) claim him as a classic liberal, his ideas are more complex
              than that. For example, as Noam Chomsky points out, Smith advocated the
              free market because “it would lead to perfect equality, equality of condition,
              not just equality of opportunity.” [Class Warfare, p. 124] As Smith himself
              put it, “in a society where things were left to follow their natural course,
              where there is perfect liberty” it would mean that “advantages would soon
              return to the level of other employments” and so “the diﬀerent employments
              of labour and stock must … be either perfectly equal or continually tending to
              equality.” Nor did he oppose state intervention or state aid for the working
              classes. For example, he advocated public education to counter the negative
              eﬀects of the division of labour. Moreover, he was against state intervention
191 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              because whenever “a legislature attempts to regulate diﬀerences between
              masters and their workmen, its counsellors are always the masters. When
              regulation, therefore, is in favour of the workmen, it is always just and
              equitable; but it is otherwise when in favour of the masters.” He notes how
              “the law” would “punish” workers’ combinations “very severely” while
              ignoring the masters’ combinations (“if it dealt impartially, it would treat the
              masters in the same manner”). [The Wealth of Nations, p. 88 and p. 129]
              Thus state intervention was to be opposed in general because the state was
              run by the few for the few, which would make state intervention beneﬁt the
              few, not the many. It is doubtful Smith would have left his ideas on laissezfaire unchanged if he had lived to see the development of corporate
              capitalism. It is this critical edge of Smith’s work are conveniently ignored by
              those claiming him for the classical liberal tradition.
                Smith, argues Chomsky, was “a pre-capitalist and anti-capitalist person with
              roots in the Enlightenment.” Yes, he argues, “the classical liberals, the
              [Thomas] Jeﬀersons and the Smiths, were opposing the concentrations of
              power that they saw around them … They didn’t see other forms of
              concentration of power which only developed later. When they did see them,
              they didn’t like them. Jeﬀerson was a good example. He was strongly opposed
              to the concentrations of power that he saw developing, and warned that the
              banking institutions and the industrial corporations which were barely coming
              into existence in his day would destroy the achievements of the Revolution.”
              [Op. Cit., p. 125]
                As Murray Bookchin notes, Jeﬀerson “is most clearly identiﬁed in the early
              history of the United States with the political demands and interests of the
              independent farmer-proprietor.” [The Third Revolution, vol. 1, pp. 188–9] In
              other words, with pre-capitalist economic forms. We also ﬁnd Jeﬀerson
              contrasting the “aristocrats” and the “democrats.” The former are “those who
              fear and distrust the people, and wish to draw all powers from them into the
              hands of the higher classes.” The democrats “identify with the people, have
              conﬁdence in them, cherish and consider them as the honest & safe …
              depository of the public interest,” if not always “the most wise.” [quoted by
              Chomsky, Powers and Prospects, p. 88] As Chomsky notes, the “aristocrats”
              were “the advocates of the rising capitalist state, which Jeﬀerson regarded
              with dismay, recognising the obvious contradiction between democracy and
              the capitalism.” [Op. Cit., p. 88] Claudio J. Katz’s essay on “Thomas
              Jeﬀerson’s Liberal Anticapitalism” usefully explores these issues. [American
              Journal of Political Science, vol. 47, No. 1 (Jan, 2003), pp. 1–17]
                Jeﬀerson even went so far as to argue that “a little rebellion now and then is
              a good thing … It is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government
              … The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of
              patriots and tyrants.” [quoted by Howard Zinn, A People’s History of the
              United States, p. 94] However, his libertarian credentials are damaged by
              him being both a President of the United States and a slave owner but
              compared to the other “founding fathers” of the American state, his liberalism
              is of a democratic form. As Chomsky reminds us, “all the Founding Fathers
              hated democracy — Thomas Jeﬀerson was a partial exception, but only
              partial.” The American state, as a classical liberal state, was designed (to
              quote James Madison) “to protect the minority of the opulent from the
192 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              majority.” Or, to repeat John Jay’s principle, the “people who own the country
              ought to govern it.” [Understanding Power, p. 315] If American is a
              (formally) democracy rather than an oligarchy, it is in spite of rather than
              because of classical liberalism.
                 Then there is John Stuart Mill who recognised the fundamental
              contradiction in classical liberalism. How can an ideology which proclaims
              itself for individual liberty support institutions which systematically nullify
              that liberty in practice? For this reason Mill attacked patriarchal marriage,
              arguing that marriage must be a voluntary association between equals, with
              “sympathy in equality … living together in love, without power on one side or
              obedience on the other.” Rejecting the idea that there had to be “an absolute
              master” in any association, he pointed out that in “partnership in business …
              it is not found or thought necessary to enact that in every partnership, one
              partner shall have entire control over the concern, and the others shall be
              bound to obey his rule.” [“The Subjection of Women,” quoted by Susan L.
              Brown, The Politics of Individualism, pp. 45–6]
                 Yet his own example showed the ﬂaw in liberal support for capitalism, for
              the employee is subject to a relationship in which power accrues to one party
              and obedience to another. Unsurprisingly, therefore, he argued that the “form
              of association … which is mankind continue to improve, must be expected in
              the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as
              chief, and workpeople without a voice in management, but the association of
              the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital
              … and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.” [The
              Principles of Political Economy, p. 147] Autocratic management during
              working hours is hardly compatible with Mill’s maxim that ”[o]ver himself,
              over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.” Mill’s opposition to
              centralised government and wage slavery brought his ideas closer to
              anarchism than most liberals, as did his comment that the “social principle of
              the future” was “how to unite the greatest individual liberty of action with a
              common ownership in the raw materials of the globe, and equal participation
              of all in the beneﬁts of combined labour.” [quoted by Peter Marshall,
              Demanding the Impossible, p. 164] His defence of individuality, On
              Liberty, is a classic, if ﬂawed, work and his analysis of socialist tendencies
              (“Chapters on Socialism”) is worth reading for its evaluation of their pros and
              cons from a (democratic) liberal perspective.
                 Like Proudhon, Mill was a forerunner of modern-day market socialism and a
              ﬁrm supporter of decentralisation and social participation. This, argues
              Chomsky, is unsurprising for pre-capitalist classical liberal thought “is
              opposed to state intervention in social life, as a consequence of deeper
              assumptions about the human need for liberty, diversity, and free association.
              On the same assumptions, capitalist relations of production, wage labour,
              competitiveness, the ideology of ‘possessive individualism’ — all must be
              regarded as fundamentally antihuman. Libertarian socialism is properly to be
              regarded as the inheritor of the liberal ideals of the Enlightenment.” [“Notes
              on Anarchism”, Op. Cit., p. 157]
                 Thus anarchism shares commonality with pre-capitalist and democratic
              liberal forms. The hopes of these liberals were shattered with the
              development of capitalism. To quote Rudolf Rocker’s analysis:
193 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   “Liberalism and Democracy were pre-eminently political concepts,
                   and since the great majority of the original adherents of both
                   maintained the right of ownership in the old sense, these had to
## renounce them both when economic development took a course
## which could not be practically reconciled with the original
                   principles of Democracy, and still less with those of Liberalism.
                   Democracy, with its motto of ‘all citizens equal before the law,’ and
                   Liberalism with its ‘right of man over his own person,’ both
                   shipwrecked on the realities of the capitalist economic form. So long
                   as millions of human beings in every country had to sell their
                   labour-power to a small minority of owners, and to sink into the
                   most wretched misery if they could ﬁnd no buyers, the so-called
                   ‘equality before the law’ remains merely a pious fraud, since the
                   laws are made by those who ﬁnd themselves in possession of the
                   social wealth. But in the same way there can also be no talk of a
                   ‘right over one’s own person,’ for that right ends when one is
                   compelled to submit to the economic dictation of another if he does
                   not want to starve.” [Anarcho-Syndicalism, p. 10]
              A.4.3 Are there any socialist thinkers close to
              anarchism?
                Anarchism developed in response to the development of capitalism and it is
              in the non-anarchist socialist tradition which anarchism ﬁnds most fellow
              travellers.
                The earliest British socialists (the so-called Ricardian Socialists) following in
              the wake of Robert Owen held ideas which were similar to those of anarchists.
              For example, Thomas Hodgskin expounded ideas similar to Proudhon’s
              mutualism while William Thompson developed a non-state, communal form of
              socialism based on “communities of mutual co-operative” which had
              similarities to anarcho-communism (Thompson had been a mutualist before
              becoming a communist in light of the problems even a non-capitalist market
              would have). John Francis Bray is also of interest, as is the radical agrarianist
              Thomas Spence who developed a communal form of land-based socialism
              which expounded many ideas usually associated with anarchism (see “The
              Agrarian Socialism of Thomas Spence” by Brian Morris in his book Ecology
              and Anarchism). Moreover, the early British trade union movement
              “developed, stage by stage, a theory of syndicalism” 40 years before Bakunin
              and the libertarian wing of the First International did. [E.P. Thompson, The
              Making of the English Working Class, p. 912] Noel Thompson’s The Real
              Rights of Man is a good summary of all these thinkers and movements, as is
              E.P. Thompson’s classic social history of working class life (and politics) of this
              period, The Making of the English Working Class.
                Libertarian ideas did not die out in Britain in the 1840s. There was also the
              quasi-syndicalists of the Guild Socialists of the 1910s and 1920s who
              advocated a decentralised communal system with workers’ control of industry.
              G.D.H. Cole’s Guild Socialism Restated is the most famous work of this
              school, which also included author’s S.G. Hobson and A.R. Orage (Geoﬀrey
194 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              Osteregaard’s The Tradition of Workers’ Control provides an good
              summary of the ideas of Guild Socialism). Bertrand Russell, another supporter
              of Guild Socialism, was attracted to anarchist ideas and wrote an extremely
              informed and thoughtful discussion of anarchism, syndicalism and Marxism in
              his classic book Roads to Freedom.
                 While Russell was pessimistic about the possibility of anarchism in the near
              future, he felt it was “the ultimate idea to which society should approximate.”
              As a Guild Socialist, he took it for granted that there could “be no real
              freedom or democracy until the men who do the work in a business also
              control its management.” His vision of a good society is one any anarchist
              would support: “a world in which the creative spirit is alive, in which life is an
              adventure full of joy and hope, based upon the impulse to construct than upon
              the desire to retain what we possess or to seize what is possessed by others.
              It must be a world in which aﬀection has free play, in which love is purged of
              the instinct for domination, in which cruelty and envy have been dispelled by
              happiness and the unfettered development of all the instincts that build up life
              and ﬁll it with mental delights.” [quoted by Noam Chomsky, Problems of
              Knowledge and Freedom, pp. 59–60, p. 61 and p. x] An informed and
              interesting writer on many subjects, his thought and social activism has
              inﬂuenced many other thinkers, including Noam Chomsky (whose Problems
              of Knowledge and Freedom is a wide ranging discussion on some of the
              topics Russell addressed).
                 Another important British libertarian socialist thinker and activist was
              William Morris. Morris, a friend of Kropotkin, was active in the Socialist
              League and led its anti-parliamentarian wing. While stressing he was not an
              anarchist, there is little real diﬀerence between the ideas of Morris and most
              anarcho-communists (Morris said he was a communist and saw no need to
              append “anarchist” to it as, for him, communism was democratic and
              liberatory). A prominent member of the “Arts and Crafts” movement, Morris
              argued for humanising work and it was, to quoted the title of one of his most
              famous essays, as case of Useful Work vrs Useless Toil. His utopia novel
              News from Nowhere paints a compelling vision of a libertarian communist
              society where industrialisation has been replaced with a communal craftbased economy. It is a utopia which has long appealed to most social
              anarchists. For a discussion of Morris’ ideas, placed in the context of his
              famous utopia, see William Morris and News from Nowhere: A Vision for
              Our Time (Stephen Coleman and Paddy O’Sullivan (eds.))
                 Also of note is the Greek thinker Cornelius Castoriadis. Originally a
              Trotskyist, Castoriadis evaluation of Trotsky’s deeply ﬂawed analysis of
              Stalinist Russia as a degenerated workers’ state lead him to reject ﬁrst
              Leninism and then Marxism itself. This led him to libertarian conclusions,
              seeing the key issue not who owns the means of production but rather
              hierarchy. Thus the class struggle was between those with power and those
              subject to it. This led him to reject Marxist economics as its value analysis
              abstracted from (i.e. ignored!) the class struggle at the heart of production
              (Autonomist Marxism rejects this interpretation of Marx, but they are the only
              Marxists who do). Castoriadis, like social anarchists, saw the future society as
              one based on radical autonomy, generalised self-management and workers’
              councils organised from the bottom up. His three volume collected works
195 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              (Political and Social Writings) are essential reading for anyone interested
              in libertarian socialist politics and a radical critique of Marxism.
                Special mention should also be made of Maurice Brinton, who, as well as
              translating many works by Castoriadis, was a signiﬁcant libertarian socialist
              thinker and activist as well. An ex-Trotskyist like Castoriadis, Brinton carved
              out a political space for a revolutionary libertarian socialism, opposed to the
              bureaucratic reformism of Labour as well as the police-state “socialism” of
              Stalinism and the authoritarianism of the Leninism which produced it. He
              produced numerous key pamphlets which shaped the thinking of a generation
              of anarchists and other libertarian socialists. These included Paris: May
              1968, his brilliant eyewitness account of the near-revolution in France, the
              essential The Bolsheviks and Workers’ Control in which he exposed
              Lenin’s hostility to workers’ self-management, and The Irrational in
              Politics, a restatement and development of the early work of Wilhelm Reich.
              These and many more articles have been collected in the book For Workers’
              Power: The Selected Writings of Maurice Brinton, edited by David
              Goodway.
                The American radical historian Howard Zinn has sometimes called himself
              an anarchist and is well informed about the anarchist tradition (he wrote an
              excellent introductory essay on “Anarchism” for a US edition of a Herbert
              Read book) . As well as his classic A People’s History of the United States,
              his writings of civil disobedience and non-violent direct action are essential.
              An excellent collection of essays by this libertarian socialist scholar has been
              produced under the title The Zinn Reader. Another notable libertarian
              socialists close to anarchism are Edward Carpenter (see, for example, Sheila
              Rowbotham’s Edward Carpenter: Prophet of the New Life) and Simone
              Weil (Oppression and Liberty)
                It would also be worthwhile to mention those market socialists who, like
              anarchists, base their socialism on workers’ self-management. Rejecting
              central planning, they have turned back to the ideas of industrial democracy
              and market socialism advocated by the likes of Proudhon (although, coming
              from a Marxist background, they generally fail to mention the link which their
              central-planning foes stress). Allan Engler (in Apostles of Greed) and David
              Schweickart (in Against Capitalism and After Capitalism) have provided
              useful critiques of capitalism and presented a vision of socialism rooted in cooperatively organised workplaces. While retaining an element of government
              and state in their political ideas, these socialists have placed economic selfmanagement at the heart of their economic vision and, consequently, are
              closer to anarchism than most socialists.
              A.4.4 Are there any Marxist thinkers close to
              anarchism?
                None of the libertarian socialists we highlighted in the last section were
              Marxists. This is unsurprising as most forms of Marxism are authoritarian.
              However, this is not the case for all schools of Marxism. There are important
              sub-branches of Marxism which shares the anarchist vision of a self-managed
              society. These include Council Communism, Situationism and Autonomism.
196 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              Perhaps signiﬁcantly, these few Marxist tendencies which are closest to
              anarchism are, like the branches of anarchism itself, not named after
              individuals. We will discuss each in turn.
                Council Communism was born in the German Revolution of 1919 when
              Marxists inspired by the example of the Russian soviets and disgusted by the
              centralism, opportunism and betrayal of the mainstream Marxist socialdemocrats, drew similar anti-parliamentarian, direct actionist and
              decentralised conclusions to those held by anarchists since Bakunin. Like
              Marx’s libertarian opponent in the First International, they argued that a
              federation of workers’ councils would form the basis of a socialist society and,
              consequently, saw the need to build militant workplace organisations to
              promote their formation. Lenin attacked these movements and their
              advocates in his diatribe Left-wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder,
              which council communist Herman Gorter demolished in his An Open Letter
              to Comrade Lenin. By 1921, the council communists broke with the
              Bolshevism that had already eﬀectively expelled them from both the national
              Communist Parties and the Communist International.
                Like the anarchists, they argued that Russia was a state-capitalist party
              dictatorship and had nothing to be with socialism. And, again like anarchists,
              the council communists argue that the process of building a new society, like
              the revolution itself, is either the work of the people themselves or doomed
              from the start. As with the anarchists, they too saw the Bolshevik take-over of
              the soviets (like that of the trade unions) as subverting the revolution and
              beginning the restoration of oppression and exploitation.
                To discover more about council communism, the works of Paul Mattick are
              essential reading. While best known as a writer on Marxist economic theory in
              such works as Marx and Keynes, Economic Crisis and Crisis Theory and
              Economics, Politics and the Age of Inﬂation, Mattick had been a council
              communist since the German revolution of 1919/1920. His books AntiBolshevik Communism and Marxism: The Last Refuge of the
              Bourgeoisie? are excellent introductions to his political ideas. Also essential
              reading is Anton Pannekeok’s works. His classic Workers’ Councils explains
              council communism from ﬁrst principles while his Lenin as Philosopher
              dissects Lenin’s claims to being a Marxist (Serge Bricianer, Pannekoek and
              the Workers’ Councils is the best study of the development of Panekoek’s
              ideas). In the UK, the militant suﬀragette Sylvia Pankhurst became a council
              communist under the impact of the Russian Revolution and, along with
              anarchists like Guy Aldred, led the opposition to the importation of Leninism
              into the communist movement there (see Mark Shipway’s AntiParliamentary Communism: The Movement for Workers Councils in
              Britain, 1917–45 for more details of libertarian communism in the UK). Otto
              Ruhle and Karl Korsch are also important thinkers in this tradition.
                Building upon the ideas of council communism, the Situationists developed
              their ideas in important new directions. Working in the late 1950s and 1960s,
              they combined council communist ideas with surrealism and other forms of
              radical art to produce an impressive critique of post-war capitalism. Unlike
              Castoriadis, whose ideas inﬂuenced them, the Situationists continued to view
              themselves as Marxists, developing Marx’s critique of capitalist economy into
              a critique of capitalist society as alienation had shifted from being located in

              capitalist production into everyday life. They coined the expression “The
              Spectacle” to describe a social system in which people become alienated
              from their own lives and played the role of an audience, of spectators. Thus
              capitalism had turned being into having and now, with the spectacle, it turned
              having into appearing. They argued that we could not wait for a distant
              revolution, but rather should liberate ourselves in the here and now, creating
              events (“situations”) which would disrupt the ordinary and normal to jolt
              people out of their allotted roles within society. A social revolution based on
              sovereign rank and ﬁle assemblies and self-managed councils would be the
              ultimate “situation” and the aim of all Situationists.
                 While critical of anarchism, the diﬀerences between the two theories are
              relatively minor and the impact of the Situationists on anarchism cannot be
              underestimated. Many anarchists embraced their critique of modern capitalist
              society, their subversion of modern art and culture for revolutionary purposes
              and call for revolutionising everyday life. Ironically, while Situationism viewed
              itself as an attempt to transcend tradition forms of Marxism and anarchism, it
              essentially became subsumed by anarchism. The classic works of situationism
              are Guy Debord’s Society of the Spectacle and Raoul Veneigem’s The
              Revolution of Everyday Life. The Situationist International Anthology
              (edited by Ken Knabb) is essential reading for any budding Situationists, as is
              Knabb’s own Public Secrets.
                 Lastly there is Autonomist Marxism. Drawing on the works of the council
              communism, Castoriadis, situationism and others, it places the class struggle
              at the heart of its analysis of capitalism. It initially developed in Italy during
              the 1960s and has many currents, some closer to anarchism than others.
              While the most famous thinker in the Autonomist tradition is probably Antonio
              Negri (who coined the wonderful phrase “money has only one face, that of the
              boss” in Marx Beyond Marx) his ideas are more within traditional Marxist.
              For an Autonomist whose ideas are closer to anarchism, we need to turn to
              the US thinker and activist who has written the one of the best summaries of
              Kropotkin’s ideas in which he usefully indicates the similarities between
              anarcho-communism and Autonomist Marxism (“Kropotkin, Self-valorisation
              and the Crisis of Marxism,” Anarchist Studies, vol. 2, no. 3). His book
              Reading Capital Politically is an essential text for understanding
              Autonomism and its history.
                 For Cleaver, “autonomist Marxism” as generic name for a variety of
              movements, politics and thinkers who have emphasised the autonomous
              power of workers — autonomous from capital, obviously, but also from their
              oﬀicial organisations (e.g. the trade unions, the political parties) and,
              moreover, the power of particular groups of working class people to act
              autonomously from other groups (e.g. women from men). By “autonomy” it is
              meant the ability of working class people to deﬁne their own interests and to
              struggle for them and, critically, to go beyond mere reaction to exploitation
              and to take the oﬀensive in ways that shape the class struggle and deﬁne the
              future. Thus they place working class power at the centre of their thinking
              about capitalism, how it develops and its dynamics as well as in the class
              conﬂicts within it. This is not limited to just the workplace and just as workers
              resist the imposition of work inside the factory or oﬀice, via slowdowns,
              strikes and sabotage, so too do the non-waged resist the reduction of their
198 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              lives to work. For Autonomists, the creation of communism is not something
              that comes later but is something which is repeatedly created by current
              developments of new forms of working class self-activity.
                 The similarities with social anarchism are obvious. Which probably explains
              why Autonomists spend so much time analysing and quoting Marx to justify
              their ideas for otherwise other Marxists will follow Lenin’s lead on the council
              communists and label them anarchists and ignore them! For anarchists, all
              this Marx quoting seems amusing. Ultimately, if Marx really was an
              Autonomist Marxist then why do Autonomists have to spend so much time reconstructing what Marx “really” meant? Why did he not just say it clearly to
              begin with? Similarly, why root out (sometimes obscure) quotes and
              (sometimes passing) comments from Marx to justify your insights? Does
              something stop being true if Marx did not mention it ﬁrst? Whatever the
              insights of Autonomism its Marxism will drag it backwards by rooting its
              politics in the texts of two long dead Germans. Like the surreal debate
              between Trotsky and Stalin in the 1920s over “Socialism in One Country”
              conducted by means of Lenin quotes, all that will be proved is not whether a
              given idea is right but simply that the mutually agreed authority ﬁgure (Lenin
              or Marx) may have held it. Thus anarchists suggest that Autonomists practice
              some autonomy when it comes to Marx and Engels.
                 Other libertarian Marxists close to anarchism include Erich Fromm and
              Wilhelm Reich. Both tried to combine Marx with Freud to produce a radical
              analysis of capitalism and the personality disorders it causes. Erich Fromm, in
              such books as The Fear of Freedom, Man for Himself, The Sane Society
              and To Have or To Be? developed a powerful and insightful analysis of
              capitalism which discussed how it shaped the individual and built
              psychological barriers to freedom and authentic living. His works discuss
              many important topics, including ethics, the authoritarian personality (what
              causes it and how to change it), alienation, freedom, individualism and what a
              good society would be like.
                 Fromm’s analysis of capitalism and the “having” mode of life are incredibly
              insightful, especially in context with today’s consumerism. For Fromm, the
              way we live, work and organise together inﬂuence how we develop, our health
              (mental and physical), our happiness more than we suspect. He questions the
              sanity of a society which covets property over humanity and adheres to
              theories of submission and domination rather than self-determination and selfactualisation. His scathing indictment of modern capitalism shows that it is
              the main source of the isolation and alienation prevalent in today. Alienation,
              for Fromm, is at the heart of the system (whether private or state capitalism).
              We are happy to the extent that we realise ourselves and for this to occur our
              society must value the human over the inanimate (property).
                 Fromm rooted his ideas in a humanistic interpretation of Marx, rejecting
              Leninism and Stalinism as an authoritarian corruption of his ideas (“the
              destruction of socialism … began with Lenin.”). Moreover, he stressed the
              need for a decentralised and libertarian form of socialism, arguing that the
              anarchists had been right to question Marx’s preferences for states and
              centralisation. As he put it, the “errors of Marx and Engels … [and] their
              centralistic orientation, were due to the fact they were much more rooted in
              the middle-class tradition of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, both

              psychologically and intellectually, than men like Fourier, Owen, Proudhon and
              Kropotkin.” As the “contradiction” in Marx between “the principles of
              centralisation and decentralisation,” for Fromm “Marx and Engels were much
              more ‘bourgeois’ thinkers than were men like Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin
              and Landauer. Paradoxical as it sounds, the Leninist development of Socialism
              represented a regression to the bourgeois concepts of the state and of
              political power, rather than the new socialist concept as it was expressed so
              much clearer by Owen, Proudhon and others.” [The Sane Society, p. 265, p.
              267 and p. 259] Fromm’s Marxism, therefore, was fundamentally of a
              libertarian and humanist type and his insights of profound importance for
              anyone interested in changing society for the better.
                 Wilheim Reich, like Fromm, set out to elaborate a social psychology based
              on both Marxism and psychoanalysis. For Reich, sexual repression led to
              people amenable to authoritarianism and happy to subject themselves to
              authoritarian regimes. While he famously analysed Nazism in this way (in The
              Mass Psychology of Fascism, his insights also apply to other societies and
              movements (it is no co-incidence, for example, that the religious right in
              America oppose pre-martial sex and use scare tactics to get teenagers to
              associate it with disease, dirt and guilt).
                 His argument is that due to sexual repression we develop what he called
              “character armour” which internalises our oppressions and ensures that we
              can function in a hierarchical society. This social conditioning is produced by
              the patriarchal family and its net results is a powerful reinforcement and
              perpetuation of the dominant ideology and the mass production of individuals
              with obedience built into them, individuals ready to accept the authority of
              teacher, priest, employer and politician as well as to endorse the prevailing
              social structure. This explains how individuals and groups can support
              movements and institutions which exploit or oppress them. In other words,
              act think, feel and act against themselves and, moreover, can internalise their
              own oppression to such a degree that they may even seek to defend their
              subordinate position.
                 Thus, for Reich, sexual repression produces an individual who is adjusted to
              the authoritarian order and who will submit to it in spite of all misery and
              degradation it causes them. The net result is fear of freedom, and a
              conservative, reactionary mentality. Sexual repression aids political power,
              not only through the process which makes the mass individual passive and
              unpolitical, but also by creating in their character structure an interest in
              actively supporting the authoritarian order.
                 While his uni-dimensional focus on sex is misplaced, his analysis of how we
              internalise our oppression in order to survive under hierarchy is important for
              understanding why so many of the most oppressed people seem to love their
              social position and those who rule over them. By understanding this collective
              character structure and how it forms also provides humanity with new means
              of transcending such obstacles to social change. Only an awareness of how
              people’s character structure prevents them from becoming aware of their real
              interests can it be combated and social self-emancipation assured.
                 Maurice Brinton’s The Irrational in Politics is an excellent short
              introduction to Reich’s ideas which links their insights to libertarian
              socialism.

              A.5 What are some examples of “Anarchy in
              Action”?
                Anarchism, more than anything else, is about the eﬀorts of millions of
              revolutionaries changing the world in the last two centuries. Here we will
              discuss some of the high points of this movement, all of them of a profoundly
              anti-capitalist nature.
                Anarchism is about radically changing the world, not just making the
              present system less inhuman by encouraging the anarchistic tendencies
              within it to grow and develop. While no purely anarchist revolution has taken
              place yet, there have been numerous ones with a highly anarchist character
              and level of participation. And while these have all been destroyed, in each
              case it has been at the hands of outside force brought against them (backed
              either by Communists or Capitalists), not because of any internal problems in
              anarchism itself. These revolutions, despite their failure to survive in the face
              of overwhelming force, have been both an inspiration for anarchists and proof
              that anarchism is a viable social theory and can be practised on a large scale.
                What these revolutions share is the fact they are, to use Proudhon’s term, a
              “revolution from below” — they were examples of “collective activity, of
              popular spontaneity.” It is only a transformation of society from the bottom up
              by the action of the oppressed themselves that can create a free society. As
              Proudhon asked, ”[w]hat serious and lasting Revolution was not made from
              below, by the people?” For this reason an anarchist is a “revolutionary from
              below.” Thus the social revolutions and mass movements we discuss in this
              section are examples of popular self-activity and self-liberation (as Proudhon
              put it in 1848, “the proletariat must emancipate itself”). [quoted by George
              Woodcock, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: A Biography, p. 143 and p. 125] All
              anarchists echo Proudhon’s idea of revolutionary change from below, the
              creation of a new society by the actions of the oppressed themselves.
              Bakunin, for example, argued that anarchists are “foes … of all State
              organisations as such, and believe that the people can only be happy and free,
              when, organised from below by means of its own autonomous and completely
              free associations, without the supervision of any guardians, it will create its
              own life.” [Marxism, Freedom and the State, p. 63] In section J.7 we
              discuss what anarchists think a social revolution is and what it involves.
                Many of these revolutions and revolutionary movements are relatively
              unknown to non-anarchists. Most people will have heard of the Russian
              revolution but few will know of the popular movements which were its lifeblood before the Bolsheviks seized power or the role that the anarchists
              played in it. Few will have heard of the Paris Commune, the Italian factory
              occupations or the Spanish collectives. This is unsurprising for, as Hebert
              Read notes, history “is of two kinds — a record of events that take place
              publicly, that make the headlines in the newspapers and get embodied in
              oﬀicial records — we might call this overground history” but “taking place at
              the same time, preparing for these public events, anticipating them, is
              another kind of history, that is not embodied in oﬀicial records, an invisible
              underground history.” [quoted by William R. McKercher, Freedom and
              Authority, p. 155] Almost by deﬁnition, popular movements and revolts are
201 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              part of “underground history”, the social history which gets ignored in favour
              of elite history, the accounts of the kings, queens, politicians and wealthy
              whose fame is the product of the crushing of the many.
                This means our examples of “anarchy in action” are part of what the
              Russian anarchist Voline called “The Unknown Revolution.” Voline used that
              expression as the title of his classic account of the Russian revolution he was
              an active participant of. He used it to refer to the rarely acknowledged
              independent, creative actions of the people themselves. As Voline put it, “it is
              not known how to study a revolution” and most historians “mistrust and
              ignore those developments which occur silently in the depths of the revolution
              … at best, they accord them a few words in passing … [Yet] it is precisely
              these hidden facts which are important, and which throw a true light on the
              events under consideration and on the period.” [The Unknown Revolution,
              p. 19] Anarchism, based as it is on revolution from below, has contributed
              considerably to both the “underground history” and the “unknown
              revolution” of the past few centuries and this section of the FAQ will shed
              some light on its achievements.
                It is important to point out that these examples are of wide-scale social
              experiments and do not imply that we ignore the undercurrent of anarchist
              practice which exists in everyday life, even under capitalism. Both Peter
              Kropotkin (in Mutual Aid) and Colin Ward (in Anarchy in Action) have
              documented the many ways in which ordinary people, usually unaware of
              anarchism, have worked together as equals to meet their common interests.
              As Colin Ward argues, “an anarchist society, a society which organises itself
              without authority, is always in existence, like a seed beneath the snow, buried
              under the weight of the state and its bureaucracy, capitalism and its waste,
              privilege and its injustices, nationalism and its suicidal loyalties, religious
              diﬀerences and their superstitious separatism.” [Anarchy in Action, p. 14]
                Anarchism is not only about a future society, it is also about the social
              struggle happening today. It is not a condition but a process, which we create
              by our self-activity and self-liberation.
                By the 1960’s, however, many commentators were writing oﬀ the anarchist
              movement as a thing of the past. Not only had fascism ﬁnished oﬀ European
              anarchist movements in the years before and during the war, but in the postwar period these movements were prevented from recovering by the capitalist
              West on one hand and the Leninist East on the other. Over the same period of
              time, anarchism had been repressed in the US, Latin America, China, Korea
              (where a social revolution with anarchist content was put down before the
              Korean War), and Japan. Even in the one or two countries that escaped the
              worst of the repression, the combination of the Cold War and international
              isolation saw libertarian unions like the Swedish SAC become reformist.
                But the 60’s were a decade of new struggle, and all over the world the ‘New
              Left’ looked to anarchism as well as elsewhere for its ideas. Many of the
              prominent ﬁgures of the massive explosion of May 1968 in France considered
              themselves anarchists. Although these movements themselves degenerated,
              those coming out of them kept the idea alive and began to construct new
              movements. The death of Franco in 1975 saw a massive rebirth of anarchism
              in Spain, with up to 500,000 people attending the CNT’s ﬁrst post-Franco

              the late 70’s and 80’s saw a growth in anarchism there. Finally, in the late
              80’s it was anarchists who struck the ﬁrst blows against the Leninist USSR,
              with the ﬁrst protest march since 1928 being held in Moscow by anarchists in
              1987.
                 Today the anarchist movement, although still weak, organises tens of
              thousands of revolutionaries in many countries. Spain, Sweden and Italy all
              have libertarian union movements organising some 250,000 between them.
              Most other European countries have several thousand active anarchists.
              Anarchist groups have appeared for the ﬁrst time in other countries, including
              Nigeria and Turkey. In South America the movement has recovered massively.
              A contact sheet circulated by the Venezuelan anarchist group Corrio A lists
              over 100 organisations in just about every country.
                 Perhaps the recovery is slowest in North America, but there, too, all the
              libertarian organisations seem to be undergoing signiﬁcant growth. As this
              growth accelerates, many more examples of anarchy in action will be created
              and more and more people will take part in anarchist organisations and
              activities, making this part of the FAQ less and less important.
                 However, it is essential to highlight mass examples of anarchism working on
              a large scale in order to avoid the specious accusation of “utopianism.” As
              history is written by the winners, these examples of anarchy in action are
              often hidden from view in obscure books. Rarely are they mentioned in the
              schools and universities (or if mentioned, they are distorted). Needless to say,
              the few examples we give are just that, a few.
                 Anarchism has a long history in many countries, and we cannot attempt to
              document every example, just those we consider to be important. We are also
              sorry if the examples seem Eurocentric. We have, due to space and time
              considerations, had to ignore the syndicalist revolt (1910 to 1914) and the
              shop steward movement (1917–21) in Britain, Germany (1919–21), Portugal
              (1974), the Mexican revolution, anarchists in the Cuban revolution, the
              struggle in Korea against Japanese (then US and Russian) imperialism during
              and after the Second World War, Hungary (1956), the “the refusal of work”
              revolt in the late 1960’s (particularly in “the hot Autumn” in Italy, 1969), the
              UK miner’s strike (1984–85), the struggle against the Poll Tax in Britain
              (1988–92), the strikes in France in 1986 and 1995, the Italian COBAS
              movement in the 80’s and 90’s, the popular assemblies and self-managed
              occupied workplaces during the Argentine revolt at the start of the 21st
              century and numerous other major struggles that have involved anarchist
              ideas of self-management (ideas that usually develop from the movement
              themselves, without anarchists necessarily playing a major, or “leading”,
              role).
                 For anarchists, revolutions and mass struggles are “festivals of the
              oppressed,” when ordinary people start to act for themselves and change
              both themselves and the world.
              A.5.1 The Paris Commune
                The Paris Commune of 1871 played an important role in the development of
              both anarchist ideas and the movement. As Bakunin commented at the time,
203 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   “revolutionary socialism [i.e. anarchism] has just attempted its ﬁrst
                   striking and practical demonstration in the Paris Commune … [It]
                   show[ed] to all enslaved peoples (and are there any masses that are
                   not slaves?) the only road to emancipation and health; Paris
                   inﬂict[ed] a mortal blow upon the political traditions of bourgeois
                   radicalism and [gave] a real basis to revolutionary socialism.”
                   [Bakunin on Anarchism, pp. 263–4]
                 The Paris Commune was created after France was defeated by Prussia in
              the Franco-Prussian war. The French government tried to send in troops to
              regain the Parisian National Guard’s cannon to prevent it from falling into the
              hands of the population. “Learning that the Versailles soldiers were trying to
              seize the cannon,” recounted participant Louise Michel, “men and women of
              Montmartre swarmed up the Butte in surprise manoeuvre. Those people who
              were climbing up the Butte believed they would die, but they were prepared
              to pay the price.” The soldiers refused to ﬁre on the jeering crowd and turned
              their weapons on their oﬀicers. This was March 18th; the Commune had
              begun and “the people wakened … The eighteenth of March could have
              belonged to the allies of kings, or to foreigners, or to the people. It was the
              people’s.” [Red Virgin: Memoirs of Louise Michel, p. 64]
                 In the free elections called by the Parisian National Guard, the citizens of
              Paris elected a council made up of a majority of Jacobins and Republicans and
              a minority of socialists (mostly Blanquists — authoritarian socialists — and
              followers of the anarchist Proudhon). This council proclaimed Paris
              autonomous and desired to recreate France as a confederation of communes
              (i.e. communities). Within the Commune, the elected council people were
              recallable and paid an average wage. In addition, they had to report back to
              the people who had elected them and were subject to recall by electors if they
              did not carry out their mandates.
                 Why this development caught the imagination of anarchists is clear — it has
              strong similarities with anarchist ideas. In fact, the example of the Paris
              Commune was in many ways similar to how Bakunin had predicted that a
              revolution would have to occur — a major city declaring itself autonomous,
              organising itself, leading by example, and urging the rest of the planet to
              follow it. (See “Letter to Albert Richards” in Bakunin on Anarchism). The
              Paris Commune began the process of creating a new society, one organised
              from the bottom up. It was “a blow for the decentralisation of political power.”
              [Voltairine de Cleyre, “The Paris Commune,” Anarchy! An Anthology of
              Emma Goldman’s Mother Earth, p. 67]
                 Many anarchists played a role within the Commune — for example Louise
              Michel, the Reclus brothers, and Eugene Varlin (the latter murdered in the
              repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as
              the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas
              of associated labour beginning to be realised. By May, 43 workplaces were cooperatively run and the Louvre Museum was a munitions factory run by a
              workers’ council. Echoing Proudhon, a meeting of the Mechanics Union and
              the Association of Metal Workers argued that “our economic emancipation …
              can only be obtained through the formation of workers’ associations, which
              alone can transform our position from that of wage earners to that of
204 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              associates.” They instructed their delegates to the Commune’s Commission on
              Labour Organisation to support the following objectives:
                   “The abolition of the exploitation of man by man, the last vestige of
## slavery;

                   “The organisation of labour in mutual associations and inalienable
## capital.”

                In this way, they hoped to ensure that “equality must not be an empty word”
              in the Commune. [The Paris Commune of 1871: The View from the Left,
              Eugene Schulkind (ed.), p. 164] The Engineers Union voted at a meeting on
              23rd of April that since the aim of the Commune should be “economic
              emancipation” it should “organise labour through associations in which there
              would be joint responsibility” in order “to suppress the exploitation of man by
              man.” [quoted by Stewart Edwards, The Paris Commune 1871, pp. 263–4]
                As well as self-managed workers’ associations, the Communards practised
              direct democracy in a network popular clubs, popular organisations similar to
              the directly democratic neighbourhood assemblies (“sections”) of the French
              Revolution. “People, govern yourselves through your public meetings, through
              your press” proclaimed the newspaper of one Club. The commune was seen as
              an expression of the assembled people, for (to quote another Club)
              “Communal power resides in each arrondissement [neighbourhood] wherever
              men are assembled who have a horror of the yoke and of servitude.” Little
              wonder that Gustave Courbet, artist friend and follower of Proudhon,
              proclaimed Paris as “a true paradise … all social groups have established
              themselves as federations and are masters of their own fate.” [quoted by
              Martin Phillip Johnson, The Paradise of Association, p. 5 and p. 6]
                In addition the Commune’s “Declaration to the French People” which
              echoed many key anarchist ideas. It saw the “political unity” of society as
              being based on “the voluntary association of all local initiatives, the free and
              spontaneous concourse of all individual energies for the common aim, the
              well-being, the liberty and the security of all.” [quoted by Edwards, Op. Cit.,
              p. 218] The new society envisioned by the communards was one based on the
              “absolute autonomy of the Commune … assuring to each its integral rights
              and to each Frenchman the full exercise of his aptitudes, as a man, a citizen
              and a labourer. The autonomy of the Commune will have for its limits only the
              equal autonomy of all other communes adhering to the contract; their
              association must ensure the liberty of France.” [“Declaration to the French
              People”, quoted by George Woodcock, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: A
              Biography, pp. 276–7] With its vision of a confederation of communes,
              Bakunin was correct to assert that the Paris Commune was “a bold, clearly
              formulated negation of the State.” [Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 264]
                Moreover, the Commune’s ideas on federation obviously reﬂected the
              inﬂuence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune’s vision
              of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative
              mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes
              Proudhon’s ideas (Proudhon had argued in favour of the “implementation of
              the binding mandate” in 1848 [No Gods, No Masters, p. 63] and for
              federation of communes in his work The Principle of Federation).
205 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily
              inﬂuenced by anarchist ideas. Economically, the theory of associated
              production expounded by Proudhon and Bakunin became consciously
              revolutionary practice. Politically, in the Commune’s call for federalism and
              autonomy, anarchists see their “future social organisation… [being] carried
              out from the bottom up, by the free association or federation of workers,
              starting with associations, then going into the communes, the regions, the
              nations, and, ﬁnally, culminating in a great international and universal
              federation.” [Bakunin, Op. Cit., p. 270]
                However, for anarchists the Commune did not go far enough. It did not
              abolish the state within the Commune, as it had abolished it beyond it. The
              Communards organised themselves “in a Jacobin manner” (to use Bakunin’s
              cutting term). As Peter Kropotkin pointed out, while “proclaiming the free
              Commune, the people of Paris proclaimed an essential anarchist principle …
              they stopped mid-course” and gave “themselves a Communal Council copied
              from the old municipal councils.” Thus the Paris Commune did not “break
              with the tradition of the State, of representative government, and it did not
              attempt to achieve within the Commune that organisation from the simple to
              the complex it inaugurated by proclaiming the independence and free
              federation of the Communes.” This lead to disaster as the Commune council
              became “immobilised … by red tape” and lost “the sensitivity that comes from
              continued contact with the masses … Paralysed by their distancing from the
              revolutionary centre — the people — they themselves paralysed the popular
              initiative.” [Words of a Rebel, p. 97, p. 93 and p. 97]
                In addition, its attempts at economic reform did not go far enough, making
              no attempt to turn all workplaces into co-operatives (i.e. to expropriate
              capital) and forming associations of these co-operatives to co-ordinate and
              support each other’s economic activities. Paris, stressed Voltairine de Cleyre,
              “failed to strike at economic tyranny, and so came of what it could have
              achieved” which was a “free community whose economic aﬀairs shall be
              arranged by the groups of actual producers and distributors, eliminating the
              useless and harmful element now in possession of the world’s capital.” [Op.
              Cit., p. 67] As the city was under constant siege by the French army, it is
              understandable that the Communards had other things on their minds.
              However, for Kropotkin such a position was a disaster:
                   “They treated the economic question as a secondary one, which
                   would be attended to later on, after the triumph of the Commune …
                   But the crushing defeat which soon followed, and the blood-thirsty
                   revenge taken by the middle class, proved once more that the
                   triumph of a popular Commune was materially impossible without a
                   parallel triumph of the people in the economic ﬁeld.” [Op. Cit., p.
                   74]
                Anarchists drew the obvious conclusions, arguing that “if no central
              government was needed to rule the independent Communes, if the national
              Government is thrown overboard and national unity is obtained by free
              federation, then a central municipal Government becomes equally useless
              and noxious. The same federative principle would do within the Commune.”
              [Kropotkin, Evolution and Environment, p. 75] Instead of abolishing the
206 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              state within the commune by organising federations of directly democratic
              mass assemblies, like the Parisian “sections” of the revolution of 1789–93 (see
              Kropotkin’s Great French Revolution for more on these), the Paris
              Commune kept representative government and suﬀered for it. “Instead of
              acting for themselves … the people, conﬁding in their governors, entrusted
              them the charge of taking the initiative. This was the ﬁrst consequence of the
              inevitable result of elections.” The council soon became “the greatest obstacle
              to the revolution” thus proving the “political axiom that a government cannot
              be revolutionary.” [Anarchism, p. 240, p. 241 and p. 249]
                The council become more and more isolated from the people who elected it,
              and thus more and more irrelevant. And as its irrelevance grew, so did its
              authoritarian tendencies, with the Jacobin majority creating a “Committee of
              Public Safety” to “defend” (by terror) the “revolution.” The Committee was
              opposed by the libertarian socialist minority and was, fortunately, ignored in
              practice by the people of Paris as they defended their freedom against the
              French army, which was attacking them in the name of capitalist civilisation
              and “liberty.” On May 21st, government troops entered the city, followed by
              seven days of bitter street ﬁghting. Squads of soldiers and armed members of
              the bourgeoisie roamed the streets, killing and maiming at will. Over 25,000
              people were killed in the street ﬁghting, many murdered after they had
              surrendered, and their bodies dumped in mass graves. As a ﬁnal insult, Sacré
              Coeur was built by the bourgeoisie on the birth place of the Commune, the
              Butte of Montmartre, to atone for the radical and atheist revolt which had so
              terriﬁed them.
                For anarchists, the lessons of the Paris Commune were threefold. Firstly, a
              decentralised confederation of communities is the necessary political form of
              a free society (”This was the form that the social revolution must take —
              the independent commune.” [Kropotkin, Op. Cit., p. 163]). Secondly, “there is
              no more reason for a government inside a Commune than for government
              above the Commune.” This means that an anarchist community will be based
              on a confederation of neighbourhood and workplace assemblies freely cooperating together. Thirdly, it is critically important to unify political and
              economic revolutions into a social revolution. “They tried to consolidate the
              Commune ﬁrst and put oﬀ the social revolution until later, whereas the only
              way to proceed was to consolidate the Commune by means of the social
              revolution!” [Peter Kropotkin, Words of a Rebel , p. 97]
                For more anarchist perspectives on the Paris Commune see Kropotkin’s
              essay “The Paris Commune” in Words of a Rebel (and The Anarchist
              Reader) and Bakunin’s “The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State” in
              Bakunin on Anarchism.
              A.5.2 The Haymarket Martyrs
                May 1st is a day of special signiﬁcance for the labour movement. While it
              has been hijacked in the past by the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union
              and elsewhere, the labour movement festival of May Day is a day of worldwide solidarity. A time to remember past struggles and demonstrate our hope
              for a better future. A day to remember that an injury to one is an injury to all.
207 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                The history of Mayday is closely linked with the anarchist movement and
              the struggles of working people for a better world. Indeed, it originated with
              the execution of four anarchists in Chicago in 1886 for organising workers in
              the ﬁght for the eight-hour day. Thus May Day is a product of “anarchy in
              action” — of the struggle of working people using direct action in labour
              unions to change the world.
                It began in the 1880s in the USA. In 1884, the Federation of Organised
              Trades and Labor Unions of the United States and Canada (created in
              1881, it changed its name in 1886 to the American Federation of Labor)
              passed a resolution which asserted that “eight hours shall constitute a legal
              day’s work from and after May 1, 1886, and that we recommend to labour
              organisations throughout this district that they so direct their laws as to
              conform to this resolution.” A call for strikes on May 1st, 1886 was made in
              support of this demand.
                In Chicago the anarchists were the main force in the union movement, and
              partially as a result of their presence, the unions translated this call into
              strikes on May 1st. The anarchists thought that the eight hour day could only
              be won through direct action and solidarity. They considered that struggles
              for reforms, like the eight hour day, were not enough in themselves. They
              viewed them as only one battle in an ongoing class war that would only end by
              social revolution and the creation of a free society. It was with these ideas
              that they organised and fought.
                In Chicago alone, 400 000 workers went out and the threat of strike action
              ensured that more than 45 000 were granted a shorter working day without
              striking. On May 3, 1886, police ﬁred into a crowd of pickets at the
              McCormick Harvester Machine Company, killing at least one striker, seriously
              wounding ﬁve or six others, and injuring an undetermined number. Anarchists
              called for a mass meeting the next day in Haymarket Square to protest the
              brutality. According to the Mayor, “nothing had occurred yet, or looked likely
              to occur to require interference.” However, as the meeting was breaking up a
              column of 180 police arrived and ordered the meeting to end. At this moment
              a bomb was thrown into the police ranks, who opened ﬁre on the crowd. How
              many civilians were wounded or killed by the police was never exactly
              ascertained, but 7 policemen eventually died (ironically, only one was the
              victim of the bomb, the rest were a result of the bullets ﬁred by the police
              [Paul Avrich, The Haymarket Tragedy, p. 208]).
                A “reign of terror” swept over Chicago, and the “organised banditti and
              conscienceless brigands of capital suspended the only papers which would
              give the side of those whom they crammed into prison cells. They have
              invaded the homes of everyone who has ever known to have raised a voice or
              sympathised with those who have aught to say against the present system of
              robbery and oppression … they have invaded their homes and subjected them
              and their families to indignities that must be seen to be believed.” [Lucy
              Parsons, Liberty, Equality & Solidarity, p. 53] Meeting halls, union oﬀices,
              printing shops and private homes were raided (usually without warrants).
              Such raids into working-class areas allowed the police to round up all known
              anarchists and other socialists. Many suspects were beaten up and some
              bribed. “Make the raids ﬁrst and look up the law afterwards” was the public
              statement of J. Grinnell, the States Attorney, when a question was raised
208 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              about search warrants. [“Editor’s Introduction”, The Autobiographies of
              the Haymarket Martyrs, p. 7]
                Eight anarchists were put on trial for accessory to murder. No pretence was
              made that any of the accused had carried out or even planned the bomb. The
              judge ruled that it was not necessary for the state to identify the actual
              perpetrator or prove that he had acted under the inﬂuence of the accused.
              The state did not try to establish that the defendants had in any way approved
              or abetted the act. In fact, only three were present at the meeting when the
              bomb exploded and one of those, Albert Parsons, was accompanied by his wife
              and fellow anarchist Lucy and their two small children to the event.
                The reason why these eight were picked was because of their anarchism
              and union organising, as made clear by that State’s Attorney when he told the
              jury that “Law is on trial. Anarchy is on trial. These men have been selected,
              picked out by the Grand Jury, and indicted because they were leaders. They
              are no more guilty than the thousands who follow them. Gentlemen of the
              jury; convict these men, make examples of them, hang them and you save our
              institutions, our society.” The jury was selected by a special bailiﬀ, nominated
              by the State’s Attorney and was explicitly chosen to compose of businessmen
              and a relative of one of the cops killed. The defence was not allowed to
              present evidence that the special bailiﬀ had publicly claimed “I am managing
              this case and I know what I am about. These fellows are going to be hanged
              as certain as death.” [Op. Cit., p. 8] Not surprisingly, the accused were
              convicted. Seven were sentenced to death, one to 15 years’ imprisonment.
                An international campaign resulted in two of the death sentences being
              commuted to life, but the world wide protest did not stop the US state. Of the
              remaining ﬁve, one (Louis Lingg) cheated the executioner and killed himself
              on the eve of the execution. The remaining four (Albert Parsons, August Spies,
              George Engel and Adolph Fischer) were hanged on November 11th 1887.
              They are known in Labour history as the Haymarket Martyrs. Between
              150,000 and 500,000 lined the route taken by the funeral cortege and
              between 10,000 to 25,000 were estimated to have watched the burial.
                In 1889, the American delegation attending the International Socialist
              congress in Paris proposed that May 1st be adopted as a workers’ holiday. This
              was to commemorate working class struggle and the “Martyrdom of the
              Chicago Eight”. Since then Mayday has became a day for international
              solidarity. In 1893, the new Governor of Illinois made oﬀicial what the
              working class in Chicago and across the world knew all along and pardoned
              the Martyrs because of their obvious innocence and because “the trial was not
              fair.” To this day, no one knows who threw the bomb — the only deﬁnite fact is
              that it was not any of those who were tried for the act: “Our comrades were
              not murdered by the state because they had any connection with the bombthrowing, but because they had been active in organising the wage-slaves of
              America.” [Lucy Parsons, Op. Cit., p. 142]
                The authorities had believed at the time of the trial that such persecution
              would break the back of the labour movement. As Lucy Parsons, a participant
              of the events, noted 20 years later, the Haymarket trial “was a class trial —
              relentless, vindictive, savage and bloody. By that prosecution the capitalists
              sought to break the great strike for the eight-hour day which as being
              successfully inaugurated in Chicago, this city being the stormcentre of that

              great movement; and they also intended, by the savage manner in which they
              conducted the trial of these men, to frighten the working class back to their
              long hours of toil and low wages from which they were attempting to emerge.
              The capitalistic class imagined they could carry out their hellish plot by
              putting to an ignominious death the most progressive leaders among the
              working class of that day. In executing their bloody deed of judicial murder
              they succeeded, but in arresting the mighty onward movement of the class
              struggle they utterly failed.” [Lucy Parsons, Op. Cit., p. 128] In the words of
              August Spies when he addressed the court after he had been sentenced to
              die:
                   “If you think that by hanging us you can stamp out the labour
                   movement … the movement from which the downtrodden millions,
                   the millions who toil in misery and want, expect salvation — if this is
                   your opinion, then hang us! Here you will tread on a spark, but
                   there and there, behind you — and in front of you, and everywhere,
                   ﬂames blaze up. It is a subterranean ﬁre. You cannot put it out.”
                   [quoted by Paul Avrich, Op. Cit., p. 287]
                At the time and in the years to come, this deﬁance of the state and
              capitalism was to win thousands to anarchism, particularly in the US itself.
              Since the Haymarket event, anarchists have celebrated May Day (on the 1st of
              May — the reformist unions and labour parties moved its marches to the ﬁrst
              Sunday of the month). We do so to show our solidarity with other working
              class people across the world, to celebrate past and present struggles, to
              show our power and remind the ruling class of their vulnerability. As Nestor
              Makhno put it:

## “That day those American workers attempted, by organising
                   themselves, to give expression to their protest against the iniquitous
## order of the State and Capital of the propertied …

                   “The workers of Chicago … had gathered to resolve, in common, the
## problems of their lives and their struggles…

                   “Today too … the toilers … regard the ﬁrst of May as the occasion of
                   a get-together when they will concern themselves with their own
## aﬀairs and consider the matter of their emancipation.” [The
                   Struggle Against the State and Other Essays, pp. 59–60]
                Anarchists stay true to the origins of May Day and celebrate its birth in the
              direct action of the oppressed. It is a classic example of anarchist principles of
              direct action and solidarity, “an historic event of great importance, inasmuch
              as it was, in the ﬁrst place, the ﬁrst time that workers themselves had
              attempted to get a shorter work day by united, simultaneous action … this
              strike was the ﬁrst in the nature of Direct Action on a large scale, the ﬁrst in
              America.” [Lucy Parsons, Op. Cit., pp. 139–40] Oppression and exploitation
              breed resistance and, for anarchists, May Day is an international symbol of
              that resistance and power — a power expressed in the last words of August
              Spies, chiselled in stone on the monument to the Haymarket martyrs in

              Waldheim Cemetery in Chicago:
                   “The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the
## voices you are throttling today.”

                To understand why the state and business class were so determined to hang
              the Chicago Anarchists, it is necessary to realise they were considered the
              leaders of a massive radical union movement. In 1884, the Chicago Anarchists
              produced the world’s ﬁrst daily anarchist newspaper, the Chicagoer
              Arbeiter-Zeiting. This was written, read, owned and published by the
              German immigrant working class movement. The combined circulation of this
              daily plus a weekly (Vorbote) and a Sunday edition (Fackel) more than
              doubled, from 13,000 per issues in 1880 to 26,980 in 1886. Anarchist weekly
              papers existed for other ethnic groups as well (one English, one Bohemian
              and one Scandinavian).
                Anarchists were very active in the Central Labour Union (which included
              the eleven largest unions in the city) and aimed to make it, in the words of
              Albert Parsons (one of the Martyrs), “the embryonic group of the future ‘free
              society.’” The anarchists were also part of the International Working
              People’s Association (also called the “Black International”) which had
              representatives from 26 cities at its founding convention. The I.W.P.A. soon
              “made headway among trade unions, especially in the mid-west” and its ideas
              of “direct action of the rank and ﬁle” and of trade unions “serv[ing] as the
              instrument of the working class for the complete destruction of capitalism and
              the nucleus for the formation of a new society” became known as the
              “Chicago Idea” (an idea which later inspired the Industrial Workers of the
              World which was founded in Chicago in 1905). [“Editor’s Introduction,” The
              Autobiographies of the Haymarket Martyrs, p. 4]
                This idea was expressed in the manifesto issued at the I.W.P.A.‘s Pittsburgh
              Congress of 1883:
                   “First — Destruction of the existing class rule, by all means, i.e. by
                   energetic, relentless, revolutionary and international action.
                   “Second — Establishment of a free society based upon co-operative
## organisation of production.

                   “Third — Free exchange of equivalent products by and between the
                   productive organisations without commerce and proﬁt-mongery.
                   “Fourth — Organisation of education on a secular, scientiﬁc and
## equal basis for both sexes.

                   “Fifth — Equal rights for all without distinction to sex or race.
                   “Sixth — Regulation of all public aﬀairs by free contracts between
                   autonomous (independent) communes and associations, resting on a
                   federalistic basis.” [Op. Cit., p. 42]
                In addition to their union organising, the Chicago anarchist movement also
              organised social societies, picnics, lectures, dances, libraries and a host of
211 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              other activities. These all helped to forge a distinctly working-class
              revolutionary culture in the heart of the “American Dream.” The threat to the
              ruling class and their system was too great to allow it to continue (particularly
              with memories of the vast uprising of labour in 1877 still fresh. As in 1886,
              that revolt was also meet by state violence — see Strike! by J. Brecher for
              details of this strike movement as well as the Haymarket events). Hence the
              repression, kangaroo court, and the state murder of those the state and
              capitalist class considered “leaders” of the movement.
                For more on the Haymarket Martyrs, their lives and their ideas, The
              Autobiographies of the Haymarket Martyrs is essential reading. Albert
              Parsons, the only American born Martyr, produced a book which explained
              what they stood for called Anarchism: Its Philosophy and Scientiﬁc Basis.
              Historian Paul Avrich’s The Haymarket Tragedy is a useful in depth account
              of the events.
              A.5.3 Building the Syndicalist Unions
                 Just before the turn of the century in Europe, the anarchist movement
              began to create one of the most successful attempts to apply anarchist
              organisational ideas in everyday life. This was the building of mass
              revolutionary unions (also known as syndicalism or anarcho-syndicalism). The
              syndicalist movement, in the words of a leading French syndicalist militant,
              was “a practical schooling in anarchism” for it was “a laboratory of economic
              struggles” and organised “along anarchic lines.” By organising workers into
              “libertarian organisations,” the syndicalist unions were creating the “free
              associations of free producers” within capitalism to combat it and, ultimately,
              replace it. [Fernand Pelloutier, No Gods, No Masters, vol. 2, p. 57, p. 55 and
              p. 56]
                 While the details of syndicalist organisation varied from country to country,
              the main lines were the same. Workers should form themselves into unions (or
              syndicates, the French for union). While organisation by industry was
              generally the preferred form, craft and trade organisations were also used.
              These unions were directly controlled by their members and would federate
              together on an industrial and geographical basis. Thus a given union would be
              federated with all the local unions in a given town, region and country as well
              as with all the unions within its industry into a national union (of, say, miners
              or metal workers). Each union was autonomous and all oﬀicials were parttime (and paid their normal wages if they missed work on union business).
              The tactics of syndicalism were direct action and solidarity and its aim was to
              replace capitalism by the unions providing the basic framework of the new,
              free, society.
                 Thus, for anarcho-syndicalism, “the trade union is by no means a mere
              transitory phenomenon bound up with the duration of capitalist society, it is
              the germ of the Socialist economy of the future, the elementary school of
              Socialism in general.” The “economic ﬁghting organisation of the workers”
              gives their members “every opportunity for direct action in their struggles for
              daily bread, it also provides them with the necessary preliminaries for
              carrying through the reorganisation of social life on a [libertarian] Socialist

              plan by them own strength.” [Rudolf Rocker, Anarcho-Syndicalism, p. 59
              and p. 62] Anarcho-syndicalism, to use the expression of the I.W.W., aims to
              build the new world in the shell of the old.
                In the period from the 1890’s to the outbreak of World War I, anarchists
              built revolutionary unions in most European countries (particularly in Spain,
              Italy and France). In addition, anarchists in South and North America were
              also successful in organising syndicalist unions (particularly Cuba, Argentina,
              Mexico and Brazil). Almost all industrialised countries had some syndicalist
              movement, although Europe and South America had the biggest and strongest
              ones. These unions were organised in a confederal manner, from the bottom
              up, along anarchist lines. They fought with capitalists on a day-to-day basis
              around the issue of better wages and working conditions and the state for
              social reforms, but they also sought to overthrow capitalism through the
              revolutionary general strike.
                Thus hundreds of thousands of workers around the world were applying
              anarchist ideas in everyday life, proving that anarchy was no utopian dream
              but a practical method of organising on a wide scale. That anarchist
              organisational techniques encouraged member participation, empowerment
              and militancy, and that they also successfully fought for reforms and
              promoted class consciousness, can be seen in the growth of anarchosyndicalist unions and their impact on the labour movement. The Industrial
              Workers of the World, for example, still inspires union activists and has,
              throughout its long history, provided many union songs and slogans.
                However, as a mass movement, syndicalism eﬀectively ended by the 1930s.
              This was due to two factors. Firstly, most of the syndicalist unions were
              severely repressed just after World War I. In the immediate post-war years
              they reached their height. This wave of militancy was known as the “red
              years” in Italy, where it attained its high point with factory occupations (see
              section A.5.5). But these years also saw the destruction of these unions in
              country after county. In the USA, for example, the I.W.W. was crushed by a
              wave of repression backed whole-heartedly by the media, the state, and the
              capitalist class. Europe saw capitalism go on the oﬀensive with a new weapon
              — fascism. Fascism arose (ﬁrst in Italy and, most infamously, in Germany) as
              an attempt by capitalism to physically smash the organisations the working
              class had built. This was due to radicalism that had spread across Europe in
              the wake of the war ending, inspired by the example of Russia. Numerous
              near revolutions had terriﬁed the bourgeoisie, who turned to fascism to save
              their system.
                In country after country, anarchists were forced to ﬂee into exile, vanish
              from sight, or became victims of assassins or concentration camps after their
              (often heroic) attempts at ﬁghting fascism failed. In Portugal, for example, the
              100,000 strong anarcho-syndicalist CGT union launched numerous revolts in
              the late 1920s and early 1930s against fascism. In January 1934, the CGT
              called for a revolutionary general strike which developed into a ﬁve day
              insurrection. A state of siege was declared by the state, which used extensive
              force to crush the rebellion. The CGT, whose militants had played a prominent
              and courageous role in the insurrection, was completely smashed and
              Portugal remained a fascist state for the next 40 years. [Phil Mailer,
              Portugal: The Impossible Revolution, pp. 72–3] In Spain, the CNT (the
213 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              most famous anarcho-syndicalist union) fought a similar battle. By 1936, it
              claimed one and a half million members. As in Italy and Portugal, the
              capitalist class embraced fascism to save their power from the dispossessed,
              who were becoming conﬁdent of their power and their right to manage their
              own lives (see section A.5.6).
                 As well as fascism, syndicalism also faced the negative inﬂuence of
              Leninism. The apparent success of the Russian revolution led many activists
              to turn to authoritarian politics, particularly in English speaking countries
              and, to a lesser extent, France. Such notable syndicalist activists as Tom
              Mann in England, William Gallacher in Scotland and William Foster in the
              USA became Communists (the last two, it should be noted, became Stalinist).
              Moreover, Communist parties deliberately undermined the libertarian unions,
              encouraging ﬁghts and splits (as, for example, in the I.W.W.). After the end of
              the Second World War, the Stalinists ﬁnished oﬀ what fascism had started in
              Eastern Europe and destroyed the anarchist and syndicalist movements in
              such places as Bulgaria and Poland. In Cuba, Castro also followed Lenin’s
              example and did what the Batista and Machado dictatorship’s could not,
              namely smash the inﬂuential anarchist and syndicalist movements (see Frank
              Fernandez’s Cuban Anarchism for a history of this movement from its
              origins in the 1860s to the 21st century).
                 So by the start of the second world war, the large and powerful anarchist
              movements of Italy, Spain, Poland, Bulgaria and Portugal had been crushed by
              fascism (but not, we must stress, without a ﬁght). When necessary, the
              capitalists supported authoritarian states in order to crush the labour
              movement and make their countries safe for capitalism. Only Sweden escaped
              this trend, where the syndicalist union the SAC is still organising workers. It
              is, in fact, like many other syndicalist unions active today, growing as workers
              turn away from bureaucratic unions whose leaders seem more interested in
              protecting their privileges and cutting deals with management than defending
              their members. In France, Spain and Italy and elsewhere, syndicalist unions
              are again on the rise, showing that anarchist ideas are applicable in everyday
              life.
                 Finally, it must be stressed that syndicalism has its roots in the ideas of the
              earliest anarchists and, consequently, was not invented in the 1890s. It is true
              that development of syndicalism came about, in part, as a reaction to the
              disastrous “propaganda by deed” period, in which individual anarchists
              assassinated government leaders in attempts to provoke a popular uprising
              and in revenge for the mass murders of the Communards and other rebels
              (see section A.2.18 for details). But in response to this failed and
              counterproductive campaign, anarchists went back to their roots and to the
              ideas of Bakunin. Thus, as recognised by the likes of Kropotkin and Malatesta,
              syndicalism was simply a return to the ideas current in the libertarian wing of
              the First International.
                 Thus we ﬁnd Bakunin arguing that “it is necessary to organise the power of
              the proletariat. But this organisation must be the work of the proletariat itself
              … Organise, constantly organise the international militant solidarity of the
              workers, in every trade and country, and remember that however weak you
              are as isolated individuals or districts, you will constitute a tremendous,
              invincible power by means of universal co-operation.” As one American

              activist commented, this is “the same militant spirit that breathes now in the
              best expressions of the Syndicalist and I.W.W. movements” both of which
              express “a strong world wide revival of the ideas for which Bakunin laboured
              throughout his life.” [Max Baginski, Anarchy! An Anthology of Emma
              Goldman’s Mother Earth, p. 71] As with the syndicalists, Bakunin stressed
              the “organisation of trade sections, their federation … bear in themselves the
              living germs of the new social order, which is to replace the bourgeois
              world. They are creating not only the ideas but also the facts of the future
              itself.” [quoted by Rudolf Rocker, Op. Cit., p. 50]
                 Such ideas were repeated by other libertarians. Eugene Varlin, whose role
              in the Paris Commune ensured his death, advocated a socialism of
              associations, arguing in 1870 that syndicates were the “natural elements” for
              the rebuilding of society: “it is they that can easily be transformed into
              producer associations; it is they that can put into practice the retooling of
              society and the organisation of production.” [quoted by Martin Phillip
              Johnson, The Paradise of Association, p. 139] As we discussed in section
              A.5.2, the Chicago Anarchists held similar views, seeing the labour movement
              as both the means of achieving anarchy and the framework of the free society.
              As Lucy Parsons (the wife of Albert) put it “we hold that the granges, tradeunions, Knights of Labour assemblies, etc., are the embryonic groups of the
              ideal anarchistic society …” [contained in Albert R. Parsons, Anarchism: Its
              Philosophy and Scientiﬁc Basis, p. 110] These ideas fed into the
              revolutionary unionism of the I.W.W. As one historian notes, the “proceedings
              of the I.W.W.‘s inaugural convention indicate that the participants were not
              only aware of the ‘Chicago Idea’ but were conscious of a continuity between
              their eﬀorts and the struggles of the Chicago anarchists to initiate industrial
              unionism.” The Chicago idea represented “the earliest American expression of
              syndicalism.” [Salvatore Salerno, Red November, Black November, p. 71]
                 Thus, syndicalism and anarchism are not diﬀering theories but, rather,
              diﬀerent interpretations of the same ideas (see for a fuller discussion section
              H.2.8). While not all syndicalists are anarchists (some Marxists have
              proclaimed support for syndicalism) and not all anarchists are syndicalists
              (see section J.3.9 for a discussion why), all social anarchists see the need for
              taking part in the labour and other popular movements and encouraging
              libertarian forms of organisation and struggle within them. By doing this,
              inside and outside of syndicalist unions, anarchists are showing the validity of
              our ideas. For, as Kropotkin stressed, the “next revolution must from its
              inception bring about the seizure of the entire social wealth by the workers in
              order to transform it into common property. This revolution can succeed only
              through the workers, only if the urban and rural workers everywhere carry
              out this objective themselves. To that end, they must initiate their own action
              in the period before the revolution; this can happen only if there is a strong
              workers’ organisation.” [Selected Writings on Anarchism and
              Revolution, p. 20] Such popular self-managed organisations cannot be
              anything but “anarchy in action.”
              A.5.4 Anarchists in the Russian Revolution
215 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                The Russian revolution of 1917 saw a huge growth in anarchism in that
              country and many experiments in anarchist ideas. However, in popular culture
              the Russian Revolution is seen not as a mass movement by ordinary people
              struggling towards freedom but as the means by which Lenin imposed his
              dictatorship on Russia. The truth is radically diﬀerent. The Russian Revolution
              was a mass movement from below in which many diﬀerent currents of ideas
              existed and in which millions of working people (workers in the cities and
              towns as well as peasants) tried to transform their world into a better place.
              Sadly, those hopes and dreams were crushed under the dictatorship of the
              Bolshevik party — ﬁrst under Lenin, later under Stalin.
                The Russian Revolution, like most history, is a good example of the maxim
              “history is written by those who win.” Most capitalist histories of the period
              between 1917 and 1921 ignore what the anarchist Voline called “the
              unknown revolution” — the revolution called forth from below by the
              actions of ordinary people. Leninist accounts, at best, praise this autonomous
              activity of workers so long as it coincides with their own party line but
              radically condemn it (and attribute it with the basest motives) as soon as it
              strays from that line. Thus Leninist accounts will praise the workers when
              they move ahead of the Bolsheviks (as in the spring and summer of 1917) but
              will condemn them when they oppose Bolshevik policy once the Bolsheviks
              are in power. At worse, Leninist accounts portray the movement and struggles
              of the masses as little more than a backdrop to the activities of the vanguard
              party.
                For anarchists, however, the Russian Revolution is seen as a classic example
              of a social revolution in which the self-activity of working people played a key
              role. In their soviets, factory committees and other class organisations, the
              Russian masses were trying to transform society from a class-ridden,
              hierarchical statist regime into one based on liberty, equality and solidarity. As
              such, the initial months of the Revolution seemed to conﬁrm Bakunin’s
              prediction that the “future social organisation must be made solely from the
              bottom upwards, by the free associations or federations of workers, ﬁrstly in
              their unions, then in the communes, regions, nations and ﬁnally in a great
              federation, international and universal.” [Michael Bakunin: Selected
              Writings, p. 206] The soviets and factory committees expressed concretely
              Bakunin’s ideas and Anarchists played an important role in the struggle.
                The initial overthrow of the Tsar came from the direct action of the masses.
              In February 1917, the women of Petrograd erupted in bread riots. On
              February 18th, the workers of the Putilov Works in Petrograd went on strike.
              By February 22nd, the strike had spread to other factories. Two days later, 200
              000 workers were on strike and by February 25th the strike was virtually
              general. The same day also saw the ﬁrst bloody clashes between protestors
              and the army. The turning point came on the 27th, when some troops went
              over to the revolutionary masses, sweeping along other units. This left the
              government without its means of coercion, the Tsar abdicated and a
              provisional government was formed.
                So spontaneous was this movement that all the political parties were left
              behind. This included the Bolsheviks, with the “Petrograd organisation of the
              Bolsheviks oppos[ing] the calling of strikes precisely on the eve of the
              revolution destined to overthrow the Tsar. Fortunately, the workers ignored
216 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              the Bolshevik ‘directives’ and went on strike anyway … Had the workers
              followed its guidance, it is doubtful that the revolution would have occurred
              when it did.” [Murray Bookchin, Post-Scarcity Anarchism, p. 123]
                The revolution carried on in this vein of direct action from below until the
              new, “socialist” state was powerful enough to stop it.
                For the Left, the end of Tsarism was the culmination of years of eﬀort by
              socialists and anarchists everywhere. It represented the progressive wing of
              human thought overcoming traditional oppression, and as such was duly
              praised by leftists around the world. However, in Russia things were
              progressing. In the workplaces and streets and on the land, more and more
              people became convinced that abolishing feudalism politically was not
              enough. The overthrow of the Tsar made little real diﬀerence if feudal
              exploitation still existed in the economy, so workers started to seize their
              workplaces and peasants, the land. All across Russia, ordinary people started
              to build their own organisations, unions, co-operatives, factory committees
              and councils (or “soviets” in Russian). These organisations were initially
              organised in anarchist fashion, with recallable delegates and being federated
              with each other.
                Needless to say, all the political parties and organisations played a role in
              this process. The two wings of the Marxist social-democrats were active (the
              Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks), as were the Social Revolutionaries (a
              populist peasant based party) and the anarchists. The anarchists participated
              in this movement, encouraging all tendencies to self-management and urging
              the overthrow of the provisional government. They argued that it was
              necessary to transform the revolution from a purely political one into an
              economic/social one. Until the return of Lenin from exile, they were the only
              political tendency who thought along those lines.
                Lenin convinced his party to adopt the slogan “All Power to the Soviets” and
              push the revolution forward. This meant a sharp break with previous Marxist
              positions, leading one ex-Bolshevik turned Menshevik to comment that Lenin
              had “made himself a candidate for one European throne that has been vacant
              for thirty years — the throne of Bakunin!” [quoted by Alexander Rabinowitch,
              Prelude to Revolution, p. 40] The Bolsheviks now turned to winning mass
              support, championing direct action and supporting the radical actions of the
              masses, policies in the past associated with anarchism (“the Bolsheviks
              launched … slogans which until then had been particularly and insistently
              been voiced by the Anarchists.” [Voline, The Unknown Revolution, p. 210]).
              Soon they were winning more and more votes in the soviet and factory
              committee elections. As Alexander Berkman argues, the “Anarchist mottoes
              proclaimed by the Bolsheviks did not fail to bring results. The masses relied to
              their ﬂag.” [What is Anarchism?, p. 120]
                The anarchists were also inﬂuential at this time. Anarchists were
              particularly active in the movement for workers self-management of
              production which existed around the factory committees (see M. Brinton, The
              Bolsheviks and Workers Control for details). They were arguing for
              workers and peasants to expropriate the owning class, abolish all forms of
              government and re-organise society from the bottom up using their own class
              organisations — the soviets, the factory committees, co-operatives and so on.
              They could also inﬂuence the direction of struggle. As Alexander Rabinowitch
217 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              (in his study of the July uprising of 1917) notes:
                   “At the rank-and-ﬁle level, particularly within the [Petrograd]
                   garrison and at the Kronstadt naval base, there was in fact very
                   little to distinguish Bolshevik from Anarchist… The AnarchistCommunists and the Bolsheviks competed for the support of the
## same uneducated, depressed, and dissatisﬁed elements of the
## population, and the fact is that in the summer of 1917, the
                   Anarchist-Communists, with the support they enjoyed in a few
## important factories and regiments, possessed an undeniable
                   capacity to inﬂuence the course of events. Indeed, the Anarchist
                   appeal was great enough in some factories and military units to
                   inﬂuence the actions of the Bolsheviks themselves.” [Op. Cit., p. 64]
                Indeed, one leading Bolshevik stated in June, 1917 (in response to a rise in
              anarchist inﬂuence), ”[b]y fencing ourselves oﬀ from the Anarchists, we may
              fence ourselves oﬀ from the masses.” [quoted by Alexander Rabinowitch, Op.
              Cit., p. 102]
                The anarchists operated with the Bolsheviks during the October Revolution
              which overthrew the provisional government. But things changed once the
              authoritarian socialists of the Bolshevik party had seized power. While both
              anarchists and Bolsheviks used many of the same slogans, there were
              important diﬀerences between the two. As Voline argued, ”[f]rom the lips and
              pens of the Anarchists, those slogans were sincere and concrete, for they
              corresponded to their principles and called for action entirely in conformity
              with such principles. But with the Bolsheviks, the same slogans meant
              practical solutions totally diﬀerent from those of the libertarians and did not
              tally with the ideas which the slogans appeared to express.” [The Unknown
              Revolution, p. 210]
                Take, for example, the slogan “All power to the Soviets.” For anarchists it
              meant exactly that — organs for the working class to run society directly,
              based on mandated, recallable delegates. For the Bolsheviks, that slogan was
              simply the means for a Bolshevik government to be formed over and above
              the soviets. The diﬀerence is important, “for the Anarchists declared, if
              ‘power’ really should belong to the soviets, it could not belong to the
              Bolshevik party, and if it should belong to that Party, as the Bolsheviks
              envisaged, it could not belong to the soviets.” [Voline, Op. Cit., p. 213]
              Reducing the soviets to simply executing the decrees of the central
              (Bolshevik) government and having their All-Russian Congress be able to
              recall the government (i.e. those with real power) does not equal “all power,”
              quite the reverse.
                Similarly with the term “workers’ control of production.” Before the
              October Revolution Lenin saw “workers’ control” purely in terms of the
              “universal, all-embracing workers’ control over the capitalists.” [Will the
              Bolsheviks Maintain Power?, p. 52] He did not see it in terms of workers’
              management of production itself (i.e. the abolition of wage labour) via
              federations of factory committees. Anarchists and the workers’ factory
              committees did. As S.A. Smith correctly notes, Lenin used “the term
              [‘workers’ control’] in a very diﬀerent sense from that of the factory
              committees.” In fact Lenin’s “proposals … [were] thoroughly statist and
218 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              centralist in character, whereas the practice of the factory committees was
              essentially local and autonomous.” [Red Petrograd, p. 154] For anarchists,
              “if the workers’ organisations were capable of exercising eﬀective control
              [over their bosses], then they also were capable of guaranteeing all
              production. In such an event, private industry could be eliminated quickly but
              progressively, and replaced by collective industry. Consequently, the
              Anarchists rejected the vague nebulous slogan of ‘control of production.’ They
              advocated expropriation — progressive, but immediate — of private
              industry by the organisations of collective production.” [Voline, Op. Cit.,
              p. 221]
                Once in power, the Bolsheviks systematically undermined the popular
              meaning of workers’ control and replaced it with their own, statist
              conception. “On three occasions,” one historian notes, “in the ﬁrst months of
              Soviet power, the [factory] committee leaders sought to bring their model into
              being. At each point the party leadership overruled them. The result was to
              vest both managerial and control powers in organs of the state which were
              subordinate to the central authorities, and formed by them.” [Thomas F.
              Remington, Building Socialism in Bolshevik Russia, p. 38] This process
              ultimately resulted in Lenin arguing for, and introducing, “one-man
              management” armed with “dictatorial” power (with the manager appointed
              from above by the state) in April 1918. This process is documented in Maurice
              Brinton’s The Bolsheviks and Workers’ Control, which also indicates the
              clear links between Bolshevik practice and Bolshevik ideology as well as how
              both diﬀered from popular activity and ideas.
                Hence the comments by Russian Anarchist Peter Arshinov:
                   “Another no less important peculiarity is that [the] October
                   [revolution of 1917] has two meanings — that which the working’
                   masses who participated in the social revolution gave it, and with
                   them the Anarchist-Communists, and that which was given it by the
                   political party [the Marxist-Communists] that captured power from
                   this aspiration to social revolution, and which betrayed and stiﬂed
                   all further development. An enormous gulf exists between these two
                   interpretations of October. The October of the workers and peasants
                   is the suppression of the power of the parasite classes in the name
                   of equality and self-management. The Bolshevik October is the
                   conquest of power by the party of the revolutionary intelligentsia,
                   the installation of its ‘State Socialism’ and of its ‘socialist’ methods
                   of governing the masses.” [The Two Octobers]
                Initially, anarchists had supported the Bolsheviks, since the Bolshevik
              leaders had hidden their state-building ideology behind support for the soviets
              (as socialist historian Samuel Farber notes, the anarchists “had actually been
              an unnamed coalition partner of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution.”
              [Before Stalinism, p. 126]). However, this support quickly “withered away”
              as the Bolsheviks showed that they were, in fact, not seeking true socialism
              but were instead securing power for themselves and pushing not for collective
              ownership of land and productive resources but for government ownership.
              The Bolsheviks, as noted, systematically undermined the workers’ control/selfmanagement movement in favour of capitalist-like forms of workplace

              management based around “one-man management” armed with “dictatorial
              powers.”
                As regards the soviets, the Bolsheviks systematically undermining what
              limited independence and democracy they had. In response to the “great
              Bolshevik losses in the soviet elections” during the spring and summer of
              1918 “Bolshevik armed force usually overthrew the results of these provincial
              elections.” Also, the “government continually postponed the new general
              elections to the Petrograd Soviet, the term of which had ended in March
              1918. Apparently, the government feared that the opposition parties would
              show gains.” [Samuel Farber, Op. Cit., p. 24 and p. 22] In the Petrograd
              elections, the Bolsheviks “lost the absolute majority in the soviet they had
              previously enjoyed” but remained the largest party. However, the results of
              the Petrograd soviet elections were irrelevant as a “Bolshevik victory was
              assured by the numerically quite signiﬁcant representation now given to trade
              unions, district soviets, factory-shop committees, district workers
              conferences, and Red Army and naval units, in which the Bolsheviks had
              overwhelming strength.” [Alexander Rabinowitch, “The Evolution of Local
              Soviets in Petrograd”, pp. 20–37, Slavic Review, Vol. 36, No. 1, p. 36f] In
              other words, the Bolsheviks had undermined the democratic nature of the
              soviet by swamping it by their own delegates. Faced with rejection in the
              soviets, the Bolsheviks showed that for them “soviet power” equalled party
              power. To stay in power, the Bolsheviks had to destroy the soviets, which they
              did. The soviet system remained “soviet” in name only. Indeed, from 1919
              onwards Lenin, Trotsky and other leading Bolsheviks were admitting that they
              had created a party dictatorship and, moreover, that such a dictatorship was
              essential for any revolution (Trotsky supported party dictatorship even after
              the rise of Stalinism).
                The Red Army, moreover, no longer was a democratic organisation. In
              March of 1918 Trotsky had abolished the election of oﬀicers and soldier
              committees:
                   “the principle of election is politically purposeless and technically
                   inexpedient, and it has been, in practice, abolished by decree.”
                   [Work, Discipline, Order]
               As Maurice Brinton correctly summarises:
                   “Trotsky, appointed Commissar of Military Aﬀairs after BrestLitovsk, had rapidly been reorganising the Red Army. The death
                   penalty for disobedience under ﬁre had been restored. So, more
                   gradually, had saluting, special forms of address, separate living
                   quarters and other privileges for oﬀicers. Democratic forms of
                   organisation, including the election of oﬀicers, had been quickly
                   dispensed with.” [“The Bolsheviks and Workers’ Control”, For
                   Workers’ Power, pp. 336–7]
                Unsurprisingly, Samuel Farber notes that “there is no evidence indicating
              that Lenin or any of the mainstream Bolshevik leaders lamented the loss of
              workers’ control or of democracy in the soviets, or at least referred to these
              losses as a retreat, as Lenin declared with the replacement of War

              Communism by NEP in 1921.” [Before Stalinism, p. 44]
                Thus after the October Revolution, anarchists started to denounce the
              Bolshevik regime and call for a “Third Revolution” which would ﬁnally free
              the masses from all bosses (capitalist or socialist). They exposed the
              fundamental diﬀerence between the rhetoric of Bolshevism (as expressed, for
              example, in Lenin’s State and Revolution) with its reality. Bolshevism in
              power had proved Bakunin’s prediction that the “dictatorship of the
              proletariat” would become the “dictatorship over the proletariat” by the
              leaders of the Communist Party.
                The inﬂuence of the anarchists started to grow. As Jacques Sadoul (a French
              oﬀicer) noted in early 1918:
                   “The anarchist party is the most active, the most militant of the
                   opposition groups and probably the most popular … The Bolsheviks
                   are anxious.” [quoted by Daniel Guerin, Anarchism, pp. 95–6]
                 By April 1918, the Bolsheviks began the physical suppression of their
              anarchist rivals. On April 12th, 1918, the Cheka (the secret police formed by
              Lenin in December, 1917) attacked anarchist centres in Moscow. Those in
              other cities were attacked soon after. As well as repressing their most vocal
              opponents on the left, the Bolsheviks were restricting the freedom of the
              masses they claimed to be protecting. Democratic soviets, free speech,
              opposition political parties and groups, self-management in the workplace and
              on the land — all were destroyed in the name of “socialism.” All this
              happened, we must stress, before the start of the Civil War in late May, 1918,
              which most supporters of Leninism blame for the Bolsheviks’
              authoritarianism. During the civil war, this process accelerated, with the
              Bolsheviks’ systematically repressing opposition from all quarters — including
              the strikes and protests of the very class who they claimed was exercising its
              “dictatorship” while they were in power!
                 It is important to stress that this process had started well before the start
              of the civil war, conﬁrming anarchist theory that a “workers’ state” is a
              contraction in terms. For anarchists, the Bolshevik substitution of party power
              for workers power (and the conﬂict between the two) did not come as a
              surprise. The state is the delegation of power — as such, it means that the
              idea of a “workers’ state” expressing “workers’ power” is a logical
              impossibility. If workers are running society then power rests in their hands.
              If a state exists then power rests in the hands of the handful of people at the
              top, not in the hands of all. The state was designed for minority rule. No state
              can be an organ of working class (i.e. majority) self-management due to its
              basic nature, structure and design. For this reason anarchists have argued for
              a bottom-up federation of workers’ councils as the agent of revolution and the
              means of managing society after capitalism and the state have been
              abolished.
                 As we discuss in section H, the degeneration of the Bolsheviks from a
              popular working class party into dictators over the working class did not
              occur by accident. A combination of political ideas and the realities of state
              power (and the social relationships it generates) could not help but result in
              such a degeneration. The political ideas of Bolshevism, with its vanguardism,
              fear of spontaneity and identiﬁcation of party power with working class power
221 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              inevitably meant that the party would clash with those whom it claimed to
              represent. After all, if the party is the vanguard then, automatically, everyone
              else is a “backward” element. This meant that if the working class resisted
              Bolshevik policies or rejected them in soviet elections, then the working class
              was “wavering” and being inﬂuenced by “petty-bourgeois” and “backward”
              elements. Vanguardism breeds elitism and, when combined with state power,
              dictatorship.
                State power, as anarchists have always stressed, means the delegation of
              power into the hands of a few. This automatically produces a class division in
              society — those with power and those without. As such, once in power the
              Bolsheviks were isolated from the working class. The Russian Revolution
              conﬁrmed Malatesta’s argument that a “government, that is a group of people
              entrusted with making laws and empowered to use the collective power to
              oblige each individual to obey them, is already a privileged class and cut oﬀ
              from the people. As any constituted body would do, it will instinctively seek to
              extend its powers, to be beyond public control, to impose its own policies and
              to give priority to its special interests. Having been put in a privileged
              position, the government is already at odds with the people whose strength it
              disposes of.” [Anarchy, p. 34] A highly centralised state such as the
              Bolsheviks built would reduce accountability to a minimum while at the same
              time accelerating the isolation of the rulers from the ruled. The masses were
              no longer a source of inspiration and power, but rather an alien group whose
              lack of “discipline” (i.e. ability to follow orders) placed the revolution in
              danger. As one Russian Anarchist argued:
                   “The proletariat is being gradually enserfed by the state. The people
                   are being transformed into servants over whom there has arisen a
                   new class of administrators — a new class born mainly form the
                   womb of the so-called intelligentsia … We do not mean to say … that
                   the Bolshevik party set out to create a new class system. But we do
                   say that even the best intentions and aspirations must inevitably be
                   smashed against the evils inherent in any system of centralised
                   power. The separation of management from labour, the division
## between administrators and workers ﬂows logically from
                   centralisation. It cannot be otherwise.” [The Anarchists in the
                   Russian Revolution, pp. 123–4]
                For this reason anarchists, while agreeing that there is an uneven
              development of political ideas within the working class, reject the idea that
              “revolutionaries” should take power on behalf of working people. Only when
              working people actually run society themselves will a revolution be
              successful. For anarchists, this meant that ”[e]ﬀective emancipation can be
              achieved only by the direct, widespread, and independent action … of
              the workers themselves, grouped … in their own class organisations … on
              the basis of concrete action and self-government, helped but not governed,
              by revolutionaries working in the very midst of, and not above the mass and
              the professional, technical, defence and other branches.” [Voline, Op. Cit., p.
              197] By substituting party power for workers power, the Russian Revolution
              had made its ﬁrst fatal step. Little wonder that the following prediction (from
              November 1917) made by anarchists in Russia came true:
222 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   “Once their power is consolidated and ‘legalised’, the Bolsheviks
                   who are … men of centralist and authoritarian action will begin to
                   rearrange the life of the country and of the people by governmental
                   and dictatorial methods, imposed by the centre. The[y] … will
                   dictate the will of the party to all Russia, and command the whole
                   nation. Your Soviets and your other local organisations will
                   become little by little, simply executive organs of the will of
                   the central government. In the place of healthy, constructive work
                   by the labouring masses, in place of free uniﬁcation from the
                   bottom, we will see the installation of an authoritarian and statist
                   apparatus which would act from above and set about wiping out
                   everything that stood in its way with an iron hand.” [quoted by
                   Voline, Op. Cit., p. 235]
                The so-called “workers’ state” could not be participatory or empowering for
              working class people (as the Marxists claimed) simply because state
              structures are not designed for that. Created as instruments of minority rule,
              they cannot be transformed into (nor “new” ones created which are) a means
              of liberation for the working classes. As Kropotkin put it, Anarchists “maintain
              that the State organisation, having been the force to which minorities
              resorted for establishing and organising their power over the masses, cannot
              be the force which will serve to destroy these privileges.” [Anarchism, p.
              170] In the words of an anarchist pamphlet written in 1918:
                   “Bolshevism, day by day and step by step, proves that state power
                   possesses inalienable characteristics; it can change its label, its
                   ‘theory’, and its servitors, but in essence it merely remains power
## and despotism in new forms.” [quoted by Paul Avrich, “The
## Anarchists in the Russian Revolution,” pp. 341–350, Russian
                   Review, vol. 26, issue no. 4, p. 347]
                For insiders, the Revolution had died a few months after the Bolsheviks took
              over. To the outside world, the Bolsheviks and the USSR came to represent
              “socialism” even as they systematically destroyed the basis of real socialism.
              By transforming the soviets into state bodies, substituting party power for
              soviet power, undermining the factory committees, eliminating democracy in
              the armed forces and workplaces, repressing the political opposition and
              workers’ protests, the Bolsheviks eﬀectively marginalised the working class
              from its own revolution. Bolshevik ideology and practice were themselves
              important and sometimes decisive factors in the degeneration of the
              revolution and the ultimate rise of Stalinism.
                As anarchists had predicted for decades previously, in the space of a few
              months, and before the start of the Civil War, the Bolshevik’s “workers’ state”
              had become, like any state, an alien power over the working class and an
              instrument of minority rule (in this case, the rule of the party). The Civil War
              accelerated this process and soon party dictatorship was introduced (indeed,
              leading Bolsheviks began arguing that it was essential in any revolution). The
              Bolsheviks put down the libertarian socialist elements within their country,
              with the crushing of the uprising at Kronstadt and the Makhnovist movement
              in the Ukraine being the ﬁnal nails in the coﬀin of socialism and the

              subjugation of the soviets.
                The Kronstadt uprising of February, 1921, was, for anarchists, of immense
              importance (see the appendix “What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?” for a full
              discussion of this uprising). The uprising started when the sailors of Kronstadt
              supported the striking workers of Petrograd in February, 1921. They raised a
              15 point resolution, the ﬁrst point of which was a call for soviet democracy.
              The Bolsheviks slandered the Kronstadt rebels as counter-revolutionaries and
              crushed the revolt. For anarchists, this was signiﬁcant as the repression could
              not be justiﬁed in terms of the Civil War (which had ended months before) and
              because it was a major uprising of ordinary people for real socialism. As
              Voline puts it:
                   “Kronstadt was the ﬁrst entirely independent attempt of the people
                   to liberate themselves of all yokes and carry out the Social
                   Revolution: this attempt was made directly … by the working
                   masses themselves, without political shepherds, without leaders or
                   tutors. It was the ﬁrst step towards the third and social revolution.”
                   [Voline, Op. Cit., pp. 537–8]
                In the Ukraine, anarchist ideas were most successfully applied. In areas
              under the protection of the Makhnovist movement, working class people
              organised their own lives directly, based on their own ideas and needs — true
              social self-determination. Under the leadership of Nestor Makhno, a selfeducated peasant, the movement not only fought against both Red and White
              dictatorships but also resisted the Ukrainian nationalists. In opposition to the
              call for “national self-determination,” i.e. a new Ukrainian state, Makhno
              called instead for working class self-determination in the Ukraine and across
              the world. Makhno inspired his fellow peasants and workers to ﬁght for real
              freedom:
                   “Conquer or die — such is the dilemma that faces the Ukrainian
                   peasants and workers at this historic moment … But we will not
                   conquer in order to repeat the errors of the past years, the error of
                   putting our fate into the hands of new masters; we will conquer in
                   order to take our destinies into our own hands, to conduct our lives
                   according to our own will and our own conception of the truth.”
                   [quoted by Peter Arshinov, History of the Makhnovist Movement,
                   p. 58]
                To ensure this end, the Makhnovists refused to set up governments in the
              towns and cities they liberated, instead urging the creation of free soviets so
              that the working people could govern themselves. Taking the example of
              Aleksandrovsk, once they had liberated the city the Makhnovists “immediately
              invited the working population to participate in a general conference … it was
              proposed that the workers organise the life of the city and the functioning of
              the factories with their own forces and their own organisations … The ﬁrst
              conference was followed by a second. The problems of organising life
              according to principles of self-management by workers were examined and
              discussed with animation by the masses of workers, who all welcomed this
              ideas with the greatest enthusiasm … Railroad workers took the ﬁrst step …

              They formed a committee charged with organising the railway network of the
              region … From this point, the proletariat of Aleksandrovsk began to turn
              systematically to the problem of creating organs of self-management.” [Op.
              Cit., p. 149]
                The Makhnovists argued that the “freedom of the workers and peasants is
              their own, and not subject to any restriction. It is up to the workers and
              peasants themselves to act, to organise themselves, to agree among
              themselves in all aspects of their lives, as they see ﬁt and desire .. . The
              Makhnovists can do no more than give aid and counsel … In no circumstances
              can they, nor do they wish to, govern.” [Peter Arshinov, quoted by Guerin, Op.
              Cit., p. 99] In Alexandrovsk, the Bolsheviks proposed to the Makhnovists
              spheres of action — their Revkom (Revolutionary Committee) would handle
              political aﬀairs and the Makhnovists military ones. Makhno advised them “to
              go and take up some honest trade instead of seeking to impose their will on
              the workers.” [Peter Arshinov in The Anarchist Reader, p. 141]
                They also organised free agricultural communes which ”[a]dmittedly .. .
              were not numerous, and included only a minority of the population .. . But
              what was most precious was that these communes were formed by the poor
              peasants themselves. The Makhnovists never exerted any pressure on the
              peasants, conﬁning themselves to propagating the idea of free communes.”
              [Arshinov, History of the Makhnovist Movement, p. 87] Makhno played an
              important role in abolishing the holdings of the landed gentry. The local soviet
              and their district and regional congresses equalised the use of the land
              between all sections of the peasant community. [Op. Cit., pp. 53–4]
                Moreover, the Makhnovists took the time and energy to involve the whole
              population in discussing the development of the revolution, the activities of
              the army and social policy. They organised numerous conferences of workers’,
              soldiers’ and peasants’ delegates to discuss political and social issues as well
              as free soviets, unions and communes. They organised a regional congress of
              peasants and workers when they had liberated Aleksandrovsk. When the
              Makhnovists tried to convene the third regional congress of peasants,
              workers and insurgents in April 1919 and an extraordinary congress of
              several regions in June 1919 the Bolsheviks viewed them as counterrevolutionary, tried to ban them and declared their organisers and delegates
              outside the law.
                The Makhnovists replied by holding the conferences anyway and asking
              ”[c]an there exist laws made by a few people who call themselves
              revolutionaries, which permit them to outlaw a whole people who are more
              revolutionary than they are themselves?” and ”[w]hose interests should the
              revolution defend: those of the Party or those of the people who set the
              revolution in motion with their blood?” Makhno himself stated that he
              “consider[ed] it an inviolable right of the workers and peasants, a right won
              by the revolution, to call conferences on their own account, to discuss their
              aﬀairs.” [Op. Cit., p. 103 and p. 129]
                In addition, the Makhnovists “fully applied the revolutionary principles of
              freedom of speech, of thought, of the press, and of political association. In all
              cities and towns occupied by the Makhnovists, they began by lifting all the
              prohibitions and repealing all the restrictions imposed on the press and on
              political organisations by one or another power.” Indeed, the “only restriction
225 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              that the Makhnovists considered necessary to impose on the Bolsheviks, the
              left Socialist-Revolutionaries and other statists was a prohibition on the
              formation of those ‘revolutionary committees’ which sought to impose a
              dictatorship over the people.” [Op. Cit., p. 153 and p. 154]
                The Makhnovists rejected the Bolshevik corruption of the soviets and
              instead proposed “the free and completely independent soviet system of
              working people without authorities and their arbitrary laws.” Their
              proclamations stated that the “working people themselves must freely choose
              their own soviets, which carry out the will and desires of the working people
              themselves, that is to say. ADMINISTRATIVE, not ruling soviets.”
              Economically, capitalism would be abolished along with the state — the land
              and workshops “must belong to the working people themselves, to those who
              work in them, that is to say, they must be socialised.” [Op. Cit., p. 271 and p.
              273]
                The army itself, in stark contrast to the Red Army, was fundamentally
              democratic (although, of course, the horriﬁc nature of the civil war did result
              in a few deviations from the ideal — however, compared to the regime
              imposed on the Red Army by Trotsky, the Makhnovists were much more
              democratic movement).
                The anarchist experiment of self-management in the Ukraine came to a
              bloody end when the Bolsheviks turned on the Makhnovists (their former
              allies against the “Whites,” or pro-Tsarists) when they were no longer needed.
              This important movement is fully discussed in the appendix “Why does the
              Makhnovist movement show there is an alternative to Bolshevism?” of our
              FAQ. However, we must stress here the one obvious lesson of the Makhnovist
              movement, namely that the dictatorial policies pursued by the Bolsheviks
              were not imposed on them by objective circumstances. Rather, the political
              ideas of Bolshevism had a clear inﬂuence in the decisions they made. After all,
              the Makhnovists were active in the same Civil War and yet did not pursue the
              same policies of party power as the Bolsheviks did. Rather, they successfully
              encouraged working class freedom, democracy and power in extremely
              diﬀicult circumstances (and in the face of strong Bolshevik opposition to those
              policies). The received wisdom on the left is that there was no alternative
              open to the Bolsheviks. The experience of the Makhnovists disproves this.
              What the masses of people, as well as those in power, do and think politically
              is as much part of the process determining the outcome of history as are the
              objective obstacles that limit the choices available. Clearly, ideas do matter
              and, as such, the Makhnovists show that there was (and is) a practical
              alternative to Bolshevism — anarchism.
                The last anarchist march in Moscow until 1987 took place at the funeral of
              Kropotkin in 1921, when over 10,000 marched behind his coﬀin. They carried
              black banners declaring “Where there is authority, there is no freedom” and
              “The Liberation of the working class is the task of the workers themselves.”
              As the procession passed the Butyrki prison, the inmates sang anarchist songs
              and shook the bars of their cells.
                Anarchist opposition within Russia to the Bolshevik regime started in 1918.
              They were the ﬁrst left-wing group to be repressed by the new
              “revolutionary” regime. Outside of Russia, anarchists continued to support
              the Bolsheviks until news came from anarchist sources about the repressive
226 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              nature of the Bolshevik regime (until then, many had discounted negative
              reports as being from pro-capitalist sources). Once these reliable reports
              came in, anarchists across the globe rejected Bolshevism and its system of
              party power and repression. The experience of Bolshevism conﬁrmed
              Bakunin’s prediction that Marxism meant “the highly despotic government of
              the masses by a new and very small aristocracy of real or pretended scholars.
              The people are not learned, so they will be liberated from the cares of
              government and included in entirety in the governed herd.” [Statism and
              Anarchy, pp. 178–9]
                From about 1921 on, anarchists outside of Russia started describing the
              USSR as “state-capitalist” to indicate that although individual bosses might
              have been eliminated, the Soviet state bureaucracy played the same role as
              individual bosses do in the West (anarchists within Russia had been calling it
              that since 1918). For anarchists, “the Russian revolution … is trying to reach
              … economic equality … this eﬀort has been made in Russia under a strongly
              centralised party dictatorship … this eﬀort to build a communist republic on
              the basis of a strongly centralised state communism under the iron law of a
              party dictatorship is bound to end in failure. We are learning to know in
              Russia how not to introduce communism.” [Anarchism, p. 254]
                This meant exposing that Berkman called “The Bolshevik Myth,” the idea
              that the Russian Revolution was a success and should be copied by
              revolutionaries in other countries: “It is imperative to unmask the great
              delusion, which otherwise might lead the Western workers to the same abyss
              as their brothers [and sisters] in Russia. It is incumbent upon those who have
              seen through the myth to expose its true nature.” [“The Anti-Climax’”, The
              Bolshevik Myth, p. 342] Moreover, anarchists felt that it was their
              revolutionary duty not only present and learn from the facts of the revolution
              but also show solidarity with those subject to Bolshevik dictatorship. As
              Emma Goldman argued, she had not “come to Russia expecting to ﬁnd
              Anarchism realised.” Such idealism was alien to her (although that has not
              stopped Leninists saying the opposite). Rather, she expected to see “the
              beginnings of the social changes for which the Revolution had been fought.”
              She was aware that revolutions were diﬀicult, involving “destruction” and
              “violence.” That Russia was not perfect was not the source of her vocal
              opposition to Bolshevism. Rather, it was the fact that “the Russian people
              have been locked out” of their own revolution by the Bolshevik state which
              used “the sword and the gun to keep the people out.” As a revolutionary she
              refused “to side with the master class, which in Russia is called the
              Communist Party.” [My Disillusionment in Russia, p. xlvii and p. xliv]

              anarchists, see the appendix on “The Russian Revolution” of the FAQ. As well

                Many of these books were written by anarchists active during the
              revolution, many imprisoned by the Bolsheviks and deported to the West due
              to international pressure exerted by anarcho-syndicalist delegates to Moscow
              who the Bolsheviks were trying to win over to Leninism. The majority of such
              delegates stayed true to their libertarian politics and convinced their unions
              to reject Bolshevism and break with Moscow. By the early 1920’s all the
              anarcho-syndicalist union confederations had joined with the anarchists in
              rejecting the “socialism” in Russia as state capitalism and party dictatorship.
              A.5.5 Anarchists in the Italian Factory Occupations
                 After the end of the First World War there was a massive radicalisation
              across Europe and the world. Union membership exploded, with strikes,
              demonstrations and agitation reaching massive levels. This was partly due to
              the war, partly to the apparent success of the Russian Revolution. This
              enthusiasm for the Russian Revolution even reached Individualist Anarchists
              like Joseph Labadie, who like many other anti-capitalists, saw “the red in the
              east [giving] hope of a brighter day” and the Bolsheviks as making “laudable
              eﬀorts to at least try some way out of the hell of industrial slavery.” [quoted
              by Carlotta R. Anderson, All-American Anarchist p. 225 and p. 241]
                 Across Europe, anarchist ideas became more popular and anarchosyndicalist unions grew in size. For example, in Britain, the ferment produced
              the shop stewards’ movement and the strikes on Clydeside; Germany saw the
              rise of IWW inspired industrial unionism and a libertarian form of Marxism
              called “Council Communism”; Spain saw a massive growth in the anarchosyndicalist CNT. In addition, it also, unfortunately, saw the rise and growth of
              both social democratic and communist parties. Italy was no exception.
                 In Turin, a new rank-and-ﬁle movement was developing. This movement was
              based around the “internal commissions” (elected ad hoc grievance
              committees). These new organisations were based directly on the group of
              people who worked together in a particular work shop, with a mandated and
              recallable shop steward elected for each group of 15 to 20 or so workers. The
              assembly of all the shop stewards in a given plant then elected the “internal
              commission” for that facility, which was directly and constantly responsible to
              the body of shop stewards, which was called the “factory council.”
                 Between November 1918 and March 1919, the internal commissions had
              become a national issue within the trade union movement. On February 20,
              1919, the Italian Federation of Metal Workers (FIOM) won a contract
              providing for the election of “internal commissions” in the factories. The
              workers subsequently tried to transform these organs of workers’
              representation into factory councils with a managerial function. By May Day
              1919, the internal commissions “were becoming the dominant force within the
              metalworking industry and the unions were in danger of becoming marginal
              administrative units. Behind these alarming developments, in the eyes of
              reformists, lay the libertarians.” [Carl Levy, Gramsci and the Anarchists, p.
228 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              135] By November 1919 the internal commissions of Turin were transformed
              into factory councils.
                 The movement in Turin is usually associated with the weekly L’Ordine
              Nuovo (The New Order), which ﬁrst appeared on May 1, 1919. As Daniel
              Guerin summarises, it was “edited by a left socialist, Antonio Gramsci,
              assisted by a professor of philosophy at Turin University with anarchist ideas,
              writing under the pseudonym of Carlo Petri, and also of a whole nucleus of
              Turin libertarians. In the factories, the Ordine Nuovo group was supported by
              a number of people, especially the anarcho-syndicalist militants of the metal
              trades, Pietro Ferrero and Maurizio Garino. The manifesto of Ordine Nuovo
              was signed by socialists and libertarians together, agreeing to regard the
              factory councils as ‘organs suited to future communist management of both
              the individual factory and the whole society.’” [Anarchism, p. 109]
                 The developments in Turin should not be taken in isolation. All across Italy,
              workers and peasants were taking action. In late February 1920, a rash of
              factory occupations broke out in Liguria, Piedmont and Naples. In Liguria, the
              workers occupied the metal and shipbuilding plants in Sestri Ponente,
              Cornigliano and Campi after a breakdown of pay talks. For up to four days,
              under syndicalist leadership, they ran the plants through factory councils.
                 During this period the Italian Syndicalist Union (USI) grew in size to around
              800 000 members and the inﬂuence of the Italian Anarchist Union (UAI) with
              its 20 000 members and daily paper (Umanita Nova) grew correspondingly.
              As the Welsh Marxist historian Gwyn A. Williams points out “Anarchists and
              revolutionary syndicalists were the most consistently and totally revolutionary
              group on the left … the most obvious feature of the history of syndicalism and
              anarchism in 1919–20: rapid and virtually continuous growth … The
              syndicalists above all captured militant working-class opinion which the
              socialist movement was utterly failing to capture.” [Proletarian Order, pp.
              194–195] In Turin, libertarians “worked within FIOM” and had been “heavily
              involved in the Ordine Nuovo campaign from the beginning.” [Op. Cit., p.
              195] Unsurprisingly, Ordone Nuovo was denounced as “syndicalist” by other
              socialists.
                 It was the anarchists and syndicalists who ﬁrst raised the idea of occupying
              workplaces. Malatesta was discussing this idea in Umanita Nova in March,
              1920. In his words, “General strikes of protest no longer upset anyone … One
              must seek something else. We put forward an idea: take-over of factories…
              the method certainly has a future, because it corresponds to the ultimate ends
              of the workers’ movement and constitutes an exercise preparing one for the
              ultimate act of expropriation.” [Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, p.
              134] In the same month, during “a strong syndicalist campaign to establish
              councils in Mila, Armando Borghi [anarchist secretary of the USI] called for
              mass factory occupations. In Turin, the re-election of workshop commissars
              was just ending in a two-week orgy of passionate discussion and workers
              caught the fever. [Factory Council] Commissars began to call for
              occupations.” Indeed, “the council movement outside Turin was essentially
              anarcho-syndicalist.” Unsurprisingly, the secretary of the syndicalist metalworkers “urged support for the Turin councils because they represented antibureaucratic direct action, aimed at control of the factory and could be the
              ﬁrst cells of syndicalist industrial unions … The syndicalist congress voted to

              support the councils… . Malatesta … supported them as a form of direct
              action guaranteed to generate rebelliousness … Umanita Nova and Guerra
              di Classe [paper of the USI] became almost as committed to the councils as
              L’Ordine Nuovo and the Turin edition of Avanti.” [Williams, Op. Cit., p. 200,
              p. 193 and p. 196]
                 The upsurge in militancy soon provoked an employer counter-oﬀensive. The
              bosses organisation denounced the factory councils and called for a
              mobilisation against them. Workers were rebelling and refusing to follow the
              bosses orders — “indiscipline” was rising in the factories. They won state
              support for the enforcement of the existing industrial regulations. The
              national contract won by the FIOM in 1919 had provided that the internal
              commissions were banned from the shop ﬂoor and restricted to non-working
              hours. This meant that the activities of the shop stewards’ movement in Turin
              — such as stopping work to hold shop steward elections — were in violation of
              the contract. The movement was essentially being maintained through mass
              insubordination. The bosses used this infringement of the agreed contract as
              the means combating the factory councils in Turin.
                 The showdown with the employers arrived in April, when a general
              assembly of shop stewards at Fiat called for sit-in strikes to protest the
              dismissal of several shop stewards. In response the employers declared a
              general lockout. The government supported the lockout with a mass show of
              force and troops occupied the factories and mounted machine guns posts at
              them. When the shop stewards movement decided to surrender on the
              immediate issues in dispute after two weeks on strike, the employers
              responded with demands that the shop stewards councils be limited to nonworking hours, in accordance with the FIOM national contract, and that
              managerial control be re-imposed.
                 These demands were aimed at the heart of the factory council system and
              Turin labour movement responded with a massive general strike in defence of
              it. In Turin, the strike was total and it soon spread throughout the region of
              Piedmont and involved 500 000 workers at its height. The Turin strikers
              called for the strike to be extended nationally and, being mostly led by
              socialists, they turned to the CGL trade union and Socialist Party leaders, who
              rejected their call.
                 The only support for the Turin general strike came from unions that were
              mainly under anarcho-syndicalist inﬂuence, such as the independent railway
              and the maritime workers unions (“The syndicalists were the only ones to
              move.”). The railway workers in Pisa and Florence refused to transport troops
              who were being sent to Turin. There were strikes all around Genoa, among
              dock workers and in workplaces where the USI was a major inﬂuence. So in
              spite of being “betrayed and abandoned by the whole socialist movement,”
              the April movement “still found popular support” with “actions … either
              directly led or indirectly inspired by anarcho-syndicalists.” In Turin itself, the
              anarchists and syndicalists were “threatening to cut the council movement
              out from under” Gramsci and the Ordine Nuovo group. [Williams, Op. Cit.,
              p. 207, p. 193 and p. 194]
                 Eventually the CGL leadership settled the strike on terms that accepted the
              employers’ main demand for limiting the shop stewards’ councils to nonworking hours. Though the councils were now much reduced in activity and

              shop ﬂoor presence, they would yet see a resurgence of their position during
              the September factory occupations.
                The anarchists “accused the socialists of betrayal. They criticised what they
              believed was a false sense of discipline that had bound socialists to their own
              cowardly leadership. They contrasted the discipline that placed every
              movement under the ‘calculations, fears, mistakes and possible betrayals of
              the leaders’ to the other discipline of the workers of Sestri Ponente who
              struck in solidarity with Turin, the discipline of the railway workers who
              refused to transport security forces to Turin and the anarchists and members
              of the Unione Sindacale who forgot considerations of party and sect to put
              themselves at the disposition of the Torinesi.” [Carl Levy, Op. Cit., p. 161]
              Sadly, this top-down “discipline” of the socialists and their unions would be
              repeated during the factory occupations, with terrible results.
                In September, 1920, there were large-scale stay-in strikes in Italy in
              response to an owner wage cut and lockout. “Central to the climate of the
              crisis was the rise of the syndicalists.” In mid-August, the USI metal-workers
              “called for both unions to occupy the factories” and called for “a preventive
              occupation” against lock-outs. The USI saw this as the “expropriation of the
              factories by the metal-workers” (which must “be defended by all necessary
              measures”) and saw the need “to call the workers of other industries into
              battle.” [Williams, Op. Cit., p. 236, pp. 238–9] Indeed, ”[i]f the FIOM had not
              embraced the syndicalist idea of an occupation of factories to counter an
              employer’s lockout, the USI may well have won signiﬁcant support from the
              politically active working class of Turin.” [Carl Levy, Op. Cit., p. 129] These
              strikes began in the engineering factories and soon spread to railways, road
              transport, and other industries, with peasants seizing land. The strikers,
              however, did more than just occupy their workplaces, they placed them under
              workers’ self-management. Soon over 500 000 “strikers” were at work,
              producing for themselves. Errico Malatesta, who took part in these events,
              writes:
                   “The metal workers started the movement over wage rates. It was a
                   strike of a new kind. Instead of abandoning the factories, the idea
                   was to remain inside without working … Throughout Italy there was
                   a revolutionary fervour among the workers and soon the demands
                   changed their characters. Workers thought that the moment was
                   ripe to take possession once [and] for all the means of production.
                   They armed for defence … and began to organise production on
                   their own … It was the right of property abolished in fact …; it was a
                   new regime, a new form of social life that was being ushered in. And
## the government stood by because it felt impotent to oﬀer
                   opposition.” [Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, p. 134]
               Daniel Guerin provides a good summary of the extent of the movement:
                   “The management of the factories … [was] conducted by technical
                   and administrative workers’ committees. Self-management went
                   quite a long way: in the early period assistance was obtained from
                   the banks, but when it was withdrawn the self-management system
                   issued its own money to pay the workers’ wages. Very strict self231 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM

                   discipline was required, the use of alcoholic beverages forbidden,
                   and armed patrols were organised for self-defence. Very close
                   solidarity was established between the factories under self-
## management. Ores and coal were put into a common pool, and
                   shared out equitably.” [Anarchism, p. 109]
                 Italy was “paralysed, with half a million workers occupying their factories
              and raising red and black ﬂags over them.” The movement spread throughout
              Italy, not only in the industrial heartland around Milan, Turin and Genoa, but
              also in Rome, Florence, Naples and Palermo. The “militants of the USI were
              certainly in the forefront of the movement,” while Umanita Nova argued that
              “the movement is very serious and we must do everything we can to channel
              it towards a massive extension.” The persistent call of the USI was for “an
              extension of the movement to the whole of industry to institute their
              ‘expropriating general strike.’” [Williams, Op. Cit., p. 236 and pp. 243–4]
              Railway workers, inﬂuenced by the libertarians, refused to transport troops,
              workers went on strike against the orders of the reformist unions and
              peasants occupied the land. The anarchists whole-heartedly supported the
              movement, unsurprisingly as the “occupation of the factories and the land
              suited perfectly our programme of action.” [Malatesta, Op. Cit., p. 135] Luigi
              Fabbri described the occupations as having “revealed a power in the
              proletariat of which it had been unaware hitherto.” [quoted by Paolo Sprinao,
              The Occupation of the Factories, p. 134]
                 However, after four weeks of occupation, the workers decided to leave the
              factories. This was because of the actions of the socialist party and the
              reformist trade unions. They opposed the movement and negotiated with the
              state for a return to “normality” in exchange for a promise to extend workers’
              control legally, in association with the bosses. The question of revolution was
              decided by a vote of the CGL national council in Milan on April 10–11th,
              without consulting the syndicalist unions, after the Socialist Party leadership
              refused to decide one way or the other.
                 Needless to say, this promise of “workers’ control” was not kept. The lack of
              independent inter-factory organisation made workers dependent on trade
              union bureaucrats for information on what was going on in other cities, and
              they used that power to isolate factories, cities, and factories from each other.
              This lead to a return to work, “in spite of the opposition of individual
              anarchists dispersed among the factories.” [Malatesta, Op. Cit., p. 136] The
              local syndicalist union confederations could not provide the necessary
              framework for a fully co-ordinated occupation movement as the reformist
              unions refused to work with them; and although the anarchists were a large
              minority, they were still a minority:
                   “At the ‘interproletarian’ convention held on 12 September (in which
                   the Unione Anarchia, the railwaymen’s and maritime workers union
                   participated) the syndicalist union decided that ‘we cannot do it
                   ourselves’ without the socialist party and the CGL, protested against
                   the ‘counter-revolutionary vote’ of Milan, declared it minoritarian,
                   arbitrary and null, and ended by launching new, vague, but ardent
                   calls to action.” [Paolo Spriano, Op. Cit., p. 94]
232 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                Malatesta addressed the workers of one of the factories at Milan. He argued
              that ”[t]hose who celebrate the agreement signed at Rome [between the
              Confederazione and the capitalists] as a great victory of yours are deceiving
              you. The victory in reality belongs to Giolitti, to the government and the
              bourgeoisie who are saved from the precipice over which they were hanging.”
              During the occupation the “bourgeoisie trembled, the government was
              powerless to face the situation.” Therefore:
                   “To speak of victory when the Roman agreement throws you back
                   under bourgeois exploitation which you could have got rid of is a lie.
                   If you give up the factories, do this with the conviction [of] hav[ing]
                   lost a great battle and with the ﬁrm intention to resume the struggle
                   on the ﬁrst occasion and to carry it on in a thorough way… Nothing
                   is lost if you have no illusion [about] the deceiving character of the
                   victory. The famous decree on the control of factories is a mockery
                   … because it tends to harmonise your interests and those of the
                   bourgeois which is like harmonising the interests of the wolf and the
                   sheep. Don’t believe those of your leaders who make fools of you by
                   adjourning the revolution from day to day. You yourselves must
                   make the revolution when an occasion will oﬀer itself, without
                   waiting for orders which never come, or which come only to enjoin
                   you to abandon action. Have conﬁdence in yourselves, have faith in
                   your future and you will win.” [quoted by Max Nettlau, Errico
                   Malatesta: The Biography of an Anarchist]
                Malatesta was proven correct. With the end of the occupations, the only
              victors were the bourgeoisie and the government. Soon the workers would
              face Fascism, but ﬁrst, in October 1920, “after the factories were evacuated,”
              the government (obviously knowing who the real threat was) “arrested the
              entire leadership of the USI and UAI. The socialists did not respond” and
              “more-or-less ignored the persecution of the libertarians until the spring of
              1921 when the aged Malatesta and other imprisoned anarchists mounted a
              hunger strike from their cells in Milan.” [Carl Levy, Op. Cit., pp. 221–2] They
              were acquitted after a four day trial.
                The events of 1920 show four things. Firstly, that workers can manage their
              own workplaces successfully by themselves, without bosses. Secondly, on the
              need for anarchists to be involved in the labour movement. Without the
              support of the USI, the Turin movement would have been even more isolated
              than it was. Thirdly, anarchists need to be organised to inﬂuence the class
              struggle. The growth of the UAI and USI in terms of both inﬂuence and size
              indicates the importance of this. Without the anarchists and syndicalists
              raising the idea of factory occupations and supporting the movement, it is
              doubtful that it would have been as successful and widespread as it was.
              Lastly, that socialist organisations, structured in a hierarchical fashion, do not
              produce a revolutionary membership. By continually looking to leaders, the
              movement was crippled and could not develop to its full potential.
                This period of Italian history explains the growth of Fascism in Italy. As
              Tobias Abse points out, “the rise of fascism in Italy cannot be detached from
              the events of the biennio rosso, the two red years of 1919 and 1920, that
              preceded it. Fascism was a preventive counter-revolution … launched as a

              result of the failed revolution” [“The Rise of Fascism in an Industrial City”, pp.
              52–81, Rethinking Italian Fascism, David Forgacs (ed.), p. 54] The term
              “preventive counter-revolution” was originally coined by the leading anarchist
              Luigi Fabbri, who correctly described fascism as “the organisation and agent
              of the violent armed defence of the ruling class against the proletariat, which,
              to their mind, has become unduly demanding, united and intrusive.”
              [“Fascism: The Preventive Counter-Revolution”, pp. 408–416, Anarchism,
              Robert Graham (ed.), p. 410 and p. 409]
                The rise of fascism conﬁrmed Malatesta’s warning at the time of the factory
              occupations: “If we do not carry on to the end, we will pay with tears of blood
              for the fear we now instil in the bourgeoisie.” [quoted by Tobias Abse, Op.
              Cit., p. 66] The capitalists and rich landowners backed the fascists in order to
              teach the working class their place, aided by the state. They ensured “that it
              was given every assistance in terms of funding and arms, turning a blind eye
              to its breaches of the law and, where necessary, covering its back through
              intervention by armed forces which, on the pretext of restoring order, would
              rush to the aid of the fascists wherever the latter were beginning to take a
              beating instead of doling one out.” [Fabbri, Op. Cit., p. 411] To quote Tobias
              Abse:

## “The aims of the Fascists and their backers amongst the
                   industrialists and agrarians in 1921–22 were simple: to break the
                   power of the organised workers and peasants as completely as
                   possible, to wipe out, with the bullet and the club, not only the gains
                   of the biennio rosso, but everything that the lower classes had
                   gained … between the turn of the century and the outbreak of the
                   First World War.” [Op. Cit., p. 54]
                The fascist squads attacked and destroyed anarchist and socialist meeting
              places, social centres, radical presses and Camera del Lavoro (local trade
              union councils). However, even in the dark days of fascist terror, the
              anarchists resisted the forces of totalitarianism. “It is no coincidence that the
              strongest working-class resistance to Fascism was in … towns or cities in
              which there was quite a strong anarchist, syndicalist or anarcho-syndicalist
              tradition.” [Tobias Abse, Op. Cit., p. 56]
                The anarchists participated in, and often organised sections of, the Arditi
              del Popolo, a working-class organisation devoted to the self-defence of
              workers’ interests. The Arditi del Popolo organised and encouraged workingclass resistance to fascist squads, often defeating larger fascist forces (for
              example, “the total humiliation of thousands of Italo Balbo’s squadristi by a
              couple of hundred Arditi del Popolo backed by the inhabitants of the working
              class districts” in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922 [Tobias
              Abse, Op. Cit., p. 56]).
                The Arditi del Popolo was the closest Italy got to the idea of a united,
              revolutionary working-class front against fascism, as had been suggested by
              Malatesta and the UAI. This movement “developed along anti-bourgeois and
              anti-fascist lines, and was marked by the independence of its local sections.”
              [Red Years, Black Years: Anarchist Resistance to Fascism in Italy, p. 2]
              Rather than being just an “anti-fascist” organisation, the Arditi “were not a
              movement in defence of ‘democracy’ in the abstract, but an essentially
234 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              working-class organisation devoted to the defence of the interests of
              industrial workers, the dockers and large numbers of artisans and craftsmen.”
              [Tobias Abse, Op. Cit., p. 75] Unsurprisingly, the Arditi del Popolo “appear
              to have been strongest and most successful in areas where traditional
              working-class political culture was less exclusively socialist and had strong
              anarchist or syndicalist traditions, for example, Bari, Livorno, Parma and
              Rome.” [Antonio Sonnessa, “Working Class Defence Organisation, Anti-Fascist
              Resistance and the Arditi del Popolo in Turin, 1919–22,” pp. 183–218,
              European History Quarterly, vol. 33, no. 2, p. 184]
                 However, both the socialist and communist parties withdrew from the
              organisation. The socialists signed a “Pact of Paciﬁcation” with the Fascists in
              August 1921. The communists “preferred to withdraw their members from the
              Arditi del Popolo rather than let them work with the anarchists.” [Red Years,
              Black Years, p. 17] Indeed, ”[o]n the same day as the Pact was signed,
              Ordine Nuovo published a PCd’I [Communist Party of Italy] communication
              warning communists against involvement” in the Arditi del Popolo. Four days
              later, the Communist leadership “oﬀicially abandoned the movement. Severe
              disciplinary measures were threatened against those communists who
              continued to participate in, or liase with,” the organisation. Thus by “the end
              of the ﬁrst week of August 1921 the PSI, CGL and the PCd’I had oﬀicially
              denounced” the organisation. “Only the anarchist leaders, if not always
              sympathetic to the programme of the [Arditi del Popolo], did not abandon the
              movement.” Indeed, Umanita Nova “strongly supported” it “on the grounds
              it represented a popular expression of anti-fascist resistance and in defence of
              freedom to organise.” [Antonio Sonnessa, Op. Cit., p. 195 and p. 194]
                 However, in spite of the decisions by their leaders, many rank and ﬁle
              socialists and communists took part in the movement. The latter took part in
              open “deﬁance of the PCd’I leadership’s growing abandonment” of it. In
              Turin, for example, communists who took part in the Arditi del Polopo did so
              “less as communists and more as part of a wider, working-class selfidentiﬁcation … This dynamic was re-enforced by an important socialist and
              anarchist presence” there. The failure of the Communist leadership to support
              the movement shows the bankruptcy of Bolshevik organisational forms which
              were unresponsive to the needs of the popular movement. Indeed, these
              events show the “libertarian custom of autonomy from, and resistance to,
              authority was also operated against the leaders of the workers’ movement,
              particularly when they were held to have misunderstood the situation at grass
              roots level.” [Sonnessa, Op. Cit., p. 200, p. 198 and p. 193]
                 Thus the Communist Party failed to support the popular resistance to
              fascism. The Communist leader Antonio Gramsci explained why, arguing that
              “the party leadership’s attitude on the question of the Arditi del Popolo …
              corresponded to a need to prevent the party members from being controlled
              by a leadership that was not the party’s leadership.” Gramsci added that this
              policy “served to disqualify a mass movement which had started from below
              and which could instead have been exploited by us politically.” [Selections
              from Political Writings (1921–1926), p. 333] While being less sectarian
              towards the Arditi del Popolo than other Communist leaders, ”[i]n common
              with all communist leaders, Gramsci awaited the formation of the PCd’I-led
              military squads.” [Sonnessa, Op. Cit., p. 196] In other words, the struggle

              against fascism was seen by the Communist leadership as a means of gaining
              more members and, when the opposite was a possibility, they preferred defeat
              and fascism rather than risk their followers becoming inﬂuenced by
              anarchism.
                As Abse notes, “it was the withdrawal of support by the Socialist and
              Communist parties at the national level that crippled” the Arditi. [Op. Cit., p.
              74] Thus “social reformist defeatism and communist sectarianism made
              impossible an armed opposition that was widespread and therefore eﬀective;
              and the isolated instances of popular resistance were unable to unite in a
              successful strategy.” And fascism could have been defeated: “Insurrections at
              Sarzanna, in July 1921, and at Parma, in August 1922, are examples of the
              correctness of the policies which the anarchists urged in action and
              propaganda.” [Red Years, Black Years, p. 3 and p. 2] Historian Tobias Abse
              conﬁrms this analysis, arguing that ”[w]hat happened in Parma in August
              1922 … could have happened elsewhere, if only the leadership of the Socialist
              and Communist parties thrown their weight behind the call of the anarchist
              Malatesta for a united revolutionary front against Fascism.” [Op. Cit., p. 56]
                In the end, fascist violence was successful and capitalist power maintained:
                   “The anarchists’ will and courage were not enough to counter the
                   fascist gangs, powerfully aided with material and arms, backed by
## the repressive organs of the state. Anarchists and anarchosyndicalists were decisive in some areas and in some industries, but
                   only a similar choice of direct action on the parts of the Socialist
                   Party and the General Confederation of Labour [the reformist trade
                   union] could have halted fascism.” [Red Years, Black Years, pp. 1–
                   2]
                 After helping to defeat the revolution, the Marxists helped ensure the
              victory of fascism.
                 Even after the fascist state was created, anarchists resisted both inside and
              outside Italy. In America, for example, Italian anarchists played a major role in
              ﬁghting fascist inﬂuence in their communities, none more so that Carlo
              Tresca, most famous for his role in the 1912 IWW Lawrence strike, who “in
              the 1920s had no peer among anti-Fascist leaders, a distinction recognised by
              Mussolini’s political police in Rome.” [Nunzio Pernicone, Carlo Tresca:
              Portrait of a Rebel, p. 4] Many Italians, both anarchist and non-anarchist,
              travelled to Spain to resist Franco in 1936 (see Umberto Marzochhi’s
              Remembering Spain: Italian Anarchist Volunteers in the Spanish Civil
              War for details). During the Second World War, anarchists played a major part
              in the Italian Partisan movement. It was the fact that the anti-fascist
              movement was dominated by anti-capitalist elements that led the USA and the
              UK to place known fascists in governmental positions in the places they
              “liberated” (often where the town had already been taken by the Partisans,
              resulting in the Allied troops “liberating” the town from its own inhabitants!).
                 Given this history of resisting fascism in Italy, it is surprising that some
              claim Italian fascism was a product or form of syndicalism. This is even
              claimed by some anarchists. According to Bob Black the “Italian syndicalists
              mostly went over to Fascism” and references David D. Roberts 1979 study
              The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism to support his claim.
236 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              [Anarchy after Leftism, p. 64] Peter Sabatini in a review in Social
              Anarchism makes a similar statement, saying that syndicalism’s “ultimate
              failure” was “its transformation into a vehicle of fascism.” [Social
              Anarchism, no. 23, p. 99] What is the truth behind these claims?
                Looking at Black’s reference we discover that, in fact, most of the Italian
              syndicalists did not go over to fascism, if by syndicalists we mean members of
              the USI (the Italian Syndicalist Union). Roberts states that:
                   “The vast majority of the organised workers failed to respond to the
                   syndicalists’ appeals and continued to oppose [Italian] intervention
                   [in the First World War], shunning what seemed to be a futile
                   capitalist war. The syndicalists failed to convince even a majority
                   within the USI … the majority opted for the neutralism of Armando
                   Borghi, leader of the anarchists within the USI. Schism followed as
                   De Ambris led the interventionist minority out of the confederation.”
                   [The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, p. 113]
                However, if we take “syndicalist” to mean some of the intellectuals and
              “leaders” of the pre-war movement, it was a case that the “leading
              syndicalists came out for intervention quickly and almost unanimously”
              [Roberts, Op. Cit., p. 106] after the First World War started. Many of these
              pro-war “leading syndicalists” did become fascists. However, to concentrate
              on a handful of “leaders” (which the majority did not even follow!) and state
              that this shows that the “Italian syndicalists mostly went over to Fascism”
              staggers belief. What is even worse, as seen above, the Italian anarchists and
              syndicalists were the most dedicated and successful ﬁghters against fascism.
              In eﬀect, Black and Sabatini have slandered a whole movement.
                What is also interesting is that these “leading syndicalists” were not
              anarchists and so not anarcho-syndicalists. As Roberts notes ”[i]n Italy, the
              syndicalist doctrine was more clearly the product of a group of intellectuals,
              operating within the Socialist party and seeking an alternative to reformism.”
              They “explicitly denounced anarchism” and “insisted on a variety of Marxist
              orthodoxy.” The “syndicalists genuinely desired — and tried — to work within
              the Marxist tradition.” [Op. Cit., p. 66, p. 72, p. 57 and p. 79] According to
              Carl Levy, in his account of Italian anarchism, ”[u]nlike other syndicalist
              movements, the Italian variation coalesced inside a Second International
              party. Supporter were partially drawn from socialist intransigents … the
              southern syndicalist intellectuals pronounced republicanism … Another
              component … was the remnant of the Partito Operaio.” [“Italian Anarchism:
              1870–1926” in For Anarchism: History, Theory, and Practice, David
              Goodway (Ed.), p. 51]
                In other words, the Italian syndicalists who turned to fascism were, ﬁrstly, a
              small minority of intellectuals who could not convince the majority within the
              syndicalist union to follow them, and, secondly, Marxists and republicans
              rather than anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists or even revolutionary
              syndicalists.
                According to Carl Levy, Roberts’ book “concentrates on the syndicalist
              intelligentsia” and that “some syndicalist intellectuals … helped generate, or
              sympathetically endorsed, the new Nationalist movement .. . which bore
              similarities to the populist and republican rhetoric of the southern syndicalist
237 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              intellectuals.” He argues that there “has been far too much emphasis on
              syndicalist intellectuals and national organisers” and that syndicalism “relied
              little on its national leadership for its long-term vitality.” [Op. Cit., p. 77, p. 53
              and p. 51] If we do look at the membership of the USI, rather than ﬁnding a
              group which “mostly went over to fascism,” we discover a group of people
              who fought fascism tooth and nail and were subject to extensive fascist
              violence.
                 To summarise, Italian Fascism had nothing to do with syndicalism and, as
              seen above, the USI fought the Fascists and was destroyed by them along
              with the UAI, Socialist Party and other radicals. That a handful of pre-war
              Marxist-syndicalists later became Fascists and called for a “NationalSyndicalism” does not mean that syndicalism and fascism are related (any
              more than some anarchists later becoming Marxists makes anarchism “a
              vehicle” for Marxism!).
                 It is hardly surprising that anarchists were the most consistent and
              successful opponents of Fascism. The two movements could not be further
              apart, one standing for total statism in the service of capitalism while the
              other for a free, non-capitalist society. Neither is it surprising that when their
              privileges and power were in danger, the capitalists and the landowners
              turned to fascism to save them. This process is a common feature in history
              (to list just four examples, Italy, Germany, Spain and Chile).
              A.5.6 Anarchism and the Spanish Revolution
                As Noam Chomsky notes, “a good example of a really large-scale anarchist
              revolution — in fact the best example to my knowledge — is the Spanish
              revolution in 1936, in which over most of Republican Spain there was a quite
              inspiring anarchist revolution that involved both industry and agriculture over
              substantial areas … And that again was, by both human measures and indeed
              anyone’s economic measures, quite successful. That is, production continued
              eﬀectively; workers in farms and factories proved quite capable of managing
              their aﬀairs without coercion from above, contrary to what lots of socialists,
              communists, liberals and other wanted to believe.” The revolution of 1936
              was “based on three generations of experiment and thought and work which
              extended anarchist ideas to very large parts of the population.” [Radical
              Priorities, p. 212]
                Due to this anarchist organising and agitation, Spain in the 1930’s had the
              largest anarchist movement in the world. At the start of the Spanish “Civil”
              war, over one and one half million workers and peasants were members of the
              CNT (the National Confederation of Labour), an anarcho-syndicalist union
              federation, and 30,000 were members of the FAI (the Anarchist Federation
              of Iberia). The total population of Spain at this time was 24 million.
                The social revolution which met the Fascist coup on July 18th, 1936, is the
              greatest experiment in libertarian socialism to date. Here the last mass
              syndicalist union, the CNT, not only held oﬀ the fascist rising but encouraged
              the widespread take-over of land and factories. Over seven million people,
              including about two million CNT members, put self-management into practise
              in the most diﬀicult of circumstances and actually improved both working

              conditions and output.
                In the heady days after the 19th of July, the initiative and power truly rested
              in the hands of the rank-and-ﬁle members of the CNT and FAI. It was ordinary
              people, undoubtedly under the inﬂuence of Faistas (members of the FAI) and
              CNT militants, who, after defeating the fascist uprising, got production,
              distribution and consumption started again (under more egalitarian
              arrangements, of course), as well as organising and volunteering (in their tens
              of thousands) to join the militias, which were to be sent to free those parts of
              Spain that were under Franco. In every possible way the working class of
              Spain were creating by their own actions a new world based on their own
              ideas of social justice and freedom — ideas inspired, of course, by anarchism
              and anarchosyndicalism.
                George Orwell’s eye-witness account of revolutionary Barcelona in late
              December, 1936, gives a vivid picture of the social transformation that had
              begun:
                   “The Anarchists were still in virtual control of Catalonia and the
                   revolution was still in full swing. To anyone who had been there
## since the beginning it probably seemed even in December or
                   January that the revolutionary period was ending; but when one
                   came straight from England the aspect of Barcelona was something
                   startling and overwhelming. It was the ﬁrst time that I had ever
## been in a town where the working class was in the saddle.
                   Practically every building of any size had been seized by the
                   workers and was draped with red ﬂags or with the red and black
                   ﬂag of the Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the hammer
                   and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties; almost
                   every church had been gutted and its images burnt. Churches here
## and there were being systematically demolished by gangs of
                   workman. Every shop and cafe had an inscription saying that it had
                   been collectivised; even the bootblacks had been collectivised and
                   their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers looked
                   you in the face and treated you as an equal. Servile and even
                   ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody
                   said ‘Señor’ or ‘Don’ or even ‘Usted’; everyone called everyone else
                   ‘Comrade’ or ‘Thou’, and said ‘Salud!’ instead of ‘Buenos dias’…
                   Above all, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a
                   feeling of having suddenly emerged into an era of equality and
                   freedom. Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and
                   not as cogs in the capitalist machine.” [Homage to Catalonia, pp.
                   2–3]
                The full extent of this historic revolution cannot be covered here. It will be
              discussed in more detail in Section I.8 of the FAQ. All that can be done is to
              highlight a few points of special interest in the hope that these will give some
              indication of the importance of these events and encourage people to ﬁnd out
              more about it.
                All industry in Catalonia was placed either under workers’ self-management
              or workers’ control (that is, either totally taking over all aspects of
              management, in the ﬁrst case, or, in the second, controlling the old
239 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              management). In some cases, whole town and regional economies were
              transformed into federations of collectives. The example of the Railway
              Federation (which was set up to manage the railway lines in Catalonia,
              Aragon and Valencia) can be given as a typical example. The base of the
              federation was the local assemblies:
                   “All the workers of each locality would meet twice a week to
                   examine all that pertained to the work to be done... The local
## general assembly named a committee to manage the general
                   activity in each station and its annexes. At [these] meetings, the
                   decisions (direccion) of this committee, whose members continued
                   to work [at their previous jobs], would be subjected to the approval
                   or disapproval of the workers, after giving reports and answering
## questions.”

                 The delegates on the committee could be removed by an assembly at any
              time and the highest co-ordinating body of the Railway Federation was the
              “Revolutionary Committee,” whose members were elected by union
              assemblies in the various divisions. The control over the rail lines, according
              to Gaston Leval, “did not operate from above downwards, as in a statist and
              centralised system. The Revolutionary Committee had no such powers… The
              members of the… committee being content to supervise the general activity
              and to co-ordinate that of the diﬀerent routes that made up the network.”
              [Gaston Leval, Collectives in the Spanish Revolution, p. 255]
                 On the land, tens of thousands of peasants and rural day workers created
              voluntary, self-managed collectives. The quality of life improved as cooperation allowed the introduction of health care, education, machinery and
              investment in the social infrastructure. As well as increasing production, the
              collectives increased freedom. As one member puts it, “it was marvellous … to
              live in a collective, a free society where one could say what one thought,
              where if the village committee seemed unsatisfactory one could say. The
              committee took no big decisions without calling the whole village together in
              a general assembly. All this was wonderful.” [Ronald Fraser, Blood of Spain,
              p. 360]
                 We discuss the revolution in more detail in section I.8. For example,
              sections I.8.3 and I.8.4 discuss in more depth how the industrial collectives.
              The rural collectives are discussed in sections I.8.5 and I.8.6. We must stress
              that these sections are summaries of a vast social movement, and more
              information can be gathered from such works as Gaston Leval’s Collectives
              in the Spanish Revolution, Sam Dolfgoﬀ’s The Anarchist Collectives,
              Jose Peirats’ The CNT in the Spanish Revolution and a host of other
              anarchist accounts of the revolution.
                 On the social front, anarchist organisations created rational schools, a
              libertarian health service, social centres, and so on. The Mujeres Libres
              (free women) combated the traditional role of women in Spanish society,
              empowering thousands both inside and outside the anarchist movement (see
              The Free Women of Spain by Martha A. Ackelsberg for more information on
              this very important organisation). This activity on the social front only built on
              the work started long before the outbreak of the war; for example, the unions
              often funded rational schools, workers centres, and so on.

                The voluntary militias that went to free the rest of Spain from Franco were
              organised on anarchist principles and included both men and women. There
              was no rank, no saluting and no oﬀicer class. Everybody was equal. George
              Orwell, a member of the POUM militia (the POUM was a dissident Marxist
              party, inﬂuenced by Leninism but not, as the Communists asserted, Trotskyist)
              makes this clear:
                   “The essential point of the [militia] system was the social equality
                   between oﬀicers and men. Everyone from general to private drew
## the same pay, ate the same food, wore the same clothes, and
                   mingled on terms of complete equality. If you wanted to slap the
                   general commanding the division on the back and ask him for a
                   cigarette, you could do so, and no one thought it curious. In theory
                   at any rate each militia was a democracy and not a hierarchy. It was
                   understood that orders had to be obeyed, but it was also understood
                   that when you gave an order you gave it as comrade to comrade and
                   not as superior to inferior. There were oﬀicers and N.C.O.s, but
                   there was no military rank in the ordinary sense; no titles, no
                   badges, no heel-clicking and saluting. They had attempted to
                   produce within the militias a sort of temporary working model of the
                   classless society. Of course there was not perfect equality, but there
                   was a nearer approach to it than I had ever seen or that I would
                   have though conceivable in time of war… “ [Op. Cit., p. 26]
                In Spain, however, as elsewhere, the anarchist movement was smashed
              between Stalinism (the Communist Party) on the one hand and Capitalism
              (Franco) on the other. Unfortunately, the anarchists placed anti-fascist unity
              before the revolution, thus helping their enemies to defeat both them and the
              revolution. Whether they were forced by circumstances into this position or
              could have avoided it is still being debated (see section I.8.10 for a discussion
              of why the CNT-FAI collaborated and section I.8.11 on why this decision was
              not a product of anarchist theory).
                Orwell’s account of his experiences in the militia’s indicates why the
              Spanish Revolution is so important to anarchists:
                   “I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of
                   any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and
                   disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up
                   here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly
                   though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same
                   level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect
                   equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense
                   in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a
                   foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental
                   atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of
                   civilised life — snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.
                   — had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class- division of society
                   had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the
                   money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the
## peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his

## master… One had been in a community where hope was more
                   normal than apathy or cynicism, where the word ‘comrade’ stood for
                   comradeship and not, as in most countries, for humbug. One had
                   breathed the air of equality. I am well aware that it is now the
                   fashion to deny that Socialism has anything to do with equality. In
                   every country in the world a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek
                   little professors are busy ‘proving’ that Socialism means no more
                   than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact. But
                   fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite diﬀerent
                   from this. The thing that attracts ordinary men to Socialism and
                   makes them willing to risk their skins for it, the ‘mystique’ of
                   Socialism, is the idea of equality; to the vast majority of people
                   Socialism means a classless society, or it means nothing at all … In
                   that community where no one was on the make, where there was a
                   shortage of everything but no boot-licking, one got, perhaps, a
                   crude forecast of what the opening stages of Socialism might be
                   like. And, after all, instead of disillusioning me it deeply attracted
                   me…” [Op. Cit., pp. 83–84]

              A.5.7 The May-June Revolt in France, 1968
                The May-June events in France placed anarchism back on the radical
              landscape after a period in which many people had written the movement oﬀ
              as dead. This revolt of ten million people grew from humble beginnings.
              Expelled by the university authorities of Nanterre in Paris for anti-Vietnam
              War activity, a group of anarchists (including Daniel Cohn-Bendit) promptly
              called a protest demonstration. The arrival of 80 police enraged many
              students, who quit their studies to join the battle and drive the police from the
              university.
                Inspired by this support, the anarchists seized the administration building
              and held a mass debate. The occupation spread, Nanterre was surrounded by
              police, and the authorities closed the university down. The next day, the
              Nanterre students gathered at the Sorbonne University in the centre of Paris.
              Continual police pressure and the arrest of over 500 people caused anger to
              erupt into ﬁve hours of street ﬁghting. The police even attacked passers-by
              with clubs and tear gas.
                A total ban on demonstrations and the closure of the Sorbonne brought
              thousands of students out onto the streets. Increasing police violence
              provoked the building of the ﬁrst barricades. Jean Jacques Lebel, a reporter,
              wrote that by 1 a.m., ”[l]iterally thousands helped build barricades… women,
242 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              workers, bystanders, people in pyjamas, human chains to carry rocks, wood,
              iron.” An entire night of ﬁghting left 350 police injured. On May 7th, a 50,000strong protest march against the police was transformed into a day-long
              battle through the narrow streets of the Latin Quarter. Police tear gas was
              answered by molotov cocktails and the chant “Long Live the Paris Commune!”
                 By May 10th, continuing massive demonstrations forced the Education
              Minister to start negotiations. But in the streets, 60 barricades had appeared
              and young workers were joining the students. The trade unions condemned
              the police violence. Huge demonstrations throughout France culminated on
              May 13th with one million people on the streets of Paris.
                 Faced with this massive protest, the police left the Latin Quarter. Students
              seized the Sorbonne and created a mass assembly to spread the struggle.
              Occupations soon spread to every French University. From the Sorbonne
              came a ﬂood of propaganda, leaﬂets, proclamations, telegrams, and posters.
              Slogans such as “Everything is Possible,” “Be Realistic, Demand the
              Impossible,” “Life without Dead Times,” and “It is Forbidden to Forbid”
              plastered the walls. “All Power to the Imagination” was on everyone’s lips.
              As Murray Bookchin pointed out, “the motive forces of revolution today… are
              not simply scarcity and material need, but also quality of everyday life …
              the attempt to gain control of one’s own destiny.” [Post-Scarcity
              Anarchism, p. 166]
                 Many of the most famous slogans of those days originated from the
              Situationists. The Situationist International had been formed in 1957 by a
              small group of dissident radicals and artists. They had developed a highly
              sophisticated (if jargon riddled) and coherent analysis of modern capitalist
              society and how to supersede it with a new, freer one. Modern life, they
              argued, was mere survival rather than living, dominated by the economy of
              consumption in which everyone, everything, every emotion and relationship
              becomes a commodity. People were no longer simply alienated producers,
              they were also alienated consumers. They deﬁned this kind of society as the
              “Spectacle.” Life itself had been stolen and so revolution meant recreating
              life. The area of revolutionary change was no longer just the workplace, but in
              everyday existence:
                   “People who talk about revolution and class struggle without
                   referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is
                   subversive about love and what is positive in the refusal of
                   constraints, such people have a corpse in their mouth.” [quoted by
                   Cliﬀord Harper, Anarchy: A Graphic Guide, p. 153]
                Like many other groups whose politics inﬂuenced the Paris events, the
              situationists argued that “the workers’ councils are the only answer. Every
              other form of revolutionary struggle has ended up with the very opposite of
              what it was originally looking for.” [quoted by Cliﬀord Harper, Op. Cit., p.
              149] These councils would be self-managed and not be the means by which a
              “revolutionary” party would take power. Like the anarchists of Noire et
              Rouge and the libertarian socialists of Socialisme ou Barbarie, their
              support for a self-managed revolution from below had a massive inﬂuence in
              the May events and the ideas that inspired it.
                On May 14th, the Sud-Aviation workers locked the management in its oﬀices

              and occupied their factory. They were followed by the Cleon-Renault,
              Lockhead-Beauvais and Mucel-Orleans factories the next day. That night the
              National Theatre in Paris was seized to become a permanent assembly for
              mass debate. Next, France’s largest factory, Renault-Billancourt, was
              occupied. Often the decision to go on indeﬁnite strike was taken by the
              workers without consulting union oﬀicials. By May 17th, a hundred Paris
              Factories were in the hands of their workers. The weekend of the 19th of May
              saw 122 factories occupied. By May 20th, the strike and occupations were
              general and involved six million people. Print workers said they did not wish
              to leave a monopoly of media coverage to TV and radio, and agreed to print
              newspapers as long as the press “carries out with objectivity the role of
              providing information which is its duty.” In some cases print-workers insisted
              on changes in headlines or articles before they would print the paper. This
              happened mostly with the right-wing papers such as ‘Le Figaro’ or ‘La
              Nation’.
                With the Renault occupation, the Sorbonne occupiers immediately prepared
              to join the Renault strikers, and led by anarchist black and red banners, 4,000
              students headed for the occupied factory. The state, bosses, unions and
              Communist Party were now faced with their greatest nightmare — a workerstudent alliance. Ten thousand police reservists were called up and frantic
              union oﬀicials locked the factory gates. The Communist Party urged their
              members to crush the revolt. They united with the government and bosses to
              craft a series of reforms, but once they turned to the factories they were
              jeered out of them by the workers.
                The struggle itself and the activity to spread it was organised by selfgoverning mass assemblies and co-ordinated by action committees. The
              strikes were often run by assemblies as well. As Murray Bookchin argues, the
              “hope [of the revolt] lay in the extension of self-management in all its forms —
              the general assemblies and their administrative forms, the action committees,
              the factory strike committees — to all areas of the economy, indeed to all
              areas of life itself.” Within the assemblies, “a fever of life gripped millions, a
              rewaking of senses that people never thought they possessed.” [Op. Cit., p.
              168 and p. 167] It was not a workers’ strike or a student strike. It was a
              peoples’ strike that cut across almost all class lines.
                On May 24th, anarchists organised a demonstration. Thirty thousand
              marched towards the Palace de la Bastille. The police had the Ministries
              protected, using the usual devices of tear gas and batons, but the Bourse
              (Stock Exchange) was left unprotected and a number of demonstrators set ﬁre
              to it.
                It was at this stage that some left-wing groups lost their nerve. The
              Trotskyist JCR turned people back into the Latin Quarter. Other groups such
              as UNEF and Parti Socialiste Unife (United Socialist Party) blocked the taking
              of the Ministries of Finance and Justice. Cohn-Bendit said of this incident “As
              for us, we failed to realise how easy it would have been to sweep all these
              nobodies away… .It is now clear that if, on 25 May, Paris had woken to ﬁnd
              the most important Ministries occupied, Gaullism would have caved in at
              once… . “ Cohn-Bendit was forced into exile later that very night.
                As the street demonstrations grew and occupations continued, the state
              prepared to use overwhelming means to stop the revolt. Secretly, top generals

              readied 20,000 loyal troops for use on Paris. Police occupied communications
              centres like TV stations and Post Oﬀices. By Monday, May 27th, the
              Government had guaranteed an increase of 35% in the industrial minimum
              wage and an all round-wage increase of 10%. The leaders of the CGT
              organised a march of 500,000 workers through the streets of Paris two days
              later. Paris was covered in posters calling for a “Government of the People.”
              Unfortunately the majority still thought in terms of changing their rulers
              rather than taking control for themselves.
                By June 5th most of the strikes were over and an air of what passes for
              normality within capitalism had rolled back over France. Any strikes which
              continued after this date were crushed in a military-style operation using
              armoured vehicles and guns. On June 7th, they made an assault on the Flins
              steelworks which started a four-day running battle which left one worker
              dead. Three days later, Renault strikers were gunned down by police, killing
              two. In isolation, those pockets of militancy stood no chance. On June 12th,
              demonstrations were banned, radical groups outlawed, and their members
              arrested. Under attack from all sides, with escalating state violence and trade
              union sell-outs, the General Strike and occupations crumbled.
                So why did this revolt fail? Certainly not because “vanguard” Bolshevik
              parties were missing. It was infested with them. Fortunately, the traditional
              authoritarian left sects were isolated and outraged. Those involved in the
              revolt did not require a vanguard to tell them what to do, and the “workers’
              vanguards” frantically ran after the movement trying to catch up with it and
              control it.
                No, it was the lack of independent, self-managed confederal organisations
              to co-ordinate struggle which resulted in occupations being isolated from
              each other. So divided, they fell. In addition, Murray Bookchin argues that “an
              awareness among the workers that the factories had to be worked, not
              merely occupied or struck,” was missing. [Op. Cit., p. 182]
                This awareness would have been encouraged by the existence of a strong
              anarchist movement before the revolt. The anti-authoritarian left, though very
              active, was too weak among striking workers, and so the idea of self-managed
              organisations and workers self-management was not widespread. However,
              the May-June revolt shows that events can change very rapidly. “Under the
              inﬂuence of the students,” noted libertarian socialist Maurice Brinton,
              “thousands began to query the whole principle of hierarchy … Within a matter
              of days the tremendous creative potentialities of the people suddenly erupted.
              The boldest and realistic ideas — and they are usually the same — were
              advocated, argued, applied. Language, rendered stale by decades of
              bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo, eviscerated by those who manipulate it for
              advertising purposes, reappeared as something new and fresh. People reappropriated it in all its fullness. Magniﬁcently apposite and poetic slogans
              emerged from the anonymous crowd.” [“Paris: May 1968”, For Workers’
              Power, p. 253] The working class, fused by the energy and bravado of the
              students, raised demands that could not be catered for within the conﬁnes of
              the existing system. The General Strike displays with beautiful clarity the
              potential power that lies in the hands of the working class. The mass
              assemblies and occupations give an excellent, if short-lived, example of
              anarchy in action and how anarchist ideas can quickly spread and be applied

              in practice.

              anthology of situationist works relating to Paris 68 (it also contains Brinton’s
              essay).
              Section B — Why do anarchists oppose
              the current system?
                 This section of the FAQ presents an analysis of the basic social relationships
              of modern society and the structures which create them, particularly those
              aspects of society that anarchists want to change.
                 Anarchism is, essentially, a revolt against capitalism. As a political theory it
              was born at the same time as capitalism and in opposition to it. As a social
              movement it grew in strength and inﬂuence as capitalism colonised more and
              more parts of society. Rather than simply express opposition to the state, as
              some so-called experts assert, anarchism has always been opposed to other
              forms of authority and the oppression they create, in particular capitalism and
              its particular form of private property. It is no coincidence that Proudhon, the
              ﬁrst person to declare themselves an anarchist, did so in a book entitled
              What is Property? (and gave the answer “It is theft!”). From Proudhon
              onwards, anarchism has opposed both the state and capitalism (indeed, it is
              the one thing such diverse thinkers as Benjamin Tucker and Peter Kropotkin
              both agreed on). Needless to say, since Proudhon anarchism has extended its
              critique of authority beyond these two social evils. Other forms of social
              hierarchy, such as sexism, racism and homophobia, have been rejected as
              limitations of freedom and equality. So this section of the FAQ summarises the
              key ideas behind anarchism’s rejection of the current system we live under.
                 This, of course, does not mean that anarchistic ideas have not existed within
              society before the dawn of capitalism. Far from it. Thinkers whose ideas can
              be classiﬁed as anarchist go back thousands of years and are found many
              diverse cultures and places. Indeed, it would be no exaggeration to say that
              anarchism was born the moment the state and private property were created.
              However, as Kropotkin noted, while “from all times there have been
              Anarchists and Statists” in our times “Anarchy was brought forth by the same
              critical and revolutionary protest that gave rise to Socialism in general.”
              However, unlike other socialists, anarchists have not stopped at the “negation
              of Capitalism and of society based on the subjection of labour to capital” and
              went further to “declare themselves against what constitutes the real strength
              of Capitalism: the State and its principle supports — centralisation of
              authority, law, always made by a minority for its own proﬁt, and a form of
              justice whose chief aim is to protect Authority and Capitalism.” So anarchism
              was “not only against Capitalism, but also against these pillars of Capitalism:
              Law, Authority, and the State.” [Evolution and Environment, p. 16 and p.
              19]

                In other words, anarchism as it exists today, as a social movement with a
              long history of struggle and with a political theory and set of ideas, is the
              product of the transformation of society which accompanied the creation of
              the modern (nation-) state and capital and (far more importantly) the reaction,
              resistance and opposition of those subject to these new social relationships
              and institutions. As such, the analysis and critique presented in this section of
              the FAQ will concentrate on modern, capitalist, society.
                Anarchists realise that the power of governments and other forms of
              hierarchy depends upon the agreement of the governed. Fear is not the whole
              answer, it is far more “because they [the oppressed] subscribe to the same
              values as their governors. Rulers and ruled alike believe in the principle of
              authority, of hierarchy, of power.” [Colin Ward, Anarchy in Action, p. 15]
              With this in mind, we present in this section of the FAQ our arguments to
              challenge this “consensus,” to present the case why we should become
              anarchists, why authoritarian social relationships and organisations are not in
              our interests.
                Needless to say, this task is not easy. No ruling class could survive unless
              the institutions which empower it are generally accepted by those subject to
              them. This is achieved by various means — by propaganda, the so-called
              education system, by tradition, by the media, by the general cultural
              assumptions of a society. In this way the dominant ideas in society are those
              of the dominant elite. This means that any social movement needs to combat
              these ideas before trying to end them:
                   “People often do not even recognise the existence of systems of
                   oppression and domination. They have to try to struggle to gain
                   their rights within the systems in which they live before they even
                   perceive that there is repression. Take a look at the women’s
                   movement. One of the ﬁrst steps in the development of the women’s
                   movement was so-called ‘consciousness raising eﬀorts.’ Try to get
                   women to perceive that it is not the natural state of the world for
                   them to be dominated and controlled. My grandmother couldn’t join
                   the women’s movement, since she didn’t feel any oppression, in
                   some sense. That’s just the way life was, like the sun rises in the
                   morning. Until people can realise that it is not like the sun rising,
                   that it can be changed, that you don’t have to follow orders, that you
                   don’t have to be beaten, until people can perceive that there is
                   something wrong with that, until that is overcome, you can’t go on.
                   And one of the ways to do that is to try to press reforms within the
                   existing systems of repression, and sooner or later you ﬁnd that you
                   will have to change them.” [Noam Chomsky, Anarchism Interview]
                This means, as Malatesta stressed, that anarchists “ﬁrst task therefore must
              be to persuade people.” This means that we “must make people aware of the
              misfortunes they suﬀer and of their chances to destroy them … To those who
              are cold and hungry we will demonstrate how possible and easy it would be to
              assure everybody their material needs. To those who are oppressed and
              despised we shall show how it is possible to live happily in a world of people
              who are free and equal .. . And when we will have succeeded in arousing the
              sentiment of rebellion in the minds of men [and women] against the avoidable

              and unjust evils from which we suﬀer in society today, and in getting them to
              understand how they are caused and how it depends on human will to rid
              ourselves of them” then we will be able to unite and change them for the
              better. [Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, pp. 185–6]
                So we must explain why we want to change the system. From this
              discussion, it will become apparent why anarchists are dissatisﬁed with the
              very limited amount of freedom in modern society and why they want to
              create a truly free society. In the words of Noam Chomsky, the anarchist
              critique of modern society means:
                   “to seek out and identify structures of authority, hierarchy, and
                   domination in every aspect of life, and to challenge them; unless a
                   justiﬁcation for them can be given, they are illegitimate, and should
## be dismantled, to increase the scope of human freedom. That
                   includes political power, ownership and management, relations
                   among men and women, parents and children, our control over the
                   fate of future generations (the basic moral imperative behind the
                   environmental movement…), and much else. Naturally this means a
                   challenge to the huge institutions of coercion and control: the state,
                   the unaccountable private tyrannies that control most of the
                   domestic and international economy [i.e. capitalist corporations and
                   companies], and so on. But not only these.” [Marxism, Anarchism,
                   and Alternative Futures, p. 775]
                This task is made easier by the fact that the “dominating class” has not
              “succeeded in reducing all its subjects to passive and unconscious
              instruments of its interests.” This means that where there is oppression and
              exploitation there is also resistance — and hope. Even when those oppressed
              by hierarchical social relations generally accept it, those institutions cannot
              put out the spark of freedom totally. Indeed, they help produce the spirit of
              revolt by their very operation as people ﬁnally say enough is enough and
              stand up for their rights. Thus hierarchical societies “contain organic
              contradictions and [these] are like the germs of death” from which “the
              possibility of progress” springs. [Malatesta, Op. Cit., pp. 186–7]
                Anarchists, therefore, combine their critique of existing society with active
              participation in the on-going struggles which exist in any hierarchical
              struggle. As we discuss in section J, we urge people to take direct action to
              ﬁght oppression. Such struggles change those who take part in them,
              breaking the social conditioning which keeps hierarchical society going and
              making people aware of other possibilities, aware that other worlds are
              possible and that we do not have to live like this. Thus struggle is the
              practical school of anarchism, the means by which the preconditions of an
              anarchist society are created. Anarchists seek to learn from such struggles
              while, at the same time, propagating our ideas within them and encouraging
              them to develop into a general struggle for social liberation and change.
                Thus the natural resistance of the oppressed to their oppression encourages
              this process of justiﬁcation Chomsky (and anarchism) calls for, this critical
              evaluation of authority and domination, this undermining of what previously
              was considered “natural” or “common-sense” until we started to question
              it. As noted above, an essential part of this process is to encourage direct
248 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              action by the oppressed against their oppressors as well as encouraging the
              anarchistic tendencies and awareness that exist (to a greater or lesser
              degree) in any hierarchical society. The task of anarchists is to encourage
              such struggles and the questioning their produce of society and the way it
              works. We aim to encourage people to look at the root causes of the social
              problems they are ﬁghting, to seek to change the underlying social
              institutions and relationships which produce them. We seek to create an
              awareness that oppression can not only be fought, but ended, and that the
              struggle against an unjust system creates the seeds of the society that will
              replace it. In other words, we seek to encourage hope and a positive vision of
              a better world.
                However, this section of the FAQ is concerned directly with the critical or
              “negative” aspect of anarchism, the exposing of the evil inherent in all
              authority, be it from state, property or whatever and why, consequently,
              anarchists seek “the destruction of power, property, hierarchy and
              exploitation.” [Murray Bookchin, Post-Scarcity Anarchism, p. 11] Later
              sections will indicate how, after analysing the world, anarchists plan to
              change it constructively, but some of the constructive core of anarchism will
              be seen even in this section. After this broad critique of the current system,
              we move onto more speciﬁc areas. Section C explains the anarchist critique of
              the economics of capitalism. Section D discusses how the social relationships
              and institutions described in this section impact on society as a whole. Section
              E discusses the causes (and some suggested solutions) to the ecological
              problems we face.
              B.1 Why are anarchists against authority and
              hierarchy?
                First, it is necessary to indicate what kind of authority anarchism
              challenges. While it is customary for some opponents of anarchism to assert
              that anarchists oppose all kinds of authority, the reality of the situation is
              more complex. While anarchists have, on occasion, stated their opposition to
              “all authority” a closer reading quickly shows that anarchists reject only one
              speciﬁc form of authority, what we tend to call hierarchy (see section H.4 for
              more details). This can be seen when Bakunin stated that “the principle of
              authority” was the “eminently theological, metaphysical and political idea
              that the masses, always incapable of governing themselves, must submit at
              all times to the benevolent yoke of a wisdom and a justice, which in one way
              or another, is imposed from above.” [Marxism, Freedom and the State, p.
              33]
                Other forms of authority are more acceptable to anarchists, it depends
              whether the authority in question becomes a source of power over others or
              not. That is the key to understanding the anarchist position on authority — if
              it is hierarchical authority, then anarchists are against it.. The reason is
              simple:
                   ”[n]o one should be entrusted with power, inasmuch as anyone
                   invested with authority must … became an oppressor and exploiter
249 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   of society.” [Bakunin, The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p.
                   249]
                 This distinction between forms of authority is important. As Erich Fromm
              pointed out, “authority” is “a broad term with two entirely diﬀerent meanings:
              it can be either ‘rational’ or ‘irrational’ authority. Rational authority is based
              on competence, and it helps the person who leans on it to grow. Irrational
              authority is based on power and serves to exploit the person subjected to it.”
              [To Have or To Be, pp. 44–45] The same point was made by Bakunin over
              100 years earlier when he indicated the diﬀerence between authority and
              “natural inﬂuence.” For Bakunin, individual freedom “results from th[e] great
              number of material, intellectual, and moral inﬂuences which every individual
              around him [or her] and which society … continually exercise … To abolish
              this mutual inﬂuence would be to die.” Consequently, “when we reclaim the
              freedom of the masses, we hardly wish to abolish the eﬀect of any individual’s
              or any group of individual’s natural inﬂuence upon the masses. What we wish
              is to abolish artiﬁcial, privileged, legal, and oﬀicial inﬂuences.” [The Basic
              Bakunin, p. 140 and p. 141]
                 It is, in other words, the diﬀerence between taking part in a decision and
              listening to alternative viewpoints and experts (“natural inﬂuence”) before
              making your mind up and having a decision made for you by a separate
              group of individuals (who may or may not be elected) because that is their
              role in an organisation or society. In the former, the individual exercises their
              judgement and freedom (i.e. is based on rational authority). In the latter, they
              are subjected to the wills of others, to hierarchical authority (i.e. is based on
              irrational authority). This is because rational authority “not only permits but
              requires constant scrutiny and criticism … it is always temporary, its
              acceptance depending on its performance.” The source of irrational authority,
              on the other hand, “is always power over people … Power on the one side,
              fear on the other, are always the buttresses on which irrational authority is
              built.” Thus former is based upon “equality” while the latter “is by its very
              nature based upon inequality.” [Erich Fromm, Man for Himself, pp. 9–10]
                 This crucial point is expressed in the diﬀerence between having authority
              and being an authority. Being an authority just means that a given person is
              generally recognised as competent for a given task, based on his or her
              individual skills and knowledge. Put diﬀerently, it is socially acknowledged
              expertise. In contrast, having authority is a social relationship based on status
              and power derived from a hierarchical position, not on individual ability.
              Obviously this does not mean that competence is not an element for obtaining
              a hierarchical position; it just means that the real or alleged initial
              competence is transferred to the title or position of the authority and so
              becomes independent of individuals, i.e. institutionalised (or what Bakunin
              termed “oﬀicial”).
                 This diﬀerence is important because the way people behave is more a
              product of the institutions in which we are raised than of any inherent nature.
              In other words, social relationships shape the individuals involved. This
              means that the various groups individuals create have traits, behaviours and
              outcomes that cannot be understood by reducing them to the individuals
              within them. That is, groups consist not only of individuals, but also
250 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              relationships between individuals and these relationships will aﬀect those
              subject to them. For example, obviously “the exercise of power by some
              disempowers others” and so through a “combination of physical intimidation,
              economic domination and dependency, and psychological limitations, social
              institutions and practices aﬀect the way everyone sees the world and her or
              his place in it.” This, as we discuss in the next section, impacts on those
              involved in such authoritarian social relationships as “the exercise of power in
              any institutionalised form — whether economic, political or sexual —
              brutalises both the wielder of power and the one over whom it is exercised.”
              [Martha A. Ackelsberg, Free Women of Spain, p. 41]
                Authoritarian social relationships means dividing society into (the few)
              order givers and (the many) order takers, impoverishing the individuals
              involved (mentally, emotionally and physically) and society as a whole. Human
              relationships, in all parts of life, are stamped by authority, not liberty. And as
              freedom can only be created by freedom, authoritarian social relationships
              (and the obedience they require) do not and cannot educate a person in
              freedom — only participation (self-management) in all areas of life can do
              that. “In a society based on exploitation and servitude,” in Kropotkin’s words,
              “human nature itself is degraded” and it is only “as servitude disappears”
              shall we “regain our rights.” [Anarchism, p. 104]
                Of course, it will be pointed out that in any collective undertaking there is a
              need for co-operation and co-ordination and this need to “subordinate” the
              individual to group activities is a form of authority. Therefore, it is claimed, a
              democratically managed group is just as “authoritarian” as one based on
              hierarchical authority. Anarchists are not impressed by such arguments. Yes,
              we reply, of course in any group undertaking there is a need make and stick
              by agreements but anarchists argue that to use the word “authority” to
              describe two fundamentally diﬀerent ways of making decisions is playing with
              words. It obscures the fundamental diﬀerence between free association and
              hierarchical imposition and confuses co-operation with command (as we note
              in section H.4, Marxists are particularly fond of this fallacy). Simply put, there
              are two diﬀerent ways of co-ordinating individual activity within groups —
              either by authoritarian means or by libertarian means. Proudhon, in relation
              to workplaces, makes the diﬀerence clear:

## “either the workman… will be simply the employee of the
                   proprietor-capitalist-promoter; or he will participate… [and] have a
                   voice in the council, in a word he will become an associate.
                   “In the ﬁrst case the workman is subordinated, exploited: his
                   permanent condition is one of obedience… In the second case he
                   resumes his dignity as a man and citizen… he forms part of the
                   producing organisation, of which he was before but the slave; as, in
                   the town, he forms part of the sovereign power, of which he was
                   before but the subject … we need not hesitate, for we have no
                   choice… it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers …
                   because without that, they would remain related as subordinates
                   and superiors, and there would ensue two … castes of masters and
                   wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society.”

                In other words, associations can be based upon a form of rational authority,
              based upon natural inﬂuence and so reﬂect freedom, the ability of
              individuals to think, act and feel and manage their own time and activity.
              Otherwise, we include elements of slavery into our relationships with others,
              elements that poison the whole and shape us in negative ways (see section
              B.1.1). Only the reorganisation of society in a libertarian way (and, we may
              add, the mental transformation such a change requires and would create) will
              allow the individual to “achieve more or less complete blossoming, whilst
              continuing to develop” and banish “that spirit of submission that has been
              artiﬁcially thrust upon him [or her]” [Nestor Makhno, The Struggle Against
              the State and Other Essays, p. 62]
                So, anarchists “ask nothing better than to see [others]… exercise over us a
              natural and legitimate inﬂuence, freely accepted, and never imposed … We
              accept all natural authorities and all inﬂuences of fact, but none of right.”
              [Bakunin, The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 255] Anarchist support
              for free association within directly democratic groups is based upon such
              organisational forms increasing inﬂuence and reducing irrational authority in
              our lives. Members of such organisations can create and present their own
              ideas and suggestions, critically evaluate the proposals and suggestions from
              their fellows, accept those that they agree with or become convinced by and
              have the option of leaving the association if they are unhappy with its
              direction. Hence the inﬂuence of individuals and their free interaction
              determine the nature of the decisions reached, and no one has the right to
              impose their ideas on another. As Bakunin argued, in such organisations “no
              function remains ﬁxed and it will not remain permanently and irrevocably
              attached to one person. Hierarchical order and promotion do not exist… In
              such a system, power, properly speaking, no longer exists. Power is diﬀused to
              the collectivity and becomes the true expression of the liberty of everyone.”
              [Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 415]
                Therefore, anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority,
              in other words, hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalisation of
              authority within a society. Hierarchical social institutions include the state
              (see section B.2), private property and the class systems it produces (see
              section B.3) and, therefore, capitalism (see section B.4). Due to their
              hierarchical nature, anarchists oppose these with passion. “Every institution,
              social or civil,” argued Voltairine de Cleyre, “that stands between man [or
              woman] and his [or her] right; every tie that renders one a master, another a
              serf; every law, every statue, every be-it-enacted that represents tyranny”
              anarchists seek to destroy. However, hierarchy exists beyond these
              institutions. For example, hierarchical social relationships include sexism,
              racism and homophobia (see section B.1.4), and anarchists oppose, and ﬁght,
              them all. Thus, as well as ﬁghting capitalism as being hierarchical (for
              workers “slave in a factory,” albeit “the slavery ends with the working hours”)
              de Cleyre also opposed patriarchal social relationships which produce a
              “home that rests on slavery” because of a “marriage that represents the sale
              and transfer of the individuality of one of its parties to the other!” [The
              Voltairine de Cleyre Reader, p. 72, p. 17 and p. 72]
                Needless to say, while we discuss diﬀerent forms of hierarchy in diﬀerent
              sections this does not imply that anarchists think they, and their negative

              eﬀects, are somehow independent or can be easily compartmentalised. For
              example, the modern state and capitalism are intimately interrelated and
              cannot be considered as independent of each other. Similarly, social
              hierarchies like sexism and racism are used by other hierarchies to maintain
              themselves (for example, bosses will use racism to divide and so rule their
              workers). From this it follows that abolishing one or some of these
              hierarchies, while desirable, would not be suﬀicient. Abolishing capitalism
              while maintaining the state would not lead to a free society (and vice versa) —
              if it were possible. As Murray Bookchin notes:
                   “there can be a decidedly classless, even a non-exploitative society
                   in the economic sense that still preserves hierarchical rule and
                   domination in the social sense — whether they take the form of the
## patriarchal family, domination by age and ethnic groups,
                   bureaucratic institutions, ideological manipulation or a pyramidal
                   division of labour … classless or not, society would be riddles by
                   domination and, with domination, a general condition of command
                   and obedience, of unfreedom and humiliation, and perhaps most
                   decisively, an abortion of each individual’s potentiality for
                   consciousness, reason, selfhood, creativity, and the right to assert
                   full control over her or his daily live.” [Toward an Ecological
                   Society, pp. 14–5]
                This clearly implies that anarchists “challenge not only class formations but
              hierarchies, not only material exploitation but domination in every form.”
              [Bookchin, Op. Cit., p. 15] Hence the anarchist stress on opposing hierarchy
              rather than just, say, the state (as some falsely assert) or simply economic
              class and exploitation (as, say, many Marxists do). As noted earlier (in section
              A.2.8), anarchists consider all hierarchies to be not only harmful but
              unnecessary, and think that there are alternative, more egalitarian ways to
              organise social life. In fact, we argue that hierarchical authority creates the
              conditions it is presumably designed to combat, and thus tends to be selfperpetuating. Thus hierarchical organisations erode the ability of those at the
              bottom to manage their own aﬀairs directly so requiring hierarchy and some
              people in positions to give orders and the rest to follow them. Rather than
              prevent disorder, governments are among its primary causes while its
              bureaucracies ostensibly set up to ﬁght poverty wind up perpetuating it,
              because without poverty, the high-salaried top administrators would be out of
              work. The same applies to agencies intended to eliminate drug abuse, ﬁght
              crime, etc. In other words, the power and privileges deriving from top
              hierarchical positions constitute a strong incentive for those who hold them
              not to solve the problems they are supposed to solve. (For further discussion
              see Marilyn French, Beyond Power: On Women, Men, and Morals, Summit
              Books, 1985).
              B.1.1 What are the eﬀects of authoritarian social
              relationships?
253 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                Hierarchical authority is inextricably connected with the marginalisation
              and disempowerment of those without authority. This has negative eﬀects on
              those over whom authority is exercised, since ”[t]hose who have these
              symbols of authority and those who beneﬁt from them must dull their subject
              people’s realistic, i.e. critical, thinking and make them believe the ﬁction [that
              irrational authority is rational and necessary], … [so] the mind is lulled into
              submission by cliches … [and] people are made dumb because they become
              dependent and lose their capacity to trust their eyes and judgement.” [Erich
              Fromm, To Have or To Be?, p. 47]
                Or, in the words of Bakunin, “the principle of authority, applied to men who
              have surpassed or attained their majority, becomes a monstrosity, a source of
              slavery and intellectual and moral depravity.” [God and the State, p. 41]
                This is echoed by the syndicalist miners who wrote the classic The Miners’
              Next Step when they indicate the nature of authoritarian organisations and
              their eﬀect on those involved. Leadership (i.e. hierarchical authority) “implies
              power held by the leader. Without power the leader is inept. The possession of
              power inevitably leads to corruption… in spite of… good intentions …
              [Leadership means] power of initiative, this sense of responsibility, the selfrespect which comes from expressed manhood [sic!], is taken from the men,
              and consolidated in the leader. The sum of their initiative, their responsibility,
              their self-respect becomes his … [and the] order and system he maintains is
              based upon the suppression of the men, from being independent thinkers into
              being ‘the men’ … In a word, he is compelled to become an autocrat and a foe
              to democracy.” Indeed, for the “leader,” such marginalisation can be
              beneﬁcial, for a leader “sees no need for any high level of intelligence in the
              rank and ﬁle, except to applaud his actions. Indeed such intelligence from his
              point of view, by breeding criticism and opposition, is an obstacle and causes
              confusion.” [The Miners’ Next Step, pp. 16–17 and p. 15]
                Anarchists argue that hierarchical social relationships will have a negative
              eﬀect on those subject to them, who can no longer exercise their critical,
              creative and mental abilities freely. As Colin Ward argues, people “do go from
              womb to tomb without realising their human potential, precisely because the
              power to initiate, to participate in innovating, choosing, judging, and deciding
              is reserved for the top men” (and it usually is men!) [Anarchy in Action, p,
              42]. Anarchism is based on the insight that there is an interrelationship
              between the authority structures of institutions and the psychological
              qualities and attitudes of individuals. Following orders all day hardly builds an
              independent, empowered, creative personality (“authority and servility walk
              ever hand in hand.” [Peter Kropotkin, Anarchism, p. 81]). As Emma Goldman
              made clear, if a person’s “inclination and judgement are subordinated to the
              will of a master” (such as a boss, as most people have to sell their labour
              under capitalism) then little wonder such an authoritarian relationship
              “condemns millions of people to be mere nonentities.” [Red Emma Speaks,
              p. 50]
                As the human brain is a bodily organ, it needs to be used regularly in order
              to be at its ﬁttest. Authority concentrates decision-making in the hands of
              those at the top, meaning that most people are turned into executants,
              following the orders of others. If muscle is not used, it turns to fat; if the brain
              is not used, creativity, critical thought and mental abilities become blunted

              and side-tracked onto marginal issues, like sports and fashion. This can only
              have a negative impact:
                   “Hierarchical institutions foster alienated and exploitative
                   relationships among those who participate in them, disempowering
                   people and distancing them from their own reality. Hierarchies
                   make some people dependent on others, blame the dependent for
                   their dependency, and then use that dependency as a justiﬁcation
                   for further exercise of authority… . Those in positions of relative
## dominance tend to deﬁne the very characteristics of those
                   subordinate to them … Anarchists argue that to be always in a
                   position of being acted upon and never to be allowed to act is to be
                   doomed to a state of dependence and resignation. Those who are
## constantly ordered about and prevented from thinking for
                   themselves soon come to doubt their own capacities … [and have]
                   diﬀiculty acting on [their] sense of self in opposition to societal
                   norms, standards and expectations.” [Martha Ackelsberg, Free
                   Women of Spain, pp. 40–1]
                 And so, in the words of Colin Ward, the “system makes its morons, then
              despises them for their ineptitude, and rewards its ‘gifted few’ for their
              rarity.” [Op. Cit., p. 43]
                 This negative impact of hierarchy is, of course, not limited to those subject
              to it. Those in power are aﬀected by it, but in diﬀerent ways. As we noted in
              section A.2.15, power corrupts those who have it as well as those subjected to
              it. The Spanish Libertarian Youth put it this way in the 1930s:
                   “Against the principle of authority because this implies erosion of
                   the human personality when some men submit to the will of others,
                   arousing in these instincts which predispose them to cruelty and
                   indiﬀerence in the face of the suﬀering of their fellows.” [quoted by
                   Jose Peirats, The CNT in the Spanish Revolution, vol. 2, p. 76]
                Hierarchy impoverishes the human spirit. “A hierarchical mentality,” notes
              Bookchin, “fosters the renunciation of the pleasures of life. It justiﬁes toil,
              guilt, and sacriﬁce by the ‘inferiors,’ and pleasure and the indulgent
              gratiﬁcation of virtually every caprice by their ‘superiors.’ The objective
              history of the social structure becomes internalised as a subjective history of
              the psychic structure.” In other words, being subject to hierarchy fosters the
              internalisation of oppression — and the denial of individuality necessary to
              accept it. “Hierarchy, class, and ultimately the State,” he stresses, “penetrate
              the very integument of the human psyche and establish within it unreﬂective
              internal powers of coercion and constraint … By using guilt and self-blame,
              the inner State can control behaviour long before fear of the coercive powers
              of the State have to be invoked.” [The Ecology of Freedom, p. 72 and p.
              189]
                In a nutshell, ”[h]ierarchies, classes, and states warp the creative powers of
              humanity.” However, that is not all. Hierarchy, anarchists argue, also twists
              our relationships with the environment. Indeed, “all our notions of dominating
              nature stem from the very real domination of human by human … And it is not
255 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              until we eliminate domination in all its forms … that we will really create a
              rational, ecological society.” For “the conﬂicts within a divided humanity,
              structured around domination, inevitably leads to conﬂicts with nature. The
              ecological crisis with its embattled division between humanity and nature
              stems, above all, from divisions between human and human.” While the “rise
              of capitalism, with a law of life based on competition, capital accumulation,
              and limitless growth, brought these problems — ecological and social — to an
              acute point,” anarchists “emphasise that major ecological problems have their
              roots in social problems — problems that go back to the very beginnings of
              patricentric culture itself.” [Murray Bookchin, Remaking Society, p. 72, p.
              44, p. 72 and pp. 154–5]
                Thus, anarchists argue, hierarchy impacts not only on us but also our
              surroundings. The environmental crisis we face is a result of the hierarchical
              power structures at the heart of our society, structures which damage the
              planet’s ecology at least as much as they damage humans. The problems
              within society, the economic, ethnic, cultural, and gender conﬂicts, among
              many others, lie at the core of the most serious ecological dislocations we
              face. The way human beings deal with each other as social beings is crucial to
              addressing the ecological crisis. Ultimately, ecological destruction is rooted in
              the organisation of our society for a degraded humanity can only yield a
              degraded nature (as capitalism and our hierarchical history have sadly
              shown).
                This is unsurprising as we, as a species, shape our environment and,
              consequently, whatever shapes us will impact how we do so. This means that
              the individuals produced by the hierarchy (and the authoritarian mentality it
              produces) will shape the planet in speciﬁc, harmful, ways. This is to be
              expected as humans act upon their environment deliberately, creating what is
              most suitable for their mode of existence. If that mode of living is riddled with
              hierarchies, classes, states and the oppression, exploitation and domination
              they create then our relations with the natural world will hardly be any better.
              In other words, social hierarchy and class legitimises our domination of the
              environment, planting the seeds for the believe that nature exists, like other
              people, to be dominated and used as required.
                Which brings us to another key reason why anarchists reject hierarchy. In
              addition to these negative psychological eﬀects from the denial of liberty,
              authoritarian social relationships also produce social inequality. This is
              because an individual subject to the authority of another has to obey the
              orders of those above them in the social hierarchy. In capitalism this means
              that workers have to follow the orders of their boss (see next section), orders
              that are designed to make the boss richer. And richer they have become, with
              the Chief Executive Oﬀicers (CEOs) of big ﬁrms earning 212 times what the
              average US worker did in 1995 (up from a mere 44 times 30 years earlier).
              Indeed, from 1994 to 1995 alone, CEO compensation in the USA rose 16
              percent, compared to 2.8 percent for workers, which did not even keep pace
              with inﬂation, and whose stagnating wages cannot be blamed on corporate
              proﬁts, which rose a healthy 14.8 percent for that year.
                Needless to say, inequality in terms of power will translate itself into
              inequality in terms of wealth (and vice versa). The eﬀects of such social
              inequality are wide-reaching. For example, health is aﬀected signiﬁcantly by
256 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              inequality. Poor people are more likely to be sick and die at an earlier age,
              compared to rich people. Simply put, “the lower the class, the worse the
              health. Going beyond such static measures, even interruptions in income of
              the sort caused by unemployment have adverse health eﬀects.” Indeed, the
              sustained economic hardship associated with a low place in the social
              hierarchy leads to poorer physical, psychological and cognitive functioning
              (“with consequences that last a decade or more”). “Low incomes, unpleasant
              occupations and sustained discrimination,” notes Doug Henwood, “may result
              in apparently physical symptoms that confuse even sophisticated biomedical
              scientists … Higher incomes are also associated with lower frequency of
              psychiatric disorders, as are higher levels of asset ownership.” [After the
              New Economy, pp. 81–2]
                Moreover, the degree of inequality is important (i.e. the size of the gap
              between rich and poor). According to an editorial in the British Medical
              Journal “what matters in determining mortality and health in a society is less
              the overall wealth of that society and more how evenly wealth is distributed.
              The more equally wealth is distributed the better the health of that society.”
              [vol. 312, April 20, 1996, p. 985]
                Research in the USA found overwhelming evidence of this. George Kaplan
              and his colleagues measured inequality in the 50 US states and compared it to
              the age-adjusted death rate for all causes of death, and a pattern emerged:
              the more unequal the distribution of income, the greater the death rate. In
              other words, it is the gap between rich and poor, and not the average income
              in each state, that best predicts the death rate in each state. [“Inequality in
              income and mortality in the United States: analysis of mortality and potential
              pathways,” British Medical Journal, vol. 312, April 20, 1996, pp. 999–1003]
                This measure of income inequality was also tested against other social
              conditions besides health. States with greater inequality in the distribution of
              income also had higher rates of unemployment, higher rates of incarceration,
              a higher percentage of people receiving income assistance and food stamps, a
              greater percentage of people without medical insurance, greater proportion
              of babies born with low birth weight, higher murder rates, higher rates of
              violent crime, higher costs per-person for medical care, and higher costs per
              person for police protection. Moreover states with greater inequality of
              income distribution also spent less per person on education, had fewer books
              per person in the schools, and had poorer educational performance, including
              worse reading skills, worse mathematics skills, and lower rates of completion
              of high school.
                As the gap grows between rich and poor (indicating an increase in social
              hierarchy within and outwith of workplaces) the health of a people
              deteriorates and the social fabric unravels. The psychological hardship of
              being low down on the social ladder has detrimental eﬀects on people, beyond
              whatever eﬀects are produced by the substandard housing, nutrition, air
              quality, recreational opportunities, and medical care enjoyed by the poor (see
              George Davey Smith, “Income inequality and mortality: why are they
              related?” British Medical Journal, Vol. 312, April 20, 1996, pp. 987–988).
                So wealth does not determine health. What does is the gap between the rich
              and the poor. The larger the gap, the sicker the society. Countries with a
              greater degree of socioeconomic inequality show greater inequality in health

              status; also, that middle-income groups in relatively unequal societies have
              worse health than comparable, or even poorer, groups in more equal
              societies. Unsurprisingly, this is also reﬂected over time. The widening income
              diﬀerentials in both the USA and the UK since 1980 have coincided with a
              slowing down of improvements in life-expectancy, for example.
                 Inequality, in short, is bad for our health: the health of a population depends
              not just on the size of the economic pie, but on how the pie is shared.
                 This is not all. As well as inequalities in wealth, inequalities in freedom also
              play a large role in overall human well-being. According to Michael Marmot’s
              The Status Syndrome: How Social Standing Aﬀects Our Health and
              Longevity, as you move up any kind of hierarchy your health status improves.
              Autonomy and position in a hierarchy are related (i.e. the higher you are in a
              hierarchy, the more autonomy you have). Thus the implication of this
              empirical work is that autonomy is a source of good health, that the more
              control you have over your work environment and your life in general, the less
              likely you are to suﬀer the classic stress-related illnesses, such as heart
              disease. As public-Health scholars Jeﬀrey Johnson and Ellen Hall have noted,
              the “potential to control one’s own environment is diﬀerentially distributed
              along class lines.” [quoted by Robert Kuttner, Everything for Sale, p. 153]
                 As would be expected from the very nature of hierarchy, to “be in a life
              situation where one experiences relentless demands by others, over which
              one has relatively little control, is to be at risk of poor health, physically as
              well as mentally.” Looking at heart disease, the people with greatest risk
              “tended to be in occupations with high demands, low control, and low social
              support. People in demanding positions but with great autonomy were at
              lower risk.” Under capitalism, “a relatively small elite demands and gets
              empowerment, self-actualisation, autonomy, and other work satisfaction that
              partially compensate for long hours” while “epidemiological data conﬁrm that
              lower-paid, lower-status workers are more likely to experience the most
              clinically damaging forms of stress, in part because they have less control
              over their work.” [Kuttner, Op. Cit., p. 153 and p. 154]
                 In other words, the inequality of autonomy and social participation
              produced by hierarchy is itself a cause of poor health. There would be positive
              feedback on the total amount of health — and thus of social welfare — if social
              inequality was reduced, not only in terms of wealth but also, crucially, in
              power. This is strong evidence in support of anarchist visions of
              egalitarianism. Some social structures give more people more autonomy than
              others and acting to promote social justice along these lines is a key step
              toward improving our health. This means that promoting libertarian, i.e. selfmanaged, social organisations would increase not only liberty but also
              people’s health and well-being, both physical and mental. Which is, as we
              argued above, to be expected as hierarchy, by its very nature, impacts
              negatively on those subject to it.
                 This dovetails into anarchist support for workers’ control. Industrial
              psychologists have found that satisfaction in work depends on the “span of
              autonomy” works have. Unsurprisingly, those workers who are continually
              making decisions for themselves are happier and live longer. It is the power to
              control all aspects of your life — work particularly — that wealth and status
              tend to confer that is the key determinant of health. Men who have low job
258 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              control face a 50% higher risk of new illness: heart attacks, stroke, diabetes
              or merely ordinary infections. Women are at slightly lower risk but low job
              control was still a factor in whether they fell ill or not.
                 So it is the fact that the boss is a boss that makes the employment
              relationship so troublesome for health issues (and genuine libertarians). The
              more bossy the boss, the worse, as a rule is the job. So part of autonomy is
              not being bossed around, but that is only part of the story. And, of course,
              hierarchy (inequality of power) and exploitation (the source of material
              inequality) are related. As we indicate in the next section, capitalism is based
              on wage labour. The worker sell their liberty to the boss for a given period of
              time, i.e. they loose their autonomy. This allows the possibility of exploitation,
              as the worker can produce more wealth than they receive back in wages. As
              the boss pockets the diﬀerence, lack of autonomy produces increases in social
              inequality which, in turn, impacts negatively on your well-being.
                 Then there is the waste associated with hierarchy. While the proponents of
              authority like to stress its “eﬀiciency,” the reality is diﬀerent. As Colin Ward
              points out, being in authority “derives from your rank in some chain of
              command … But knowledge and wisdom are not distributed in order of rank,
              and they are no one person’s monopoly in any undertaking. The fantastic
              ineﬀiciency of any hierarchical organisation — any factory, oﬀice, university,
              warehouse or hospital — is the outcome of two almost invariable
              characteristics. One is that the knowledge and wisdom of the people at the
              bottom of the pyramid ﬁnds no place in the decision-making leadership
              hierarchy of the institution. Frequently it is devoted to making the institution
              work in spite of the formal leadership structure, or alternatively to sabotaging
              the ostensible function of the institution, because it is none of their choosing.
              The other is that they would rather not be there anyway: they are there
              through economic necessity rather than through identiﬁcation with a common
              task which throws up its own shifting and functional leadership.” [Op. Cit., p.
              41]
                 Hierarchy, in other words, blocks the ﬂow of information and knowledge.
              Rulers, as Malatesta argued, “can only make use of the forces that exist in
              society — except for those great forces” their action “paralyses and destroys,
              and those rebel forces, and all that is wasted through conﬂicts; inevitable
              tremendous losses in such an artiﬁcial system.” And so as well as individuals
              being prevented from developing to their fullest, wasting their unfulﬁlled
              potentialities, hierarchy also harms society as a whole by reducing eﬀiciency
              and creativity. This is because input into decisions are limited “only to those
              individuals who form the government [of a hierarchical organisation] or who
              by reason of their position can inﬂuence the[ir] policy.” Obviously this means
              “that far from resulting in an increase in the productive, organising and
              protective forces in society,” hierarchy “greatly reduce[s] them, limiting
              initiative to a few, and giving them the right to do everything without, of
              course, being able to provide them with the gift of being all-knowing.”
              [Anarchy, p. 38 and p. 39]
                 Large scale hierarchical organisations, like the state, are also marked by
              bureaucracy. This becomes a necessity in order to gather the necessary
              information it needs to make decisions (and, obviously, to control those under
              it). However, soon this bureaucracy becomes the real source of power due to
259 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              its permanence and control of information and resources. Thus hierarchy
              cannot “survive without creating around itself a new privileged class” as well
              as being a “privileged class and cut oﬀ from the people” itself. [Malatesta, Op.
              Cit., p. 37 and p. 36] This means that those at the top of an institution rarely
              know the facts on the ground, making decisions in relative ignorance of their
              impact or the actual needs of the situation or people involved. As economist
              Joseph Stiglitz concluded from his own experiences in the World Bank,
              “immense time and eﬀort are required to eﬀect change even from the inside,
              in an international bureaucracy. Such organisations are opaque rather than
              transparent, and not only does far too little information radiate from inside to
              the outside world, perhaps even less information from outside is able to
              penetrate the organisation. The opaqueness also means that it is hard for
              information from the bottom of the organisation to percolate to the top.”
              [Globalisation and its Discontents, p. 33] The same can be said of any
              hierarchical organisation, whether a nation state or capitalist business.
                 Moreover, as Ward and Malatesta indicate, hierarchy provokes a struggle
              between those at the bottom and at the top. This struggle is also a source of
              waste as it diverts resources and energy from more fruitful activity into
              ﬁghting it. Ironically, as we discuss in section H.4.4, one weapon forged in
              that struggle is the “work to rule,” namely workers bringing their workplace
              to a grinding halt by following the dictates of the boss to the letter. This is
              clear evidence that a workplace only operates because workers exercise their
              autonomy during working hours, an autonomy which authoritarian structures
              stiﬂe and waste. A participatory workplace, therefore, would be more eﬀicient
              and less wasteful than the hierarchical one associated with capitalism. As we
              discuss in section J.5.12, hierarchy and the struggle it creates always acts as a
              barrier stopping the increased eﬀiciency associated with workers’
              participation undermining the autocratic workplace of capitalism.
                 All this is not to suggest that those at the bottom of hierarchies are victims
              nor that those at the top of hierarchies only gain beneﬁts — far from it. As
              Ward and Malatesta indicated, hierarchy by its very nature creates resistance
              to it from those subjected to it and, in the process, the potential for ending it
              (see section B.1.6 for more discussion). Conversely, at the summit of the
              pyramid, we also see the evils of hierarchy.
                 If we look at those at the top of the system, yes, indeed they often do very
              well in terms of material goods and access to education, leisure, health and so
              on but they lose their humanity and individuality. As Bakunin pointed out,
              “power and authority corrupt those who exercise them as much as those who
              are compelled to submit to them.” [The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p.
              249] Power operates destructively, even on those who have it, reducing their
              individuality as it “renders them stupid and brutal, even when they were
              originally endowed with the best of talents. One who is constantly striving to
              force everything into a mechanical order at last becomes a machine himself
              and loses all human feeling.” [Rudolf Rocker, Anarcho-Syndicalism, pp. 17–
              8]
                 When it boils down to it, hierarchy is self-defeating, for if “wealth is other
              people,” then by treating others as less than yourself, restricting their growth,
              you lose all the potential insights and abilities these individuals have, so
              impoverishing your own life and restricting your own growth.

              Unfortunately in these days material wealth (a particularly narrow form of
              “self-interest”) has replaced concern for developing the whole person and
              leading a fulﬁlling and creative life (a broad self-interest, which places the
              individual within society, one that recognises that relationships with others
              shape and develop all individuals). In a hierarchical, class based society
              everyone loses to some degree, even those at the “top.”
                 Looking at the environment, the self-defeating nature of hierarchy also
              becomes clear. The destiny of human life goes hand-in-hand with the destiny
              of the non-human world. While being rich and powerful may mitigate the
              impact of the ecological destruction produced by hierarchies and capitalism,
              it will not stop them and will, eventually, impact on the elite as well as the
              many.
                 Little wonder, then, that “anarchism … works to destroy authority in all its
              aspects … [and] refuses all hierarchical organisation.” [Kropotkin,
              Anarchism, p. 137]
              B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical?
                 Yes. Under capitalism workers do not exchange the products of their labour
              they exchange the labour itself for money. They sell themselves for a given
              period of time, and in return for wages, promise to obey their paymasters.
              Those who pay and give the orders — owners and managers — are at the top
              of the hierarchy, those who obey at the bottom. This means that capitalism, by
              its very nature, is hierarchical.
                 As Carole Pateman argues:
                   “Capacities or labour power cannot be used without the worker
                   using his will, his understanding and experience, to put them into
                   eﬀect. The use of labour power requires the presence of its ‘owner,’
                   and it remains mere potential until he acts in the manner necessary
                   to put it into use, or agrees or is compelled so to act; that is, the
                   worker must labour. To contract for the use of labour power is a
                   waste of resources unless it can be used in the way in which the
                   new owner requires. The ﬁction ‘labour power’ cannot be used;
                   what is required is that the worker labours as demanded. The
                   employment contract must, therefore, create a relationship of
                   command and obedience between employer and worker … In short,
                   the contract in which the worker allegedly sells his labour power is
## a contract in which, since he cannot be separated from his
                   capacities, he sells command over the use of his body and himself.
                   To obtain the right to use another is to be a (civil) master.” [The
                   Sexual Contract, pp. 150–1]
                You need only compare this to Proudhon’s comments quoted in section B.1
              to see that anarchists have long recognised that capitalism is, by its very
              nature, hierarchical. The worker is subjected to the authority of the boss
              during working hours (sometimes outside work too). As Noam Chomsky
              summarises, “a corporation, factory of business is the economic equivalent of
              fascism: decisions and control are strictly top-down.” [Letters from
261 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              Lexington, p. 127] The worker’s choices are extremely limited, for most
              people it amount to renting themselves out to a series of diﬀerent masters (for
              a lucky few, the option of being a master is available). And master is the right
              word for, as David Ellerman reminds us, ”[s]ociety seems to have ‘covered up’
              in the popular consciousness the fact that the traditional name [for employer
              and employee] is ‘master and servant.’” [Property and Contract in
              Economics, p. 103]
                This hierarchical control of wage labour has the eﬀect of alienating workers
              from their own work, and so from themselves. Workers no longer govern
              themselves during work hours and so are no longer free. And so, due to
              capitalism, there is “an oppression in the land,” a “form of slavery” rooted in
              current “property institutions” which produces “a social war, inevitable so
              long as present legal-social conditions endure.” [Voltairine de Cleyre, Op.
              Cit., pp. 54–5]
                Some defenders of capitalism are aware of the contradiction between the
              rhetoric of the system and its reality for those subject to it. Most utilise the
              argument that workers consent to this form of hierarchy. Ignoring the
              economic conditions which force people to sell their liberty on the labour
              market (see section B.4.3), the issue instantly arises of whether consent is
              enough in itself to justify the alienation/selling of a person’s liberty. For
              example, there have been arguments for slavery and monarchy (i.e.
              dictatorship) rooted in consent. Do we really want to say that the only thing
              wrong with fascism or slavery is that people do not consent to it? Sadly, some
              right-wing “libertarians” come to that conclusion (see section B.4).
                Some try to redeﬁne the reality of the command-and-obey of wage labour.
              “To speak of managing, directing, or assigning workers to various tasks is a
              deceptive way of noting that the employer continually is involved in renegotiation of contracts on terms that must be acceptable to both parties,”
              argue two right-wing economists. [Arman Alchian and Harold Demsetz,
              quoted by Ellerman, Op. Cit., p. 170] So the employer-employee (or, to use
              the old, more correct, terminology, master-servant) contract is thus a series of
              unspoken contracts.
                However, if an oral contract is not worth the paper it is written on, how
              valuable is an unspoken one? And what does this “re-negotiation of contracts”
              amount to? The employee decides whether to obey the command or leave and
              the boss decides whether the employee is obedient and productive enough to
              remain in under his or her control. Hardly a relationship based on freedom
              between equal partners! As such, this capitalist defence of wage labour “is a
              deceptive way of noting” that the employee is paid to obey. The contract
              between them is simply that of obedience on one side and power on the other.
              That both sides may break the contract does not alter this fact. Thus the
              capitalist workplace “is not democratic in spite of the ‘consent of the
              governed’ to the employment contract … In the employment contract, the
              workers alienate and transfer their legal rights to the employer to govern
              their activities ‘within the scope of the employment’ to the employer.” [David
              Ellerman, The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm, p. 50]
                Ultimately, there is one right that cannot be ceded or abandoned, namely
              the right to personality. If a person gave up their personality they would cease
              to be a person yet this is what the employment contract imposes. To maintain

              and develop their personality is a basic right of humanity and it cannot be
              transferred to another, permanently or temporarily. To argue otherwise would
              be to admit that under certain circumstances and for certain periods of time a
              person is not a person but rather a thing to be used by others. Yet this is
              precisely what capitalism does due to its hierarchical nature.
                This is not all. Capitalism, by treating labour as analogous to all other
              commodities denies the key distinction between labour and other “resources”
              — that is to say its inseparability from its bearer — labour, unlike other
              “property,” is endowed with will and agency. Thus when one speaks of selling
              labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy). As Karl Polanyi
              writes:
                   “Labour is only another name for human activity which goes with
                   life itself, which is in turn not produced for sale but for entirely
                   diﬀerent reasons, nor can that activity be detached from the rest of
                   life itself, be stored or mobilised … To allow the market mechanism
                   to be sole director of the fate of human beings and their natural
                   environment … would result in the demolition of society. For the
                   alleged commodity ‘labour power’ cannot be shoved about, used
                   indiscriminately, or even left unused, without aﬀecting also the
                   human individual who happens to be the bearer of this peculiar
                   commodity. In disposing of a man’s labour power the system would,
                   incidentally, dispose of the physical, psychological, and moral entity
                   ‘man’ attached to that tag.” [The Great Transformation, p. 72]
                In other words, labour is much more than the commodity to which
              capitalism tries to reduce it. Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride
              and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of
              work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and
              physical health. Indeed, Proudhon went so far as to argue that capitalist
              companies “plunder the bodies and souls of the wage-workers” and were an
              “outrage upon human dignity and personality.” [Op. Cit., p. 219] This is
              because wage labour turns productive activity and the person who does it into
              a commodity. People “are not human beings so much as human resources.
              To the morally blind corporation, they are tool to generate as much proﬁt as
              possible. And ‘the tool can be treated just like a piece of metal — you use it if
              you want, you throw it away if you don’t want it,’ says Noam Chomsky. ‘If you
              can get human beings to become tool like that, it’s more eﬀicient by some
              measure of eﬀiciency … a measure which is based on dehumanisation. You
              have to dehumanise it. That’s part of the system.’” [Joel Bakan, The
              Corporation, p. 69]
                Separating labour from other activities of life and subjecting it to the laws
              of the market means to annihilate its natural, organic form of existence — a
              form that evolved with the human race through tens of thousands of years of
              co-operative economic activity based on sharing and mutual aid — and
              replacing it with an atomistic and individualistic one based on contract and
              competition. Unsurprisingly, this relationship is a very recent development
              and, moreover, the product of substantial state action and coercion (see
              section F.8 for some discussion of this). Simply put, “the early labourer …
              abhorred the factory, where he [or she] felt degraded and tortured.” While the
263 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              state ensured a steady pool of landless workers by enforcing private property
              rights, the early manufacturers also utilised the state to ensure low wages,
              primarily for social reasons — only an overworked and downtrodden labourer
              with no other options would agree to do whatever their master required of
              them. “Legal compulsion and parish serfdom as in England,” noted Polanyi,
              “the rigors of an absolutist labour police as on the Continent, indented labour
              as in the early Americas were the prerequisites of the ‘willing worker.’” [Op.
              Cit., pp. 164–5]
                Ignoring its origins in state action, the social relationship of wage labour is
              then claimed by capitalists to be a source of “freedom,” whereas in fact it is a
              form of (in)voluntary servitude (see sections B.4 and A.2.14 for more
              discussion). Therefore a libertarian who did not support economic liberty (i.e.
              self-government in industry, libertarian socialism) would be no libertarian at
              all, and no believer in liberty. Capitalism is based upon hierarchy and the
              denial of liberty. To present it otherwise denies the nature of wage labour.
              However, supporters of capitalism try to but — as Karl Polanyi points out —
              the idea that wage labour is based upon some kind of “natural” liberty is
              false:
                   “To represent this principle [wage labour] as one of noninterference [with freedom], as economic liberals were wont to do,
                   was merely the expression of an ingrained prejudice in favour of a
                   deﬁnite kind of interference, namely, such as would destroy non-
## contractual relations between individuals and prevent their
                   spontaneous re-formation.” [Op. Cit., p.163]
                As noted above, capitalism itself was created by state violence and the
              destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that
              task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating
              attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were
              subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association
              between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to
              regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments.
              Indeed, capitalists prefer centralised, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes
              precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section
              B.2.5). They are the only way that contractual relations based on market
              power could be enforced on an unwilling population. Capitalism was born
              under such states and as well as backing fascist movements, they made high
              proﬁts in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Today many corporations “regularly
              do business with totalitarian and authoritarian regimes — again, because it is
              proﬁtable to do so.” Indeed, there is a “trend by US corporations to invest in”
              such countries. [Joel Bakan, Op. Cit., p. 89 and p. 185] Perhaps
              unsurprisingly, as such regimes are best able to enforce the necessary
              conditions to commodify labour fully.
              B.1.3 What kind of hierarchy of values does capitalism
              create?
264 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                 Anarchists argue that capitalism can only have a negative impact on ethical
              behaviour. This ﬂows from its hierarchical nature. We think that hierarchy
              must, by its very nature, always impact negatively on morality.
                 As we argued in section A.2.19, ethics is dependent on both individual
              liberty and equality between individuals. Hierarchy violates both and so the
              “great sources of moral depravity” are “capitalism, religion, justice,
              government.” In “the domain of economy, coercion has lead us to industrial
              servitude; in the domain of politics to the State … [where] the nation …
              becomes nothing but a mass of obedient subjects to a central authority.” This
              has “contributed and powerfully aided to create all the present economic,
              political, and social evils” and “has given proof of its absolute impotence to
              raise the moral level of societies; it has not even been able to maintain it at
              the level it had already reached.” This is unsurprising, as society developed
              “authoritarian prejudices” and “men become more and more divided into
              governors and governed, exploiters and exploited, the moral level fell … and
              the spirit of the age declined.” By violating equality, by rejecting social cooperation between equals in favour of top-down, authoritarian, social
              relationships which turn some into the tools of others, capitalism, like the
              state, could not help but erode ethical standards as the “moral level” of
              society is “debased by the practice of authority.” [Kropotkin, Anarchism, pp.
              137–8, p. 106 and p. 139]
                 However, as we as promoting general unethical behaviour, capitalism
              produces a speciﬁc perverted hierarchy of values — one that places humanity
              below property. As Erich Fromm argues:
                   “The use [i.e. exploitation] of man by man is expressive of the
                   system of values underlying the capitalistic system. Capital, the
                   dead past, employs labour — the living vitality and power of
                   the present. In the capitalistic hierarchy of values, capital stands
                   higher than labour, amassed things higher than the manifestations
                   of life. Capital employs labour, and not labour capital. The person
                   who owns capital commands the person who ‘only’ owns his life,
                   human skill, vitality and creative productivity. ‘Things’ are higher
                   than man. The conﬂict between capital and labour is much more
                   than the conﬂict between two classes, more than their ﬁght for a
                   greater share of the social product. It is the conﬂict between two
                   principles of value: that between the world of things, and their
                   amassment, and the world of life and its productivity.” [The
                   Sane Society, pp. 94–95]
                Capitalism only values a person as representing a certain amount of the
              commodity called “labour power,” in other words, as a thing. Instead of being
              valued as an individual — a unique human being with intrinsic moral and
              spiritual worth — only one’s price tag counts. This replacement of human
              relationships by economic ones soon results in the replacement of human
              values by economic ones, giving us an “ethics” of the account book, in which
              people are valued by how much they earn. It also leads, as Murray Bookchin
              argues, to a debasement of human values:
                   “So deeply rooted is the market economy in our minds that its
265 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...

## grubby language has replaced our most hallowed moral and
                   spiritual expressions. We now ‘invest’ in our children, marriages,
                   and personal relationships, a term that is equated with words like
                   ‘love’ and ‘care.’ We live in a world of ‘trade-oﬀs’ and we ask for the
                   ‘bottom line’ of any emotional ‘transaction.’ We use the terminology
                   of contracts rather than that of loyalties and spiritual aﬀinities.”
                   [The Modern Crisis, p. 79]
                With human values replaced by the ethics of calculation, and with only the
              laws of market and state “binding” people together, social breakdown is
              inevitable. Little wonder modern capitalism has seen a massive increase in
              crime and dehumanisation under the freer markets established by
              “conservative” governments, such as those of Thatcher and Reagan and their
              transnational corporate masters. We now live in a society where people live in
              self-constructed fortresses, “free” behind their walls and defences (both
              emotional and physical).
                Of course, some people like the “ethics” of mathematics. But this is mostly
              because — like all gods — it gives the worshipper an easy rule book to follow.
              “Five is greater than four, therefore ﬁve is better” is pretty simple to
              understand. John Steinbeck noticed this when he wrote:
                   “Some of them [the owners] hated the mathematics that drove them
                   [to kick the farmers oﬀ their land], and some were afraid, and some
                   worshipped the mathematics because it provided a refuge from
                   thought and from feeling.” [The Grapes of Wrath, p. 34]
                 The debasement of the individual in the workplace, where so much time is
              spent, necessarily aﬀects a person’s self-image, which in turn carries over into
              the way he or she acts in other areas of life. If one is regarded as a commodity
              at work, one comes to regard oneself and others in that way also. Thus all
              social relationships — and so, ultimately, all individuals — are commodiﬁed.
              In capitalism, literally nothing is sacred — “everything has its price” — be it
              dignity, self-worth, pride, honour — all become commodities up for grabs.
              Such debasement produces a number of social pathologies. “Consumerism” is
              one example which can be traced directly to the commodiﬁcation of the
              individual under capitalism. To quote Fromm again, ”Things have no self, and
              men who have become things [i.e. commodities on the labour market] can
              have no self.” [Op. Cit., p. 143]
                 However, people still feel the need for selfhood, and so try to ﬁll the
              emptiness by consuming. The illusion of happiness, that one’s life will be
              complete if one gets a new commodity, drives people to consume.
              Unfortunately, since commodities are yet more things, they provide no
              substitute for selfhood, and so the consuming must begin anew. This process
              is, of course, encouraged by the advertising industry, which tries to convince
              us to buy what we don’t need because it will make us popular/sexy/happy/
              free/etc. (delete as appropriate!). But consuming cannot really satisfy the
              needs that the commodities are bought to satisfy. Those needs can only be
              satisﬁed by social interaction based on truly human values and by creative,
              self-directed work.
                 This does not mean, of course, that anarchists are against higher living
266 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              standards or material goods. To the contrary, they recognise that liberty and a
              good life are only possible when one does not have to worry about having
              enough food, decent housing, and so forth. Freedom and 16 hours of work a
              day do not go together, nor do equality and poverty or solidarity and hunger.
              However, anarchists consider consumerism to be a distortion of consumption
              caused by the alienating and inhuman “account book” ethics of capitalism,
              which crushes the individual and his or her sense of identity, dignity and
              selfhood.
              B.1.4 Why do racism, sexism and homophobia exist?
                 Since racism, sexism and homophobia (hatred/fear of homosexuals) are
              institutionalised throughout society, sexual, racial and gay oppression are
              commonplace. The primary cause of these three evil attitudes is the need for
              ideologies that justify domination and exploitation, which are inherent in
              hierarchy — in other words, “theories” that “justify” and “explain” oppression
              and injustice. As Tacitus said, “We hate those whom we injure.” Those who
              oppress others always ﬁnd reasons to regard their victims as “inferior” and
              hence deserving of their fate. Elites need some way to justify their superior
              social and economic positions. Since the social system is obviously unfair and
              elitist, attention must be distracted to other, less inconvenient, “facts,” such
              as alleged superiority based on biology or “nature.” Therefore, doctrines of
              sexual, racial, and ethnic superiority are inevitable in hierarchical, classstratiﬁed societies.
## We will take each form of bigotry in turn.
                 From an economic standpoint, racism is associated with the exploitation of
              cheap labour at home and imperialism abroad. Indeed, early capitalist
              development in both America and Europe was strengthened by the bondage of
              people, particularly those of African descent. In the Americas, Australia and
              other parts of the world the slaughter of the original inhabitants and the
              expropriation of their land was also a key aspect in the growth of capitalism.
              As the subordination of foreign nations proceeds by force, it appears to the
              dominant nation that it owes its mastery to its special natural qualities, in
              other words to its “racial” characteristics. Thus imperialists have frequently
              appealed to the Darwinian doctrine of “Survival of the Fittest” to give their
              racism a basis in “nature.”
                 In Europe, one of the ﬁrst theories of racial superiority was proposed by
              Gobineau in the 1850s to establish the natural right of the aristocracy to rule
              over France. He argued that the French aristocracy was originally of
              Germanic origin while the “masses” were Gallic or Celtic, and that since the
              Germanic race was “superior”, the aristocracy had a natural right to rule.
              Although the French “masses” didn’t ﬁnd this theory particularly persuasive,
              it was later taken up by proponents of German expansion and became the
              origin of German racial ideology, used to justify Nazi oppression of Jews and
              other “non-Aryan” types. Notions of the “white man’s burden” and “Manifest
              Destiny” developed at about the same time in England and to a lesser extent
              in America, and were used to rationalise Anglo-Saxon conquest and world
              domination on a “humanitarian” basis.

                Racism and authoritarianism at home and abroad has gone hand in hand. As
              Rudolf Rocker argued, ”[a]ll advocates of the race doctrine have been and are
              the associates and defenders of every political and social reaction, advocates
              of the power principle in its most brutal form … He who thinks that he sees in
              all political and social antagonisms merely blood-determined manifestations of
              race, denies all conciliatory inﬂuence of ideas, all community of ethical
              feeling, and must at every crisis take refuge in brute force. In fact, race
              theory is only the cult of power.” Racism aids the consolidation of elite power
              for by attacking “all the achievements … in the direction of personal freedom”
              and the idea of equality ”[n]o better moral justiﬁcation could be produced for
              the industrial bondage which our holders of industrial power keep before
              them as a picture of the future.” [Nationalism and Culture, pp. 337–8]
                The idea of racial superiority was also found to have great domestic utility.
              As Paul Sweezy points out, ”[t]he intensiﬁcation of social conﬂict within the
              advanced capitalist countries… has to be directed as far as possible into
              innocuous channels — innocuous, that is to say, from the standpoint of
              capitalist class rule. The stirring up of antagonisms along racial lines is a
              convenient method of directing attention away from class struggle,” which of
              course is dangerous to ruling-class interests. [Theory of Capitalist
              Development, p. 311] Indeed, employers have often deliberately fostered
              divisions among workers on racial lines as part of a strategy of “divide and
              rule” (in other contexts, like Northern Ireland or Scotland, the employers
              have used religion in the same way instead).
                Employers and politicians have often deliberately fostered divisions among
              workers on racial lines as part of a strategy of “divide and rule.” In other
              contexts, like Tzarist Russia, Northern Ireland or Scotland, the employers
              have used religion in the same way. In others, immigrants and native born is
              the dividing line. The net eﬀect is the same, social oppressions which range
              from the extreme violence anarchists like Emma Goldman denounced in the
              American South (“the atrocities rampant in the South, of negroes lynched,
              tortured and burned by infuriated crowds without a hand being raised or a
              word said for their protection” [Emma Goldman: A Documentary History
              of the American Years, vol. 1, p. 386]) or the pogroms against Jews in
              Tsarist Russia to discrimination in where people can live, what jobs people
              can get, less pay and so on.
                For those in power, this makes perfect sense as racism (like other forms of
              bigotry) can be used to split and divide the working class by getting people to
              blame others of their class for the conditions they all suﬀer. In this way, the
              anger people feel about the problems they face are turned away from their
              real causes onto scapegoats. Thus white workers are subtly (and sometimes
              not so subtly) encouraged, for example, to blame unemployment, poverty and
              crime on blacks or Hispanics instead of capitalism and the (white, male) elites
              who run it and who directly beneﬁt from low wages and high proﬁts.
              Discrimination against racial minorities and women makes sense for
              capitalism, for in this way proﬁts are enlarged directly and indirectly. As jobs
              and investment opportunities are denied to the disadvantaged groups, their
              wages can be depressed below prevailing levels and proﬁts, correspondingly,
              increased. Indirectly, discrimination adds capitalist proﬁts and power by
              increasing unemployment and setting workers against each other. Such

              factors ensure that capitalism will never “compete” discrimination way as
              some free-market capitalist economists argue.
                 In other words, capitalism has beneﬁted and will continue to beneﬁt from its
              racist heritage. Racism has provided pools of cheap labour for capitalists to
              draw upon and permitted a section of the population to be subjected to worse
              treatment, so increasing proﬁts by reducing working conditions and other
              non-pay related costs. In America, blacks still get paid less than whites for the
              same work (around 10% less than white workers with the same education,
              work experience, occupation and other relevent demographic variables). This
              is transferred into wealth inequalities. In 1998, black incomes were 54% of
              white incomes while black net worth (including residential) was 12% and
              nonresidential net worth just 3% of white. For Hispanics, the picture was
              similar with incomes just 62% of whites, net worth, 4% and nonresidential net
              worth 0%. While just under 15% of white households had zero or negative net
              worth, 27% of black households and 36% Hispanic were in the same situation.
              Even at similar levels of income, black households were signiﬁcantly less
              wealthy than white ones. [Doug Henwood, After the New Economy, p. 99
              and pp. 125–6]
                 All this means that racial minorities are “subjected to oppression and
              exploitation on the dual grounds of race and class, and thus have to ﬁght the
              extra battles against racism and discrimination.” [Lorenzo Kom’boa Ervin,
              Anarchism and the Black Revolution, p. 126]
                 Sexism only required a “justiﬁcation” once women started to act for
              themselves and demand equal rights. Before that point, sexual oppression did
              not need to be “justiﬁed” — it was “natural” (saying that, of course, equality
              between the sexes was stronger before the rise of Christianity as a state
              religion and capitalism so the “place” of women in society has fallen over the
              last few hundred years before rising again thanks to the women’s movement).
                 The nature of sexual oppression can be seen from marriage. Emma
              Goldman pointed out that marriage “stands for the sovereignty of the man
              over the women,” with her “complete submission” to the husbands “whims
              and commands.” [Red Emma Speaks, p. 164] As Carole Pateman notes, until
              “the late nineteenth century the legal and civil position of a wife resembled
              that of a slave… A slave had no independent legal existence apart from his
              master, and husband and wife became ‘one person,’ the person of the
              husband.” Indeed, the law “was based on the assumption that a wife was
              (like) property” and only the marriage contract “includes the explicit
              commitment to obey.” [The Sexual Contract, p. 119, p. 122 and p. 181]
                 However, when women started to question the assumptions of male
              domination, numerous theories were developed to explain why women’s
              oppression and domination by men was “natural.” Because men enforced
              their rule over women by force, men’s “superiority” was argued to be a
              “natural” product of their gender, which is associated with greater physical
              strength (on the premise that “might makes right”). In the 17th century, it was
              argued that women were more like animals than men, thus “proving” that
              women had as much right to equality with men as sheep did. More recently,
              elites have embraced socio-biology in response to the growing women’s
              movement. By “explaining” women’s oppression on biological grounds, a
              social system run by men and for men could be ignored.

                Women’s subservient role also has economic value for capitalism (we should
              note that Goldman considered capitalism to be another “paternal
              arrangement” like marriage, both of which robbed people of their
              “birthright,” “stunts” their growth, “poisons” their bodies and keeps people in
              “ignorance, in poverty and dependence.” [Op. Cit., p. 210]). Women often
              provide necessary (and unpaid) labour which keeps the (usually) male worker
              in good condition; and it is primarily women who raise the next generation of
              wage-slaves (again without pay) for capitalist owners to exploit. Moreover,
              women’s subordination gives working-class men someone to look down upon
              and, sometimes, a convenient target on whom they can take out their
              frustrations (instead of stirring up trouble at work). As Lucy Parsons pointed
              out, a working class woman is “a slave to a slave.”
                Sexism, like all forms of bigotry, is reﬂected in relative incomes and wealth
              levels. In the US women, on average, were being paid 57% the amount men
              were in 2001 (an improvement than the 39% 20 years earlier). Part of this is
              due to fewer women working than men, but for those who do work outside the
              home their incomes were 66% than of men’s (up from 47% in 1980 and 38%
              in 1970). Those who work full time, their incomes 76% of men’s, up from the
              60% average through most of the 1970s. However, as with the black-white
              gap, this is due in part to the stagnant income of male workers (in 1998 men’s
              real incomes were just 1% above 1989 levels while women’s were 14%
              above). So rather than the increase in income being purely the result of
              women entering high-paying and largely male occupations and them closing
              the gender gap, it has also been the result of the intense attacks on the
              working class since the 1980s which has de-unionised and de-industrialised
              America. This has resulted in a lot of high-paying male jobs have been lost
              and more and more women have entered the job market to make sure their
              families make ends. [Henwood, Op. Cit., p. 91–2]
                Turning away from averages, we discover that sexism results in women
              being paid about 12% less than men during the same job, with the same
              relative variables (like work experience, education and so forth). Needless to
              say, as with racism, such “relevant variables” are themselves shaped by
              discrimination. Women, like blacks, are less likely to get job interviews and
              jobs. Sexism even aﬀects types of jobs, for example, “caring” professions pay
              less than non-caring ones because they are seen as feminine and involve the
              kinds of tasks which women do at home without pay. In general, female
              dominated industries pay less. In 1998, occupations that were over 90% male
              had a median wage almost 10% above average while those over 90% female,
              almost 25% below. One study found that a 30% increase in women in an
              occupation translated into a 10% decline in average pay. Needless to say,
              having children is bad economic news for most women (women with children
              earn 10 to 15% less than women without children while for men the opposite
              is the case). Having maternity level, incidentally, have a far smaller
              motherhood penalty. [Henwood, Op. Cit., p. 95–7]
                The oppression of lesbians, gays and bisexuals is inextricably linked with
              sexism. A patriarchal, capitalist society cannot see homosexual practices as
              the normal human variations they are because they blur that society’s rigid
              gender roles and sexist stereotypes. Most young gay people keep their
              sexuality to themselves for fear of being kicked out of home and all gays have
270 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              the fear that some “straights” will try to kick their sexuality out of them if
              they express their sexuality freely. As with those subject to other forms of
              bigotry, gays are also discriminated against economically (gay men earning
              about 4–7% less than the average straight man [Henwood, Op. Cit., p. 100]).
              Thus the social oppression which result in having an alternative sexuality are
              experienced on many diﬀerent levels, from extreme violence to less pay for
              doing the same work.
                Gays are not oppressed on a whim but because of the speciﬁc need of
              capitalism for the nuclear family. The nuclear family, as the primary — and
              inexpensive — creator of submissive people (growing up within the
              authoritarian family gets children used to, and “respectful” of, hierarchy and
              subordination — see section B.1.5) as well as provider and carer for the
              workforce fulﬁls an important need for capitalism. Alternative sexualities
              represent a threat to the family model because they provide a diﬀerent role
              model for people. This means that gays are going to be in the front line of
              attack whenever capitalism wants to reinforce “family values” (i.e. submission
              to authority, “tradition”, “morality” and so on). The introduction of Clause 28
              in Britain is a good example of this, with the government making it illegal for
              public bodies to promote gay sexuality (i.e. to present it as anything other
              than a perversion). In American, the right is also seeking to demonise
              homosexuality as part of their campaign to reinforce the values of the
              patriarchal family unit and submission to “traditional” authority. Therefore,
              the oppression of people based on their sexuality is unlikely to end until
              sexism is eliminated.
                This is not all. As well as adversely aﬀecting those subject to them, sexism,
              racism and homophobia are harmful to those who practice them (and in some
              way beneﬁt from them) within the working class itself. Why this should be the
              case is obvious, once you think about it. All three divide the working class,
              which means that whites, males and heterosexuals hurt themselves by
              maintaining a pool of low-paid competing labour, ensuring low wages for their
              own wives, daughters, mothers, relatives and friends. Such divisions create
              inferior conditions and wages for all as capitalists gain a competitive
              advantage using this pool of cheap labour, forcing all capitalists to cut
              conditions and wages to survive in the market (in addition, such social
              hierarchies, by undermining solidarity against the employer on the job and
              the state possibly create a group of excluded workers who could become
              scabs during strikes). Also, “privileged” sections of the working class lose out
              because their wages and conditions are less than those which unity could
              have won them. Only the boss really wins.
                This can be seen from research into this subject. The researcher Al
              Szymanski sought to systematically and scientiﬁcally test the proposition that
              white workers gain from racism [“Racial Discrimination and White Gain”, in
              American Sociological Review, vol. 41, no. 3, June 1976, pp. 403–414]. He
              compared the situation of “white” and “non-white” (i.e. black, Native
              American, Asian and Hispanic) workers in United States and found several
              key things:
                (1) The narrower the gap between white and black wages in an American
               state, the higher white earnings were relative to white earnings elsewhere.
271 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                      This means that “whites do not beneﬁt economically by economic
               discrimination. White workers especially appear to beneﬁt economically from
                the absence of economic discrimination... both in the absolute level of their
               earnings and in relative equality among whites.” [p. 413] In other words, the
              less wage discrimination there was against black workers, the better were the
## wages that white workers received.
               (2) The more “non-white” people in the population of a given American State,
               the more inequality there was between whites. In other words, the existence
                of a poor, oppressed group of workers reduced the wages of white workers,
               although it did not aﬀect the earnings of non-working class whites very much
                (“the greater the discrimination against [non-white] people, the greater the
              inequality among whites” [p. 410]). So white workers clearly lost economically
## from this discrimination.
              (3) He also found that “the more intense racial discrimination is, the lower are
                the white earnings because of ... [its eﬀect on] working-class solidarity.” [p.
                  412] In other words, racism economically disadvantages white workers
                because it undermines the solidarity between black and white workers and
## weakens trade union organisation.

                So overall, these white workers receive some apparent privileges from
              racism, but are in fact screwed by it. Thus racism and other forms of
              hierarchy actually works against the interests of those working class people
              who practice it — and, by weakening workplace and social unity, beneﬁts the
              ruling class:
                   “As long as discrimination exists and racial or ethnic minorities are
                   oppressed, the entire working class is weakened. This is so because
                   the Capitalist class is able to use racism to drive down the wages of
## individual segments of the working class by inciting racial
                   antagonism and forcing a ﬁght for jobs and services. This division is
                   a development that ultimately undercuts the living standards of all
                   workers. Moreover, by pitting Whites against Blacks and other
                   oppressed nationalities, the Capitalist class is able to prevent
## workers from uniting against their common enemy. As long as
                   workers are ﬁghting each other, the Capitalist class is secure.”
                   [Lorenzo Kom’boa Ervin, Op. Cit., pp. 12–3]
                In addition, a wealth of alternative viewpoints, insights, experiences,
              cultures, thoughts and so on are denied the racist, sexist or homophobe. Their
              minds are trapped in a cage, stagnating within a mono-culture — and
              stagnation is death for the personality. Such forms of oppression are
              dehumanising for those who practice them, for the oppressor lives as a role,
              not as a person, and so are restricted by it and cannot express their
              individuality freely (and so do so in very limited ways). This warps the
              personality of the oppressor and impoverishes their own life and personality.
              Homophobia and sexism also limits the ﬂexibility of all people, gay or straight,
              to choose the sexual expressions and relationships that are right for them.
              The sexual repression of the sexist and homophobe will hardly be good for
              their mental health, their relationships or general development.
                From the anarchist standpoint, oppression based on race, sex or sexuality
272 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              will remain forever intractable under capitalism or, indeed, under any
              economic or political system based on domination and exploitation. While
              individual members of “minorities” may prosper, racism as a justiﬁcation for
              inequality is too useful a tool for elites to discard. By using the results of
              racism (e.g. poverty) as a justiﬁcation for racist ideology, criticism of the
              status quo can, yet again, be replaced by nonsense about “nature” and
              “biology.” Similarly with sexism or discrimination against gays.
                The long-term solution is obvious: dismantle capitalism and the hierarchical,
              economically class-stratiﬁed society with which it is bound up. By getting rid
              of capitalist oppression and exploitation and its consequent imperialism and
              poverty, we will also eliminate the need for ideologies of racial or sexual
              superiority used to justify the oppression of one group by another or to divide
              and weaken the working class. However, struggles against bigotry cannot be
              left until after a revolution. If they were two things are likely: one, such a
              revolution would be unlikely to happen and, two, if it were then these
              problems would more than likely remain in the new society created by it.
              Therefore the negative impacts of inequality can and must be fought in the
              here and now, like any form of hierarchy. Indeed, as we discuss in more detail
              section B.1.6 by doing so we make life a bit better in the here and now as well
              as bringing the time when such inequalities are ﬁnally ended nearer. Only this
              can ensure that we can all live as free and equal individuals in a world
              without the blights of sexism, racism, homophobia or religious hatred.
                Needless to say, anarchists totally reject the kind of “equality” that accepts
              other kinds of hierarchy, that accepts the dominant priorities of capitalism
              and the state and accedes to the devaluation of relationships and individuality
              in name of power and wealth. There is a kind of “equality” in having “equal
              opportunities,” in having black, gay or women bosses and politicians, but one
              that misses the point. Saying “Me too!” instead of “What a mess!” does not
              suggest real liberation, just diﬀerent bosses and new forms of oppression. We
              need to look at the way society is organised, not at the sex, colour, nationality
              or sexuality of who is giving the orders!
              B.1.5 How is the mass-psychological basis for
              authoritarian civilisation created?
                We noted in section A.3.6 that hierarchical, authoritarian institutions tend
              to be self-perpetuating, because growing up under their inﬂuence creates
              submissive/authoritarian personalities — people who both “respect” authority
              (based on fear of punishment) and desire to exercise it themselves on
              subordinates. Individuals with such a character structure do not really want
              to dismantle hierarchies, because they are afraid of the responsibility entailed
              by genuine freedom. It seems “natural” and “right” to them that society’s
              institutions, from the authoritarian factory to the patriarchal family, should be
              pyramidal, with an elite at the top giving orders while those below them
              merely obey. Thus we have the spectacle of so-called “Libertarians” and
              “anarcho” capitalists bleating about “liberty” while at the same time
              advocating factory fascism and privatised states. In short, authoritarian
              civilisation reproduces itself with each generation because, through an

              intricate system of conditioning that permeates every aspect of society, it
              creates masses of people who support the status quo.
                 Wilhelm Reich has given one of the most thorough analyses of the
              psychological processes involved in the reproduction of authoritarian
              civilisation. Reich based his analysis on four of Freud’s most solidly grounded
              discoveries, namely, (1) that there exists an unconscious part of the mind
              which has a powerful though irrational inﬂuence on behaviour; (2) that even
              the small child develops a lively “genital” sexuality, i.e. a desire for sexual
              pleasure which has nothing to do with procreation; (3) that childhood
              sexuality along with the Oedipal conﬂicts that arise in parent-child relations
              under monogamy and patriarchy are usually repressed through fear of
              punishment or disapproval for sexual acts and thoughts; (4) that this blocking
              of the child’s natural sexual activity and extinguishing it from memory does
              not weaken its force in the unconscious, but actually intensiﬁes it and enables
              it to manifest itself in various pathological disturbances and anti-social drives;
              and (5) that, far from being of divine origin, human moral codes are derived
              from the educational measures used by the parents and parental surrogates in
              earliest childhood, the most eﬀective of these being the ones opposed to
              childhood sexuality.
                 By studying Bronislaw Malinowsli’s research on the Trobriand Islanders, a
              woman-centred (matricentric) society in which children’s sexual behaviour
              was not repressed and in which neuroses and perversions as well as
              authoritarian institutions and values were almost non-existent, Reich came to
              the conclusion that patriarchy and authoritarianism originally developed
              when tribal chieftains began to get economic advantages from a certain type
              of marriage (“cross-cousin marriages”) entered into by their sons. In such
              marriages, the brothers of the son’s wife were obliged to pay a dowry to her
              in the form of continuous tribute, thus enriching her husband’s clan (i.e. the
              chief’s). By arranging many such marriages for his sons (which were usually
              numerous due to the chief’s privilege of polygamy), the chief’s clan could
              accumulate wealth. Thus society began to be stratiﬁed into ruling and
              subordinate clans based on wealth.
                 To secure the permanence of these “good” marriages, strict monogamy was
              required. However, it was found that monogamy was impossible to maintain
              without the repression of childhood sexuality, since, as statistics show,
              children who are allowed free expression of sexuality often do not adapt
              successfully to life-long monogamy. Therefore, along with class stratiﬁcation
              and private property, authoritarian child-rearing methods were developed to
              inculcate the repressive sexual morality on which the new patriarchal system
              depended for its reproduction. Thus there is a historical correlation between,
              on the one hand, pre-patriarchal society, primitive libertarian communism (or
              “work democracy,” to use Reich’s expression), economic equality, and sexual
              freedom, and on the other, patriarchal society, a private-property economy,
              economic class stratiﬁcation, and sexual repression. As Reich puts it:
                   “Every tribe that developed from a [matricentric] to a patriarchal
                   organisation had to change the sexual structure of its members to
                   produce a sexuality in keeping with its new form of life. This was a
                   necessary change because the shifting of power and of wealth from

                   the democratic gens [maternal clans] to the authoritarian family of
                   the chief was mainly implemented with the help of the suppression
                   of the sexual strivings of the people. It was in this way that sexual
                   suppression became an essential factor in the division of society into
## classes.

                   “Marriage, and the lawful dowry it entailed, became the axis of the
                   transformation of the one organisation into the other. In view of the
                   fact that the marriage tribute of the wife’s gens to the man’s family
                   strengthened the male’s, especially the chief’s, position of power,
## the male members of the higher ranking gens and families
                   developed a keen interest in making the nuptial ties permanent. At
                   this stage, in other words, only the man had an interest in marriage.
                   In this way natural work-democracy’s simple alliance, which could
                   be easily dissolved at any time, was transformed into the permanent
                   and monogamous marital relationship of patriarchy. The permanent
                   monogamous marriage became the basic institution of patriarchal
                   society — which it still is today. To safeguard these marriages,
## however, it was necessary to impose greater and greater
                   restrictions upon and to depreciate natural genital strivings.” [The
                   Mass Psychology of Fascism, p. 90]
                The suppression of natural sexuality involved in this transformation from
              matricentric to patriarchal society created various anti-social drives (sadism,
              destructive impulses, rape fantasies, etc.), which then also had to be
              suppressed through the imposition of a compulsive morality, which took the
              place the natural self-regulation that one ﬁnds in pre-patriarchal societies. In
              this way, sex began to be regarded as “dirty,” “diabolical,” “wicked,” etc. —
              which it had indeed become through the creation of secondary drives. Thus:
                   “The patriarchal-authoritarian sexual order that resulted from the
                   revolutionary processes of latter-day [matricentrism] (economic
                   independence of the chief’s family from the maternal gens, a
                   growing exchange of goods between the tribes, development of the
## means of production, etc.) becomes the primary basis of
                   authoritarian ideology by depriving the women, children, and
                   adolescents of their sexual freedom, making a commodity of sex and
                   placing sexual interests in the service of economic subjugation.
                   From now on, sexuality is indeed distorted; it becomes diabolical
                   and demonic and has to be curbed.” [Reich, Op. Cit., p. 88]
                Once the beginnings of patriarchy are in place, the creation of a fully
              authoritarian society based on the psychological crippling of its members
              through sexual suppression follows:
                   “The moral inhibition of the child’s natural sexuality, the last stage
                   of which is the severe impairment of the child’s genital sexuality,
                   makes the child afraid, shy, fearful of authority, obedient, ‘good,’
                   and ‘docile’ in the authoritarian sense of the words. It has a
                   crippling eﬀect on man’s rebellious forces because every vital life275 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM
An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   impulse is now burdened with severe fear; and since sex is a
                   forbidden subject, thought in general and man’s critical faculty also
                   become inhibited. In short, morality’s aim is to produce acquiescent
                   subjects who, despite distress and humiliation, are adjusted to the
                   authoritarian order. Thus, the family is the authoritarian state in
                   miniature, to which the child must learn to adapt himself as a
                   preparation for the general social adjustment required of him later.
                   Man’s authoritarian structure — this must be clearly established —
                   is basically produced by the embedding of sexual inhibitions and
                   fear.” [Reich, Op. Cit., p. 30]
                In this way, by damaging the individual’s power to rebel and think for him/
              herself, the inhibition of childhood sexuality — and indeed other forms of free,
              natural expression of bioenergy (e.g. shouting, crying, running, jumping, etc.)
              — becomes the most important weapon in creating reactionary personalities.
              This is why every reactionary politician puts such an emphasis on
              “strengthening the family” and promoting “family values” (i.e. patriarchy,
              compulsive monogamy, premarital chastity, corporal punishment, etc.). In the
              words of Reich:
                   “Since authoritarian society reproduces itself in the individual
                   structures of the masses with the help of the authoritarian family, it
                   follows that political reaction has to regard and defend the
                   authoritarian family as the basis of the ‘state, culture, and
                   civilisation… .’ [It is] political reaction’s germ cell, the most
                   important centre for the production of reactionary men and women.
                   Originating and developing from deﬁnite social processes, it
                   becomes the most essential institution for the preservation of the
                   authoritarian system that shapes it.” [Op. Cit., pp. 104–105]
                The family is the most essential institution for this purpose because children
              are most vulnerable to psychological maiming in their ﬁrst few years, from
              the time of birth to about six years of age, during which time they are mostly
              in the charge of their parents. The schools and churches then continue the
              process of conditioning once the children are old enough to be away from
              their parents, but they are generally unsuccessful if the proper foundation has
              not been laid very early in life by the parents. Thus A.S. Neill observes that
              “the nursery training is very like the kennel training. The whipped child, like
              the whipped puppy, grows into an obedient, inferior adult. And as we train our
              dogs to suit our own purposes, so we train our children. In that kennel, the
              nursery, the human dogs must be clean; they must feed when we think it
              convenient for them to feed. I saw a hundred thousand obedient, fawning
              dogs wag their tails in the Templehof, Berlin, when in 1935, the great trainer
              Hitler whistled his commands.” [Summerhill: a Radical Approach to Child
              Rearing, p. 100]
                The family is also the main agency of repression during adolescence, when
              sexual energy reaches its peak. This is because the vast majority of parents
              provide no private space for adolescents to pursue undisturbed sexual
              relationships with their partners, but in fact actively discourage such
              behaviour, often (as in fundamentalist Christian families) demanding complete

              abstinence — at the very time when abstinence is most impossible! Moreover,
              since teenagers are economically dependent on their parents under
              capitalism, with no societal provision of housing or dormitories allowing for
              sexual freedom, young people have no alternative but to submit to irrational
              parental demands for abstention from premarital sex. This in turn forces them
              to engage in furtive sex in the back seats of cars or other out-of-the-way
              places where they cannot relax or obtain full sexual satisfaction. As Reich
              found, when sexuality is repressed and laden with anxiety, the result is always
              some degree of what he terms “orgastic impotence”: the inability to fully
              surrender to the ﬂow of energy discharged during orgasm. Hence there is an
              incomplete release of sexual tension, which results in a state of chronic
              bioenergetic stasis. Such a condition, Reich found, is the breeding ground for
              neuroses and reactionary attitudes. (For further details see the section J.6).
                 In this connection it is interesting to note that “primitive” societies, such as
              the Trobriand Islanders, prior to their developing patriarchal-authoritarian
              institutions, provided special community houses where teenagers could go
              with their partners to enjoy undisturbed sexual relationships — and this with
              society’s full approval. Such an institution would be taken for granted in an
              anarchist society, as it is implied by the concept of freedom. (For more on
              adolescent sexual liberation, see section J.6.8.)
                 Nationalistic feelings can also be traced to the authoritarian family. A child’s
              attachment to its mother is, of course, natural and is the basis of all family
              ties. Subjectively, the emotional core of the concepts of homeland and nation
              are mother and family, since the mother is the homeland of the child, just as
              the family is the “nation in miniature.” According to Reich, who carefully
              studied the mass appeal of Hitler’s “National Socialism,” nationalistic
              sentiments are a direct continuation of the family tie and are rooted in a
              ﬁxated tie to the mother. As Reich points out, although infantile attachment
              to the mother is natural, ﬁxated attachment is not, but is a social product. In
              puberty, the tie to the mother would make room for other attachments, i.e.,
              natural sexual relations, if the unnatural sexual restrictions imposed on
              adolescents did not cause it to be eternalised. It is in the form of this socially
              conditioned externalisation that ﬁxation on the mother becomes the basis of
              nationalist feelings in the adult; and it is only at this stage that it becomes a
              reactionary social force.
                 Later writers who have followed Reich in analysing the process of creating
              reactionary character structures have broadened the scope of his analysis to
              include other important inhibitions, besides sexual ones, that are imposed on
              children and adolescents. Rianne Eisler, for example, in her book Sacred
              Pleasure, stresses that it is not just a sex-negative attitude but a pleasurenegative attitude that creates the kinds of personalities in question. Denial of
              the value of pleasurable sensations permeates our unconscious, as reﬂected,
              for example, in the common idea that to enjoy the pleasures of the body is the
              “animalistic” (and hence “bad”) side of human nature, as contrasted with the
              “higher” pleasures of the mind and “spirit.” By such dualism, which denies a
              spiritual aspect to the body, people are made to feel guilty about enjoying any
              pleasurable sensations — a conditioning that does, however, prepare them for
              lives based on the sacriﬁce of pleasure (or indeed, even of life itself) under
              capitalism and statism, with their requirements of mass submission to
277 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              alienated labour, exploitation, military service to protect ruling-class interests,
              and so on. And at the same time, authoritarian ideology emphasises the value
              of suﬀering, as for example through the gloriﬁcation of the tough, insensitive
              warrior hero, who suﬀers (and inﬂicts “necessary” suﬀering on others ) for
              the sake of some pitiless ideal.
                Eisler also points out that there is “ample evidence that people who grow up
              in families where rigid hierarchies and painful punishments are the norm
              learn to suppress anger toward their parents. There is also ample evidence
              that this anger is then often deﬂected against traditionally disempowered
              groups (such as minorities, children, and women).” [Sacred Pleasure, p. 187]
              This repressed anger then becomes fertile ground for reactionary politicians,
              whose mass appeal usually rests in part on scapegoating minorities for
              society’s problems.
## As the psychologist Else Frenkel-Brunswick documents in The
              Authoritarian Personality, people who have been conditioned through
              childhood abuse to surrender their will to the requirements of feared
              authoritarian parents, also tend to be very susceptible as adults to surrender
              their will and minds to authoritarian leaders. “In other words,” FrenkelBrunswick summarises, “at the same time that they learn to deﬂect their
              repressed rage against those they perceive as weak, they also learn to submit
              to autocratic or ‘strong-man’ rule. Moreover, having been severely punished
              for any hint of rebellion (even ‘talking back’ about being treated unfairly),
              they gradually also learn to deny to themselves that there was anything wrong
              with what was done to them as children — and to do it in turn to their own
              children.” [The Authoritarian Personality, p. 187]
                These are just some of the mechanisms that perpetuate the status quo by
              creating the kinds of personalities who worship authority and fear freedom.
              Consequently, anarchists are generally opposed to traditional child-rearing
              practices, the patriarchal-authoritarian family (and its “values”), the
              suppression of adolescent sexuality, and the pleasure-denying, pain-aﬀirming
              attitudes taught by the Church and in most schools. In place of these,
              anarchists favour non-authoritarian, non-repressive child-rearing practices
              and educational methods (see sections J.6 and secJ.5.13, respectively) whose
              purpose is to prevent, or at least minimise, the psychological crippling of
              individuals, allowing them instead to develop natural self-regulation and selfmotivated learning. This, we believe, is the only way to for people to grow up
              into happy, creative, and truly freedom-loving individuals who will provide the
              psychological ground where anarchist economic and political institutions can
              ﬂourish.
              B.1.6 Can hierarchy be ended?
                Faced with the fact that hierarchy, in its many distinctive forms, has been
              with us such a long time and so negatively shapes those subject to it, some
              may conclude that the anarchist hope of ending it, or even reducing it, is little
              more than a utopian dream. Surely, it will be argued, as anarchists
              acknowledge that those subject to a hierarchy adapt to it this automatically
              excludes the creation of people able to free themselves from it?
278 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                 Anarchists disagree. Hierarchy can be ended, both in speciﬁc forms and in
              general. A quick look at the history of the human species shows that this is
              the case. People who have been subject to monarchy have ended it, creating
              republics where before absolutism reigned. Slavery and serfdom have been
              abolished. Alexander Berkman simply stated the obvious when he pointed out
              that “many ideas, once held to be true, have come to be regarded as wrong
              and evil. Thus the ideas of divine right of kings, of slavery and serfdom. There
              was a time when the whole world believed those institutions to be right, just,
              and unchangeable.” However, they became “discredited and lost their hold
              upon the people, and ﬁnally the institutions that incorporated those ideas
              were abolished” as “they were useful only to the master class” and “were
              done away with by popular uprisings and revolutions.” [What is Anarchism?,
              p. 178] It is unlikely, therefore, that current forms of hierarchy are exceptions
              to this process.
                 Today, we can see that this is the case. Malatesta’s comments of over one
              hundred years ago are still valid: “the oppressed masses … have never
              completely resigned themselves to oppression and poverty … [and] show
              themselves thirsting for justice, freedom and wellbeing.” [Anarchy, p. 33]
              Those at the bottom are constantly resisting both hierarchy and its the
              negative eﬀects and, equally important, creating non-hierarchical ways of
              living and ﬁghting. This constant process of self-activity and self-liberation
              can be seen from the labour, women’s and other movements — in which, to
              some degree, people create their own alternatives based upon their own
              dreams and hopes. Anarchism is based upon, and grew out of, this process of
              resistance, hope and direct action. In other words, the libertarian elements
              that the oppressed continually produce in their struggles within and against
              hierarchical systems are extrapolated and generalised into what is called
              anarchism. It is these struggles and the anarchistic elements they produce
              which make the end of all forms of hierarchy not only desirable, but possible.
                 So while the negative impact of hierarchy is not surprising, neither is the
              resistance to it. This is because the individual “is not a blank sheet of paper
              on which culture can write its text; he [or she] is an entity charged with
              energy and structured in speciﬁc ways, which, while adapting itself, reacts in
              speciﬁc and ascertainable ways to external conditions.” In this “process of
              adaptation,” people develop “deﬁnite mental and emotional reactions which
              follow from speciﬁc properties” of our nature. [Eric Fromm, Man for
              Himself, p. 23 and p. 22] For example:
                   “Man can adapt himself to slavery, but he reacts to it by lowering
                   his intellectual and moral qualities … Man can adapt himself to
                   cultural conditions which demand the repression of sexual strivings,
                   but in achieving this adaptation he develops … neurotic symptoms.
                   He can adapt to almost any culture pattern, but in so far as these
                   are contradictory to his nature he develops mental and emotional
                   disturbances which force him eventually change these conditions
                   since he cannot change his nature… . If … man could adapt himself
                   to all conditions without ﬁghting those which are against his nature,
                   he would have no history. Human evolution is rooted in man’s
                   adaptability and in certain indestructible qualities of his nature

                   which compel him to search for conditions better adjusted to his
                   intrinsic needs.” [Op. Cit., pp. 22–23]
                So as well as adaptation to hierarchy, there is resistance. This means that
              modern society (capitalism), like any hierarchical society, faces a direct
              contradiction. On the one hand, such systems divide society into a narrow
              stratum of order givers and the vast majority of the population who are
              (oﬀicially) excluded from decision making, who are reduced to carrying out
              (executing) the decisions made by the few. As a result, most people suﬀer
              feelings of alienation and unhappiness. However, in practice, people try and
              overcome this position of powerlessness and so hierarchy produces a struggle
              against itself by those subjected to it. This process goes on all the time, to a
              greater or lesser degree, and is an essential aspect in creating the possibility
              of political consciousness, social change and revolution. People refuse to be
              treated like objects (as required by hierarchical society) and by so doing
              hierarchy creates the possibility for its own destruction.
                For the inequality in wealth and power produced by hierarchies, between
              the powerful and the powerless, between the rich and the poor, has not been
              ordained by god, nature or some other superhuman force. It has been created
              by a speciﬁc social system, its institutions and workings — a system based
              upon authoritarian social relationships which eﬀect us both physically and
              mentally. So there is hope. Just as authoritarian traits are learned, so can they
              be unlearned. As Carole Pateman summarises, the evidence supports the
              argument “that we do learn to participate by participating” and that a
              participatory environment “might also be eﬀective in diminishing tendencies
              toward non-democratic attitudes in the individual.” [Participaton and
              Democratic Theory, p. 105] So oppression reproduces resistance and the
              seeds of its own destruction.
                It is for this reason anarchists stress the importance of self-liberation (see
              section A.2.7) and “support all struggles for partial freedom, because we are
              convinced that one learns through struggle, and that once one begins to enjoy
              a little freedom one ends by wanting it all.” [Malatesta, Errico Malatesta:
              His Life and Ideas, p. 195] By means of direct action (see section J.2),
              people exert themselves and stand up for themselves. This breaks the
              conditioning of hierarchy, breaks the submissiveness which hierarchical social
              relationships both need and produce. Thus the daily struggles against
              oppression “serve as a training camp to develop” a person’s “understanding
              of [their] proper role in life, to cultivate [their] self-reliance and
              independence, teach him [or her] mutual help and co-operation, and make
              him [or her] conscious of [their] responsibility. [They] will learn to decide and
              act on [their] own behalf, not leaving it to leaders or politicians to attend to
              [their] aﬀairs and look out for [their] welfare. It will be [them] who will
              determine, together with [their] fellows … , what they want and what methods
              will best serve their aims.” [Berkman, Op. Cit., p. 206]
                In other words, struggle encourages all the traits hierarchy erodes and,
              consequently, develop the abilities not only to question and resist authority
              but, ultimately, end it once and for all. This means that any struggle changes
              those who take part in it, politicising them and transforming their
              personalities by shaking oﬀ the servile traits produced and required by

              hierarchy. As an example, after the sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, in 1937
              one eye-witness saw how “the auto worker became a diﬀerent human being.
              The women that had participated actively became a diﬀerent type of women
              … They carried themselves with a diﬀerent walk, their heads were high, and
              they had conﬁdence in themselves.” [Genora (Johnson) Dollinger, contained in
              Voices of a People’s History of the United States, Howard Zinn and
              Anthony Arnove (eds.), p. 349] Such changes happen in all struggles (also see
              section J.4.2). Anarchists are not surprised for, as discussed in section J.1 and
              J.2.1, we have long recognised the liberating aspects of social struggle and
              the key role it plays in creating free people and the other preconditions for
              needed for an anarchist society (like the initial social structure — see section
              I.2.3).
                 Needless to say, a hierarchical system like capitalism cannot survive with a
              non-submissive working class and the bosses spend a considerable amount of
              time, energy and resources trying to break the spirits of the working class so
              they will submit to authority (either unwillingly, by fear of being ﬁred, or
              willingly, by fooling them into believing that hierarchy is natural or by
              rewarding subservient behaviour). Unsurprisingly, this never completely
              succeeds and so capitalism is marked by constant struggles between the
              oppressed and oppressor. Some of these struggles succeed, some do not.
              Some are defensive, some are not. Some, like strikes, are visible, other less so
              (such a working slowly and less eﬀiciently than management desires). And
              these struggles are waged by both sides of the hierarchical divide. Those
              subject to hierarchy ﬁght to limit it and increase their autonomy and those
              who exercise authority ﬁght to increase their power over others. Who wins
              varies. The 1960s and 1970s saw a marked increase in victories for the
              oppressed all throughout capitalism but, unfortunately, since the 1980s, as we
              discuss in section C.8.3, there has been a relentless class war conducted by
              the powerful which has succeeded in inﬂicting a series of defeats on working
              class people. Unsurprisingly, the rich have got richer and more powerful
              since.
                 So anarchists take part in the on-going social struggle in society in an
              attempt to end it in the only way possible, the victory of the oppressed. A key
              part of this is to ﬁght for partial freedoms, for minor or major reforms, as this
              strengthens the spirit of revolt and starts the process towards the ﬁnal end of
              hierarchy. In such struggles we stress the autonomy of those involved and see
              them not only as the means of getting more justice and freedom in the current
              unfree system but also as a means of ending the hierarchies they are ﬁghting
              once and for all. Thus, for example, in the class struggle we argue for
              ”[o]rganisation from the bottom up, beginning with the shop and factory, on
              the foundation of the joint interests of the workers everywhere, irrespective of
              trade, race, or country.” [Alexander Berkman, Op. Cit., p. 207] Such an
              organisation, as we discuss in section J.5.2, would be run via workplace
              assemblies and would be the ideal means of replacing capitalist hierarchy in
              industry by genuine economic freedom, i.e. worker’s self-management of
              production (see section I.3). Similarly, in the community we argue for popular
              assemblies (see section J.5.1) as a means of not only combating the power of
              the state but also replaced it with by free, self-managed, communities (see
              section I.5).
281 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
               Thus the current struggle itself creates the bridge between what is and
              what could be:
                   “Assembly and community must arise from within the revolutionary
                   process itself; indeed, the revolutionary process must be the
                   formation of assembly and community, and with it, the destruction
                   of power. Assembly and community must become ‘ﬁghting words,’
                   not distant panaceas. They must be created as modes of struggle
                   against the existing society, not as theoretical or programmatic
                   abstractions.” [Murray Bookchin, Post-Scarcity Anarchism, p.
                   104]
                This is not all. As well as ﬁghting the state and capitalism, we also need
              ﬁght all other forms of oppression. This means that anarchists argue that we
              need to combat social hierarchies like racism and sexism as well as workplace
              hierarchy and economic class, that we need to oppose homophobia and
              religious hatred as well as the political state. Such oppressions and struggles
              are not diversions from the struggle against class oppression or capitalism
              but part and parcel of the struggle for human freedom and cannot be ignored
              without fatally harming it.
                As part of that process, anarchists encourage and support all sections of the
              population to stand up for their humanity and individuality by resisting racist,
              sexist and anti-gay activity and challenging such views in their everyday lives,
              everywhere (as Carole Pateman points out, “sexual domination structures the
              workplace as well as the conjugal home” [The Sexual Contract, p. 142]). It
              means a struggle of all working class people against the internal and external
              tyrannies we face — we must ﬁght against own our prejudices while
              supporting those in struggle against our common enemies, no matter their
              sex, skin colour or sexuality. Lorenzo Kom’boa Ervin words on ﬁghting racism
              are applicable to all forms of oppression:
                   “Racism must be fought vigorously wherever it is found, even if in
                   our own ranks, and even in ones own breast. Accordingly, we must
                   end the system of white skin privilege which the bosses use to split
## the class, and subject racially oppressed workers to superexploitation. White workers, especially those in the Western world,
                   must resist the attempt to use one section of the working class to
## help them advance, while holding back the gains of another
                   segment based on race or nationality. This kind of class opportunism
                   and capitulationism on the part of white labour must be directly
                   challenged and defeated. There can be no workers unity until the
                   system of super-exploitation and world White Supremacy is brought
                   to an end.” [Anarchism and the Black Revolution, p. 128]
                Progress towards equality can and has been made. While it is still true that
              (in the words of Emma Goldman) ”[n]owhere is woman treated according to
              the merit of her work, but rather as a sex” [Red Emma Speaks, p. 177] and
              that education is still patriarchal, with young women still often steered away
              from traditionally “male” courses of study and work (which teaches children
              that men and women are assigned diﬀerent roles in society and sets them up
282 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              to accept these limitations as they grow up) it is also true that the position of
              women, like that of blacks and gays, has improved. This is due to the various
              self-organised, self-liberation movements that have continually developed
              throughout history and these are the key to ﬁghting oppression in the short
              term (and creating the potential for the long term solution of dismantling
              capitalism and the state).
                 Emma Goldman argued that emancipation begins “in [a] woman’s soul.”
              Only by a process of internal emancipation, in which the oppressed get to
              know their own value, respect themselves and their culture, can they be in a
              position to eﬀectively combat (and overcome) external oppression and
              attitudes. Only when you respect yourself can you be in a position to get
              others to respect you. Those men, whites and heterosexuals who are opposed
              to bigotry, inequality and injustice, must support oppressed groups and refuse
              to condone racist, sexist or homophobic attitudes and actions by others or
              themselves. For anarchists, “not a single member of the Labour movement
              may with impunity be discriminated against, suppressed or ignored… Labour
              [and other] organisations must be built on the principle of equal liberty of all
              its members. This equality means that only if each worker is a free and
              independent unit, co-operating with the others from his or her mutual
              interests, can the whole labour organisation work successfully and become
              powerful.” [Lorenzo Kom’boa Ervin, Op. Cit., pp. 127–8]
                 We must all treat people as equals, while at the same time respecting their
              diﬀerences. Diversity is a strength and a source of joy, and anarchists reject
              the idea that equality means conformity. By these methods, of internal selfliberation and solidarity against external oppression, we can ﬁght against
              bigotry. Racism, sexism and homophobia can be reduced, perhaps almost
              eliminated, before a social revolution has occurred by those subject to them
              organising themselves, ﬁghting back autonomously and refusing to be
              subjected to racial, sexual or anti-gay abuse or to allowing others to get away
              with it (which plays an essential role in making others aware of their own
              attitudes and actions, attitudes they may even be blind to!).
                 The example of the Mujeres Libres (Free Women) in Spain during the
              1930s shows what is possible. Women anarchists involved in the C.N.T. and
              F.A.I. organised themselves autonomously to raise the issue of sexism in the
              wider libertarian movement, to increase women’s involvement in libertarian
              organisations and help the process of women’s self-liberation against male
              oppression. Along the way they also had to combat the (all too common) sexist
              attitudes of their “revolutionary” male fellow anarchists. Martha A.
              Ackelsberg’s book Free Women of Spain is an excellent account of this
              movement and the issues it raises for all people concerned about freedom.
              Decades latter, the women’s movement of the 1960s and 1970s did much the
              same thing, aiming to challenge the traditional sexism and patriarchy of
              capitalist society. They, too, formed their own organisations to ﬁght for their
              own needs as a group. Individuals worked together and drew strength for
              their own personal battles in the home and in wider society.
                 Another essential part of this process is for such autonomous groups to
              actively support others in struggle (including members of the dominant race/
              sex/sexuality). Such practical solidarity and communication can, when
              combined with the radicalising eﬀects of the struggle itself on those involved,
283 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              help break down prejudice and bigotry, undermining the social hierarchies
              that oppress us all. For example, gay and lesbian groups supporting the
              1984/5 UK miners’ strike resulted in such groups being given pride of place in
              many miners’ marches. Another example is the great strike by Jewish
              immigrant workers in 1912 in London which occurred at the same time as a
              big London Dock Strike. “The common struggle brought Jewish and nonJewish workers together. Joint strike meetings were held, and the same
              speakers spoke at huge joint demonstrations.” The Jewish strike was a
              success, dealing a “death-blow to the sweatshop system. The English workers
              looked at the Jewish workers with quite diﬀerent eyes after this victory.” Yet
              the London dock strike continued and many dockers’ families were suﬀering
              real wants. The successful Jewish strikers started a campaign “to take some of
              the dockers’ children into their homes.” This practical support “did a great
              deal to strengthen the friendship between Jewish and non-Jewish workers.”
              [Rudolf Rocker, London Years, p. 129 and p. 131] This solidarity was repaid
              in October 1936, when the dockers were at the forefront in stopping Mosley’s
              fascist blackshirts marching through Jewish areas (the famous battle of Cable
              street).
                 For whites, males and heterosexuals, the only anarchistic approach is to
              support others in struggle, refuse to tolerate bigotry in others and to root out
              their own fears and prejudices (while refusing to be uncritical of selfliberation struggles — solidarity does not imply switching your brain oﬀ!).
              This obviously involves taking the issue of social oppression into all working
              class organisations and activity, ensuring that no oppressed group is
              marginalised within them.
                 Only in this way can the hold of these social diseases be weakened and a
              better, non-hierarchical system be created. An injury to one is an injury to all.
              B.2 Why are anarchists against the state?
                As previously noted (see section B.1), anarchists oppose all forms of
              hierarchical authority. Historically, however, they have spent most of their
              time and energy opposing two main forms in particular. One is capitalism, the
              other, the state. These two forms of authority have a symbiotic relationship
              and cannot be easily separated:
                   “[T]he State … and Capitalism are facts and conceptions which we
                   cannot separate from each other. In the course of history these
                   institutions have developed, supporting and reinforcing each other.
                   “They are connected with each other — not as mere accidental coincidences. They are linked together by the links of cause and
                   eﬀect.” [Kropotkin, Evolution and Environment, p. 94]
                In this section, in consequence, as well as explaining why anarchists oppose
              the state, we will necessarily have to analyse the relationship between it and
              capitalism.
                So what is the state? As Malatesta put it, anarchists “have used the word
              State, and still do, to mean the sum total of the political, legislative, judiciary,
284 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              military and ﬁnancial institutions through which the management of their own
              aﬀairs, the control over their personal behaviour, the responsibility for their
              personal safety, are taken away from the people and entrusted to others who,
              by usurpation or delegation, are vested with the power to make laws for
              everything and everybody, and to oblige the people to observe them, if need
              be, by the use of collective force.” [Anarchy, p. 17]
                He continues:
                   “For us, government [or the state] is made up of all the governors;
                   and the governors … are those who have the power to make laws
                   regulating inter-human relations and to see that they are carried out
                   . .. [and] who have the power, to a greater or lesser degree, to make
                   use of the social power, that is of the physical, intellectual and
## economic power of the whole community, in order to oblige
                   everybody to carry out their wishes. And this power, in our opinion,
                   constitutes the principle of government, of authority.” [Op. Cit., p.
                   19]
                Kropotkin presented a similar analysis, arguing that the state “not only
              includes the existence of a power situated above society, but also of a
              territorial concentration as well as the concentration in the hands of a
              few of many functions in the life of societies … A whole mechanism of
              legislation and of policing has to be developed in order to subject some
              classes to the domination of others.” [The State: Its Historic Role, p. 10]
              For Bakunin, all states “are in essence only machines governing the masses
              from above, through … a privileged minority, allegedly knowing the genuine
              interests of the people better than the people themselves.” [The Political
              Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 211] On this subject Murray Bookchin writes:
                   “Minimally, the State is a professional system of social coercion —
                   not merely a system of social administration as it is still naively
                   regarded by the public and by many political theorists. The word
                   ‘professional’ should be emphasised as much as the word ‘coercion.’
                   .. . It is only when coercion is institutionalised into a professional,
                   systematic and organised form of social control — that is, when
                   people are plucked out of their everyday lives in a community and
                   expected not only to ‘administer’ it but to do so with the backing of
                   a monopoly of violence — that we can properly speak of a State.”
                   [Remaking Society, p. 66]
                As Bookchin indicates, anarchists reject the idea that the state is the same
              as society or that any grouping of human beings living and organised
              together is a state. This confusion, as Kropotkin notes, explains why
              “anarchists are generally upbraided for wanting to ‘destroy society’ and of
              advocating a return to ‘the permanent war of each against all.’” Such a
              position “overlook[s] the fact that Man lived in Societies for thousands of
              years before the State had been heard of” and that, consequently, the State
              “is only one of the forms assumed by society in the course of history.” [Op.
              Cit., p. 10]
                The state, therefore, is not just federations of individuals or peoples and so,
285 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              as Malatesta stressed, cannot be used to describe a “human collectively
              gathered together in a particular territory and making up what is called a
              social unit irrespective of the way the way said collectivity are grouped or the
              state of relations between them.” It cannot be “used simply as a synonym for
              society.” [Op. Cit., p. 17] The state is a particular form of social organisation
              based on certain key attributes and so, we argue, “the word ‘State’ … should
              be reserved for those societies with the hierarchical system and
              centralisation.” [Peter Kropotkin, Ethics, p. 317f] As such, the state “is a
              historic, transitory institution, a temporary form of society” and one whose
              “utter extinction” is possible as the “State is not society.” [Bakunin, Michael
              Bakunin: Selected Writings, p. 151]
                 In summary, the state is a speciﬁc way in which human aﬀairs are organised
              in a given area, a way marked by certain institutions which, in turn, have
              certain characteristics. This does not imply, however, that the state is a
              monolithic entity that has been the same from its birth to the present day.
              States vary in many ways, especially in their degree of authoritarianism, in
              the size and power of their bureaucracy and how they organise themselves.
              Thus we have monarchies, oligarchies, theocracies, party dictatorships and
              (more or less) democratic states. We have ancient states, with minimal
              bureaucracy, and modern ones, with enormous bureaucracy.
                 Moreover, anarchists argue that “the political regime … is always an
              expression of the economic regime which exists at the heart of society.” This
              means that regardless of how the state changes, it “continues to be shaped by
              the economic system, of which it is always the expression and, at the same
              time, the consecration and the sustaining force.” Needless to say, there is not
              always an exact match and sometimes “the political regime of a country ﬁnds
              itself lagging behind the economic changes that are taking place, and in that
              case it will abruptly be set aside and remodelled in a way appropriate to the
              economic regime that has been established.” [Kropotkin, Words of a Rebel,
              p. 118]
                 At other times, the state can change its form to protect the economic system
              it is an expression of. Thus we see democracies turn to dictatorships in the
              face of popular revolts and movements. The most obvious examples of
              Pinochet’s Chile, Franco’s Spain, Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s Germany are
              all striking conﬁrmations of Bakunin’s comment that while ”[n]o government
              could serve the economic interests of the bourgeoisie better than a republic,”
              that class would “prefer … military dictatorship” if needed to crush “the
              revolts of the proletariat.” [Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 417]
                 However, as much as the state may change its form it still has certain
              characteristics which identify a social institution as a state. As such, we can
              say that, for anarchists, the state is marked by three things:

## 1. A “monopoly of violence” in a given territorial area;

                2. This violence having a “professional,” institutional nature; and

                3. A hierarchical nature, centralisation of power and initiative into the
## hands of a few.

                Of these three aspects, the last one (its centralised, hierarchical nature) is
286 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              the most important simply because the concentration of power into the hands
              of the few ensures a division of society into government and governed (which
              necessitates the creation of a professional body to enforce that division).
              Hence we ﬁnd Bakunin arguing that ”[w]ith the State there must go also … all
              organisation of social life from the top downward, via legislation and
              government.” [The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 242] In other
              words, “the people was not governing itself.” [Kropotkin, Op. Cit., p. 120]
                This aspect implies the rest. In a state, all the people residing in an area are
              subject to the state, submitting themselves to the individuals who make up
              the institution of authority ruling that territory. To enforce the will of this few,
              they must have a monopoly of force within the territory. As the members of
              the state collectively monopolise political decision making power, they are a
              privileged body separated by its position and status from the rest of the
              population as a whole which means they cannot rely on them to enforce its
              will. This necessities a professional body of some kind to enforce their
              decisions, a separate police force or army rather than the people armed.
                Given this, the division of society into rulers and ruled is the key to what
              constitutes a state. Without such a division, we would not need a monopoly of
              violence and so would simply have an association of equals, unmarked by
              power and hierarchy (such as exists in many stateless “primitive” tribes and
              will exist in a future anarchist society). And, it must be stressed, such a
              division exists even in democratic states as “with the state there is always a
              hierarchical and status diﬀerence between rulers and ruled. Even if it is a
              democracy, where we suppose those who rule today are not rulers tomorrow,
              there are still diﬀerences in status. In a democratic system, only a tiny
              minority will ever have the opportunity to rule and these are invariably drawn
              from the elite.” [Harold Barclay, The State, pp. 23–4]
                Thus, the “essence of government” is that “it is a thing apart, developing its
              own interests” and so is “an institution existing for its own sake, preying upon
              the people, and teaching them whatever will tend to keep it secure in its
              seat.” [Voltairine de Cleyre, The Voltairine de Cleyre Reader, p. 27 and p.
              26] And so “despotism resides not so much in the form of the State or power
              as in the very principle of the State and political power.” [Bakunin, Op. Cit.,
              p. 211]
                As the state is the delegation of power into the hands of the few, it is
              obviously based on hierarchy. This delegation of power results in the elected
              people becoming isolated from the mass of people who elected them and
              outside of their control (see section B.2.4). In addition, as those elected are
              given power over a host of diﬀerent issues and told to decide upon them, a
              bureaucracy soon develops around them to aid in their decision-making and
              enforce those decisions once they have been reached. However, this
              bureaucracy, due to its control of information and its permanency, soon has
              more power than the elected oﬀicials. Therefore “a highly complex state
              machine … leads to the formation of a class especially concerned with state
              management, which, using its acquired experience, begins to deceive the rest
              for its personal advantage.” [Kropotkin, Selected Writings on Anarchism
              and Revolution, p. 61] This means that those who serve the people’s (socalled) servant have more power than those they serve, just as the politician
              has more power than those who elected him. All forms of state-like (i.e.
287 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              hierarchical) organisations inevitably spawn a bureaucracy about them. This
              bureaucracy soon becomes the de facto focal point of power in the structure,
              regardless of the oﬀicial rules.
                This marginalisation and disempowerment of ordinary people (and so the
              empowerment of a bureaucracy) is the key reason for anarchist opposition to
              the state. Such an arrangement ensures that the individual is disempowered,
              subject to bureaucratic, authoritarian rule which reduces the person to an
              object or a number, not a unique individual with hopes, dreams, thoughts and
              feelings. As Proudhon forcefully argued:
                   “To be GOVERNED is to be kept in sight, inspected, spied upon,
                   directed, law-driven, numbered, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached
## at, controlled, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by
                   creatures who have neither the right, nor the wisdom, nor the virtue
                   to do so … To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every
                   transaction, noted, registered, enrolled, taxed, stamped, measured,
                   numbered, assessed, licensed, authorised, admonished, forbidden,
                   reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under the pretext of public
                   utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be placed under
                   contribution, trained, ransomed, exploited, monopolised, extorted,
                   squeezed, mystiﬁed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the
                   ﬁrst word of complaint, to be repressed, ﬁned, despised, harassed,
                   tracked, abused, clubbed, disarmed, choked, imprisoned, judged,
                   condemned, shot, deported, sacriﬁced, sold, betrayed; and, to crown
## it all, mocked, ridiculed, outraged, dishonoured. That is
                   government; that is its justice; that is its morality.” [General Idea
                   of the Revolution, p. 294]
                Such is the nature of the state that any act, no matter how evil, becomes
              good if it helps forward the interests of the state and the minorities it
              protects. As Bakunin put it:

## ”The State … is the most ﬂagrant, the most cynical, and the
                   most complete negation of humanity. It shatters the universal
                   solidarity of all men [and women] on the earth, and brings some of
## them into association only for the purpose of destroying,
## conquering, and enslaving all the rest …

                   “This ﬂagrant negation of humanity which constitutes the very
                   essence of the State is, from the standpoint of the State, its supreme
                   duty and its greatest virtue … Thus, to oﬀend, to oppress, to despoil,
                   to plunder, to assassinate or enslave one’s fellowman [or woman] is
                   ordinarily regarded as a crime. In public life, on the other hand,
                   from the standpoint of patriotism, when these things are done for
                   the greater glory of the State, for the preservation or the extension
                   of its power, it is all transformed into duty and virtue. And this
                   virtue, this duty, are obligatory for each patriotic citizen; everyone if
                   supposed to exercise them not against foreigners only but against
                   one’s own fellow citizens … whenever the welfare of the State
## demands it.

288 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   “This explains why, since the birth of the State, the world of politics
## has always been and continues to be the stage for unlimited
                   rascality and brigandage … This explains why the entire history of
                   ancient and modern states is merely a series of revolting crimes;
                   why kings and ministers, past and present, of all times and all
                   countries — statesmen, diplomats, bureaucrats, and warriors — if
                   judged from the standpoint of simply morality and human justice,
                   have a hundred, a thousand times over earned their sentence to
                   hard labour or to the gallows. There is no horror, no cruelty,
                   sacrilege, or perjury, no imposture, no infamous transaction, no
                   cynical robbery, no bold plunder or shabby betrayal that has not
                   been or is not daily being perpetrated by the representatives of the
## states, under no other pretext than those elastic words, so
                   convenient and yet so terrible: ‘for reasons of state.’” [Bakunin
                   on Anarchism, pp. 133–4]
                 Governments habitually lie to the people they claim to represent in order to
              justify wars, reductions (if not the destruction) of civil liberties and human
              rights, policies which beneﬁt the few over the many, and other crimes. And if
              its subjects protest, the state will happily use whatever force deemed
              necessary to bring the rebels back in line (labelling such repression “law and
              order”). Such repression includes the use of death squads, the
              institutionalisation of torture, collective punishments, indeﬁnite
              imprisonment, and other horrors at the worse extremes.
                 Little wonder the state usually spends so much time ensuring the
              (mis)education of its population — only by obscuring (when not hiding) its
              actual practises can it ensure the allegiance of those subject to it. The history
              of the state could be viewed as nothing more than the attempts of its subjects
              to control it and bind it to the standards people apply to themselves.
                 Such behaviour is not surprising, given that Anarchists see the state, with
              its vast scope and control of deadly force, as the “ultimate” hierarchical
              structure, suﬀering from all the negative characteristics associated with
              authority described in the last section. “Any loical and straightforward theory
              of the State,” argued Bakunin, “is essentially founded upon the principle of
              authority, that is the eminently theological, metaphysical, and political idea
              that the masses, always incapable of governing themselves, must at all times
              submit to the beneﬁcent yoke of a wisdom and a justice imposed upon them,
              in some way or other, from above.” [Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 142] Such a
              system of authority cannot help being centralised, hierarchical and
              bureaucratic in nature. And because of its centralised, hierarchical, and
              bureaucratic nature, the state becomes a great weight over society,
              restricting its growth and development and making popular control
              impossible. As Bakunin put it:
                   “the so-called general interests of society supposedly represented
                   by the State … [are] in reality … the general and permanent
                   negation of the positive interests of the regions, communes, and
                   associations, and a vast number of individuals subordinated to the
                   State … [in which] all the best aspirations, all the living forces of a
## country, are sanctimoniously immolated and interred.” [The

                   Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 207]
                 That is by no means the end of it. As well as its obvious hierarchical form,
              anarchists object to the state for another, equally important, reason. This is its
              role as a defender of the economically dominant class in society against the
              rest of it (i.e. from the working class). This means, under the current system,
              the capitalists “need the state to legalise their methods of robbery, to protect
              the capitalist system.” [Berkman, What is Anarchism?, p. 16] The state, as
              we discuss in section B.2.1, is the defender of private property (see section
              B.3 for a discussion of what anarchists mean by that term and how it diﬀers
              from individual possessions).
                 This means that in capitalist states the mechanisms of state domination are
              controlled by and for a corporate elite (and hence the large corporations are
              often considered to belong to a wider “state-complex”). Indeed, as we discuss
              in more depth in section F.8, the “State has been, and still is, the main pillar
              and the creator, direct and indirect, of Capitalism and its powers over the
              masses.” [Kropotkin, Evolution and Environment, p. 97] Section B.2.3
              indicates how this is domination is achieved in a representative democracy.
                 However this does not mean anarchists think that the state is purely an
              instrument of economic class rule. As Malatesta argued, while “a special class
              (government) which, provided with the necessary means of repression, exists
              to legalise and protect the owning class from the demands of the workers … it
              uses the powers at its disposal to create privileges for itself and to subject, if
              it can, the owning class itself as well.” [Errico Malatesta: His Life and
              Ideas, p. 183] Thus the state has interests of its own, distinct from and
              sometimes in opposition to the economic ruling elite. This means that both
              state and capitalism needs to be abolished, for the former is as much a
              distinct (and oppressive and exploitative) class as the former. This aspects of
              the state is discussed in section B.2.6.
                 As part of its role as defender of capitalism, the state is involved in not only
              in political domination but also in economic domination. This domination can
              take diﬀerent forms, varying from simply maintaining capitalist property
              rights to actually owning workplaces and exploiting labour directly. Thus
              every state intervenes in the economy in some manner. While this is usually to
              favour the economically dominant, it can also occur try and mitigate the antisocial nature of the capitalist market and regulate its worse abuses. We
              discuss this aspect of the state in section B.2.2.
                 Needless to say, the characteristics which mark a state did not develop by
              chance. As we discuss in section H.3.7, anarchists have an evolutionary
              perspective on the state. This means that it has a hierarchical nature in order
              to facilitate the execution of its role, its function. As sections B.2.4 and B.2.5
              indicate, the centralisation that marks a state is required to secure elite rule
              and was deliberately and actively created to do so. This means that states, by
              their very nature, are top-down institutions which centralise power into a few
              hands and, as a consequence, a state “with its traditions, its hierarchy, and its
              narrow nationalism” can “not be utilised as an instrument of emancipation.”
              [Kropotkon, Evolution and Environment, p. 78] It is for this reason that
              anarchists aim to create a new form of social organisation and life, a
              decentralised one based on decision making from the bottom-up and the
290 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              elimination of hierarchy.
                 Finally, we must point out that anarchists, while stressing what states have
              in common, do recognise that some forms of the state are better than others.
              Democracies, for example, tend to be less oppressive than dictatorships or
              monarchies. As such it would be false to conclude that anarchists, “in
              criticising the democratic government we thereby show our preference for
              the monarchy. We are ﬁrmly convinced that the most imperfect republic is a
              thousand times better than the most enlightened monarchy.” [Bakunin,
              Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 144] However, this does not change the nature or
              role of the state. Indeed, what liberties we have are not dependent on the
              goodwill of the state but rather the result of people standing against it and
              exercising their autonomy. Left to itself, the state would soon turn the
              liberties and rights it says it defends into dead-laws — things that look good in
              print but not practised in real life.
                 So in the rest of this section we will discuss the state, its role, its impact on
              a society’s freedom and who beneﬁts from its existence. Kropotkin’s classic
              essay, The State: It’s Historic Role is recommended for further reading on
              this subject. Harold Barclay’s The State is a good overview of the origins of
              the state, how it has changed over the millenniums and the nature of the
              modern state.
              B.2.1 What is main function of the state?
                The main function of the state is to guarantee the existing social
              relationships and their sources within a given society through centralised
              power and a monopoly of violence. To use Malatesta’s words, the state is
              basically “the property owners’ gendarme.” This is because there are “two
              ways of oppressing men [and women]: either directly by brute force, by
              physical violence; or indirectly by denying them the means of life and thus
              reducing them to a state of surrender.” The owning class, “gradually
              concentrating in their hands the means of production, the real sources of life,
              agriculture, industry, barter, etc., end up establishing their own power which,
              by reason of the superiority of its means … always ends by more or less
              openly subjecting the political power, which is the government, and making it
              into its own gendarme.” [Op. Cit., p. 23, p. 21 and p. 22]
                The state, therefore, is “the political expression of the economic structure”
              of society and, therefore, “the representative of the people who own or
              control the wealth of the community and the oppressor of the people who do
              the work which creates the wealth.” [Nicholas Walter, About Anarchism, p.
              37] It is therefore no exaggeration to say that the state is the extractive
              apparatus of society’s parasites.
                The state ensures the exploitative privileges of its ruling elite by protecting
              certain economic monopolies from which its members derive their wealth. The
              nature of these economic privileges varies over time. Under the current
              system, this means defending capitalist property rights (see section B.3.2).
              This service is referred to as “protecting private property” and is said to be
              one of the two main functions of the state, the other being to ensure that
              individuals are “secure in their persons.” However, although this second aim
291 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              is professed, in reality most state laws and institutions are concerned with the
              protection of property (for the anarchist deﬁnition of “property” see section
              B.3.1).
                 From this we may infer that references to the “security of persons,” “crime
              prevention,” etc., are mostly rationalisations of the state’s existence and
              smokescreens for its perpetuation of elite power and privileges. This does not
              mean that the state does not address these issues. Of course it does, but, to
              quote Kropotkin, any “laws developed from the nucleus of customs useful to
              human communities … have been turned to account by rulers to sanctify their
              own domination.” of the people, and maintained only by the fear of
              punishment.” [Anarchism, p. 215]
                 Simply put, if the state “presented nothing but a collection of prescriptions
              serviceable to rulers, it would ﬁnd some diﬀiculty in insuring acceptance and
              obedience” and so the law reﬂects customs “essential to the very being of
              society” but these are “cleverly intermingled with usages imposed by the
              ruling caste and both claim equal respect from the crowd.” Thus the state’s
              laws have a “two-fold character.” While its “origin is the desire of the ruling
              class to give permanence to customs imposed by themselves for their own
              advantage” it also passes into law “customs useful to society, customs which
              have no need of law to insure respect” — unlike those “other customs useful
              only to rulers, injurious to the mass of the people, and maintained only by the
              fear of punishment.” [Kropotkin, Op. Cit., pp. 205–6] To use an obvious
              example, we ﬁnd the state using the defence of an individual’s possessions as
              the rationale for imposing capitalist private property rights upon the general
              public and, consequently, defending the elite and the source of its wealth and
              power against those subject to it.
                 Moreover, even though the state does take a secondary interest in
              protecting the security of persons (particularly elite persons), the vast
              majority of crimes against persons are motivated by poverty and alienation
              due to state-supported exploitation and also by the desensitisation to violence
              created by the state’s own violent methods of protecting private property. In
              other words, the state rationalises its existence by pointing to the social evils
              it itself helps to create (either directly or indirectly). Hence, anarchists
              maintain that without the state and the crime-engendering conditions to
              which it gives rise, it would be possible for decentralised, voluntary
              community associations to deal compassionately (not punitively) with the few
              incorrigibly violent people who might remain (see section I.5.8).
                 Anarchists think it is pretty clear what the real role of the modern state is.
              It represents the essential coercive mechanisms by which capitalism and the
              authority relations associated with private property are sustained. The
              protection of property is fundamentally the means of assuring the social
              domination of owners over non-owners, both in society as a whole and in the
              particular case of a speciﬁc boss over a speciﬁc group of workers. Class
              domination is the authority of property owners over those who use that
              property and it is the primary function of the state to uphold that domination
              (and the social relationships that generate it). In Kropotkin’s words, “the rich
              perfectly well know that if the machinery of the State ceased to protect them,
              their power over the labouring classes would be gone immediately.”
              [Evolution and Environment, p. 98] Protecting private property and
292 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              upholding class domination are the same thing.
                The historian Charles Beard makes a similar point:
                   “Inasmuch as the primary object of a government, beyond mere
                   repression of physical violence, is the making of the rules which
## determine the property relations of members of society, the
## dominant classes whose rights are thus to be protected must
                   perforce obtain from the government such rules as are consonant
                   with the larger interests necessary to the continuance of their
                   economic processes, or they must themselves control the organs of
                   government.” [“An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution,”
                   quoted by Howard Zinn, Op. Cit., p. 89]
                This role of the state — to protect capitalism and the property, power and
              authority of the property owner — was also noticed by Adam Smith:
                   ”[T]he inequality of fortune … introduces among men a degree of
                   authority and subordination which could not possibly exist before. It
                   thereby introduces some degree of that civil government which is
                   indispensably necessary for its own preservation … [and] to
                   maintain and secure that authority and subordination. The rich, in
                   particular, are necessarily interested to support that order of things
## which can alone secure them in the possession of their own
                   advantages. Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of
                   superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that
## men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the
                   possession of theirs … [T]he maintenance of their lesser authority
                   depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their
                   subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in
                   subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who
                   feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the
                   authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able
                   to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil
                   government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is
                   in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of
                   those who have some property against those who have none at all.”
                   [The Wealth of Nations, book 5, pp. 412–3]
                This is reﬂected in both the theory and history of the modern state.
              Theorists of the liberal state like John Locke had no qualms about developing
              a theory of the state which placed the defence of private property at its heart.
              This perspective was reﬂected in the American Revolution. For example, there
              is the words of John Jay (the ﬁrst chief justice of the Supreme Court), namely
              that “the people who own the country ought to govern it.” [quoted by Noam
              Chomksy, Understanding Power, p. 315] This was the maxim of the
              Founding Fathers of American “democracy” and it has continued ever since.
                So, in a nutshell, the state is the means by which the ruling class rules.
              Hence Bakunin:
                   “The State is authority, domination, and force, organised by the
293 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   property-owning and so-called enlightened classes against the
                   masses .. . the State’s domination … [ensures] that of the privileged
                   classes who it solely represents.” [The Basic Bakunin, p. 140]
                Under the current system, this means that the state “constitutes the chief
              bulwark of capital” because of its “centralisation, law (always written by a
              minority in the interest of that minority), and courts of justice (established
              mainly for the defence of authority and capital).” Thus it is “the mission of all
              governments … is to protect and maintain by force the … privileges of the
              possessing classes.” Consequently, while ”[i]n the struggle between the
              individual and the State, anarchism … takes the side of the individual as
              against the State, of society against the authority which oppresses it,”
              anarchists are well aware that the state does not exist above society,
              independent of the classes which make it up. [Kropotkin, Anarchism, pp.
              149–50, p. 214 and pp. 192–3]
                Consequently anarchists reject the idea that the role of the state is simply to
              represent the interests of the people or “the nation.” For “democracy is an
              empty pretence to the extent that production, ﬁnance and commerce — and
              along with them, the political processes of the society as well — are under
              control of ‘concentrations of private power.’ The ‘national interest’ as
              articulated by those who dominate the … societies will be their special
              interests. Under these circumstances, talk of ‘national interest’ can only
              contribute to mystiﬁcation and oppression.” [Noam Chomsky, Radical
              Priorities, p. 52] As we discuss in section D.6, nationalism always reﬂects the
              interests of the elite, not those who make up a nation and, consequently,
              anarchists reject the notion as nothing more than a con (i.e. the use of
              aﬀection of where you live to further ruling class aims and power).
                Indeed, part of the state’s role as defender of the ruling elite is to do so
              internationally, defending “national” (i.e. elite) interests against the elites of
              other nations. Thus we ﬁnd that at the IMF and World Bank, nations are
              represented by ministers who are “closely aligned with particular constituents
              within their countries. The trade ministers reﬂect the concerns of the
              business community” while the “ﬁnance ministers and central bank governors
              are closely tied to ﬁnancial community; they come from ﬁnancial ﬁrms, and
              after their period in service, that is where they return … These individuals see
              the world through the eyes of the ﬁnancial community.” Unsurprisingly, the
              “decisions of any institution naturally reﬂect the perspectives and interests of
              those who make the decisions” and so the “policies of the international
              economic institutions are all too often closely aligned with the commercial
              and ﬁnancial interests of those in the advanced industrial countries.” [Joseph
              Stiglitz, Globalisation and its Discontents, pp. 19–20]
                This, it must be stressed, does not change in the so-called democratic state.
              Here, however, the primary function of the state is disguised by the
              “democratic” facade of the representative electoral system, through which it
              is made to appear that the people rule themselves. Thus Bakunin writes that
              the modern state “unites in itself the two conditions necessary for the
              prosperity of the capitalistic economy: State centralisation and the actual
              subjection of … the people … to the minority allegedly representing it but
              actually governing it.” [Op. Cit., p. 210] How this is achieved is discussed in
294 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              section B.2.3.
              B.2.2 Does the state have subsidiary functions?
                 Yes, it does. While, as discussed in the last section, the state is an
              instrument to maintain class rule this does not mean that it is limited to just
              defending the social relationships in a society and the economic and political
              sources of those relationships. No state has ever left its activities at that bare
              minimum. As well as defending the rich, their property and the speciﬁc forms
              of property rights they favoured, the state has numerous other subsidiary
              functions.
                 What these are has varied considerably over time and space and,
              consequently, it would be impossible to list them all. However, why it does is
              more straight forward. We can generalise two main forms of subsidiary
              functions of the state. The ﬁrst one is to boost the interests of the ruling elite
              either nationally or internationally beyond just defending their property. The
              second is to protect society against the negative eﬀects of the capitalist
              market. We will discuss each in turn and, for simplicity and relevance, we will
              concentrate on capitalism (see also section D.1).
                 The ﬁrst main subsidiary function of the state is when it intervenes in
              society to help the capitalist class in some way. This can take obvious forms of
              intervention, such as subsidies, tax breaks, non-bid government contracts,
              protective tariﬀs to old, ineﬀicient, industries, giving actual monopolies to
              certain ﬁrms or individuals, bailouts of corporations judged by state
              bureaucrats as too important to let fail, and so on. However, the state
              intervenes far more than that and in more subtle ways. Usually it does so to
              solve problems that arise in the course of capitalist development and which
              cannot, in general, be left to the market (at least initially). These are designed
              to beneﬁt the capitalist class as a whole rather than just speciﬁc individuals,
              companies or sectors.
                 These interventions have taken diﬀerent forms in diﬀerent times and
              include state funding for industry (e.g. military spending); the creation of
              social infrastructure too expensive for private capital to provide (railways,
              motorways); the funding of research that companies cannot aﬀord to
              undertake; protective tariﬀs to protect developing industries from more
              eﬀicient international competition (the key to successful industrialisation as it
              allows capitalists to rip-oﬀ consumers, making them rich and increasing funds
              available for investment); giving capitalists preferential access to land and
              other natural resources; providing education to the general public that
              ensures they have the skills and attitude required by capitalists and the state
              (it is no accident that a key thing learned in school is how to survive boredom,
              being in a hierarchy and to do what it orders); imperialist ventures to create
              colonies or client states (or protect citizen’s capital invested abroad) in order
              to create markets or get access to raw materials and cheap labour;
              government spending to stimulate consumer demand in the face of recession
              and stagnation; maintaining a “natural” level of unemployment that can be
              used to discipline the working class, so ensuring they produce more, for less;
              manipulating the interest rate in order to try and reduce the eﬀects of the

              business cycle and undermine workers’ gains in the class struggle.
                These actions, and others like it, ensures that a key role of the state within
              capitalism “is essentially to socialise risk and cost, and to privatise power and
              proﬁt.” Unsurprisingly, “with all the talk about minimising the state, in the
              OECD countries the state continues to grow relative to GNP.” [Noam
              Chomsky, Rogue States, p. 189] Hence David Deleon:
                   “Above all, the state remains an institution for the continuance of
                   dominant socioeconomic relations, whether through such agencies
                   as the military, the courts, politics or the police … Contemporary
                   states have acquired … less primitive means to reinforce their
                   property systems [than state violence — which is always the means
                   of last, often ﬁrst, resort]. States can regulate, moderate or resolve
                   tensions in the economy by preventing the bankruptcies of key
                   corporations, manipulating the economy through interest rates,
                   supporting hierarchical ideology through tax beneﬁts for churches
                   and schools, and other tactics. In essence, it is not a neutral
                   institution; it is powerfully for the status quo. The capitalist state,
                   for example, is virtually a gyroscope centred in capital, balancing
                   the system. If one sector of the economy earns a level of proﬁt, let
                   us say, that harms the rest of the system — such as oil producers’
                   causing public resentment and increased manufacturing costs — the
                   state may redistribute some of that proﬁt through taxation, or oﬀer
                   encouragement to competitors.” [“Anarchism on the origins and
                   functions of the state: some basic notes”, Reinventing Anarchy,
                   pp. 71–72]
                In other words, the state acts to protect the long-term interests of the
              capitalist class as a whole (and ensure its own survival) by protecting the
              system. This role can and does clash with the interests of particular capitalists
              or even whole sections of the ruling class (see section B.2.6). But this conﬂict
              does not change the role of the state as the property owners’ policeman.
              Indeed, the state can be considered as a means for settling (in a peaceful and
              apparently independent manner) upper-class disputes over what to do to keep
              the system going.
                This subsidiary role, it must be stressed, is no accident, It is part and parcel
              capitalism. Indeed, “successful industrial societies have consistently relied on
              departures from market orthodoxies, while condemning their victims [at home
              and abroad] to market discipline.” [Noam Chomsky, World Orders, Old and
              New, p. 113] While such state intervention grew greatly after the Second
              World War, the role of the state as active promoter of the capitalist class
              rather than just its passive defender as implied in capitalist ideology (i.e. as
              defender of property) has always been a feature of the system. As Kropotkin
              put it:
                   “every State reduces the peasants and the industrial workers to a
                   life of misery, by means of taxes, and through the monopolies it
                   creates in favour of the landlords, the cotton lords, the railway
                   magnates, the publicans, and the like … we need only to look round,

                   constituting monopolies in favour of capitalists at home, and still
                   more in conquered lands [which are part of their empires].”
                   [Evolution and Environment, p. 97]
                 By “monopolies,” it should be noted, Kropotkin meant general privileges
              and beneﬁts rather than giving a certain ﬁrm total control over a market. This
              continues to this day by such means as, for example, privatising industries but
              providing them with state subsidies or by (mis-labelled) “free trade”
              agreements which impose protectionist measures such as intellectual
              property rights on the world market.
                 All this means that capitalism has rarely relied on purely economic power to
              keep the capitalists in their social position of dominance (either nationally, visà-vis the working class, or internationally, vis-à-vis competing foreign elites).
              While a “free market” capitalist regime in which the state reduces its
              intervention to simply protecting capitalist property rights has been
              approximated on a few occasions, this is not the standard state of the system
              — direct force, i.e. state action, almost always supplements it.
                 This is most obviously the case during the birth of capitalist production.
              Then the bourgeoisie wants and uses the power of the state to “regulate”
              wages (i.e. to keep them down to such levels as to maximise proﬁts and force
              people attend work regularly), to lengthen the working day and to keep the
              labourer dependent on wage labour as their own means of income (by such
              means as enclosing land, enforcing property rights on unoccupied land, and
              so forth). As capitalism is not and has never been a “natural” development in
              society, it is not surprising that more and more state intervention is required
              to keep it going (and if even this was not the case, if force was essential to
              creating the system in the ﬁrst place, the fact that it latter can survive
              without further direct intervention does not make the system any less statist).
              As such, “regulation” and other forms of state intervention continue to be
              used in order to skew the market in favour of the rich and so force working
              people to sell their labour on the bosses terms.
                 This form of state intervention is designed to prevent those greater evils
              which might threaten the eﬀiciency of a capitalist economy or the social and
              economic position of the bosses. It is designed not to provide positive beneﬁts
              for those subject to the elite (although this may be a side-eﬀect). Which brings
              us to the other kind of state intervention, the attempts by society, by means of
              the state, to protect itself against the eroding eﬀects of the capitalist market
              system.
                 Capitalism is an inherently anti-social system. By trying to treat labour
              (people) and land (the environment) as commodities, it has to break down
              communities and weaken eco-systems. This cannot but harm those subject to
              it and, as a consequence, this leads to pressure on government to intervene to
              mitigate the most damaging eﬀects of unrestrained capitalism. Therefore, on
              one side there is the historical movement of the market, a movement that has
              not inherent limit and that therefore threatens society’s very existence. On
              the other there is society’s natural propensity to defend itself, and therefore
              to create institutions for its protection. Combine this with a desire for justice
              on behalf of the oppressed along with opposition to the worse inequalities and
              abuses of power and wealth and we have the potential for the state to act to

              combat the worse excesses of the system in order to keep the system as a
              whole going. After all, the government “cannot want society to break up, for it
              would mean that it and the dominant class would be deprived of the sources
              of exploitation.” [Malatesta, Op. Cit., p. 25]
                Needless to say, the thrust for any system of social protection usually comes
              from below, from the people most directly aﬀected by the negative eﬀects of
              capitalism. In the face of mass protests the state may be used to grant
              concessions to the working class in cases where not doing so would threaten
              the integrity of the system as a whole. Thus, social struggle is the dynamic for
              understanding many, if not all, of the subsidiary functions acquired by the
              state over the years (this applies to pro-capitalist functions as these are
              usually driven by the need to bolster the proﬁts and power of capitalists at the
              expense of the working class).
                State legislation to set the length of the working day is an obvious example
              this. In the early period of capitalist development, the economic position of
              the capitalists was secure and, consequently, the state happily ignored the
              lengthening working day, thus allowing capitalists to appropriate more
              surplus value from workers and increase the rate of proﬁt without
              interference. Whatever protests erupted were handled by troops. Later,
              however, after workers began to organise on a wider and wider scale,
              reducing the length of the working day became a key demand around which
              revolutionary socialist fervour was developing. In order to defuse this threat
              (and socialist revolution is the worst-case scenario for the capitalist), the state
              passed legislation to reduce the length of the working day.
                Initially, the state was functioning purely as the protector of the capitalist
              class, using its powers simply to defend the property of the few against the
              many who used it (i.e. repressing the labour movement to allow the capitalists
              to do as they liked). In the second period, the state was granting concessions
              to the working class to eliminate a threat to the integrity of the system as a
              whole. Needless to say, once workers’ struggle calmed down and their
              bargaining position reduced by the normal workings of market (see section
              B.4.3), the legislation restricting the working day was happily ignored and
              became “dead laws.”
                This suggests that there is a continuing tension and conﬂict between the
              eﬀorts to establish, maintain, and spread the “free market” and the eﬀorts to
              protect people and society from the consequences of its workings. Who wins
              this conﬂict depends on the relative strength of those involved (as does the
              actual reforms agreed to). Ultimately, what the state concedes, it can also
              take back. Thus the rise and fall of the welfare state — granted to stop more
              revolutionary change (see section D.1.3), it did not fundamentally challenge
              the existence of wage labour and was useful as a means of regulating
              capitalism but was “reformed” (i.e. made worse, rather than better) when it
              conﬂicted with the needs of the capitalist economy and the ruling elite felt
              strong enough to do so.
                Of course, this form of state intervention does not change the nature nor
              role of the state as an instrument of minority power. Indeed, that nature
              cannot help but shape how the state tries to implement social protection and
              so if the state assumes functions it does so as much in the immediate interest
              of the capitalist class as in the interest of society in general. Even where it

              takes action under pressure from the general population or to try and mend
              the harm done by the capitalist market, its class and hierarchical character
              twists the results in ways useful primarily to the capitalist class or itself. This
              can be seen from how labour legislation is applied, for example. Thus even the
              “good” functions of the state are penetrated with and dominated by the
              state’s hierarchical nature. As Malatesta forcefully put it:
                   “The basic function of government … is always that of oppressing
                   and exploiting the masses, of defending the oppressors and the
                   exploiters … It is true that to these basic functions … other
                   functions have been added in the course of history … hardly ever
## has a government existed … which did not combine with its
                   oppressive and plundering activities others which were useful … to
                   social life. But this does not detract from the fact that government is
                   by nature oppressive … and that it is in origin and by its attitude,
                   inevitably inclined to defend and strengthen the dominant class;
                   indeed it conﬁrms and aggravates the position … [I]t is enough to
                   understand how and why it carries out these functions to ﬁnd the
## practical evidence that whatever governments do is always
                   motivated by the desire to dominate, and is always geared to
                   defending, extending and perpetuating its privileges and those of
                   the class of which it is both the representative and defender.” [Op.
                   Cit., pp. 23–4]
                This does not mean that these reforms should be abolished (the alternative
              is often worse, as neo-liberalism shows), it simply recognises that the state is
              not a neutral body and cannot be expected to act as if it were. Which,
              ironically, indicates another aspect of social protection reforms within
              capitalism: they make for good PR. By appearing to care for the interests of
              those harmed by capitalism, the state can obscure it real nature:
                   “A government cannot maintain itself for long without hiding its true
                   nature behind a pretence of general usefulness; it cannot impose
                   respect for the lives of the privileged if it does not appear to
                   demand respect for all human life; it cannot impose acceptance of
                   the privileges of the few if it does not pretend to be the guardian of
                   the rights of all.” [Malatesta, Op. Cit., p. 24]
                Obviously, being an instrument of the ruling elite, the state can hardly be
              relied upon to control the system which that elite run. As we discuss in the
              next section, even in a democracy the state is run and controlled by the
              wealthy making it unlikely that pro-people legislation will be introduced or
              enforced without substantial popular pressure. That is why anarchists favour
              direct action and extra-parliamentary organising (see sections J.2 and J.5 for
              details). Ultimately, even basic civil liberties and rights are the product of
              direct action, of “mass movements among the people” to “wrest these rights
              from the ruling classes, who would never have consented to them voluntarily.”
              [Rocker, Anarcho-Syndicalism, p. 75]
                Equally obviously, the ruling elite and its defenders hate any legislation it
              does not favour — while, of course, remaining silent on its own use of the
299 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              state. As Benjamin Tucker pointed out about the “free market” capitalist
              Herbert Spencer, “amid his multitudinous illustrations … of the evils of
              legislation, he in every instance cites some law passed ostensibly at least to
              protect labour, alleviating suﬀering, or promote the people’s welfare… But
              never once does he call attention to the far more deadly and deep-seated evils
              growing out of the innumerable laws creating privilege and sustaining
              monopoly.” [The Individualist Anarchists, p. 45] Such hypocrisy is
              staggering, but all too common in the ranks of supporters of “free market”
              capitalism.
                 Finally, it must be stressed that none of these subsidiary functions implies
              that capitalism can be changed through a series of piecemeal reforms into a
              benevolent system that primarily serves working class interests. To the
              contrary, these functions grow out of, and supplement, the basic role of the
              state as the protector of capitalist property and the social relations they
              generate — i.e. the foundation of the capitalist’s ability to exploit. Therefore
              reforms may modify the functioning of capitalism but they can never threaten
              its basis.
                 In summary, while the level and nature of statist intervention on behalf of
              the employing classes may vary, it is always there. No matter what activity it
              conducts beyond its primary function of protecting private property, what
              subsidiary functions it takes on, the state always operates as an instrument of
              the ruling class. This applies even to those subsidiary functions which have
              been imposed on the state by the general public — even the most popular
              reform will be twisted to beneﬁt the state or capital, if at all possible. This is
              not to dismiss all attempts at reform as irrelevant, it simply means
              recognising that we, the oppressed, need to rely on our own strength and
              organisations to improve our circumstances.
              B.2.3 How does the ruling class maintain control of
              the state?
                In some systems, it is obvious how economic dominant minorities control
              the state. In feudalism, for example, the land was owned by the feudal lords
              who exploited the peasantry directly. Economic and political power were
              merged into the same set of hands, the landlords. Absolutism saw the
              monarch bring the feudal lords under his power and the relative decentralised
              nature of feudalism was replaced by a centralised state.
                It was this centralised state system which the raising bourgeoisie took as
              the model for their state. The King was replaced by a Parliament, which was
              initially elected on a limited suﬀrage. In this initial form of capitalist state, it
              is (again) obvious how the elite maintain control of the state machine. As the
              vote was based on having a minimum amount of property, the poor were
              eﬀectively barred from having any (oﬀicial) say in what the government did.
              This exclusion was theorised by philosophers like John Locke — the working
              masses were considered to be an object of state policy rather than part of the
              body of people (property owners) who nominated the government. In this
              perspective the state was like a joint-stock company. The owning class were
              the share-holders who nominated the broad of directors and the mass of the

              population were the workers who had no say in determining the management
              personnel and were expected to follow orders.
                As would be expected, this system was mightily disliked by the majority who
              were subjected to it. Such a “classical liberal” regime was rule by an alien,
              despotic power, lacking popular legitimacy, and utterly unaccountable to the
              general population. It is quite evident that a government elected on a limited
              franchise could not be trusted to treat those who owned no real property with
              equal consideration. It was predictable that the ruling elite would use the
              state they controlled to further their own interests and to weaken potential
              resistance to their social, economic and political power. Which is precisely
              what they did do, while masking their power under the guise of “good
              governance” and “liberty.” Moreover, limited suﬀrage, like absolutism, was
              considered an aﬀront to liberty and individual dignity by many of those
              subject to it.
                Hence the call for universal suﬀrage and opposition to property
              qualiﬁcations for the franchise. For many radicals (including Marx and
              Engels) such a system would mean that the working classes would hold
              “political power” and, consequently, be in a position to end the class system
              once and for all. Anarchists were not convinced, arguing that “universal
              suﬀrage, considered in itself and applied in a society based on economic and
              social inequality, will be nothing but a swindle and snare for the people” and
              “the surest way to consolidate under the mantle of liberalism and justice the
              permanent domination of the people by the owning classes, to the detriment
              of popular liberty.” Consequently, anarchists denied that it “could be used by
              the people for the conquest of economic and social equality. It must always
              and necessarily be an instrument hostile to the people, one which supports
              the de facto dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.” [Bakunin, Bakunin on
              Anarchism, p. 224]
                Due to popular mass movements form below, the vote was won by the male
              working classes and, at a later stage, women. While the elite fought long and
              hard to retain their privileged position they were defeated. Sadly, the history
              of universal suﬀrage proven the anarchists right. Even allegedly “democratic”
              capitalist states are in eﬀect dictatorships of the propertariat. The political
              history of modern times can be summarised by the rise of capitalist power, the
              rise, due to popular movements, of (representative) democracy and the
              continued success of the former to undermine and control the latter.
                This is achieved by three main processes which combine to eﬀectively deter
              democracy. These are the wealth barrier, the bureaucracy barrier and, lastly,
              the capital barrier. Each will be discussed in turn and all ensure that
              “representative democracy” remains an “organ of capitalist domination.”
              [Kropotkin, Words of a Rebel, p. 127]
                The wealth barrier is the most obvious. It takes money to run for oﬀice. In
              1976, the total spent on the US Presidential election was $66.9 million. In
              1984, it was $103.6 million and in 1996 it was $239.9 million. At the dawn of
              the 21st century, these ﬁgures had increased yet again. 2000 saw $343.1
              spent and 2004, $717.9 million. Most of this money was spent by the two main
              candidates. In 2000, Republican George Bush spent a massive $185,921,855
              while his Democratic rival Al Gore spent only $120,031,205. Four years later,
              Bush spent $345,259,155 while John Kerry managed a mere $310,033,347.

                Other election campaigns are also enormously expensive. In 2000, the
              average winning candidate for a seat in the US House of Representatives
              spent $816,000 while the average willing senator spent $7 million. Even local
              races require signiﬁcant amounts of fundraising. One candidate for the Illinois
              House raised over $650,000 while another candidate for the Illinois Supreme
              Court raised $737,000. In the UK, similarly prohibitive amounts were spent.
              In the 2001 general election the Labour Party spent a total of £10,945,119,
              the Tories £12,751,813 and the Liberal Democrats (who came a distant third)
              just £1,361,377.
                To get this sort of money, wealthy contributors need to be found and wooed,
              in other words promised that that their interests will be actively looked after.
              While, in theory, it is possible to raise large sums from small contributions in
              practice this is diﬀicult. To raise $1 million you need to either convince 50
              millionaires to give you $20,000 or 20,000 people to fork out $50. Given that
              for the elite $20,000 is pocket money, it is hardly surprising that politicians
              aim for winning over the few, not the many. Similarly with corporations and
              big business. It is far easier and more eﬀicient in time and energy to
              concentrate on the wealthy few (whether individuals or companies).
                It is obvious: whoever pays the piper calls the tune. And in capitalism, this
              means the wealthy and business. In the US corporate campaign donations and
              policy paybacks have reached unprecedented proportions. The vast majority
              of large campaign donations are, not surprisingly, from corporations. Most of
              the wealthy individuals who give large donations to the candidates are CEOs
              and corporate board members. And, just to be sure, many companies give to
              more than one party.
                Unsurprisingly, corporations and the rich expect their investments to get a
              return. This can be seen from George W. Bush’s administration. His election
              campaigns were beholden to the energy industry (which has backed him since
              the beginning of his career as Governor of Texas). The disgraced corporation
              Enron (and its CEO Kenneth Lay) were among Bush’s largest contributors in
              2000. Once in power, Bush backed numerous policies favourable to that
              industry (such as rolling back environmental regulation on a national level as
              he had done in Texas). His supporters in Wall Street were not surprised that
              Bush tried to privatise Social Security. Nor were the credit card companies
              when the Republicans tighten the noose on bankrupt people in 2005. By
              funding Bush, these corporations ensured that the government furthered their
              interests rather than the people who voted in the election.
                This means that as a “consequence of the distribution of resources and
              decision-making power in the society at large … the political class and the
              cultural managers typically associate themselves with the sectors that
              dominate the private economy; they are either drawn directly from those
              sectors or expect to join them.” [Chomsky, Necessary Illusions, p. 23] This
              can be seen from George W. Bush’s quip at an elite fund-raising gala during
              the 2000 Presidential election: “This is an impressive crowd — the haves and
              the have-mores. Some people call you the elites; I call you my base.”
              Unsurprisingly:
                   “In the real world, state policy is largely determined by those
                   groups that command resources, ultimately by virtue of their
302 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   ownership and management of the private economy or their status
                   as wealthy professionals. The major decision-making positions in the
## Executive branch of the government are typically ﬁlled by
                   representatives of major corporations, banks and investment ﬁrms,
                   a few law ﬁrms that cater primarily to corporate interests and thus
                   represent the broad interests of owners and managers rather than
                   some parochial interest .. . The Legislative branch is more varied,
                   but overwhelmingly, it is drawn from the business and professional
                   classes.” [Chomsky, On Power and Ideology, pp. 116–7]
                That is not the only tie between politics and business. Many politicians also
              have directorships in companies, interests in companies, shares, land and
              other forms of property income and so forth. Thus they are less like the
              majority of constituents they claim to represent and more like the wealthy
              few. Combine these outside earnings with a high salary (in the UK, MP’s are
              paid more than twice the national average) and politicians can be among the
              richest 1% of the population. Thus not only do we have a sharing of common
              interests the elite, the politicians are part of it. As such, they can hardly be
              said to be representative of the general public and are in a position of having
              a vested interest in legislation on property being voted on.
                Some defend these second jobs and outside investments by saying that it
              keeps them in touch with the outside world and, consequently, makes them
              better politicians. That such an argument is spurious can be seen from the
              fact that such outside interests never involve working in McDonald’s ﬂipping
              burgers or working on an assembly line. For some reason, no politician seeks
              to get a feeling for what life is like for the average person. Yet, in a sense, this
              argument does have a point. Such jobs and income do keep politicians in
              touch with the world of the elite rather than that of the masses and, as the
              task of the state is to protect elite interests, it cannot be denied that this
              sharing of interests and income with the elite can only aid that task!
                Then there is the sad process by which politicians, once they leave politics,
              get jobs in the corporate hierarchy (particularly with the very companies they
              had previously claimed to regulate on behalf of the public). This was termed
              “the revolving door.” Incredibly, this has changed for the worse. Now the
              highest of government oﬀicials arrive directly from the executive oﬀices of
              powerful corporations. Lobbyists are appointed to the jobs whose occupants
              they once vied to inﬂuence. Those who regulate and those supposed to be
              regulated have become almost indistinguishable.
                Thus politicians and capitalists go hand in hand. Wealth selects them, funds
              them and gives them jobs and income when in oﬀice. Finally, once they ﬁnally
              leave politics, they are often given directorships and other jobs in the
              business world. Little wonder, then, that the capitalist class maintains control
              of the state.
                That is not all. The wealth barrier operates indirectly to. This takes many
              forms. The most obvious is in the ability of corporations and the elite to lobby
              politicians. In the US, there is the pervasive power of Washington’s army of
              24,000 registered lobbyists — and the inﬂuence of the corporate interests
              they represent. These lobbyists, whose job it is to convince politicians to vote
              in certain ways to further the interests of their corporate clients help shape
303 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              the political agenda even further toward business interests than it already is.
              This Lobby industry is immense — and exclusively for big business and the
              elite. Wealth ensures that the equal opportunity to garner resources to share
              a perspective and inﬂuence the political progress is monopolised by the few:
              “where are the desperately needed countervailing lobbies to represent the
              interests of average citizens? Where are the millions of dollars acting in their
              interests? Alas, they are notably absent.” [Joel Bakan, The Corporation, p.
              107]
                However, it cannot be denied that it is up to the general population to vote
              for politicians. This is when the indirect impact of wealth kicks in, namely the
              role of the media and the Public Relations (PR) industry. As we discuss in
              section D.3, the modern media is dominated by big business and,
              unsurprisingly, reﬂects their interests. This means that the media has an
              important impact on how voters see parties and speciﬁc politicians and
              candidates. A radical party will, at best, be ignored by the capitalist press or,
              at worse, subject to smears and attacks. This will have a corresponding
              negative impact on their election prospects and will involve the aﬀected party
              having to invest substantially more time, energy and resources in countering
              the negative media coverage. The PR industry has a similar eﬀect, although
              that has the advantage of not having to bother with appearing to look factual
              or unbiased. Add to this the impact of elite and corporation funded “think
              tanks” and the political system is fatally skewed in favour of the capitalist
              class (also see section D.2).
                In a nutshell:
                   “The business class dominates government through its ability to
                   fund political campaigns, purchase high priced lobbyists and reward
                   former oﬀicials with lucrative jobs … [Politicians] have become
                   wholly dependent upon the same corporate dollars to pay for a new
## professional class of PR consultants, marketeers and social
## scientists who manage and promote causes and candidates in
                   essentially the same manner that advertising campaigns sell cars,
## fashions, drugs and other wares.” [John Stauber and Sheldon
                   Rampton, Toxic Sludge is Good for You, p. 78]
                 That is the ﬁrst barrier, the direct and indirect impact of wealth. This, in
              itself, is a powerful barrier to deter democracy and, as a consequence, it is
              usually suﬀicient in itself. Yet sometimes people see through the media
              distortions and vote for reformist, even radical, candidates. As we discuss in
              section J.2.6, anarchists argue that the net eﬀect of running for oﬀice is a
              general de-radicalising of the party involved. Revolutionary parties become
              reformist, reformist parties end up maintaining capitalism and introducing
              polities the opposite of which they had promised. So while it is unlikely that a
              radical party could get elected and remain radical in the process, it is
              possible. If such a party did get into oﬀice, the remaining two barriers kicks
              in: the bureaucracy barrier and the capital barrier.
                 The existence of a state bureaucracy is a key feature in ensuring that the
              state remains the ruling class’s “policeman” and will be discussed in greater
              detail in section J.2.2 (Why do anarchists reject voting as a means for
              change?). Suﬀice to say, the politicians who are elected to oﬀice are at a
304 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              disadvantage as regards the state bureaucracy. The latter is a permanent
              concentration of power while the former come and go. Consequently, they are
              in a position to tame any rebel government by means of bureaucratic inertia,
              distorting and hiding necessary information and pushing its own agenda onto
              the politicians who are in theory their bosses but in reality dependent on the
              bureaucracy. And, needless to say, if all else fails the state bureaucracy can
              play its ﬁnal hand: the military coup.
                This threat has been applied in many countries, most obviously in the
              developing world (with the aid of Western, usually US, imperialism). The
              coups in Iran (1953) and Chile (1973) are just two examples of this process.
              Yet the so-called developed world is not immune to it. The rise of fascism in
              Italy, Germany, Portugal and Spain can be considered as variations of a
              military coup (particularly the last one where fascism was imposed by the
              military). Wealthy business men funded para-military forces to break the back
              of the labour movement, forces formed by ex-military people. Even the New
              Deal in America was threatened by such a coup. [Joel Bakan, Op. Cit., pp. 86–
              95] While such regimes do protect the interests of capital and are,
              consequently, backed by it, they do hold problems for capitalism. This is
              because, as with the Absolutism which fostered capitalism in the ﬁrst place,
              this kind of government can get ideas above its station This means that a
              military coup will only be used when the last barrier, the capital barrier, is
              used and fails.
                The capital barrier is obviously related to the wealth barrier insofar as it
              relates to the power that great wealth produces. However, it is diﬀerent in
              how it is applied. The wealth barrier restricts who gets into oﬀice, the capital
              barrier controls whoever does so. The capital barrier, in other words, are the
              economic forces that can be brought to bear on any government which is
              acting in ways disliked of by the capitalist class.
                We see their power implied when the news report that changes in
              government, policies and law have been “welcomed by the markets.” As the
              richest 1% of households in America (about 2 million adults) owned 35% of
              the stock owned by individuals in 1992 — with the top 10% owning over 81%
              — we can see that the “opinion” of the markets actually means the power of
              the richest 1–5% of a countries population (and their ﬁnance experts), power
              derived from their control over investment and production. Given that the
              bottom 90% of the US population has a smaller share (23%) of all kinds of
              investable capital that the richest 1/2% (who own 29%), with stock ownership
              being even more concentrated (the top 5% holding 95% of all shares), its
              obvious why Doug Henwood argues that stock markets are “a way for the very
              rich as a class to own an economy’s productive capital stock as a whole,” are
              a source of “political power” and a way to have inﬂuence over government
              policy. [Wall Street: Class Racket]
                The mechanism is simple enough. The ability of capital to disinvest (capital
              ﬂight) and otherwise adversely impact the economy is a powerful weapon to
              keep the state as its servant. The companies and the elite can invest at home
              or abroad, speculate in currency markets and so forth. If a signiﬁcant number
              of investors or corporations lose conﬁdence in a government they will simply
              stop investing at home and move their funds abroad. At home, the general
              population feel the results as demand drops, layoﬀs increase and recession

              kicks in. As Noam Chomsky notes:
                   “In capitalist democracy, the interests that must be satisﬁed are
## those of capitalists; otherwise, there is no investment, no
## production, no work, no resources to be devoted, however
                   marginally, to the needs of the general population.” [Turning the
                   Tide, p. 233]
                This ensures the elite control of government as government policies which
              private power ﬁnds unwelcome will quickly be reversed. The power which
              “business conﬁdence” has over the political system ensures that democracy is
              subservient to big business. As summarised by Malatesta:
                   “Even with universal suﬀrage — we could well say even more so
## with universal suﬀrage — the government remained the
                   bourgeoisie’s servant and gendarme. For were it to be otherwise
                   with the government hinting that it might take up a hostile attitude,
                   or that democracy could ever be anything but a pretence to deceive
                   the people, the bourgeoisie, feeling its interests threatened, would
                   by quick to react, and would use all the inﬂuence and force at its
                   disposal, by reason of its wealth, to recall the government to its
                   proper place as the bourgeoisie’s gendarme.” [Anarchy, p. 23]
                It is due to these barriers that the state remains an instrument of the
              capitalist class while being, in theory, a democracy. Thus the state machine
              remains a tool by which the few can enrich themselves at the expense of the
              many. This does not mean, of course, that the state is immune to popular
              pressure. Far from it. As indicated in the last section, direct action by the
              oppressed can and has forced the state to implement signiﬁcant reforms.
              Similarly, the need to defend society against the negative eﬀects of
              unregulated capitalism can also force through populist measures (particularly
              when the alternative may be worse than the allowing the reforms, i.e.
              revolution). The key is that such changes are not the natural function of the
              state.
                So due to their economic assets, the elites whose incomes are derived from
              them — namely, ﬁnance capitalists, industrial capitalists, and landlords — are
              able to accumulate vast wealth from those whom they exploit. This stratiﬁes
              society into a hierarchy of economic classes, with a huge disparity of wealth
              between the small property-owning elite at the top and the non-propertyowning majority at the bottom. Then, because it takes enormous wealth to win
              elections and lobby or bribe legislators, the propertied elite are able to
              control the political process — and hence the state — through the “power of
              the purse.” In summary:
                   “No democracy has freed itself from the rule by the well-to-do
                   anymore than it has freed itself from the division between the ruler
                   and the ruled … at the very least, no democracy has jeopardised the
                   role of business enterprise. Only the wealthy and well oﬀ can aﬀord
                   to launch viable campaigns for public oﬀice and to assume such
                   positions. Change in government in a democracy is a circulation

                   from one elite group to another.” [Harold Barclay, Op. Cit., p. 47]
                In other words, elite control of politics through huge wealth disparities
              insures the continuation of such disparities and thus the continuation of elite
              control. In this way the crucial political decisions of those at the top are
              insulated from signiﬁcant inﬂuence by those at the bottom. Finally, it should
              be noted that these barriers do not arise accidentally. They ﬂow from the way
              the state is structured. By eﬀectively disempowering the masses and
              centralising power into the hands of the few which make up the government,
              the very nature of the state ensures that it remains under elite control. This is
              why, from the start, the capitalist class has favoured centralisation. We
              discuss this in the next two sections.
                (For more on the ruling elite and its relation to the state, see C. Wright
              Mills, The Power Elite [Oxford, 1956]; cf. Ralph Miliband, The State in
              Capitalist Society [Basic Books, 1969] and Divided Societies [Oxford,

              B.2.4 How does state centralisation aﬀect freedom?
                It is a common idea that voting every four or so years to elect the public
              face of a highly centralised and bureaucratic machine means that ordinary
              people control the state and, as a consequence, free. In reality, this is a false
              idea. In any system of centralised power the general population have little say
              in what aﬀects them and, as a result, their freedom is extremely limited.
                Obviously, to say that this idea is false does not imply that there is no
              diﬀerence between a liberal republic and a fascistic or monarchical state. Far
              from it. The vote is an important victory wrested from the powers that be.
              That, of course, is not to suggest that anarchists think that libertarian
              socialism is only possible after universal suﬀrage has been won or that it is
              achievable via it. Far from it. It is simply to point out that being able to pick
              your ruler is a step forward from having one imposed upon you. Moreover,
              those considered able to pick their ruler is, logically, also able to do without
              one.
                However, while the people are proclaimed to be sovereign in a democratic
              state, in reality they alienate their power and hand over control of their aﬀairs
              to a small minority. Liberty, in other words, is reduced to merely the
              possibility “to pick rulers” every four or ﬁve years and whose mandate (sic!) is
              “to legislate on any subject, and his decision will become law.” [Kropotkin,
              Words of a Rebel, p. 122 and p. 123]
                In other words, representative democracy is not “liberty” nor “selfgovernment.” It is about alienating power to a few people who then (mis)rule
              in your name. To imply it is anything else is nonsense. So while we get to pick
              a politician to govern in our name it does not follow that they represent those
              who voted for them in any meaningful sense. As shown time and time again,
              “representative” governments can happily ignore the opinions of the majority
              while, at the same time, verbally praising the “democracy” it is abusing (New
              Labour in the UK during the run up to the invasion of Iraq was a classic
              example of this). Given that politicians can do what they like for four or ﬁve

              years once elected, it is clear that popular control via the ballot box is hardly
              eﬀective or even meaningful.
                 Indeed, such “democracy” almost always means electing politicians who say
              one thing in opposition and do the opposite once in oﬀice. Politicians who, at
              best, ignore their election manifesto when it suits them or, at worse, introduce
              the exact opposite. It is the kind of “democracy” in which people can protest
              in their hundreds of thousands against a policy only to see their
              “representative” government simply ignore them (while, at the same time,
              seeing their representatives bend over backward ensuring corporate proﬁts
              and power while speaking platitudes to the electorate and their need to
              tighten their belts). At best it can be said that democratic governments tend
              to be less oppressive than others but it does not follow that this equates to
              liberty.
                 State centralisation is the means to ensure this situation and the
              debasement of freedom it implies.
                 All forms of hierarchy, even those in which the top oﬀicers are elected are
              marked by authoritarianism and centralism. Power is concentrated in the
              centre (or at the top), which means that society becomes “a heap of dust
              animated from without by a subordinating, centralist idea.” [P. J. Proudhon,
              quoted by Martin Buber, Paths in Utopia, p. 29] For, once elected, top
              oﬀicers can do as they please, and, as in all bureaucracies, many important
              decisions are made by non-elected staﬀ. This means that the democratic state
              is a contradiction in terms:
                   “In the democratic state the election of rulers by alleged majority
                   vote is a subterfuge which helps individuals to believe that they
                   control the situation. They are selecting persons to do a task for
                   them and they have no guarantee that it will be carried out as they
                   desired. They are abdicating to these persons, granting them the
                   right to impose their own wills by the threat of force. Electing
                   individuals to public oﬀice is like being given a limited choice of
## your oppressors … Parliamentary democracies are essentially
                   oligarchies in which the populace is led to believe that it delegates
                   all its authority to members of parliament to do as they think best.”
                   [Harold Barclay, Op. Cit., pp. 46–7]
                 The nature of centralisation places power into the hands of the few.
              Representative democracy is based on this delegation of power, with voters
              electing others to govern them. This cannot help but create a situation in
              which freedom is endangered — universal suﬀrage “does not prevent the
              formation of a body of politicians, privileged in fact though not in law, who,
              devoting themselves exclusively to the administration of the nation’s public
              aﬀairs, end by becoming a sort of political aristocracy or oligarchy.” [Bakunin,
              The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 240]
                 This should not come as a surprise, for to “create a state is to
              institutionalise power in a form of machine that exists apart from the people.
              It is to professionalise rule and policy making, to create a distinct interest (be
              it of bureaucrats, deputies, commissars, legislators, the military, the police, ad
              nauseam) that, however weak or however well-intentioned it may be at ﬁrst,
              eventually takes on a corruptive power of its own.” [Murray Bookchin, “The

              Ecological Crisis, Socialism, and the need to remake society,” pp. 1–10,
              Society and Nature, vol. 2, no. 3, p. 7]
                Centralism makes democracy meaningless, as political decision-making is
              given over to professional politicians in remote capitals. Lacking local
              autonomy, people are isolated from each other (atomised) by having no
              political forum where they can come together to discuss, debate, and decide
              among themselves the issues they consider important. Elections are not based
              on natural, decentralised groupings and thus cease to be relevant. The
              individual is just another “voter” in the mass, a political “constituent” and
              nothing more. The amorphous basis of modern, statist elections “aims at
              nothing less than to abolish political life in towns, communes and
              departments, and through this destruction of all municipal and regional
              autonomy to arrest the development of universal suﬀrage.” [Proudhon, quoted
              by Martin Buber, Op. Cit., p. 29]
                Thus people are disempowered by the very structures that claim to allow
              them to express themselves. To quote Proudhon again, in the centralised state
              “the citizen divests himself of sovereignty, the town and the Department and
              province above it, absorbed by central authority, are no longer anything but
              agencies under direct ministerial control.” He continues:
                   “The Consequences soon make themselves felt: the citizen and the
                   town are deprived of all dignity, the state’s depredations multiply,
                   and the burden on the taxpayer increases in proportion. It is no
                   longer the government that is made for the people; it is the people
## who are made for the government. Power invades everything,
                   dominates everything, absorbs everything.” [The Principle of
                   Federation, p. 59]
                 As intended, as isolated people are no threat to the powers that be. This
              process of marginalisation can be seen from American history, for example,
              when town meetings were replaced by elected bodies, with the citizens being
              placed in passive, spectator roles as mere “voters” (see next section). Being
              an atomised voter is hardly an ideal notion of “freedom,” despite the rhetoric
              of politicians about the virtues of a “free society” and “The Free World” — as
              if voting once every four or ﬁve years could ever be classed as “liberty” or
              even “democracy.”
                 Marginalisation of the people is the key control mechanism in the state and
              authoritarian organisations in general. Considering the European Community
              (EC), for example, we ﬁnd that the “mechanism for decision-making between
              EC states leaves power in the hands of oﬀicials (from Interior ministries,
              police, immigration, customs and security services) through a myriad of
              working groups. Senior oﬀicials … play a critical role in ensuring agreements
              between the diﬀerent state oﬀicials. The EC Summit meetings, comprising the
              12 Prime Ministers, simply rubber-stamp the conclusions agreed by the
              Interior and Justice Ministers. It is only then, in this intergovernmental
              process, that parliaments and people are informed (and them only with the
              barest details).” [Tony Bunyon, Statewatching the New Europe, p. 39]
                 As well as economic pressures from elites, governments also face pressures
              within the state itself due to the bureaucracy that comes with centralism.
              There is a diﬀerence between the state and government. The state is the
309 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              permanent collection of institutions that have entrenched power structures
              and interests. The government is made up of various politicians. It’s the
              institutions that have power in the state due to their permanence, not the
              representatives who come and go. As Clive Ponting (an ex-civil servant
              himself) indicates, “the function of a political system in any country … is to
              regulate, but not to alter radically, the existing economic structure and its
              linked power relationships. The great illusion of politics is that politicians
              have the ability to make whatever changes they like.” [quoted in
              Alternatives, no.5, p. 19]
                 Therefore, as well as marginalising the people, the state also ends up
              marginalising “our” representatives. As power rests not in the elected bodies,
              but in a bureaucracy, popular control becomes increasingly meaningless. As
              Bakunin pointed out, “liberty can be valid only when . .. [popular] control [of
              the state] is valid. On the contrary, where such control is ﬁctitious, this
              freedom of the people likewise becomes a mere ﬁction.” [Op. Cit., p. 212]
              State centralisation ensures that popular control is meaningless.
                 This means that state centralism can become a serious source of danger to
              the liberty and well-being of most of the people under it. “The bourgeois
              republicans,” argued Bakunin, “do not yet grasp this simple truth,
              demonstrated by the experience of all times and in all lands, that every
              organised power standing above and over the people necessarily excludes the
              freedom of peoples. The political state has no other purpose than to protect
              and perpetuate the exploitation of the labour of the proletariat by the
              economically dominant classes, and in so doing the state places itself against
              the freedom of the people.” [Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 416]
                 Unsurprisingly, therefore, “whatever progress that has been made … on
              various issues, whatever things have been done for people, whatever human
              rights have been gained, have not been gained through the calm deliberations
              of Congress or the wisdom of presidents or the ingenious decisions of the
              Supreme Court. Whatever progress has been made … has come because of
              the actions of ordinary people, of citizens, of social movements. Not from the
              Constitution.” That document has been happily ignored by the oﬀicial of the
              state when it suits them. An obvious example is the 14th Amendment of the
              US Constitution, which “didn’t have any meaning until black people rose up in
              the 1950s and 1960s in the South in mass movements … They made whatever
              words there were in the Constitution and the 14th Amendment have some
              meaning for the ﬁrst time.” [Howard Zinn, Failure to Quit, p. 69 and p. 73]
                 This is because the “fact that you have got a constitutional right doesn’t
              mean you’re going to get that right. Who has the power on the spot? The
              policeman on the street. The principal in the school. The employer on job. The
              Constitution does not cover private employment. In other words, the
              Constitution does not cover most of reality.” Thus our liberty is not
              determined by the laws of the state. Rather “the source and solution of our
              civil liberties problems are in the situations of every day … Our actual
              freedom is determined not by the Constitution or the Court, but by the power
              the policeman has over us on the street or that of the local judge behind him;
              by the authority of our employers; … by the welfare bureaucrats if we are
              poor; … by landlords if we are tenants.” Thus freedom and justice “are
              determined by power and money” rather than laws. This points to the
310 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              importance of popular participation, of social movements, for what those do
              are “to create a countervailing power to the policeman with a club and a gun.
              That’s essentially what movements do: They create countervailing powers to
              counter the power which is much more important than what is written down
              in the Constitution or the laws.” [Zinn, Op. Cit., pp. 84–5, pp. 54–5 and p. 79]
                 It is precisely this kind of mass participation that centralisation kills. Under
              centralism, social concern and power are taken away from ordinary citizens
              and centralised in the hands of the few. This results in any formally
              guaranteed liberties being eﬀectively ignored when people want to use them,
              if the powers at be so decide. Ultimately, isolated individuals facing the might
              of a centralised state machine are in a weak position. Which is way the state
              does what it can to undermine such popular movements and organisations
              (going so far as to violate its own laws to do so).
                 As should be obvious, by centralisation anarchists do not mean simply a
              territorial centralisation of power in a speciﬁc central location (such as in a
              nation state where power rests in a central government located in a speciﬁc
              place). We also mean the centralisation of power into a few hands. Thus we
              can have a system like feudalism which is territorially decentralised (i.e. made
              up on numerous feudal lords without a strong central state) while having
              power centralised in a few hands locally (i.e. power rests in the hands of the
              feudal lords, not in the general population). Or, to use another example, we
              can have a laissez-faire capitalist system which has a weak central authority
              but is made up of a multitude of autocratic workplaces. As such, getting rid of
              the central power (say the central state in capitalism or the monarch in
              absolutism) while retaining the local authoritarian institutions (say capitalist
              ﬁrms and feudal landlords) would not ensure freedom. Equally, the abolition
              of local authorities may simply result in the strengthening of central power
              and a corresponding weakening of freedom.
              B.2.5 Who beneﬁts from centralisation?
                No social system would exist unless it beneﬁted someone or some group.
              Centralisation, be it in the state or the company, is no diﬀerent. In all cases,
              centralisation directly beneﬁts those at the top, because it shelters them from
              those who are below, allowing the latter to be controlled and governed more
              eﬀectively. Therefore, it is in the direct interests of bureaucrats and
              politicians to support centralism.
                Under capitalism, however, various sections of the business class also
              support state centralism. This is the symbiotic relationship between capital
              and the state. As will be discussed later (in section F.8), the state played an
              important role in “nationalising” the market, i.e. forcing the “free market”
              onto society. By centralising power in the hands of representatives and so
              creating a state bureaucracy, ordinary people were disempowered and thus
              became less likely to interfere with the interests of the wealthy. “In a
              republic,” writes Bakunin, “the so-called people, the legal people, allegedly
              represented by the State, stiﬂe and will keep on stiﬂing the actual and living
              people” by “the bureaucratic world” for “the greater beneﬁt of the privileged
              propertied classes as well as for its own beneﬁt.” [Op. Cit., p. 211]

                Examples of increased political centralisation being promoted by wealthy
              business interests by can be seen throughout the history of capitalism. “In
              revolutionary America, ‘the nature of city government came in for heated
              discussion,’ observes Merril Jensen … Town meetings … ‘had been a focal
              point of revolutionary activity’. The anti-democratic reaction that set in after
              the American revolution was marked by eﬀorts to do away with town meeting
              government … Attempts by conservative elements were made to establish a
              ‘corporate form (of municipal government) whereby the towns would be
              governed by mayors and councils’ elected from urban wards … [T]he
              merchants ‘backed incorporation consistently in their eﬀorts to escape town
              meetings.’” [Murray Bookchin, Towards an Ecological Society, p. 182]
                Here we see local policy making being taken out of the hands of the many
              and centralised in the hands of the few (who are always the wealthy). France
              provides another example:
                   “The Government found…the folkmotes [of all households] ‘too
                   noisy’, too disobedient, and in 1787, elected councils, composed of a
## mayor and three to six syndics, chosen among the wealthier
                   peasants, were introduced instead.” [Peter Kropotkin, Mutual Aid,
                   pp. 185–186]
                This was part of a general movement to disempower the working class by
              centralising decision making power into the hands of the few (as in the
              American revolution). Kropotkin indicates the process at work:
                   ”[T]he middle classes, who had until then had sought the support of
                   the people, in order to obtain constitutional laws and to dominate
                   the higher nobility, were going, now that they had seen and felt the
                   strength of the people, to do all they could to dominate the people,
## to disarm them and to drive them back into subjection.

                   […]
                   ”[T]hey made haste to legislate in such a way that the political
                   power which was slipping out of the hand of the Court should not
                   fall into the hands of the people. Thus … [it was] proposed … to
                   divide the French into two classes, of which one only, the active
                   citizens, should take part in the government, whilst the other,
                   comprising the great mass of the people under the name of passive
                   citizens, should be deprived of all political rights … [T]he [National]
                   Assembly divided France into departments … always maintaining
                   the principle of excluding the poorer classes from the Government
                   … [T]hey excluded from the primary assemblies the mass of the
                   people … who could no longer take part in the primary assemblies,
                   and accordingly had no right to nominate the electors [who chose
                   representatives to the National Assembly], or the municipality, or
## any of the local authorities …

## “And ﬁnally, the permanence of the electoral assemblies was
                   interdicted. Once the middle-class governors were appointed, these

                   assemblies were not to meet again. Once the middle-class governors
                   were appointed, they must not be controlled too strictly. Soon the
                   right even of petitioning and of passing resolutions was taken away
## — ‘Vote and hold your tongue!’

                   “As to the villages … the general assembly of the inhabitants … [to
                   which] belonged the administration of the aﬀairs of the commune .. .
## were forbidden by the … law. Henceforth only the well-to-do
                   peasants, the active citizens, had the right to meet, once a year, to
                   nominate the mayor and the municipality, composed of three or four
## middle-class men of the village.

## “A similar municipal organisation was given to the towns…

                   ”[Thus] the middle classes surrounded themselves with every
                   precaution in order to keep the municipal power in the hands of the
## well-to-do members of the community.” [The Great French
                   Revolution, vol. 1, pp. 179–186]
                 Thus centralisation aimed to take power away from the mass of the people
              and give it to the wealthy. The power of the people rested in popular
              assemblies, such as the “Sections” and “Districts” of Paris (expressing, in
              Kropotkin’s words, “the principles of anarchism” and “practising … Direct
              Self-Government” [Op. Cit., p. 204 and p. 203]) and village assemblies.
              However, the National Assembly “tried all it could to lessen the power of the
              districts … [and] put an end to those hotbeds of Revolution … [by allowing]
              active citizens only … to take part in the electoral and administrative
              assemblies.” [Op. Cit., p. 211] Thus the “central government was steadily
              endeavouring to subject the sections to its authority” with the state “seeking
              to centralise everything in its own hands … [I]ts depriving the popular
              organisations … all … administrative functions … and its subjecting them to
              its bureaucracy in police matters, meant the death of the sections.” [Op. Cit.,
              vol. 2, p. 549 and p. 552]
                 As can be seen, both the French and American revolutions saw a similar
              process by which the wealthy centralised power into their own hands (volume
              one of Murray Bookchin’s The Third Revolution discusses the French and
              American revolutions in some detail). This ensured that working class people
              (i.e. the majority) were excluded from the decision making process and
              subject to the laws and power of a few. Which, of course, beneﬁts the minority
              class whose representatives have that power. This was the rationale for the
              centralisation of power in every revolution. Whether it was the American,
              French or Russian, the centralisation of power was the means to exclude the
              many from participating in the decisions that aﬀected them and their
              communities.
                 For example, the founding fathers of the American State were quite explicit
              on the need for centralisation for precisely this reason. For James Madison
              the key worry was when the “majority” gained control of “popular
              government” and was in a position to “sacriﬁce to its ruling passion or
              interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens.” Thus the
              “public good” escaped the “majority” nor was it, as you would think, what the
313 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              public thought of as good (for some reason left unexplained, Madison
              considered the majority able to pick those who could identify the public
              good). To safeguard against this, he advocated a republic rather than a
              democracy in which the citizens “assemble and administer the government in
              person … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the
              rights of property.” He, of course, took it for granted that ”[t]hose who hold
              and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in
              society.” His schema was to ensure that private property was defended and,
              as a consequence, the interests of those who held protected. Hence the need
              for “the delegation of the government … to a small number of citizens elected
              by the rest.” This centralisation of power into a few hands locally was
              matched by a territorial centralisation for the same reason. Madison favoured
              “a large over a small republic” as a “rage for paper money, for an abolition of
              debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked
              project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a
              particular member of it.” [contained in Voices of a People’s History of the
              United States, Howard Zinn and Anthony Arnove (eds.), pp. 109–113] This
              desire to have a formal democracy, where the masses are mere spectators of
              events rather than participants, is a recurring theme in capitalism (see the
              chapter “Force and Opinion” in Noam Chomsky’s Deterring Democracy for
              a good overview).
                 On the federal and state levels in the US after the Revolution, centralisation
              of power was encouraged, since “most of the makers of the Constitution had
              some direct economic interest in establishing a strong federal government.”
              Needless to say, while the rich elite were well represented in formulating the
              principles of the new order, four groups were not: “slaves, indentured
              servants, women, men without property.” Needless to say, the new state and
              its constitution did not reﬂect their interests. Given that these were the vast
              majority, “there was not only a positive need for strong central government to
              protect the large economic interests, but also immediate fear of rebellion by
              discontented farmers.” [Howard Zinn, A People’s History of the United
              States, p. 90] The chief event was Shay’s Rebellion in western
              Massachusetts. There the new Constitution had raised property qualiﬁcations
              for voting and, therefore, no one could hold state oﬀice without being wealthy.
              The new state was formed to combat such rebellions, to protect the wealthy
              few against the many.
                 Moreover, state centralisation, the exclusion of popular participation, was
              essential to mould US society into one dominated by capitalism:
                   “In the thirty years leading up to the Civil War, the law was
                   increasingly interpreted in the courts to suit capitalist development.
                   Studying this, Morton Horwitz (The Transformation of American
                   Law) points out that the English common-law was no longer holy
                   when it stood in the way of business growth … Judgements for
                   damages against businessmen were taken out of the hands of juries,
                   which were unpredictable, and given to judges … The ancient idea
                   of a fair price for goods gave way in the courts to the idea of caveat
                   emptor (let the buyer beware) … contract law was intended to
## discriminate against working people and for business … The

## pretence of the law was that a worker and a railroad made a
                   contract with equal bargaining power … ‘The circle was completed;
                   the law had come simply to ratify those forms of inequality that the
                   market system had produced.’” [Zinn, Op. Cit., p. 234]
                The US state was created on elitist liberal doctrine and actively aimed to
              reduce democratic tendencies (in the name of “individual liberty”). What
              happened in practice (unsurprisingly enough) was that the wealthy elite used
              the state to undermine popular culture and common right in favour of
              protecting and extending their own interests and power. In the process, US
              society was reformed in their own image:
                   “By the middle of the nineteenth century the legal system had been
                   reshaped to the advantage of men of commerce and industry at the
                   expense of farmers, workers, consumers, and other less powerful
                   groups in society… it actively promoted a legal distribution of
                   wealth against the weakest groups in society.” [Morton Horwitz,
                   quoted by Zinn, Op. Cit., p. 235]
                 In more modern times, state centralisation and expansion has gone hand in
              glove with rapid industrialisation and the growth of business. As Edward
              Herman points out, ”[t]o a great extent, it was the growth in business size and
              power that elicited the countervailing emergence of unions and the growth of
              government. Bigness beyond business was to a large extent a response to
              bigness in business.” [Corporate Control, Corporate Power, p. 188 — see
              also, Stephen Skowronek, Building A New American State: The
              Expansion of National Administrative Capacities, 1877–1920] State
              centralisation was required to produce bigger, well-deﬁned markets and was
              supported by business when it acted in their interests (i.e. as markets
              expanded, so did the state in order to standardise and enforce property laws
              and so on). On the other hand, this development towards “big government”
              created an environment in which big business could grow (often encouraged
              by the state by subsidies and protectionism — as would be expected when the
              state is run by the wealthy) as well as further removing state power from
              inﬂuence by the masses and placing it more ﬁrmly in the hands of the wealthy.
              It is little wonder we see such developments, for ”[s]tructures of governance
              tend to coalesce around domestic power, in the last few centuries, economic
              power.” [Noam Chomsky, World Orders, Old and New, p. 178]
                 State centralisation makes it easier for business to control government,
              ensuring that it remains their puppet and to inﬂuence the political process.
              For example, the European Round Table (ERT) “an elite lobby group of …
              chairmen or chief executives of large multi-nationals based mainly in the EU
              … [with] 11 of the 20 largest European companies [with] combined sales [in
              1991] … exceeding $500 billion, … approximately 60 per cent of EU industrial
              production,” makes much use of the EU. As two researchers who have studied
              this body note, the ERT “is adept at lobbying … so that many ERT proposals
              and ‘visions’ are mysteriously regurgitated in Commission summit
              documents.” The ERT “claims that the labour market should be more
              ‘ﬂexible,’ arguing for more ﬂexible hours, seasonal contracts, job sharing and
              part time work. In December 1993, seven years after the ERT made its
315 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              suggestions [and after most states had agreed to the Maastricht Treaty and
              its “social chapter”], the European Commission published a white paper …
              [proposing] making labour markets in Europe more ﬂexible.” [Doherty and
              Hoedeman, “Knights of the Road,” New Statesman, 4/11/94, p. 27]
                 The current talk of globalisation, NAFTA, and the Single European Market
              indicates an underlying transformation in which state growth follows the path
              cut by economic growth. Simply put, with the growth of transnational
              corporations and global ﬁnance markets, the bounds of the nation-state have
              been made economically redundant. As companies have expanded into multinationals, so the pressure has mounted for states to follow suit and rationalise
              their markets across “nations” by creating multi-state agreements and unions.
                 As Noam Chomsky notes, G7, the IMF, the World Bank and so forth are a
              “de facto world government,” and “the institutions of the transnational state
              largely serve other masters [than the people], as state power typically does; in
              this case the rising transnational corporations in the domains of ﬁnance and
              other services, manufacturing, media and communications.” [Op. Cit., p. 179]
                 As multi-nationals grow and develop, breaking through national boundaries,
              a corresponding growth in statism is required. Moreover, a “particularly
              valuable feature of the rising de facto governing institutions is their immunity
              from popular inﬂuence, even awareness. They operate in secret, creating a
              world subordinated to the needs of investors, with the public ‘put in its place’,
              the threat of democracy reduced” [Chomsky, Op. Cit., p. 178].
                 This does not mean that capitalists desire state centralisation for
              everything. Often, particularly for social issues, relative decentralisation is
              often preferred (i.e. power is given to local bureaucrats) in order to increase
              business control over them. By devolving control to local areas, the power
              which large corporations, investment ﬁrms and the like have over the local
              government increases proportionally. In addition, even middle-sized
              enterprise can join in and inﬂuence, constrain or directly control local policies
              and set one workforce against another. Private power can ensure that
              “freedom” is safe, their freedom.
                 No matter which set of bureaucrats are selected, the need to centralise
              social power, thus marginalising the population, is of prime importance to the
              business class. It is also important to remember that capitalist opposition to
              “big government” is often ﬁnancial, as the state feeds oﬀ the available social
              surplus, so reducing the amount left for the market to distribute to the
              various capitals in competition.
                 In reality, what capitalists object to about “big government” is its spending
              on social programs designed to beneﬁt the poor and working class, an
              “illegitimate” function which “wastes” part of the surplus that might go to
              capital (and also makes people less desperate and so less willing to work
              cheaply). Hence the constant push to reduce the state to its “classical” role as
              protector of private property and the system, and little else. Other than their
              specious quarrel with the welfare state, capitalists are the staunchest
              supports of government (and the “correct” form of state intervention, such as
              defence spending), as evidenced by the fact that funds can always be found to
              build more prisons and send troops abroad to advance ruling-class interests,
              even as politicians are crying that there is “no money” in the treasury for
              scholarships, national health care, or welfare for the poor.

                State centralisation ensures that “as much as the equalitarian principles
              have been embodied in its political constitutions, it is the bourgeoisie that
              governs, and it is the people, the workers, peasants included, who obey the
              laws made by the bourgeoisie” who “has in fact if not by right the exclusive
              privilege of governing.” This means that “political equality … is only a puerile
              ﬁction, an utter lie.” It takes a great deal of faith to assume that the rich,
              “being so far removed from the people by the conditions of its economic and
              social existence” can “give expression in the government and in the laws, to
              the feelings, the ideas, and the will of the people.” Unsurprisingly, we ﬁnd
              that “in legislation as well as in carrying on the government, the bourgeoisie
              is guided by its own interests and its own instincts without concerning itself
              much with the interests of the people.” So while “on election days even the
              proudest bourgeois who have any political ambitions are forced to court …
              The Sovereign People.” But on the “day after the elections every one goes
              back to their daily business” and the politicians are given carte blanche to
              rule in the name of the people they claim to represent.” [Bakunin, The
              Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 218 and p. 219]
              B.2.6 Can the state be an independent power within
              society?
                Yes it can. Given the power of the state machine, it would be hard to believe
              that it could always be simply a tool for the economically dominant minority in
              a society. Given its structure and powers, it can use them to further its own
              interests. Indeed, in some circumstances it can be the ruling class itself.
                However, in normal times the state is, as we discussed in section B.2.1, a
              tool of the capitalist class. This, it must be stressed, does not mean that they
              always see “eye to eye.” Top politicians, for example, are part of the ruling
              elite, but they are in competition with other parts of it. In addition, diﬀerent
              sectors of the capitalist class are competing against each other for proﬁts,
              political inﬂuence, privileges, etc. The bourgeoisie, argued Malatesta, “are
              always at war among themselves … Thus the games of the swings, the
              manoeuvres, the concessions and withdrawals, the attempts to ﬁnd allies
              among the people against the conservatives, and among the conservatives
              against the people.” [Anarchy, p. 25] This means that diﬀerent sections of the
              ruling class will cluster around diﬀerent parties, depending on their interests,
              and these parties will seek to gain power to further those interests. This may
              bring them into conﬂict with other sections of the capitalist class. The state is
              the means by which these conﬂicts can be resolved.
                Given that the role of the state is to ensure the best conditions for capital as
              a whole, this means that, when necessary, it can and does work against the
              interests of certain parts of the capitalist class. To carry out this function the
              state needs to be above individual capitalists or companies. This is what can
              give the state the appearance of being a neutral social institution and can fool
              people into thinking that it represents the interests of society as a whole. Yet
              this sometime neutrality with regards to individual capitalist companies exists
              only as an expression of its role as an instrument of capital in general.
              Moreover, without the tax money from successful businesses the state would

              be weakened and so the state is in competition with capitalists for the surplus
              value produced by the working class. Hence the anti-state rhetoric of big
              business which can fool those unaware of the hand-in-glove nature of modern
              capitalism to the state.
                As Chomsky notes:
                   “There has always been a kind of love-hate relationship between
                   business interests and the capitalist state. On the one hand,
                   business wants a powerful state to regulate disorderly markets,
                   provide services and subsidies to business, enhance and protect
                   access to foreign markets and resources, and so on. On the other
                   hand, business does not want a powerful competitor, in particular,
                   one that might respond to diﬀerent interests, popular interests, and
                   conduct policies with a redistributive eﬀect, with regard to income
                   or power.” [Turning the Tide, p. 211]
                As such, the state is often in conﬂict with sections of the capitalist class,
              just as sections of that class use the state to advance their own interests
              within the general framework of protecting the capitalist system (i.e. the
              interests of the ruling class as a class). The state’s role is to resolve such
              disputes within that class peacefully. Under modern capitalism, this is usually
              done via the “democratic” process (within which we get the chance of picking
              the representatives of the elite who will oppress us least).
                Such conﬂicts sometimes give the impression of the state being a “neutral”
              body, but this is an illusion — it exists to defend class power and privilege —
              but exactly which class it defends can change. While recognising that the
              state protects the power and position of the economically dominant class
              within a society anarchists also argue that the state has, due to its
              hierarchical nature, interests of its own. Thus it cannot be considered as
              simply the tool of the economically dominant class in society. States have their
              own dynamics, due to their structure, which generate their own classes and
              class interests and privileges (and which allows them to escape from the
              control of the economic ruling class and pursue their own interests, to a
              greater or lesser degree). As Malatesta put it “the government, though
              springing from the bourgeoisie and its servant and protector, tends, as with
              every servant and every protector, to achieve its own emancipation and to
              dominate whoever it protects.” [Op. Cit., p. 25]
                Thus, even in a class system like capitalism, the state can act independently
              of the ruling elite and, potentially, act against their interests. As part of its
              role is to mediate between individual capitalists/corporations, it needs
              suﬀicient power to tame them and this requires the state to have some
              independence from the class whose interests it, in general, defends. And such
              independence can be used to further its own interests, even to the detriment
              of the capitalist class, if the circumstances allow. If the capitalist class is weak
              or divided then the state can be in a position to exercise its autonomy vis-à-vis
              the economically dominant elite, using against the capitalists as a whole the
              tools it usually applies to them individually to further its own interests and
              powers.
                This means that the state it not just “the guardian of capital” for it “has a
              vitality of its own and constitutes … a veritable social class apart from other
318 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              classes … ; and this class has its own particular parasitical and usurious
              interests, in conﬂict with those of the rest of the collectivity which the State
              itself claims to represent … The State, being the depository of society’s
              greatest physical and material force, has too much power in its hands to
              resign itself to being no more than the capitalists’ guard dog.” [Luigi Fabbri,
              quoted by David Berry, A History of the French Anarchist Movement,
              1917–1945, p. 39]
                 Therefore the state machine (and structure), while its modern form is
              intrinsically linked to capitalism, cannot be seen as being a tool usable by the
              majority. This is because the “State, any State — even when it dresses-up in
              the most liberal and democratic form — is essentially based on domination,
              and upon violence, that is upon despotism — a concealed but no less
              dangerous despotism.” The State “denotes power, authority, domination; it
              presupposes inequality in fact.” [The Political Philosophy of Michael
              Bakunin, p. 211 and p. 240] The state, therefore, has its own speciﬁc logic,
              its own priorities and its own momentum. It constitutes its own locus of power
              which is not merely a derivative of economic class power. Consequently, the
              state can be beyond the control of the economically dominant class and it
              need not reﬂect economic relations.
                 This is due to its hierarchical and centralised nature, which empowers the
              few who control the state machine — ”[e]very state power, every government,
              by its nature places itself outside and over the people and inevitably
              subordinates them to an organisation and to aims which are foreign to and
              opposed to the real needs and aspirations of the people.” If “the whole
              proletariat … [are] members of the government … there will be no
              government, no state, but, if there is to be a state there will be those who are
              ruled and those who are slaves.” [Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 328 and p.
              330]
                 In other words, the state bureaucracy is itself directly an oppressor and can
              exist independently of an economically dominant class. In Bakunin’s prophetic
              words:
                   “What have we seen throughout history? The State has always been
                   the patrimony of some privileged class: the sacerdotal class, the
                   nobility, the bourgeoisie — and ﬁnally, when all other classes have
                   exhausted themselves, the class of the bureaucracy enters the stage
                   and then the State falls, or rises, if you please, to the position of a
## machine.” [The Political Philosophy of Michael Bakunin, p.
                   208]
                This is unsurprising. For anarchists, “the State organisation … [is] the force
              to which minorities resorted for establishing and organising their power over
              the masses.” It does not imply that these minorities need to be the
              economically dominant class in a society. The state is “a superstructure built
              to the advantage of Landlordism, Capitalism, and Oﬀicialism.” [Evolution
              and Environment, p. 82 and p. 105] Consequently, we cannot assume that
              abolishing one or even two of this unholy trinity will result in freedom nor that
              all three share exactly the same interests or power in relation to the others.
              Thus, in some situations, the landlord class can promote its interests over
              those of the capitalist class (and vice versa) while the state bureaucracy can
319 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              grow at the expense of both.
                As such, it is important to stress that the minority whose interests the state
              defends need not be an economically dominant one (although it usually is).
              Under some circumstances a priesthood can be a ruling class, as can a
              military group or a bureaucracy. This means that the state can also eﬀectively
              replace the economically dominant elite as the exploiting class. This is
              because anarchists view the state as having (class) interests of its own.
                As we discuss in more detail in section H.3.9, the state cannot be
              considered as merely an instrument of (economic) class rule. History has
              shown numerous societies were the state itself was the ruling class and
              where no other dominant economic class existed. The experience of Soviet
              Russia indicates the validity of this analysis. The reality of the Russian
              Revolution contrasted starkly with the Marxist claim that a state was simply
              an instrument of class rule and, consequently, the working class needed to
              build its own state within which to rule society. Rather than being an
              instrument by which working class people could run and transform society in
              their own interests, the new state created by the Russian Revolution soon
              became a power over the class it claimed to represent (see section H.6 for
              more on this). The working class was exploited and dominated by the new
              state and its bureaucracy rather than by the capitalist class as previously. This
              did not happen by chance. As we discuss in section H.3.7, the state has
              evolved certain characteristics (such as centralisation, delegated power and
              so on) which ensure its task as enforcer of minority rule is achieved. Keeping
              those characteristics will inevitably mean keeping the task they were created
              to serve.
                Thus, to summarise, the state’s role is to repress the individual and the
              working class as a whole in the interests of economically dominant minorities/
              classes and in its own interests. It is “a society for mutual insurance between
              the landlord, the military commander, the judge, the priest, and later on the
              capitalist, in order to support such other’s authority over the people, and for
              exploiting the poverty of the masses and getting rich themselves.” Such was
              the “origin of the State; such was its history; and such is its present essence.”
              [Kropotkin, Evolution and Environment, p. 94]
                So while the state is an instrument of class rule it does not automatically
              mean that it does not clash with sections of the class it represents nor that it
              has to be the tool of an economically dominant class. One thing is sure,
              however. The state is not a suitable tool for securing the emancipation of the
              oppressed.
              B.3 Why are anarchists against private
              property?
                Private property is one of the three things all anarchists oppose, along side
              hierarchical authority and the state. Today, the dominant system of private
              property is capitalist in nature and, as such, anarchists tend to concentrate on
              this system and its property rights regime. We will be reﬂecting this here but
              do not, because of this, assume that anarchists consider other forms of private
              property regime (such as, say, feudalism) as acceptable. This is not the case —
320 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              anarchists are against every form of property rights regime which results in
              the many working for the few.
                Anarchist opposition to private property rests on two, related, arguments.
              These were summed up by Proudhon’s maxims (from What is Property? that
              “property is theft” and “property is despotism.” In his words, “Property …
              violates equality by the rights of exclusion and increase, and freedom by
              despotism … [and has] perfect identity with robbery.” [Proudhon, What is
              Property, p. 251] Anarchists, therefore, oppose private property (i.e.
              capitalism) because it is a source of coercive, hierarchical authority as well as
              exploitation and, consequently, elite privilege and inequality. It is based on
              and produces inequality, in terms of both wealth and power.
## We will summarise each argument in turn.
                The statement “property is theft” is one of anarchism’s most famous
              sayings. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that anyone who rejects this
              statement is not an anarchist. This maxim works in two related ways. Firstly,
              it recognises the fact that the earth and its resources, the common
              inheritance of all, have been monopolised by a few. Secondly, it argues that,
              as a consequence of this, those who own property exploit those who do not.
              This is because those who do not own have to pay or sell their labour to those
              who do own in order to get access to the resources they need to live and work
              (such as workplaces, machinery, land, credit, housing, products under
              patents, and such like — see section B.3.2 for more discussion).
                As we discuss in section B.3.3, this exploitation (theft) ﬂows from the fact
              that workers do not own or control the means of production they use and, as a
              consequence, are controlled by those who do during work hours. This
              alienation of control over labour to the boss places the employer in a position
              to exploit that labour — to get the worker to produce more than they get paid
              in wages. That is precisely why the boss employs the worker. Combine this
              with rent, interest and intellectual property rights and we ﬁnd the secret to
              maintaining the capitalist system as all allow enormous inequalities of wealth
              to continue and keep the resources of the world in the hands of a few.
                Yet labour cannot be alienated. Therefore when you sell your labour you sell
              yourself, your liberty, for the time in question. This brings us to the second
              reason why anarchists oppose private property, the fact it produces
              authoritarian social relationships. For all true anarchists, property is opposed
              as a source of authority, indeed despotism. To quote Proudhon on this subject:
                   “The proprietor, the robber, the hero, the sovereign — for all these
                   titles are synonymous — imposes his will as law, and suﬀers neither
                   contradiction nor control; that is, he pretends to be the legislative
                   and the executive power at once … [and so] property engenders
                   despotism … That is so clearly the essence of property that, to be
                   convinced of it, one need but remember what it is, and observe what
                   happens around him. Property is the right to use and abuse … if
                   goods are property, why should not the proprietors be kings, and
                   despotic kings — kings in proportion to their facultes bonitaires?
                   And if each proprietor is sovereign lord within the sphere of his
                   property, absolute king throughout his own domain, how could a
                   government of proprietors be any thing but chaos and confusion?”
321 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   [Op. Cit., pp. 266–7]
                In other words, private property is the state writ small, with the property
              owner acting as the “sovereign lord” over their property, and so the absolute
              king of those who use it. As in any monarchy, the worker is the subject of the
              capitalist, having to follow their orders, laws and decisions while on their
              property. This, obviously, is the total denial of liberty (and dignity, we may
              note, as it is degrading to have to follow orders). And so private property
              (capitalism) necessarily excludes participation, inﬂuence, and control by those
              who use, but do not own, the means of life.
                It is, of course, true that private property provides a sphere of decisionmaking free from outside interference — but only for the property’s owners.
              But for those who are not property owners the situation if radically diﬀerent.
              In a system of exclusively private property does not guarantee them any such
              sphere of freedom. They have only the freedom to sell their liberty to those
              who do own private property. If I am evicted from one piece of private
              property, where can I go? Nowhere, unless another owner agrees to allow me
              access to their piece of private property. This means that everywhere I can
              stand is a place where I have no right to stand without permission and, as a
              consequence, I exist only by the suﬀerance of the property owning elite.
              Hence Proudhon:
                   “Just as the commoner once held his land by the muniﬁcence and
                   condescension of the lord, so to-day the working-man holds his
                   labour by the condescension and necessities of the master and
                   proprietor.” [Proudhon, Op. Cit., p. 128]
                This means that far from providing a sphere of independence, a society in
              which all property is private thus renders the property-less completely
              dependent on those who own property. This ensures that the exploitation of
              another’s labour occurs and that some are subjected to the will of others, in
              direct contradiction to what the defenders of property promise. This is
              unsurprising given the nature of the property they are defending:
                   “Our opponents … are in the habit of justifying the right to private
                   property by stating that property is the condition and guarantee of
## liberty.

                   “And we agree with them. Do we not say repeatedly that poverty is
## slavery?

## “But then why do we oppose them?

                   “The reason is clear: in reality the property that they defend is
                   capitalist property, namely property that allows its owners to live
## from the work of others and which therefore depends on the
                   existence of a class of the disinherited and dispossessed, forced to
                   sell their labour to the property owners for a wage below its real
                   value … This means that workers are subjected to a kind of slavery,
                   which, though it may vary in degree of harshness, always means
322 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   social inferiority, material penury and moral degradation, and is the
                   primary cause of all the ills that beset today’s social order.”
                   [Malatesta, The Anarchist Revolution, p. 113]
                It will, of course, be objected that no one forces a worker to work for a
              given boss. However, as we discuss in section B.4.3, this assertion (while true)
              misses the point. While workers are not forced to work for a speciﬁc boss,
              they inevitably have to work for a boss. This is because there is literally no
              other way to survive — all other economic options have been taken from them
              by state coercion. The net eﬀect is that the working class has little choice but
              to hire themselves out to those with property and, as a consequence, the
              labourer “has sold and surrendered his liberty” to the boss. [Proudhon, Op.
              Cit., p. 130]
                Private property, therefore, produces a very speciﬁc form of authority
              structure within society, a structure in which a few govern the many during
              working hours. These relations of production are inherently authoritarian and
              embody and perpetuate the capitalist class system. The moment you enter the
              factory gate or the oﬀice door, you lose all your basic rights as a human being.
              You have no freedom of speech nor association and no right of assembly. If
              you were asked to ignore your values, your priorities, your judgement, and
              your dignity, and leave them at the door when you enter your home, you
              would rightly consider that tyranny yet that is exactly what you do during
              working hours if you are a worker. You have no say in what goes on. You may
              as well be a horse (to use John Locke’s analogy — see section B.4.2) or a piece
              of machinery.
                Little wonder, then, that anarchists oppose private property as Anarchy is
              “the absence of a master, of a sovereign” [Proudhon, Op. Cit., p. 264] and call
              capitalism for what it is, namely wage slavery!
                For these reasons, anarchists agree with Rousseau when he stated:
                   “The ﬁrst man who, having fenced oﬀ a plot of land, thought of
                   saying, ‘This is mine’ and found people simple enough to believe
                   him was the real founder of civil society. How many crimes, wars,
                   murders, how many miseries and horrors might the human race had
                   been spared by the one who, upon pulling up the stakes or ﬁlling in
                   the ditch, had shouted to his fellow men: ‘Beware of listening to this
                   impostor; you are lost if you forget the fruits of the earth belong to
## all and that the earth belongs to no one.’” [“Discourse on
                   Inequality,” The Social Contract and Discourses, p. 84]
                This explains anarchist opposition to capitalism. It is marked by two main
              features, “private property” (or in some cases, state-owned property — see
              section B.3.5) and, consequently, wage labour and exploitation and authority.
              Moreover, such a system requires a state to maintain itself for as “long as
              within society a possessing and non-possessing group of human beings face
              one another in enmity, the state will be indispensable to the possessing
              minority for the protection for its privileges.” [Rudolf Rocker, AnarchoSyndicalism, p. 11] Thus private ownership of the means of production is only
              possible if there is a state, meaning mechanisms of organised coercion at the
              disposal of the propertied class (see section B.2).

                Also, it ought to be easy to see that capitalism, by giving rise to an
              ideologically inalienable “right” to private property, will also quickly give rise
              to inequalities in the distribution of external resources, and that this
              inequality in resource distribution will give rise to a further inequality in the
              relative bargaining positions of the propertied and the property less. While
              apologists for capitalism usually attempt to justify private property by
              claiming that “self-ownership” is a “universal right” (see section B.4.2 — “Is
              capitalism based on self-ownership?”), it is clear that capitalism actually
              makes universal autonomy implied by the ﬂawed concept of self-ownership
              (for the appeal of the notion of self-ownership rests on the ideal that people
              are not used as a means but only as an end in themselves). The capitalist
              system, however, has undermined autonomy and individual freedom, and
              ironically, has used the term “self-ownership” as the basis for doing so. Under
              capitalism, as will be seen in section B.4, most people are usually left in a
              situation where their best option is to allow themselves to be used in just
              those ways that are logically incompatible with genuine self-ownership, i.e.
              the autonomy which makes it initially an appealing concept.
                Only libertarian socialism can continue to aﬀirm the meaningful autonomy
              and individual freedom which self-ownership promises whilst building the
              conditions that guarantee it. Only by abolishing private property can there be
              access to the means of life for all, so making the autonomy which selfownership promises but cannot deliver a reality by universalising selfmanagement in all aspects of life.
                Before discussing the anti-libertarian aspects of capitalism, it will be
              necessary to deﬁne “private property” as distinct from “personal possessions”
              and show in more detail why the former requires state protection and is
              exploitative.
              B.3.1 What is the diﬀerence between private property
              and possession?
                Anarchists deﬁne “private property” (or just “property,” for short) as stateprotected monopolies of certain objects or privileges which are used to
              control and exploit others. “Possession,” on the other hand, is ownership of
              things that are not used to exploit others (e.g. a car, a refrigerator, a
              toothbrush, etc.). Thus many things can be considered as either property or
              possessions depending on how they are used.
                To summarise, anarchists are in favour of the kind of property which
              “cannot be used to exploit another — those kinds of personal possessions
              which we accumulate from childhood and which become part of our lives.” We
              are opposed to the kind of property “which can be used only to exploit people
              — land and buildings, instruments of production and distribution, raw
              materials and manufactured articles, money and capital.” [Nicholas Walter,
              About Anarchism, p. 40] As a rule of thumb, anarchists oppose those forms
              of property which are owned by a few people but which are used by others.
              This leads to the former controlling the latter and using them to produce a
              surplus for them (either directly, as in the case of a employee, or indirectly, in
              the case of a tenant).

                The key is that “possession” is rooted in the concept of “use rights” or
              “usufruct” while “private property” is rooted in a divorce between the users
              and ownership. For example, a house that one lives in is a possession,
              whereas if one rents it to someone else at a proﬁt it becomes property.
              Similarly, if one uses a saw to make a living as a self-employed carpenter, the
              saw is a possession; whereas if one employs others at wages to use the saw
              for one’s own proﬁt, it is property. Needless to say, a capitalist workplace,
              where the workers are ordered about by a boss, is an example of “property”
              while a co-operative, where the workers manage their own work, is an
              example of “possession.” To quote Proudhon:

## “The proprietor is a man who, having absolute control of an
                   instrument of production, claims the right to enjoy the product of
                   the instrument without using it himself. To this end he lends it.”
                   [Op. Cit., p. 293]
                While it may initially be confusing to make this distinction, it is very useful
              to understand the nature of capitalist society. Capitalists tend to use the word
              “property” to mean anything from a toothbrush to a transnational corporation
              — two very diﬀerent things, with very diﬀerent impacts upon society. Hence
              Proudhon:

## “Originally the word property was synonymous with proper or
                   individual possession. It designated each individual’s special right
                   to the use of a thing. But when this right of use … became active
                   and paramount — that is, when the usufructuary converted his right
                   to personally use the thing into the right to use it by his neighbour’s
                   labour — then property changed its nature and this idea became
                   complex.” [Op. Cit., pp. 395–6]
                 Proudhon graphically illustrated the distinction by comparing a lover as a
              possessor, and a husband as a proprietor! As he stressed, the “double
              deﬁnition of property — domain and possession — is of highest importance;
              and must be clearly understood, in order to comprehend” what anarchism is
              really about. So while some may question why we make this distinction, the
              reason is clear. As Proudhon argued, “it is proper to call diﬀerent things by
              diﬀerent names, if we keep the name ‘property’ for the former [possession],
              we must call the latter [the domain of property] robbery, repine, brigandage.
              If, on the contrary, we reserve the name ‘property’ for the latter, we must
              designate the former by the term possession or some other equivalent;
              otherwise we should be troubled with an unpleasant synonym.” [Op. Cit., p.
              65 and p. 373]
                 The diﬀerence between property and possession can be seen from the types
              of authority relations each generates. Taking the example of a capitalist
              workplace, its clear that those who own the workplace determine how it is
              used, not those who do the actual work. This leads to an almost totalitarian
              system. As Noam Chomsky points out, “the term ‘totalitarian’ is quite
              accurate. There is no human institution that approaches totalitarianism as
              closely as a business corporation. I mean, power is completely top-down. You
              can be inside it somewhere and you take orders from above and hand ‘em
325 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              down. Ultimately, it’s in the hands of owners and investors.” Thus the actual
              producer does not control their own activity, the product of their labour nor
              the means of production they use. In modern class societies, the producer is
              in a position of subordination to those who actually do own or manage the
              productive process.
                In an anarchist society, as noted, actual use is considered the only title. This
              means that a workplace is organised and run by those who work within it,
              thus reducing hierarchy and increasing freedom and equality within society.
              Hence anarchist opposition to private property and capitalism ﬂows naturally
              from anarchism’s basic principles and ideas. Hence all anarchists agree with
              Proudhon:
                   “Possession is a right; property is against right. Suppress property
                   while maintaining possession.” [Op. Cit., p. 271]
                As Alexander Berkman frames this distinction, anarchism “abolishes private
              ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes
              capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use.
              Thus, your watch is your own, but the watch factory belongs to the people.
              Land, machinery, and all other public utilities will be collective property,
              neither to be bought nor sold. Actual use will be considered the only title —
              not to ownership but to possession.” [What is Anarchism?, p. 217]
                This analysis of diﬀerent forms of property is at the heart of both social and
              individualist anarchism. This means that all anarchists seek to change
              people’s opinions on what is to be considered as valid forms of property,
              aiming to see that “the Anarchistic view that occupancy and use should
              condition and limit landholding becomes the prevailing view” and so ensure
              that “individuals should no longer be protected by their fellows in anything
              but personal occupation and cultivation [i.e. use] of land.” [Benjamin Tucker,
              The Individualist Anarchists, p. 159 and p. 85] The key diﬀerences, as we
              noted in section A.3.1, is how they apply this principle.
                This anarchist support for possession does not imply the break up of large
              scale organisations such as factories or other workplaces which require large
              numbers of people to operate. Far from it. Anarchists argue for association as
              the complement of possession. This means applying “occupancy and use” to
              property which is worked by more than one person results in associated
              labour, i.e. those who collectively work together (i.e. use a given property)
              manage it and their own labour as a self-governing, directly democratic,
              association of equals (usually called “self-management” for short).
                This logically ﬂows from the theory of possession, of “occupancy and use.”
              For if production is carried on in groups who is the legal occupier of the land?
              The employer or their manager? Obviously not, as they are by deﬁnition
              occupying more than they can use by themselves. Clearly, the association of
              those engaged in the work can be the only rational answer. Hence Proudhon’s
              comment that “all accumulated capital being social property, no one can be its
              exclusive proprietor.” “In order to destroy despotism and inequality of
              conditions, men must … become associates” and this implies workers’ selfmanagement — “leaders, instructors, superintendents … must be chosen from
              the labourers by the labourers themselves.” [Proudhon, Op. Cit., p. 130, p.
              372 and p. 137]
326 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                In this way, anarchists seek, in Proudhon’s words, “abolition of the
              proletariat” and consider a key idea of our ideas that “Industrial Democracy
              must… succeed Industrial Feudalism.” [Proudhon, Selected Writings of
              Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, p. 179 and p. 167] Thus an anarchist society
              would be based on possession, with workers’ self-management being
              practised at all levels from the smallest one person workplace or farm to large
              scale industry (see section I.3 for more discussion).
                Clearly, then, all anarchists seek to transform and limit property rights.
              Capitalist property rights would be ended and a new system introduced
              rooted in the concept of possession and use. While the exact nature of that
              new system diﬀers between schools of anarchist thought, the basic principles
              are the same as they ﬂow from the same anarchist theory of property to be
              found in Proudhon’s, What is Property?.
                Signiﬁcantly, William Godwin in his Enquiry Concerning Political Justice
              makes the same point concerning the diﬀerence between property and
              possession (although not in the same language) ﬁfty years before Proudhon,
              which indicates its central place in anarchist thought. For Godwin, there were
              diﬀerent kinds of property. One kind was “the empire to which every [person]
              is entitled over the produce of his [or her] own industry.” However, another
              kind was “a system, in whatever manner established, by which one man
              enters into the faculty of disposing of the produce of another man’s industry.”
              This “species of property is in direct contradiction” to the former kind (he
              similarities with subsequent anarchist ideas is striking). For Godwin,
              inequality produces a “servile” spirit in the poor and, moreover, a person who
              “is born to poverty, may be said, under a another name, to be born a slave.”
              [The Anarchist Writings of William Godwin, p. 133, p. 134, p. 125 and p.
              126]
                Needless to say, anarchists have not be totally consistent in using this
              terminology. Some, for example, have referred to the capitalist and landlord
              classes as being the “possessing classes.” Others prefer to use the term
              “personal property” rather than “possession” or “capital” rather than “private
              property.” Some, like many individualist anarchists, use the term “property”
              in a general sense and qualify it with “occupancy and use” in the case of land,
              housing and workplaces. However, no matter the speciﬁc words used, the key
              idea is the same.
              B.3.2 What kinds of property does the state protect?
                Kropotkin argued that the state was “the instrument for establishing
              monopolies in favour of the ruling minorities.” [Anarchism, p. 286] In every
              system of class exploitation, a ruling class controls access to the means of
              production in order to extract tribute from labour. Capitalism is no exception.
              In this system the state maintains various kinds of “class monopolies” (to use
              Tucker’s phrase) to ensure that workers do not receive their “natural wage,”
              the full product of their labour. While some of these monopolies are obvious
              (such as tariﬀs, state granted market monopolies and so on), most are “behind
              the scenes” and work to ensure that capitalist domination does not need
              extensive force to maintain.
327 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                Under capitalism, there are four major kinds of property, or exploitative
              monopolies, that the state protects:
                By enforcing these forms of property, the state ensures that the objective
              conditions within the economy favour the capitalist, with the worker free only
              to accept oppressive and exploitative contracts within which they forfeit their
              autonomy and promise obedience or face misery and poverty. Due to these
              “initiations of force” conducted previously to any speciﬁc contract being
              signed, capitalists enrich themselves at our expense because we “are
              compelled to pay a heavy tribute to property holders for the right of
              cultivating land or putting machinery into action.” [Kropotkin, The Conquest
              of Bread, p. 103] These conditions obviously also make a mockery of free
              agreement (see section B.4).
                These various forms of state intervention are considered so normal many
              people do not even think of them as such. Thus we ﬁnd defenders of “free
              market” capitalism thundering against forms of “state intervention” which are
              designed to aid the poor while seeing nothing wrong in defending intellectual
              property rights, corporations, absentee landlords and the other multitude of
              laws and taxes capitalists and their politicians have placed and kept upon the
              statute-books to skew the labour market in favour of themselves (see section
              F.8 on the state’s role in developing capitalism in the ﬁrst place).
                Needless to say, despite the supposedly subtle role of such “objective”
              pressures in controlling the working class, working class resistance has been
              such that capital has never been able to dispense with the powers of the state,
              both direct and indirect. When “objective” means of control fail, the
              capitalists will always turn to the use of state repression to restore the
              “natural” order. Then the “invisible” hand of the market is replaced by the
              visible ﬁst of the state and the indirect means of securing ruling class proﬁts
              and power are supplemented by more direct forms by the state. As we
              indicate in section D.1, state intervention beyond enforcing these forms of
              private property is the norm of capitalism, not the exception, and is done so to
              secure the power and proﬁts of the capitalist class.
                To indicate the importance of these state backed monopolies, we shall
              sketch their impact.
                The credit monopoly, by which the state controls who can and cannot issue
              or loan money, reduces the ability of working class people to create their own
              alternatives to capitalism. By charging high amounts of interest on loans
              (which is only possible because competition is restricted) few people can
              aﬀord to create co-operatives or one-person ﬁrms. In addition, having to repay
              loans at high interest to capitalist banks ensures that co-operatives often have
              to undermine their own principles by having to employ wage labour to make
              ends meet (see section J.5.11). It is unsurprising, therefore, that the very
              successful Mondragon co-operatives in the Basque Country created their own
              credit union which is largely responsible for the experiment’s success.
                Just as increasing wages is an important struggle within capitalism, so is
              the question of credit. Proudhon and his followers supported the idea of a
              People’s Bank. If the working class could take over and control increasing
              amounts of money it could undercut capitalist power while building its own
              alternative social order (for money is ultimately the means of buying labour
              power, and so authority over the labourer — which is the key to surplus value

              production). Proudhon hoped that by credit being reduced to cost (namely
              administration charges) workers would be able to buy the means of
              production they needed. While most anarchists would argue that increased
              working class access to credit would no more bring down capitalism than
              increased wages, all anarchists recognise how more cheap credit, like more
              wages, can make life easier for working people and how the struggle for such
              credit, like the struggle for wages, might play a useful role in the development
              of the power of the working class within capitalism. Obvious cases that spring
              to mind are those where money has been used by workers to ﬁnance their
              struggles against capital, from strike funds and weapons to the periodical
              avoidance of work made possible by suﬀiciently high money income.
              Increased access to cheap credit would give working class people slightly
              more options than selling their liberty or facing misery (just as increased
              wages and unemployment beneﬁt also gives us more options).
                Therefore, the credit monopoly reduces competition to capitalism from cooperatives (which are generally more productive than capitalist ﬁrms) while
              at the same time forcing down wages for all workers as the demand for labour
              is lower than it would otherwise be. This, in turn, allows capitalists to use the
              fear of the sack to extract higher levels of surplus value from employees, so
              consolidating capitalist power (within and outwith the workplace) and
              expansion (increasing set-up costs and so creating oligarchic markets
              dominated by a few ﬁrms). In addition, high interest rates transfer income
              directly from producers to banks. Credit and money are both used as weapons
              in the class struggle. This is why, again and again, we see the ruling class call
              for centralised banking and use state action (from the direct regulation of
              money itself, to the attempted management of its ﬂows by the manipulation of
              the interest) in the face of repeated threats to the nature (and role) of money
              within capitalism.
                The credit monopoly has other advantages for the elite. The 1980s were
              marked by a rising debt burden on households as well as the increased
              concentration of wealth in the US. The two are linked. Due to “the decline in
              real hourly wages, and the stagnation in household incomes, the middle and
              lower classes have borrowed more to stay in place” and they have “borrowed
              from the very rich who have [become] richer.” By 1997, US households spent
              $1 trillion (or 17% of the after-tax incomes) on debt service. “This represents
              a massive upward redistribution of income.” And why did they borrow? The
              bottom 40% of the income distribution “borrowed to compensate for stagnant
              or falling incomes” while the upper 20% borrowed “mainly to invest.” Thus
              “consumer credit can be thought of as a way to sustain mass consumption in
              the face of stagnant or falling wages. But there’s an additional social and
              political bonus, from the point of view of the creditor class: it reduces
              pressure for higher wages by allowing people to buy goods they couldn’t
              otherwise aﬀord. It helps to nourish both the appearance and reality of a
              middle-class standard of living in a time of polarisation. And debt can be a
              great conservatising force; with a large monthly mortgage and/or MasterCard
              bill, strikes and other forms of troublemaking look less appealing than they
              would other wise.” [Doug Henwood, Wall Street, pp. 64–6]
                Thus credit “is an important form of social coercion; mortgaged workers are
              more pliable.” [Henwood, Op. Cit., p. 232] Money is power and any means

              which lessens that power by increasing the options of workers is considered a
              threat by the capitalist class — whether it is tight labour markets, state
              provided unemployment beneﬁt, or cheap, self-organised, credit — will be
              resisted. The credit monopoly can, therefore, only be fought as part of a
              broader attack on all forms of capitalist social power.
                In summary, the credit monopoly, by artiﬁcially restricting the option to
              work for ourselves, ensures we work for a boss while also enriching the few at
              the expense of the many.
                The land monopoly consists of enforcement by government of land titles
              which do not rest upon personal occupancy and use. It also includes making
              the squatting of abandoned housing and other forms of property illegal. This
              leads to ground-rent, by which landlords get payment for letting others use
              the land they own but do not actually cultivate or use. It also allows the
              ownership and control of natural resources like oil, gas, coal and timber. This
              monopoly is particularly exploitative as the owner cannot claim to have
              created the land or its resources. It was available to all until the landlord
              claimed it by fencing it oﬀ and barring others from using it.
                Until the nineteenth century, the control of land was probably the single
              most important form of privilege by which working people were forced to
              accept less than its product as a wage. While this monopoly is less important
              in a modern capitalist society (as few people know how to farm), it still plays a
              role (particularly in terms of ownership of natural resources). At a minimum,
              every home and workplace needs land on which to be built. Thus while
              cultivation of land has become less important, the use of land remains crucial.
              The land monopoly, therefore, ensures that working people ﬁnd no land to
              cultivate, no space to set up shop and no place to sleep without ﬁrst having to
              pay a landlord a sum for the privilege of setting foot on the land they own but
              neither created nor use. At best, the worker has mortgaged their life for
              decades to get their wee bit of soil or, at worse, paid their rent and remained
              as property-less as before. Either way, the landlords are richer for the
              exchange.
                Moreover, the land monopoly did play an important role in creating
              capitalism (also see section F.8.3). This took two main forms. Firstly, the state
              enforced the ownership of large estates in the hands of a single family. Taking
              the best land by force, these landlords turned vast tracks of land into parks
              and hunting grounds so forcing the peasants little option but to huddle
              together on what remained. Access to superior land was therefore only
              possible by paying a rent for the privilege, if at all. Thus an elite claimed
              ownership of vacant lands, and by controlling access to it (without themselves
              ever directly occupying or working it) they controlled the labouring classes of
              the time. Secondly, the ruling elite also simply stole land which had
              traditionally been owned by the community. This was called enclosure, the
              process by which common land was turned into private property. Economist
              William Lazonick summaries this process:
                   “The reorganisation of agricultural land [the enclosure movement]
                   … inevitably undermined the viability of traditional peasant
                   agriculture . .. [it] created a sizeable labour force of disinherited
                   peasants with only tenuous attachments to the land. To earn a

                   living, many of these peasants turned to ‘domestic industry’ — the
                   production of goods in their cottages … It was the eighteenth
                   century expansion of domestic industry … that laid the basis for the
                   British Industrial Revolution. The emergence of labour-saving
                   machine technology transformed … textile manufacture … and the
## factory replaced the family home as the predominant site of
## production.” [Business Organisation and the Myth of the
                   Market Economy, pp. 3–4]
                By being able to “legally” bar people from “their” property, the landlord
              class used the land monopoly to ensure the creation of a class of people with
              nothing to sell but their labour (i.e. liberty). Land was taken from those who
              traditionally used it, violating common rights, and it was used by the landlord
              to produce for their own proﬁt (more recently, a similar process has been
              going on in the Third World as well). Personal occupancy was replaced by
              landlordism and agricultural wage slavery, and so “the Enclosure Acts …
              reduced the agricultural population to misery, placed them at the mercy of the
              landowners, and forced a great number of them to migrate to the towns
              where, as proletarians, they were delivered to the mercy of the middle-class
              manufacturers.” [Peter Kropotkin, The Great French Revolution, vol. 1, pp.
              117–8]
                A variation of this process took place in countries like America, where the
              state took over ownership of vast tracks of land and then sold it to farmers. As
              Howard Zinn notes, the Homestead Act “gave 160 acres of western land,
              unoccupied and publicly owned, to anyone who would cultivate it for ﬁves
              years. Anyone willing to pay $1.25 an acre could buy a homestead. Few
              ordinary people had the $200 necessary to do this; speculators moved in and
              bought up much of the land.” [A People’s History of the United States, p.
              233] Those farmers who did pay the money often had to go into debt to do so,
              placing an extra burden on their labour. Vast tracks of land were also given to
              railroad and other companies either directly (by gift or by selling cheap) or by
              lease (in the form of privileged access to state owned land for the purpose of
              extracting raw materials like lumber and oil). Either way, access to land was
              restricted and those who actually did work it ended up paying a tribute to the
              landlord in one form or another (either directly in rent or indirectly by
              repaying a loan).
                This was the land monopoly in action (also see sections F.8.3, F.8.4 and F.8.5
              for more details) and from it sprang the tools and equipment monopoly as
              domestic industry could not survive in the face of industrial capitalism.
              Confronted with competition from industrial production growing rich on the
              proﬁts produced from cheap labour, the ability of workers to own their own
              means of production decreased over time. From a situation where most
              workers owned their own tools and, consequently, worked for themselves, we
              now face an economic regime were the tools and equipment needed for work
              are owned by a capitalists and, consequently, workers now work for a boss.
                The tools and equipment monopoly is similar to the land monopoly as it is
              based upon the capitalist denying workers access to their capital unless the
              worker pays tribute to the owner for using it. While capital is “simply storedup labour which has already received its pay in full” and so “the lender of
331 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              capital is entitled to its return intact, and nothing more” (to use Tucker’s
              words), due to legal privilege the capitalist is in a position to charge a “fee”
              for its use. This is because, with the working class legally barred from both
              the land and available capital (the means of life), members of that class have
              little option but to agree to wage contracts which let capitalists extract a
              “fee” for the use of their equipment (see section B.3.3).
                 Thus the capital-monopoly is, like the land monopoly, enforced by the state
              and its laws. This is most clearly seen if you look at the main form in which
              such capital is held today, the corporation. This is nothing more than a legal
              construct. “Over the last 150 years,” notes Joel Bakan, “the corporation has
              risen from relative obscurity to becomes the world’s dominant economic
              institution.” The law has been changed to give corporations “limited liability”
              and other perks in order “to attract valuable incorporation business … by
              jettisoning unpopular [to capitalists] restrictions from … corporate laws.”
              Finally, the courts “fully transformed the corporation onto a ‘person,’ with its
              own identity … and empowered, like a real person, to conduct business in its
              own name, acquire assets, employ workers, pay taxes, and go to court to
              assert its rights and defend its actions.” In America, this was achieved using
              the 14th Amendment (which was passed to protect freed slaves!). In summary,
              the corporation “is not an independent ‘person’ with its own rights, needs,
              and desires … It is a state-created tool for advancing social and economic
              policy.” [The Corporation, p. 5, p. 13, p. 16 and p. 158]
                 Nor can it be said that this monopoly is the product of hard work and
              saving. The capital-monopoly is a recent development and how this situation
              developed is usually ignored. If not glossed over as irrelevant, some fairy tale
              is spun in which a few bright people saved and worked hard to accumulate
              capital and the lazy majority ﬂocked to be employed by these (almost
              superhuman) geniuses. In reality, the initial capital for investing in industry
              came from wealth plundered from overseas or from the proceeds of feudal
              and landlord exploitation. In addition, as we discuss in section F.8, extensive
              state intervention was required to create a class of wage workers and ensure
              that capital was in the best position to exploit them. This explicit state
              intervention was scaled down once the capital-monopoly found its own feet.
                 Once this was achieved, state action became less explicit and becomes
              focused around defending the capitalists’ property rights. This is because the
              “fee” charged to workers was partly reinvested into capital, which reduced
              the prices of goods, ruining domestic industry and so narrowing the options
              available to workers in the economy. In addition, investment also increased
              the set-up costs of potential competitors, which continued the dispossession
              of the working class from the means of production as these “natural” barriers
              to entry into markets ensured few members of that class had the necessary
              funds to create co-operative workplaces of appropriate size. So while the land
              monopoly was essential to create capitalism, the “tools and equipment”
              monopoly that sprang from it soon became the mainspring of the system.
                 In this way usury became self-perpetuating, with apparently “free
              exchanges” being the means by which capitalist domination survives. In other
              words, “past initiations of force” combined with the current state protection
              of property ensure that capitalist domination of society continues with only
              the use of “defensive” force (i.e. violence used to protect the power of
332 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              property owners against unions, strikes, occupations, etc.). The “fees”
              extracted from previous generations of workers has ensured that the current
              one is in no position to re-unite itself with the means of life by “free
              competition” (in other words, the paying of usury ensures that usury
              continues). Needless to say, the surplus produced by this generation will be
              used to increase the capital stock and so ensure the dispossession of future
              generations and so usury becomes self-perpetuating. And, of course, state
              protection of “property” against “theft” by working people ensures that
              property remains theft and the real thieves keep their plunder.
                 As far as the “ideas” monopoly is concerned, this has been used to enrich
              capitalist corporations at the expense of the general public and the inventor.
              Patents make an astronomical price diﬀerence. Until the early 1970s, for
              example, Italy did not recognise drug patents. As a result, Roche Products
              charged the British National Health Service over 40 times more for patented
              components of Librium and Valium than charged by competitors in Italy. As
              Tucker argued, the patent monopoly “consists in protecting investors and
              authors against competition for a period long enough to enable them to extort
              from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labour measure of their
              services, — in other words, in giving certain people a right of property for a
              term of years and facts of nature, and the power to extract tribute from others
              for the use of this natural wealth which should be open to all.” [The
              Individualist Anarchists, p. 86]
                 The net eﬀect of this can be terrible. The Uruguay Round of global trade
              negotiations “strengthen intellectual property rights. American and other
              Western drug companies could now stop drug companies in India and Brazil
              from ‘stealing’ their intellectual property. But these drug companies in the
              developing world were making these life-saving drugs available to their
              citizens at a fraction of the price at which the drugs were sold by the Western
              drug companies … Proﬁts of the Western drug companies would go up … but
              the increases proﬁts from sales in the developing world were small, since few
              could aﬀord the drugs … [and so] thousands were eﬀectively condemned to
              death, becomes governments and individuals in developing countries could no
              longer pay the high prices demanded.” [Joseph Stiglitz, Globalisation and
              its discontents, pp. 7–8] While international outrage over AIDS drugs
              eventually forced the drug companies to sell the drugs at cost price in late
              2001, the underlying intellectual property rights regime was still in place.
                 The irony that this regime was created in a process allegedly about trade
              liberalisation should not go unnoticed. “Intellectual property rights,” as Noam
              Chomsky correctly points out, “are a protectionist measure, they have nothing
              to do with free trade — in fact, they’re the exact opposite of free trade.”
              [Understanding Power, p. 282] The fundamental injustice of the “ideas
              monopoly” is exacerbated by the fact that many of these patented products
              are the result of government funding of research and development, with
              private industry simply reaping monopoly proﬁts from technology it did not
              spend a penny to develop. In fact, extending government aid for research and
              development is considered an important and acceptable area of state
              intervention by governments and companies verbally committed to the neoliberal agenda.
                 The “ideas monopoly” actually works against its own rationale. Patents

              suppress innovation as much as they encourage it. The research scientists
              who actually do the work of inventing are required to sign over patent rights
              as a condition of employment, while patents and industrial security programs
              used to bolster competitive advantage on the market actually prevent the
              sharing of information, so reducing innovation (this evil is being particularly
              felt in universities as the new “intellectual property rights” regime is
              spreading there). Further research stalls as the incremental innovation based
              on others’ patents is hindered while the patent holder can rest on their laurels
              as they have no fear of a competitor improving the invention. They also
              hamper technical progress because, by their very nature, preclude the
              possibility of independent discovery. Also, of course, some companies own a
              patent explicitly not to use it but simply to prevent someone else from so
              doing.
                 As Noam Chomsky notes, today trade agreements like GATT and NAFTA
              “impose a mixture of liberalisation and protection, going far beyond trade,
              designed to keep wealth and power ﬁrmly in the hands of the masters.” Thus
              “investor rights are to be protected and enhanced” and a key demand “is
              increased protection for ‘intellectual property,’ including software and
              patents, with patent rights extending to process as well as product” in order
              to “ensure that US-based corporations control the technology of the future”
              and so “locking the poor majority into dependence on high-priced products of
              Western agribusiness, biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry and so on.”
              [World Orders, Old and New, p. 183, p. 181 and pp. 182–3] This means that
              if a company discovers a new, more eﬀicient, way of producing a drug then
              the “ideas monopoly” will stop them and so “these are not only highly
              protectionist measures … they’re a blow against economic eﬀiciency and
              technological process — that just shows you how much ‘free trade’ really is
              involved in all of this.” [Chomsky, Understanding Power, p. 282]
                 All of which means that the corporations (and their governments) in the
              developed world are trying to prevent emergence of competition by
              controlling the ﬂow of technology to others. The “free trade” agreements are
              being used to create monopolies for their products and this will either block
              or slow down the rise of competition. While corporate propagandists piously
              denounce “anti-globalisation” activists as enemies of the developing world,
              seeking to use trade barriers to maintain their (Western) lifestyles at the
              expense of the poor nations, the reality is diﬀerent. The “ideas monopoly” is
              being aggressively used to either suppress or control the developing world’s
              economic activity in order to keep the South as, eﬀectively, one big
              sweatshop. As well as reaping monopoly proﬁts directly, the threat of “lowwage” competition from the developing world can be used to keep the wage
              slaves of the developed world in check and so maintain proﬁt levels at home.
                 This is not all. Like other forms of private property, the usury produced by it
              helps ensure it becomes self-perpetuating. By creating “legal” absolute
              monopolies and reaping the excess proﬁts these create, capitalists not only
              enrich themselves at the expense of others, they also ensure their dominance
              in the market. Some of the excess proﬁts reaped due to patents and
              copyrights are invested back into the company, securing advantages by
              creating various “natural” barriers to entry for potential competitors. Thus
              patents impact on business structure, encouraging the formation and

              dominance of big business.
                Looking at the end of the nineteenth century, the ideas monopoly played a
              key role in promoting cartels and, as a result, laid the foundation for what was
              to become corporate capitalism in the twentieth century. Patents were used
              on a massive scale to promote concentration of capital, erect barriers to entry,
              and maintain a monopoly of advanced technology in the hands of western
              corporations. The exchange or pooling of patents between competitors,
              historically, has been a key method for the creation of cartels in industry. This
              was true especially of the electrical appliance, communications, and chemical
              industries. For example, by the 1890s, two large companies, General Electric
              and Westinghouse, “monopolised a substantial part of the American electrical
              manufacturing industry, and their success had been in large measure the
              result of patent control.” The two competitors simply pooled their patents and
              “yet another means of patent and market control had developed: corporate
              patent-pooling agreements. Designed to minimise the expense and
              uncertainties of conﬂict between the giants, they greatly reinforced the
              position of each vis-à-vis lesser competitors and new entrants into the ﬁeld.”
              [David Noble, American By Design, p. 10]
                While the patent system is, in theory, promoted to defend the small scale
              inventor, in reality it is corporate interests that beneﬁt. As David Noble points
              out, the “inventor, the original focus of the patent system, tended to
              increasingly to ‘abandon’ his patent in exchange for corporate security; he
              either sold or licensed his patent rights to industrial corporations or assigned
              them to the company of which he became an employee, bartering his genius
              for a salary. In addition, by means of patent control gained through purchase,
              consolidation, patent pools, and cross-licensing agreements, as well as by
              regulated patent production through systematic industrial research, the
              corporations steadily expanded their ‘monopoly of monopolies.’” As well as
              this, corporations used “patents to circumvent anti-trust laws.” This reaping
              of monopoly proﬁts at the expense of the customer made such “tremendous
              strides” between 1900 and 1929 and “were of such proportions as to render
              subsequent judicial and legislative eﬀects to check corporate monopoly
              through patent control too little too late.” [Op. Cit., p. 87, p. 84 and p. 88]
                Things have changed little since Edwin Prindle, a corporate patent lawyer,
              wrote in 1906 that:
                   “Patents are the best and most eﬀective means of controlling
## competition. They occasionally give absolute command of the
                   market, enabling their owner to name the price without regard to
                   the cost of production… Patents are the only legal form of absolute
## monopoly .. . The power which a patentee has to dictate the
                   conditions under which his monopoly may be exercised had been
## used to form trade agreements throughout practically entire
                   industries.” [quoted by Noble, Op. Cit., p. 89]
                Thus, the ruling class, by means of the state, is continually trying to develop
              new forms of private property by creating artiﬁcial scarcities and monopolies,
              e.g. by requiring expensive licenses to engage in particular types of activities,
              such as broadcasting or producing certain kinds of medicines or products. In
              the “Information Age,” usury (use fees) from intellectual property are

              becoming a much more important source of income for elites, as reﬂected in
              the attention paid to strengthening mechanisms for enforcing copyright and
              patents in the recent GATT agreements, or in US pressure on foreign
              countries (like China) to respect such laws.
                This allows corporations to destroy potential competitors and ensure that
              their prices can be set as high as possible (and monopoly proﬁts maintained
              indeﬁnitely). It also allows them to enclose ever more of the common
              inheritance of humanity, place it under private ownership and charge the
              previous users money to gain access to it. As Chomsky notes, “U.S.
              corporations must control seeds, plant varieties, drugs, and the means of life
              generally.” [World Orders, Old and New, p. 183] This has been termed “biopiracy” (a better term may be the new enclosures) and it is a process by
              which “international companies [are] patenting traditional medicines or
              foods.” They “seek to make money from ‘resources’ and knowledge that
              rightfully belongs to the developing countries” and “in so doing, they squelch
              domestic ﬁrms that have long provided the products. While it is not clear
              whether these patents would hold up in court if they were eﬀectively
              challenged, it is clear that the less developed countries many not have the
              legal and ﬁnancial resources required to challenge the patent.” [Joseph
              Stiglitz, Op. Cit., p. 246] They may also not withstand the economic pressures
              they may experience if the international markets conclude that such acts
              indicate a regime that is less that business friendly. That the people who were
              dependent on the generic drugs or plants can no longer aﬀord them is as
              irrelevant as the impediments to scientiﬁc and technological advance they
              create.
                In other words, capitalists desire to skew the “free market” in their favour
              by ensuring that the law reﬂects and protects their interests, namely their
              “property rights.” By this process they ensure that co-operative tendencies
              within society are crushed by state-supported “market forces.” As Noam
              Chomsky puts it, modern capitalism is “state protection and public subsidy for
              the rich, market discipline for the poor.” [“Rollback, Part I”, Z Magazine]
              Self-proclaimed defenders of “free market” capitalism are usually nothing of
              the kind, while the few who actually support it only object to the “public
              subsidy” aspect of modern capitalism and happily support state protection for
              property rights.
                All these monopolies seek to enrich the capitalist (and increase their capital
              stock) at the expense of working people, to restrict their ability to undermine
              the ruling elites power and wealth. All aim to ensure that any option we have
              to work for ourselves (either individually or collectively) is restricted by tilting
              the playing ﬁeld against us, making sure that we have little option but to sell
              our labour on the “free market” and be exploited. In other words, the various
              monopolies make sure that “natural” barriers to entry (see section C.4) are
              created, leaving the heights of the economy in the control of big business
              while alternatives to capitalism are marginalised at its fringes.
                So it is these kinds of property and the authoritarian social relationships
              that they create which the state exists to protect. It should be noted that
              converting private to state ownership (i.e. nationalisation) does not
              fundamentally change the nature of property relationships; it just removes
              private capitalists and replaces them with bureaucrats (as we discuss in
336 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              section B.3.5).
              B.3.3 Why is property exploitative?
                To answer this question, consider the monopoly of productive “tools and
              equipment.” This monopoly, obtained by the class of industrial capitalists,
              allows this class in eﬀect to charge workers a “fee” for the privilege of using
              the monopolised tools and equipment.
                This occurs because property, in Proudhon words, “excommunicates” the
              working class. This means that private property creates a class of people who
              have no choice but to work for a boss in order to pay the landlord rent or buy
              the goods they, as a class, produce but do not own. The state enforces
              property rights in land, workplaces and so on, meaning that the owner can
              bar others from using them and enforce their rules on those they do let use
              “their” property. So the boss “gives you a job; that is, permission to work in
              the factory or mill which was not built by him but by other workers like
              yourself. And for that permission you help to support him for … as long as you
              work for him.” [Alexander Berkman, What is Anarchism?, p. 14] This is
              called wage labour and is, for anarchists, the deﬁning characteristic of
              capitalism.
                This class of people who are dependent on wages to survive was sometimes
              called the “proletariat” by nineteenth century anarchists. Today most
              anarchists usually call it the “working class” as most workers in modern
              capitalist nations are wage workers rather than peasants or artisans (i.e. selfemployed workers who are also exploited by the private property system, but
              in diﬀerent ways). It should also be noted that property used in this way (i.e.
              to employ and exploit other people’s labour) is also called “capital” by
              anarchists and other socialists. Thus, for anarchists, private property
              generates a class system, a regime in which the few, due to their ownership of
              wealth and the means of producing it, rule over the many who own very little
              (see section B.7 for more discussion of classes).
                This ensures that the few can proﬁt from the work of others:
                   “In the capitalist system the working man cannot [in general] work
                   for himself … So … you must ﬁnd an employer. You work for him …
                   In the capitalist system the whole working class sells its labour
                   power to the employing class. The workers build factories, make
                   machinery and tools, and produce goods. The employers keep the
                   factories, the machinery, the tools and the goods for themselves as
## their proﬁt. The workers only get their wages … Though the
                   workers, as a class, have built the factories, a slice of their daily
                   labour is taken from them for the privilege of using those factories
## … Though the workers have made the tools and the machinery,
                   another slice of their daily labour is taken from them for the
## privilege of using those tools and machinery …

## “Can you guess now why the wisdom of Proudhon said that the
                   possessions of the rich are stolen property? Stolen from the
                   producer, the worker.” [Berkman, Op. Cit., pp. 7–8]
337 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                Thus the daily theft/exploitation associated with capitalism is dependent on
              the distribution of wealth and private property (i.e. the initial theft of the
              means of life, the land, workplaces and housing by the owning class). Due to
              the dispossession of the vast majority of the population from the means of life,
              capitalists are in an ideal position to charge a “use-fee” for the capital they
              own, but neither produced nor use. Having little option, workers agree to
              contracts within which they forfeit their autonomy during work and the
              product of that work. This results in capitalists having access to a
              “commodity” (labour) that can potentially produce more value than it gets
              paid for in wages.
                For this situation to arise, for wage labour to exist, workers must not own or
              control the means of production they use. As a consequence, are controlled by
              those who do own the means of production they use during work hours. As
              their labour is owned by their boss and as labour cannot be separated from
              the person who does it, the boss eﬀectively owns the worker for the duration
              of the working day and, as a consequence, exploitation becomes possible. This
              is because during working hours, the owner can dictate (within certain limits
              determined by worker resistance and solidarity as well as objective
              conditions, such as the level of unemployment within an industry or country)
              the organisation, level, duration, conditions, pace and intensity of work, and
              so the amount of output (which the owner has sole rights over even though
              they did not produce it).
                Thus the “fee” (or “surplus value”) is created by owners paying workers less
              than the full value added by their labour to the products or services they
              create for the ﬁrm. The capitalist’s proﬁt is thus the diﬀerence between this
              “surplus value,” created by and appropriated from labour, minus the ﬁrm’s
              overhead and cost of raw materials (See also section C.2 — “Where do proﬁts
              come from?”).
                So property is exploitative because it allows a surplus to be monopolised by
              the owners. Property creates hierarchical relationships within the workplace
              (the “tools and equipment monopoly” might better be called the “power
              monopoly”) and as in any hierarchical system, those with the power use it to
              protect and further their own interests at the expense of others. Within the
              workplace there is resistance by workers to this oppression and exploitation,
              which the “hierarchical . .. relations of the capitalist enterprise are designed
              to resolve this conﬂict in favour of the representatives of capital.” [William
              Lazonick, Op. Cit., p. 184]
                Needless to say, the state is always on hand to protect the rights of property
              and management against the actions of the dispossessed. When it boils down
              to it, it is the existence of the state as protector of the “power monopoly” that
              allows it to exist at all.
                So, capitalists are able to appropriate this surplus value from workers solely
              because they own the means of production, not because they earn it by doing
              productive work themselves. Of course some capitalists may also contribute
              to production, in which case they are in fairness entitled to the amount of
              value added to the ﬁrm’s output by their own labour; but owners typically pay
              themselves much more than this, and are able to do so because the state
              guarantees them that right as property owners (which is unsurprising, as they
              alone have knowledge of the ﬁrms inputs and outputs and, like all people in
338 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              unaccountable positions, abuse that power — which is partly why anarchists
              support direct democracy as the essential counterpart of free agreement, for
              no one in power can be trusted not to prefer their own interests over those
              subject to their decisions). And of course many capitalists hire managers to
              run their businesses for them, thus collecting income for doing nothing except
              owning.
                Capitalists’ proﬁts, then, are a form of state-supported exploitation. This is
              equally true of the interest collected by bankers and rents collected by
              landlords. Without some form of state, these forms of exploitation would be
              impossible, as the monopolies on which they depend could not be maintained.
              For instance, in the absence of state troops and police, workers would simply
              take over and operate factories for themselves, thus preventing capitalists
              from appropriating an unjust share of the surplus they create.
              B.3.4 Can private property be justiﬁed?
                No. Even though a few supporters of capitalism recognise that private
              property, particularly in land, was created by the use of force, most maintain
              that private property is just. One common defence of private property is found
              in the work of Robert Nozick (a supporter of “free market” capitalism). For
              Nozick, the use of force makes acquisition illegitimate and so any current title
              to the property is illegitimate (in other words, theft and trading in stolen
              goods does not make ownership of these goods legal). So, if the initial
              acquisition of land was illegitimate then all current titles are also illegitimate.
              And since private ownership of land is the basis of capitalism, capitalism itself
              would be rendered illegal.
                To get round this problem, Nozick utilises the work of Locke (“The Lockean
              Proviso”) which can be summarised as:
                However, there are numerous ﬂaws in this theory. Most obvious is why does
              the mixing of something you own (labour) with something owned by all (or
              unowned) turn it in your property? Surely it would be as likely to simply mean
              that you have lost the labour you have expended (for example, few would
              argue that you owned a river simply because you swam or ﬁshed in it). Even if
              we assume the validity of the argument and acknowledge that by working on
              a piece of land creates ownership, why assume that this ownership must be
              based on capitalist property rights? Many cultures have recognised no such
              “absolute” forms of property, admitted the right of property in what is
              produced but not the land itself.
                As such, the assumption that expending labour turns the soil into private
              property does not automatically hold. You could equally argue the opposite,
              namely that labour, while producing ownership of the goods created, does not
              produce property in land, only possession. In the words of Proudhon:
                   “I maintain that the possessor is paid for his trouble and industry .. .
                   but that he acquires no right to the land. ‘Let the labourer have the
                   fruits of his labour.’ Very good; but I do not understand that
                   property in products carries with it property in raw material. Does
                   the skill of the ﬁsherman, who on the same coast can catch more
                   ﬁsh than his fellows, make him proprietor of the ﬁshing-grounds?

                   Can the expertness of a hunter ever be regarded as a property-title
## to a game-forest? The analogy is perfect, — the industrious
                   cultivator ﬁnds the reward of his industry in the abundancy and
                   superiority of his crop. If he has made improvements in the soil, he
## has the possessor’s right of preference. Never, under any
                   circumstances, can he be allowed to claim a property-title to the soil
                   which he cultivates, on the ground of his skill as a cultivator.
                   “To change possession into property, something is needed besides
                   labour, without which a man would cease to be proprietor as soon as
## he ceased to be a laborer. Now, the law bases property upon
                   immemorial, unquestionable possession; that is, prescription.
                   Labour is only the sensible sign, the physical act, by which
                   occupation is manifested. If, then, the cultivator remains proprietor
                   after he has ceased to labor and produce; if his possession, ﬁrst
                   conceded, then tolerated, ﬁnally becomes inalienable, — it happens
                   by permission of the civil law, and by virtue of the principle of
                   occupancy. So true is this, that there is not a bill of sale, not a farm
## lease, not an annuity, but implies it .. .

                   “Man has created every thing — every thing save the material itself.
                   Now, I maintain that this material he can only possess and use, on
                   condition of permanent labor, — granting, for the time being, his
## right of property in things which he has produced.

                   “This, then, is the ﬁrst point settled: property in product, if we grant
                   so much, does not carry with it property in the means of production;
                   that seems to me to need no further demonstration. There is no
                   diﬀerence between the soldier who possesses his arms, the mason
                   who possesses the materials committed to his care, the ﬁsherman
                   who possesses the water, the hunter who possesses the ﬁelds and
                   forests, and the cultivator who possesses the lands: all, if you say so,
                   are proprietors of their products — not one is proprietor of the
                   means of production. The right to product is exclusive --jus in re;
                   the right to means is common — jus ad rem.” [What is Property?,
                   pp. 120–1]
                 Proudhon’s argument has far more historical validity than Nozick’s.
              Common ownership of land combined with personal use has been the
              dominant form of property rights for tens of thousands of years while Nozick’s
              “natural law” theory dates back to Locke’s work in the seventh century (itself
              an attempt to defend the encroachment of capitalist norms of ownership over
              previous common law ones). Nozick’s theory only appears valid because we
              live in a society where the dominant form of property rights are capitalist. As
              such, Nozick is begging the question — he is assuming the thing he is trying
              to prove.
                 Ignoring these obvious issues, what of Nozick’s actual argument?
                 The ﬁrst thing to note is that it is a fairy tale, it is a myth. The current
              property system and its distribution of resources and ownership rights is a
              product of thousands of years of conﬂict, coercion and violence. As such,
340 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              given Nozick’s arguments, it is illegitimate and the current owners have no
              right to deprive others of access to them or to object to taxation or
              expropriation. However, it is precisely this conclusion which Nozick seeks to
              eliminate by means of his story. By presenting an ahistoric thought
              experiment, he hopes to convince the reader to ignore the actual history of
              property in order to defend the current owners of property from
              redistribution. Nozick’s theory is only taken seriously because, ﬁrstly, it
              assumes the very thing it is trying to justify (i.e. capitalist property rights)
              and, as such, has a superﬁcial coherence as a result and, secondly, it has
              obvious political utility for the rich.
                 The second thing to note is that the argument itself is deeply ﬂawed. To see
              why, take (as an example) two individuals who share land in common. Nozick
              allows for one individual to claim the land as their own as long as the “process
              normally giving rise to a permanent bequeathable property right in a
              previously unowned thing will not do so if the position of others no longer at
              liberty to use the thing is therefore worsened.” [Anarchy, State and Utopia,
              p. 178] Given this, one of our two land sharers can appropriate the land as
              long as they can provide the other with a wage greater than what they were
              originally producing. If this situation is achieved then, according to Nozick,
              the initial appropriation was just and so are all subsequent market exchanges.
              In this way, the unowned world becomes owned and a market system based
              on capitalist property rights in productive resources (the land) and labour
              develop.
                 Interestingly, for a ideology that calls itself “libertarian” Nozick’s theory
              deﬁnes “worse oﬀ” in terms purely of material welfare, compared to the
              conditions that existed within the society based upon common use. However,
              the fact is if one person appropriated the land that the other cannot live oﬀ
              the remaining land then we have a problem. The other person has no choice
              but to agree to become employed by the landowner. The fact that the new
              land owner oﬀers the other a wage to work their land that exceeds what the
              new wage slave originally produced may meet the “Lockean Proviso” misses
              the point. The important issue is that the new wage slave has no option but to
              work for another and, as a consequence, becomes subject to that person’s
              authority. In other words, being “worse oﬀ” in terms of liberty (i.e. autonomy
              or self-government) is irrelevant for Nozick, a very telling position to take.
                 Nozick claims to place emphasis on self-ownership in his ideology because
              we are separate individuals, each with our own life to lead. It is strange,
              therefore, to see that Nozick does not emphasise people’s ability to act on
              their own conception of themselves in his account of appropriation. Indeed,
              there is no objection to an appropriation that puts someone in an unnecessary
              and undesirable position of subordination and dependence on the will of
              others.
                 Notice that the fact that individuals are now subject to the decisions of
              other individuals is not considered by Nozick in assessing the fairness of the
              appropriation. The fact that the creation of private property results in the
              denial of important freedoms for wage slaves (namely, the wage slave has no
              say over the status of the land they had been utilising and no say over how
              their labour is used). Before the creation of private property, all managed
              their own work, had self-government in all aspects of their lives. After the
341 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              appropriation, the new wage slave has no such liberty and indeed must accept
              the conditions of employment within which they relinquish control over how
              they spend much of their time. That this is issue is irrelevant for the Lockean
              Proviso shows how concerned about liberty capitalism actually is.
                Considering Nozick’s many claims in favour of self-ownership and why it is
              important, you would think that the autonomy of the newly dispossessed wage
              slaves would be important to him. However, no such concern is to be found —
              the autonomy of wage slaves is treated as if it were irrelevant. Nozick claims
              that a concern for people’s freedom to lead their own lives underlies his
              theory of unrestricted property-rights, but, this apparently does not apply to
              wage slaves. His justiﬁcation for the creation of private property treats only
              the autonomy of the land owner as relevant. However, as Proudhon rightly
              argues:
                   “if the liberty of man is sacred, it is equally sacred in all individuals;
                   that, if it needs property for its objective action, that is, for its life,
                   the appropriation of material is equally necessary for all … Does it
                   not follow that if one individual cannot prevent another … from
                   appropriating an amount of material equal to his own, no more can
                   he prevent individuals to come.” [Op. Cit., pp. 84–85]
                The implications of Nozick’s argument become clear once we move beyond
              the initial acts of appropriation to the situation of a developed capitalist
              economy. In such a situation, all of the available useful land has been
              appropriated. There is massive diﬀerences in who owns what and these
              diﬀerences are passed on to the next generation. Thus we have a (minority)
              class of people who own the world and a class of people (the majority) who
              can only gain access to the means of life on terms acceptable to the former.
              How can the majority really be said to own themselves if they may do nothing
              without the permission of others (the owning minority).
                Under capitalism people are claimed to own themselves, but this is purely
              formal as most people do not have independent access to resources. And as
              they have to use other peoples’ resources, they become under the control of
              those who own the resources. In other words, private property reduces the
              autonomy of the majority of the population and creates a regime of authority
              which has many similarities to enslavement. As John Stuart Mill put it:
                   “No longer enslaved or made dependent by force of law, the great
                   majority are so by force of property; they are still chained to a
                   place, to an occupation, and to conformity with the will of an
## employer, and debarred by the accident of birth to both the
## enjoyments, and from the mental and moral advantages, which
                   others inherit without exertion and independently of desert. That
                   this is an evil equal to almost any of those against which mankind
                   have hitherto struggles, the poor are not wrong in believing.”
                   [“Chapters on Socialism”, Principles of Political Economy, pp.
                   377–8]
                Capitalism, even though claiming formal self-ownership, in fact not only
              restricts the self-determination of working class people, it also makes them a
342 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              resource for others. Those who enter the market after others have
              appropriated all the available property are limited to charity or working for
              others. The latter, as we discuss in section C, results in exploitation as the
              worker’s labour is used to enrich others. Working people are compelled to cooperate with the current scheme of property and are forced to beneﬁt others.
              This means that self-determination requires resources as well as rights over
              one’s physical and mental being. Concern for self-determination (i.e.
              meaningful self-ownership) leads us to common property plus workers’
              control of production and so some form of libertarian socialism — not private
              property and capitalism.
                 And, of course, the appropriation of the land requires a state to defend it
              against the dispossessed as well as continuous interference in people’s lives.
              Left to their own devices, people would freely use the resources around them
              which they considered unjustly appropriated by others and it is only
              continuous state intervention that prevents then from violating Nozick’s
              principles of justice (to use Nozick’s own terminology, the “Lockean Proviso”
              is a patterned theory, his claims otherwise not withstanding).
                 In addition, we should note that private ownership by one person
              presupposes non-ownership by others (“we who belong to the proletaire class,
              property excommunicates us!” [Proudhon, Op. Cit., p. 105]) and so the “free
              market” restricts as well as creates liberties just as any other economic
              system. Hence the claim that capitalism constitutes “economic liberty” is
              obviously false. In fact, it is based upon denying liberty for the vast majority
              during work hours (as well as having serious impacts on liberty outwith work
              hours due to the eﬀects of concentrations of wealth upon society).
                 Perhaps Nozick can claim that the increased material beneﬁts of private
              property makes the acquisition justiﬁed. However, it seems strange that a
              theory supporting “liberty” should consider well oﬀ slaves to be better than
              poor free men and women. As Nozick claims that the wage slaves consent is
              not required for the initial acquisition, so perhaps he can claim that the gain
              in material welfare outweighs the loss of autonomy and so allows the initial
              act as an act of paternalism. But as Nozick opposes paternalism when it
              restricts private property rights he can hardly invoke it when it is required to
              generate these rights. And if we exclude paternalism and emphasise
              autonomy (as Nozick claims he does elsewhere in his theory), then justifying
              the initial creation of private property becomes much more diﬀicult, if not
              impossible.
                 And if each owner’s title to their property includes the historical shadow of
              the Lockean Proviso on appropriation, then such titles are invalid. Any title
              people have over unequal resources will be qualiﬁed by the facts that
              “property is theft” and that “property is despotism.” The claim that private
              property is economic liberty is obviously untrue, as is the claim that private
              property can be justiﬁed in terms of anything except “might is right.”
                 In summary, ”[i]f the right of life is equal, the right of labour is equal, and so
              is the right of occupancy.” This means that “those who do not possess today
              are proprietors by the same title as those who do possess; but instead of
              inferring therefrom that property should be shared by all, I demand, in the
              name of general security, its entire abolition.” [Proudhon, Op. Cit., p. 77 and
              p. 66] Simply put, if it is right for the initial appropriation of resources to be
343 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              made then, by that very same reason, it is right for others in the same and
              subsequent generations to abolish private property in favour of a system
              which respects the liberty of all rather than a few.
                For more anarchist analysis on private property and why it cannot be
              justiﬁed (be it by occupancy, labour, natural right, or whatever) consult
              Proudhon’s classic work What is Property?. For further discussion on
              capitalist property rights see section F.4.
              B.3.5 Is state owned property diﬀerent from private
              property?

## No, far from it.
                 State ownership should not be confused with the common or public
              ownership implied by the concept of “use rights.” The state is a hierarchical
              instrument of coercion and, as we discussed in section B.2, is marked by
              power being concentrated in a few hands. As the general populate is, by
              design, excluded from decision making within it this means that the state
              apparatus has control over the property in question. As the general public and
              those who use a piece of property are excluded from controlling it, state
              property is identical to private property. Instead of capitalists owning it, the
              state bureaucracy does.
                 This can easily be seen from the example of such so-called “socialist” states
              as the Soviet Union or China. To show why, we need only quote a market
              socialist who claims that China is not capitalist. According to David
              Schweickart a society is capitalist if, ”[i]n order to gain access to means of
              production (without which no one can work), most people must contract with
              people who own (or represent the owners of) such means. In exchange for a
              wage of a salary, they agree to supply the owners with a certain quantity and
              quality of labour. It is a crucial characteristic of the institution of wage
              labour that the goods or services produced do not belong to the
              workers who produce them but to those who supply the workers with
              the means of production.” Anarchists agree with Schweickart’s deﬁnition of
              capitalism. As such, he is right to argue that a “society of small farmers and
              artisans .. . is not a capitalist society, since wage labour is largely absent.” He
              is, however, wrong to assert that a “society in which most of [the] means of
              production are owned by the central government or by local communities —
              contemporary China, for example — is not a capitalist society, since private
              ownership of the means of production is not dominant.” [After Capitalism, p.
              23]
                 The reason is apparent. As Emma Goldman said (pointing out the obvious),
              if property is nationalised “it belongs to the state; this is, the government has
              control of it and can dispose of it according to its wishes and views … Such a
              condition of aﬀairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be fantastic to
              consider it in any sense Communistic” (as that needs the “socialisation of the
              land and of the machinery of production and distribution” which “belong[s] to
              the people, to be settled and used by individuals or groups according to their
              needs” based on “free access”). [Red Emma Speaks, pp. 406–7]
                 Thus, by Schweickart’s own deﬁnition, a system based on state ownership is
344 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              capitalist as the workers clearly do not own the own means of production they
              use, the state does. Neither do they own the goods or services they produce,
              the state which supplies the workers with the means of production does. The
              diﬀerence is that rather than being a number of diﬀerent capitalists there is
              only one, the state. It is, as Kropotkin warned, the “mere substitution … of the
              State as the universal capitalist for the present capitalists.” [Evolution and
              Environment, p. 106] This is why anarchists have tended to call such
              regimes “state capitalist” as the state basically replaces the capitalist as boss.
                 While this is most clear for regimes like China’s which are dictatorships, the
              logic also applies to democratic states. No matter if a state is democratic,
              state ownership is a form of exclusive property ownership which implies a
              social relationship which is totally diﬀerent from genuine forms of socialism.
              Common ownership and use rights produce social relationships based on
              liberty and equality. State ownership, however, presupposes the existence of a
              government machine, a centralised bureaucracy, which stands above the
              members of society, both as individuals and as a group, and has the power to
              coerce and dominate them. In other words, when a state owns the means of
              life, the members of society remain proletarians, non-owners, excluded from
              control. Both legally and in reality, the means of life belong not to them, but to
              the state. As the state is not an abstraction ﬂoating above society but rather a
              social institution made up of a speciﬁc group of human beings, this means
              that this group controls and so eﬀectively owns the property in question, not
              society as a whole nor those who actually use it. Just as the owning class
              excludes the majority, so does the state bureaucracy which means it owns the
              means of production, whether or not this is formally and legally recognised.
                 This explains why libertarian socialists have consistently stressed workers’
              self-management of production as the basis of any real form of socialism. To
              concentrate on ownership, as both Leninism and social democracy have done,
              misses the point. Needless to say, those regimes which have replaced
              capitalist ownership with state property have shown the validity the anarchist
              analysis in these matters (“all-powerful, centralised Government with State
              Capitalism as its economic expression,” to quote Emma Goldman’s summation
              of Lenin’s Russia [Op. Cit., p. 388]). State property is in no way
              fundamentally diﬀerent from private property — all that changes is who
              exploits and oppresses the workers.
                 For more discussion see section H.3.13 — “Why is state socialism just state
              capitalism?”
              B.4 How does capitalism aﬀect liberty?
                Private property is in many ways like a private form of state. The owner
              determines what goes on within the area he or she “owns,” and therefore
              exercises a monopoly of power over it. When power is exercised over one’s
              self, it is a source of freedom, but under capitalism it is a source of coercive
              authority. As Bob Black points out in The Abolition of Work:

## “The liberals and conservatives and Libertarians who lament

                   He tells you how much work to do and how fast. He is free to carry
                   his control to humiliating extremes, regulating, if he feels like it, the
                   clothes you wear or how often you go to the bathroom. With a few
                   exceptions he can ﬁre you for any reason, or no reason. He has you
                   spied on by snitches and supervisors, he amasses a dossier on every
                   employee. Talking back is called ‘insubordination,’ just as if a
                   worker is a naughty child, and it not only gets you ﬁred, it

                   system of domination I’ve described rules over half the waking
                   hours of a majority of women and the vast majority of men for
                   decades, for most of their lifespans. For certain purposes it’s not too
                   misleading to call our system democracy or capitalism or — better
                   still — industrialism, but its real names are factory fascism and
                   oﬀice oligarchy. Anybody who says these people are ‘free’ is lying or
                   stupid.” [The Abolition of Work and other essays, p. 21]
                 In response to this, defenders of capitalism usually say something along the
              lines of “It’s a free market and if you don’t like it, ﬁnd another job.” Of course,
              there are a number of problems with this response. Most obviously is the fact
              that capitalism is not and has never been a “free market.” As we noted in
              section B.2, a key role of the state has been to protect the interests of the
              capitalist class and, as a consequence of this, it has intervened time and time
              again to skew the market in favour of the bosses. As such, to inform us that
              capitalism is something it has never been in order to defend it from criticism
              is hardly convincing.
                 However, there is another more fundamental issue with the response,
              namely the assumption that tyranny is an acceptable form of human
              interaction. To say that your option is either tolerate this boss or seek out
              another (hopefully more liberal) one suggests an utter lack of understanding
              what freedom is. Freedom is not the opportunity to pick a master, it is to be
              have autonomy over yourself. What capitalist ideology has achieved is to
              confuse having the ability to pick a master with freedom, that consent equates
              to liberty — regardless of the objective circumstances shaping the choices
              being made or the nature of the social relationships such choices produce.
                 While we return to this argument in section B.4.3, a few words seem
              appropriate now. To see why the capitalist response misses the point, we need
              only transfer the argument from the economic regime to the political. Let us
              assume a system of dictatorial states on an island. Each regime is a monarchy
              (i.e. a dictatorship). The King of each land decrees what his subjects do, who
              they associate with and, moreover, appropriates the fruit of their labour in
              exchange for food, clothing and shelter for however many hours a day he
              wants (the King is generous and allows his subjects some time to themselves
              in the evening and weekends). Some of the Kings even decree what their
              subjects will wear and how they will greet their fellow subjects. Few people
              would say that those subject to such arrangements are free.
                 Now, if we add the condition that any subject is free to leave a Kingdom but
              only if another King will let them join his regime, does that make it any more
346 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              freer? Slightly, but not by much. The subjects how have a limited choice in
              who can govern them but the nature of the regime they are subjected to does
              not change. What we would expect to see happen is that those subjects whose
              skills are in demand will get better, more liberal, conditions than the others
              (as long as they are in demand). For the majority the conditions they are
              forced to accept will be as bad as before as they are easily replaceable. Both
              sets of subjects, however, are still under the autocratic rule of the monarchs.
              Neither are free but the members of one set have a more liberal regime than
              the others, dependent on the whims of the autocrats and their need for labour.
                 That this thought experiment reﬂects the way capitalism operates is clear.
              Little wonder anarchists have echoed Proudhon’s complaint that “our large
              capitalist associations [are] organised in the spirit of commercial and
              industrial feudalism.” [Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, p.
              72] Ironically, rather than deny the anarchist claim, defenders of capitalism
              have tried to convince us that such a regime is liberty incarnate. Yet the
              statist nature of private property can be seen in (right-wing) “Libertarian”
              (i.e. “classical” liberal) works representing the extremes of laissez-faire
              capitalism:
                   ”[I]f one starts a private town, on land whose acquisition did not and
                   does not violate the Lockean proviso [of non-aggression], persons
                   who chose to move there or later remain there would have no right
                   to a say in how the town was run, unless it was granted to them by
## the decision procedures for the town which the owner had
                   established.” [Robert Nozick, Anarchy, State and Utopia, p. 270]
                This is voluntary feudalism, nothing more. And, indeed, it was. Such private
              towns have existed, most notably the infamous company towns of US history.
              Howard Zinn summarises the conditions of such “private towns” in the
              Colorado mine ﬁelds:
                   “Each mining camp was a feudal dominion, with the company acting
                   as lord and master. Every camp had a marshal, a law enforcement
                   oﬀicer paid by the company. The ‘laws’ were the company’s rules.
                   Curfews were imposed, ‘suspicious’ strangers were not allowed to
                   visit the homes, the company store had a monopoly on goods sold in
                   the camp. The doctor was a company doctor, the schoolteachers
                   hired by the company … Political power in Colorado rested in the
## hands of those who held economic power. This meant that the
                   authority of Colorado Fuel & Iron and other mine operators was
                   virtually supreme … Company oﬀicials were appointed as election
                   judges. Company-dominated coroners and judges prevented injured
                   employees from collecting damages.” [The Colorado Coal Strike,
                   1913–14, pp. 9–11]
                Unsurprisingly, when the workers rebelled against this tyranny, they were
              evicted from their homes and the private law enforcement agents were
              extremely eﬀicient in repressing the strikers: “By the end of the strike, most
              of the dead and injured were miners and their families.” The strike soon took
              on the features of a war, with battles between strikers and their supporters

              and the company thugs. Ironically, when the National Guard was sent in to
              “restore order” the “miners, having faced in the ﬁrst ﬁve weeks of the strike
              what they considered a reign of terror at the hands of the private guards, …
              looked forward” to their arrival. They “did not know that the governor was
              sending these troops under pressure from the mine operators.” Indeed, the
              banks and corporations lent the state funds to pay for the militia. It was these
              company thugs, dressed in the uniform of the state militia, who murdered
              woman and children in the infamous Ludlow Massacre of April 20th, 1914.
              [Op. Cit., p. 22, p. 25, p. 35]
                 Without irony the New York Times editorialised that the “militia was as
              impersonal and impartial as the law.” The corporation itself hired Ivy Lee
              (“the father of public relations in the United States”) to change public opinion
              after the slaughter. Signiﬁcantly, Lee produced a series of tracts labelled
              “Facts Concerning the Struggle in Colorado for Industrial Freedom.” The
              head of the corporation (Rockefeller) portrayed his repression of the strikers
              as blow for workers’ freedom, to “defend the workers’ right to work.” [quoted
              by Zinn, Op. Cit., p. 44, p. 51 and p. 50] So much for the capitalism being the
              embodiment of liberty.
                 Of course, it can be claimed that “market forces” will result in the most
              liberal owners being the most successful, but a nice master is still a master
              (and, of course, capitalism then was more “free market” than today,
              suggesting that this is simply wishful thinking). To paraphrase Tolstoy, “the
              liberal capitalist is like a kind donkey owner. He will do everything for the
              donkey — care for it, feed it, wash it. Everything except get oﬀ its back!” And
              as Bob Black notes, “Some people giving orders and others obeying them: this
              is the essence of servitude… . But freedom means more than the right to
              change masters.” [The Libertarian as Conservative, The Abolition of Work
              and other essays, p. 147] That supporters of capitalism often claim that this
              “right” to change masters is the essence of “freedom” is a telling indictment
              of the capitalist notion of “liberty.”
                 Needless to say, the authoritarianism of capitalism is not limited to the
              workplace. Capitalists seek to bolster their power within society as a whole,
              via the state. Capitalists call upon and support the state when it acts in their
              interests and when it supports their authority and power. Any apparent
              “conﬂict” between state and capital is like two gangsters ﬁghting over the
              proceeds of a robbery: they will squabble over the loot and who has more
              power in the gang, but they need each other to appropriate the goods and
              defend their “property” against those from whom they stole it.
                 Unlike a company, however, the democratic state can be inﬂuenced by its
              citizens, who are able to act in ways that limit (to some extent) the power of
              the ruling elite to be “left alone” to enjoy their power. As a result, the wealthy
              hate the democratic aspects of the state, and its ordinary citizens, as potential
              threats to their power. This “problem” was noted by Alexis de Tocqueville in
              early 19th-century America:
                   “It is easy to perceive that the wealthy members of the community
                   entertain a hearty distaste to the democratic institutions of their
                   country. The populace is at once the object of their scorn and their
## fears.”

348 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                These fears have not changed, nor has the contempt for democratic ideas.
              To quote one US Corporate Executive, “one man, one vote will result in the
              eventual failure of democracy as we know it.” [L. Silk and D. Vogel, Ethics
              and Proﬁts: The Crisis of Conﬁdence in American Business, pp. 189f]
                This contempt for democracy does not mean that capitalists are anti-state.
              Far from it. As previously noted, capitalists depend on the state. This is
              because ”[classical] Liberalism, is in theory a kind of anarchy without
              socialism, and therefore is simply a lie, for freedom is not possible without
              equality…The criticism liberals direct at government consists only of wanting
              to deprive it some of its functions and to call upon the capitalists to ﬁght it out
              amongst themselves, but it cannot attack the repressive functions which are
              of its essence: for without the gendarme the property owner could not exist.”
              [Errico Malatesta, Anarchy, p. 47]
                We have discussed the state and how the ruling elite control in section B.2
              and will not do so here. Nor we will discuss the ways in which the elite use
              that state to enforce private property (see section B.3) or use the state to
              intervene in society (see section D.1). Rather, the rest of this section will
              discuss how capitalism impacts on freedom and autonomy and why the
              standard apologetics by defenders of capitalism fail.
              B.4.1 Is capitalism based on freedom?
                 For anarchists, freedom means both “freedom from” and “freedom to.”
              “Freedom from” signiﬁes not being subject to domination, exploitation,
              coercive authority, repression, or other forms of degradation and humiliation.
              “Freedom to” means being able to develop and express one’s abilities, talents,
              and potentials to the fullest possible extent compatible with the maximum
              freedom of others. Both kinds of freedom imply the need for self-management,
              responsibility, and independence, which basically means that people have a
              say in the decisions that aﬀect their lives. And since individuals do not exist in
              a social vacuum, it also means that freedom must take on a collective aspect,
              with the associations that individuals form with each other (e.g. communities,
              work groups, social groups) being run in a manner which allows the individual
              to participate in the decisions that the group makes. Thus freedom for
              anarchists requires participatory democracy, which means face-to-face
              discussion and voting on issues by the people aﬀected by them.
                 Are these conditions of freedom met in the capitalist system? Obviously not.
              Despite all their rhetoric about “democracy,” most of the “advanced”
              capitalist states remain only superﬁcially democratic — and this because the
              majority of their citizens are employees who spend about half their waking
              hours under the thumb of capitalist dictators (bosses) who allow them no
              voice in the crucial economic decisions that aﬀect their lives most profoundly
              and require them to work under conditions inimical to independent thinking.
              If the most basic freedom, namely freedom to think for oneself, is denied, then
              freedom itself is denied.
                 The capitalist workplace is profoundly undemocratic. Indeed, as Noam
              Chomsky points out, the oppressive authority relations in the typical
              corporate hierarchy would be called fascist or totalitarian if we were referring
349 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              to a political system. In his words :
                   “There’s nothing individualistic about corporations. These are big
                   conglomerate institutions, essentially totalitarian in character, but
                   hardly individualistic. There are few institutions in human society
                   that have such strict hierarchy and top-down control as a business
                   organisation. Nothing there about ‘don’t tread on me‘. You’re being
                   tread on all the time.” [Keeping the Rabble in Line, p. 280]
                Far from being “based on freedom,” then, capitalism actually destroys
              freedom. In this regard, Robert E. Wood, the chief executive oﬀicer of Sears,
              spoke plainly when he said ”[w]e stress the advantages of the free enterprise
              system, we complain about the totalitarian state, but... we have created more
              or less of a totalitarian system in industry, particularly in large industry.”
              [quoted by Allan Engler, Apostles of Greed, p. 68]
                Or, as Chomsky puts it, supporters of capitalism do not understand “the
              fundamental doctrine, that you should be free from domination and control,
              including the control of the manager and the owner” [Feb. 14th, 1992
              appearance on Pozner/Donahue].
                Under corporate authoritarianism, the psychological traits deemed most
              desirable for average citizens to possess are eﬀiciency, conformity, emotional
              detachment, insensitivity, and unquestioning obedience to authority — traits
              that allow people to survive and even prosper as employees in the company
              hierarchy. And of course, for “non-average” citizens, i.e., bosses, managers,
              administrators, etc., authoritarian traits are needed, the most important
              being the ability and willingness to dominate others.
                But all such master/slave traits are inimical to the functioning of real (i.e.
              participatory/libertarian) democracy, which requires that citizens have
              qualities like ﬂexibility, creativity, sensitivity, understanding, emotional
              honesty, directness, warmth, realism, and the ability to mediate,
              communicate, negotiate, integrate and co-operate. Therefore, capitalism is
              not only undemocratic, it is anti-democratic, because it promotes the
              development of traits that make real democracy (and so a libertarian society)
              impossible.
                Many capitalist apologists have attempted to show that capitalist authority
              structures are “voluntary” and are, therefore, somehow not a denial of
              individual and social freedom. Milton Friedman (a leading free market
              capitalist economist) has attempted to do just this. Like most apologists for
              capitalism he ignores the authoritarian relations explicit within wage labour
              (within the workplace, “co-ordination” is based upon top-down command, not
              horizontal co-operation). Instead he concentrates on the decision of a worker
              to sell their labour to a speciﬁc boss and so ignores the lack of freedom
              within such contracts. He argues that “individuals are eﬀectively free to enter
              or not enter into any particular exchange, so every transaction is strictly
              voluntary… The employee is protected from coercion by the employer because
              of other employers for whom he can work.” [Capitalism and Freedom, pp.
              14–15]
                Friedman, to prove the free nature of capitalism, compares capitalism with
              a simple exchange economy based upon independent producers. He states
              that in such a simple economy each household “has the alternative of

              producing directly for itself, [and so] it need not enter into any exchange
              unless it beneﬁts from it. Hence no exchange will take place unless both
              parties do beneﬁt from it. Co-operation is thereby achieved without coercion.”
              Under capitalism (or the “complex” economy) Friedman states that
              “individuals are eﬀectively free to enter or not to enter into any particular
              exchange, so that every transaction is strictly voluntary.” [Op. Cit., p. 13 and
              p. 14]
                A moments thought, however, shows that capitalism is not based on “strictly
              voluntary” transactions as Friedman claims. This is because the proviso that
              is required to make every transaction “strictly voluntary” is not freedom not
              to enter any particular exchange, but freedom not to enter into any exchange
              at all.
                This, and only this, was the proviso that proved the simple model Friedman
              presents (the one based upon artisan production) to be voluntary and noncoercive; and nothing less than this would prove the complex model (i.e.
              capitalism) is voluntary and non-coercive. But Friedman is clearly claiming
              above that freedom not to enter into any particular exchange is enough and
              so, only by changing his own requirements, can he claim that capitalism is
              based upon freedom.
                It is easy to see what Friedman has done, but it is less easy to excuse it
              (particularly as it is so commonplace in capitalist apologetics). He moved from
              the simple economy of exchange between independent producers to the
              capitalist economy without mentioning the most important thing that
              distinguishes them — namely the separation of labour from the means of
              production. In the society of independent producers, the worker had the
              choice of working for themselves — under capitalism this is not the case. For
              capitalist economists like Friedman, workers choose whether to work or not.
              The bosses must pay a wage to cover the “disutility” of labour. In reality, of
              course, most workers face the choice of working or starvation/poverty.
              Capitalism is based upon the existence of a labour force without access to
              capital or land, and therefore without a choice as to whether to put its labour
              in the market or not. Friedman would, hopefully, agree that where there is no
              choice there is coercion. His attempted demonstration that capitalism coordinates without coercion therefore fails.
                Capitalist apologists are able to convince some people that capitalism is
              “based on freedom” only because the system has certain superﬁcial
              appearances of freedom. On closer analysis these appearances turn out to be
              deceptions. For example, it is claimed that the employees of capitalist ﬁrms
              have freedom because they can always quit. To requote Bob Black:
                   “Some people giving orders and others obeying them: this is the
                   essence of servitude. Of course, as [right-Libertarians] smugly
                   [observe], ‘one can at least change jobs,’ but you can’t avoid having
                   a job — just as under statism one can at least change nationalities
                   but you can’t avoid subjection to one nation-state or another. But
## freedom means more than the right to change masters.” [“The
                   Libertarian as Conservative”, The Abolition of Work and other
                   essays, p. 147]
               Under capitalism, workers have only the Hobson’s choice of being

              governed/exploited or living on the street.
                Anarchists point out that for choice to be real, free agreements and
              associations must be based on the social equality of those who enter into
              them, and both sides must receive roughly equivalent beneﬁt. But social
              relations between capitalists and employees can never be equal, because
              private ownership of the means of production gives rise to social hierarchy
              and relations of coercive authority and subordination, as was recognised even
              by Adam Smith (see below).
                The picture painted by Walter Reuther (one time head of the US
              autoworkers’ union) of working life in America before the Wagner act is a
              commentary on class inequality : “Injustice was as common as streetcars.
              When men walked into their jobs, they left their dignity, their citizenship and
              their humanity outside. They were required to report for duty whether there
              was work or not. While they waited on the convenience of supervisors and
              foremen they were unpaid. They could be ﬁred without a pretext. They were
              subjected to arbitrary, senseless rules … Men were tortured by regulations
              that made diﬀicult even going to the toilet. Despite grandiloquent statements
              from the presidents of huge corporations that their door was open to any
              worker with a complaint, there was no one and no agency to which a worker
              could appeal if he were wronged. The very idea that a worker could be
              wronged seemed absurd to the employer.” Much of this indignity remains, and
              with the globalisation of capital, the bargaining position of workers is further
              deteriorating, so that the gains of a century of class struggle are in danger of
              being lost.
                A quick look at the enormous disparity of power and wealth between the
              capitalist class and the working class shows that the beneﬁts of the
              “agreements” entered into between the two sides are far from equal. Walter
              Block, a leading ideologue of the Canadian right-libertarian “think-tank” the
              Fraser Institute, makes clear the diﬀerences in power and beneﬁts when
              discussing sexual harassment in the workplace:
                   “Consider the sexual harassment which continually occurs between
                   a secretary and a boss … while objectionable to many women, [it] is
                   not a coercive action. It is rather part of a package deal in which the
                   secretary agrees to all aspects of the job when she agrees to accept
                   the job, and especially when she agrees to keep the job. The oﬀice
                   is, after all, private property. The secretary does not have to remain
                   if the ‘coercion’ is objectionable.” [quoted by Engler, Op. Cit., p.
                   101]
                The primary goal of the Fraser Institute is to convince people that all other
              rights must be subordinated to the right to enjoy wealth. In this case, Block
              makes clear that under private property, only bosses have “freedom to,” and
              most also desire to ensure they have “freedom from” interference with this
              right.
                So, when capitalists gush about the “liberty” available under capitalism,
              what they are really thinking of is their state-protected freedom to exploit and
              oppress workers through the ownership of property, a freedom that allows
              them to continue amassing huge disparities of wealth, which in turn insures
              their continued power and privileges. That the capitalist class in liberal352 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM

              democratic states gives workers the right to change masters (though this is
              not true under state capitalism) is far from showing that capitalism is based
              on freedom, For as Peter Kropotkin rightly points out, “freedoms are not
              given, they are taken.” [Peter Kropotkin, Words of a Rebel, p. 43] In
              capitalism, you are “free” to do anything you are permitted to do by your
              masters, which amounts to “freedom” with a collar and leash.
              B.4.2 Is capitalism based on self-ownership?
                 Murray Rothbard, a leading “libertarian” capitalist, claims that capitalism is
              based on the “basic axiom” of “the right to self-ownership.” This “axiom” is
              deﬁned as “the absolute right of each man [sic] … to control [his or her] body
              free of coercive interference. Since each individual must think, learn, value,
              and choose his or her ends and means in order to survive and ﬂourish, the
              right to self-ownership gives man [sic] the right to perform these vital
              activities without being hampered by coercive molestation.” [For a New
              Liberty, pp. 26–27]
                 At ﬁrst sight, this appears to sound reasonable. That we “own” ourselves
              and, consequently, we decide what we do with ourselves has an intuitive
              appeal. Surely this is liberty? Thus, in this perspective, liberty “is a condition
              in which a person’s ownership rights in his own body and his legitimate
              material property are not invaded, are not aggressed against.” It also lends
              itself to contrasts with slavery, where one individual owns another and “the
              slave has little or no right to self-ownership; his person and his produce are
              systematically expropriated by his master by the use of violence.” [Rothbard,
              Op. Cit., p. 41] This means that “self-ownership” can be portrayed as the
              opposite of slavery: we have the dominion over ourselves that a slaveholder
              has over their slave. This means that slavery is wrong because the slave
              owner has stolen the rightful property of the slave, namely their body (and its
              related abilities). This concept is sometimes expressed as people having a
              “natural” or “inalienable” right to own their own body and the product of their
              own labour.
                 Anarchists, while understanding the appeal of the idea, are not convinced.
              That “self-ownership,” like slavery, places issues of freedom and individuality
              within the context of private property — as such it shares the most important
              claim of slavery, namely that people can be objects of the rules of private
              property. It suggests an alienated perspective and, moreover, a fatal ﬂaw in
              the dogma. This can be seen from how the axiom is used in practice. In as
              much as the term “self-ownership” is used simply as an synonym for
              “individual autonomy” anarchists do not have an issue with it. However, the
              “basic axiom” is not used in this way by the theorists of capitalism. Liberty in
              the sense of individual autonomy is not what “self-ownership” aims to justify.
              Rather, it aims to justify the denial of liberty, not its exercise. It aims to
              portray social relationships, primarily wage labour, in which one person
              commands another as examples of liberty rather than what they are, examples
              of domination and oppression. In other words, “self-ownership” becomes the
              means by which the autonomy of individuals is limited, if not destroyed, in the
              name of freedom and liberty.

                 This is exposed in the right-libertarian slogan “human rights are property
              rights.” Assuming this is true, it means that you can alienate your rights, rent
              them or sell them like any other kind of property. Moreover, if you have no
              property, you have no human rights as you have no place to exercise them. As
              Ayn Rand, another ideologue for “free market” capitalism stated, “there can
              be no such thing as the right to unrestricted freedom of speech (or of action)
              on someone else’s property.” [Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, p. 258] If
              you are in someone else’s property (say at work) you have no basic rights at
              all, beyond the right not to be harmed (a right bosses habitually violate
              anyway by ignoring health and safety issues).
                 Self-ownership justiﬁes this. You have rented out the property in your
              person (labour services) and, consequently, another person can tell you what
              to do, when to do and how to do it. Thus property comes into conﬂict with
              liberty. If you argue that “human rights are property rights” you automatically
              ensure that human rights are continually violated in practice simply because
              there is a conﬂict between property and liberty. This is not surprising, as the
              “property rights” theory of liberty was created to justify the denial of other
              people’s liberty and the appropriation of their labour.
                 Clearly, then, we reach a problem with “self-ownership” (or property in the
              person) once we take into account private property and its distribution. In a
              nutshell, capitalists don’t pay their employees to perform the other “vital
              activities” listed by Rothbard (learning, valuing, choosing ends and means) —
              unless, of course, the ﬁrm requires that workers undertake such activities in
              the interests of company proﬁts. Otherwise, workers can rest assured that
              any eﬀorts to engage in such “vital activities” on company time will be
              “hampered” by “coercive molestation.” Therefore wage labour (the basis of
              capitalism) in practice denies the rights associated with “self-ownership,”
              thus alienating the individual from his or her basic rights. Or as Michael
              Bakunin expressed it, “the worker sells his person and his liberty for a given
              time” under capitalism. [The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, p. 187]
                 In a society of relative equals, “property” would not be a source of power as
              use would co-incidence with occupancy (i.e. private property would be
              replaced by possession). For example, you would still be able to ﬂing a drunk
              out of your home. But in a system based on wage labour (i.e. capitalism),
              property is a diﬀerent thing altogether, becoming a source of
              institutionalised power and coercive authority through hierarchy. As Noam
              Chomsky writes, capitalism is based on “a particular form of authoritarian
              control. Namely, the kind that comes through private ownership and control,
              which is an extremely rigid system of domination.” When “property” is purely
              what you, as an individual, use (i.e. possession) it is not a source of power. In
              capitalism, however, “property” rights no longer coincide with use rights, and
              so they become a denial of freedom and a source of authority and power over
              the individual.
                 As we’ve seen in the discussion of hierarchy (sections A.2.8 and B.1), all
              forms of authoritarian control depend on “coercive molestation” — i.e. the use
              or threat of sanctions. This is deﬁnitely the case in company hierarchies under
              capitalism. Bob Black describes the authoritarian nature of capitalism as
              follows:
354 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   ”[T]he place where [adults] pass the most time and submit to the
                   closest control is at work. Thus … it’s apparent that the source of
                   the greatest direct duress experienced by the ordinary adult is not
                   the state but rather the business that employs him. Your foreman or
                   supervisor gives you more or-else orders in a week than the police
                   do in a decade.” [“The Libertarian as Conservative”, The Abolition
                   of Work and other essays, p. 145]
                In developing nations, this control can easily been seen to be an utter
              aﬀront to human dignity and liberty. There a workplace is often “surrounded
              by barbed wire. Behind its locked doors … workers are supervised by guards
              who beat and humiliate them on the slightest pretext … Each worker repeats
              the same action — sewing on a belt loop, stitching a sleeve — maybe two
              thousand times a day. They work under painfully bright lights, for twelve- to
              fourteen-hour shifts, in overheated factories, with too few bathroom breaks,
              and restricted access to water (to reduce the need for more bathroom
              breaks), which is often foul and unﬁt for human consumption in any event.”
              The purpose is “to maximise the amount of proﬁt that could be wrung out” of
              the workers, with the “time allocated to each task” being calculated in “units
              of ten thousands of a second.” [Joel Bakan, The Corporation, pp. 66–7] While
              in the developed world the forms of control are, in general, nowhere as
              extreme (in thanks due to hard won labour organising and struggle) the basic
              principle is the same. Only a sophist would argue that the workers “owned”
              themselves and abilities for the period in question — yet this is what the
              advocates of “self-ownership” do argue.
                So if by the term “self-ownership” it is meant “individual autonomy” then,
              no, capitalism is not based on it. Ironically, the theory of “self-ownership” is
              used to undercut and destroy genuine self-ownership during working hours
              (and, potentially, elsewhere). The logic is simple. As I own myself I am,
              therefore, able to sell myself as well, although few advocates of “selfownership” are as blunt as this (as we discuss in section F.2.2 right-libertarian
              Robert Nozick accepts that voluntary slavery ﬂows from this principle).
              Instead they stress that we “own” our labour and we contract them to others
              to use. Yet, unlike other forms of property, labour cannot be alienated.
              Therefore when you sell your labour you sell yourself, your liberty, for the
              time in question. By alienating your labour power, you alienate the substance
              of your being, your personality, for the time in question.
                As such, “self-ownership” ironically becomes the means of justifying
              authoritarian social relationships which deny the autonomy it claims to
              defend. Indeed, these relationships have similarities with slavery, the very
              thing which its advocates like to contrast “self-ownership” to. While modern
              defenders of capitalism deny this, classical economist James Mill let the cat
              out of the bag by directly comparing the two. It is worthwhile to quote him at
              length:
                   “The great capitalist, the owner of a manufactory, if he operated
                   with slaves instead of free labourers, like the West India planter,
                   would be regarded as owner both of the capital, and of the labour.
                   He would be owner, in short, of both instruments of production: and
                   the whole of the produce, without participation, would be his own.

                   equally therefore the owner of the labour, with the manufacturer
                   who operates with slaves. The only diﬀerence is, in the mode of
                   purchasing. The owner of the slave purchases, at once, the whole of
                   the labour, which the man can ever perform: he, who pays wages,
                   purchases only so much of a man’s labour as he can perform in a
                   day, or any other stipulated time. Being equally, however, the owner
                   of the labour, so purchased, as the owner of the slave is of that of
                   the slave, the produce, which is the result of this labour, combined
                   with his capital, is all equally his own. In the state of society, in
                   which we at present exist, it is in these circumstances that almost
                   all production is eﬀected: the capitalist is the owner of both
                   instruments of production: and the whole of the produce is his.”
## [“Elements of Political Economy” quoted by David Ellerman,
## Property and Contract in Economics, pp. 53–4

                 Thus the only “diﬀerence” between slavery and capitalist labour is the
              “mode of purchasing.” The labour itself and its product in both cases is owned
              by the “great capitalist.” Clearly this is a case of, to use Rothbard’s words,
              during working hours the worker “has little or no right to self-ownership; his
              person and his produce are systematically expropriated by his master.” Little
              wonder anarchists have tended to call wage labour by the more accurate term
              “wage slavery.” For the duration of the working day the boss owns the labour
              power of the worker. As this cannot be alienated from its “owner” this means
              that the boss eﬀectively owns the worker — and keeps the product of their
              labour for the privilege of so doing!
                 There are key diﬀerences of course. At the time, slavery was not a voluntary
              decision and the slaves could not change their master (although in some
              cultures, such as Ancient Rome, people over the could sell themselves in
              slavery while ”voluntary slavery is sanctioned in the Bible.” [Ellerman, Op.
              Cit., p. 115 and p. 114]). Yet the fact that under wage slavery people are not
              forced to take a speciﬁc job and can change masters does not change the
              relations of authority created between the two parties. As we note in the next
              section, the objection that people can leave their jobs just amounts to saying
              “love it or leave it!” and does not address the issue at hand. The vast majority
              of the population cannot avoid wage labour and remain wage workers for
              most of their adult lives. It is virtually impossible to distinguish being able to
              sell your liberty/labour piecemeal over a lifetime from alienating your whole
              lifetime’s labour at one go. Changing who you alienate your labour/liberty to
              does not change the act and experience of alienation.
                 Thus the paradox of self-ownership. It presupposes autonomy only in order
              to deny it. In order to enter a contract, the worker exercises autonomy in
              deciding whether it is advantageous to rent or sell his or her property (their
              labour power) for use by another (and given that the alternative is, at best,
              poverty unsurprisingly people do consider it “advantageous” to “consent” to

              the contract). Yet what is rented or sold is not a piece of property but rather a
              self-governing individual. Once the contract is made and the property rights
              are transferred, they no longer have autonomy and are treated like any other
              factor of production or commodity.
                In the “self-ownership” thesis this is acceptable due to its assumption that
              people and their labour power are property. Yet the worker cannot send along
              their labour by itself to an employer. By its very nature, the worker has to be
              present in the workplace if this “property” is to be put to use by the person
              who has bought it. The consequence of contracting out your labour (your
              property in the person) is that your autonomy (liberty) is restricted, if not
              destroyed, depending on the circumstances of the particular contract signed.
              This is because employers hire people, not a piece of property.
                So far from being based on the “right to self-ownership,” then, capitalism
              eﬀectively denies it, alienating the individual from such basic rights as free
              speech, independent thought, and self-management of one’s own activity,
              which individuals have to give up when they are employed. But since these
              rights, according to Rothbard, are the products of humans as humans, wage
              labour alienates them from themselves, exactly as it does the individual’s
              labour power and creativity. For you do not sell your skills, as these skills are
              part of you. Instead, what you have to sell is your time, your labour power,
              and so yourself. Thus under wage labour, rights of “self-ownership” are
              always placed below property rights, the only “right” being left to you is that
              of ﬁnding another job (although even this right is denied in some countries if
              the employee owes the company money).
                It should be stressed that this is not a strange paradox of the “selfownership” axiom. Far from it. The doctrine was most famously expounded by
              John Locke, who argued that “every Man has a Property in his own Person.
              This no Body has any Right to but himself.” However, a person can sell, “for a
              certain time, the Service he undertakes to do, in exchange for Wages he is to
              receive.” The buyer of the labour then owns both it and its product. “Thus the
              Grass my Horse has bit; the Turfs my Servant has cut; and the Ore I have
              digg’d in any place where I have a right to them in common with others,
              becomes my Property, without the assignation or consent of any body. The
              labour that was mine … hath ﬁxed my Property in them.” [Second Treatise
              on Government, Section 27, Section 85 and Section 28]
                Thus a person (the servant) becomes the equivalent of an animal (the horse)
              once they have sold their labour to the boss. Wage labour denies the basic
              humanity and autonomy of the worker. Rather than being equals, private
              property produces relations of domination and alienation. Proudhon compared
              this to an association in which, “while the partnership lasts, the proﬁts and
              losses are divided between them; since each produces, not for himself, but for
              the society; when the time of distribution arrives it is not the producer who is
              considered, but the associated. That is why the slave, to whom the planter
              gives straw and rice; and the civilised labour, to whom the capitalist pays a
              salary which is always too small, — not being associated with their employers,
              although producing with them, — are disregarded when the product is
              divided. Thus the horse who draws our coaches … produce with us, but are
              not associated with us; we take their product but do not share it with them.
              The animals and labourers whom we employ hold the same relation to us.”

              [What is Property?, p. 226]
                 So while the capitalist Locke sees nothing wrong in comparing a person to
              an animal, the anarchist Proudhon objects to the fundamental injustice of a
              system which turns a person into a resource for another to use. And we do
              mean resource, as the self-ownership thesis is also the means by which the
              poor become little more than spare parts for the wealthy. After all, the poor
              own their bodies and, consequently, can sell all or part of it to a willing party.
              This means that someone in dire economic necessity can sell parts of their
              body to the rich. Ultimately, ”[t]o tell a poor man that he has property
              because he has arms and legs — that the hunger from which he suﬀers, and
              his power to sleep in the open air are his property, — is to play upon words,
              and to add insult to injury.” [Proudhon, Op. Cit., p. 80]
                 Obviously the ability to labour is not the property of a person — it is their
              possession. Use and ownership are fused and cannot be separated out. As
              such, anarchists argue that the history of capitalism shows that there is a
              considerable diﬀerence whether one said (like the defenders of capitalism)
              that slavery is wrong because every person has a natural right to the property
              of their own body, or because every person has a natural right freely to
              determine their own destiny (like the anarchists). The ﬁrst kind of right is
              alienable and in the context of a capitalist regime ensures that the many
              labour for those who own the means of life. The second kind of right is
              inalienable as long as a person remained a person and, therefore, liberty or
              self-determination is not a claim to ownership which might be both acquired
              and surrendered, but an inextricable aspect of the activity of being human.
                 The anarchist position on the inalienable nature of human liberty also forms
              the basis for the excluded to demand access to the means necessary to labour.
              “From the distinction between possession and property,” argued Proudhon,
              “arise two sorts of rights: the jus in re, the right in a thing, the right by
              which I may reclaim the property which I have acquired, in whatever hands I
              ﬁnd it; and jus ad rem, the right to a thing, which gives me a claim to
              become a proprietor … In the ﬁrst, possession and property are united; the
              second includes only naked property. With me who, as a labourer, have a right
              to the possession of the products of Nature and my own industry — and who,
              as a proletaire, enjoy none of them — it is by virtue of the jus de rem that I
              demand admittance to the jus in re.” [Op. Cit., p. 65] Thus to make the selfownership of labour and its products a reality for those who do the actual
              work in society rather than a farce, property must be abolished — both in
              terms of the means of life and also in deﬁning liberty and what it means to be
              free.
                 So, contrary to Rothbard’s claim, capitalism in practice uses the rhetoric of
              self-ownership to alienate the right to genuine self-ownership because of the
              authoritarian structure of the workplace, which derives from private property.
              If we desire real self-ownership, we cannot renounce it for most of our adult
              lives by becoming wage slaves. Only workers’ self-management of production,
              not capitalism, can make self-ownership a reality:
                   “They speak of ‘inherent rights’, ‘inalienable rights’, ‘natural rights,’
                   etc … Unless the material conditions for equality exist, it is worse
                   than mockery to pronounce men equal. And unless there is equality
358 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   (and by equality I mean equal chances for every one to make the
                   most of himself [or herself]) unless, I say, these equal changes exist,
                   freedom, either of though, speech, or action, is equally a mockery …
                   As long as the working-people … tramp the streets, whose stones
                   they lay, whose ﬁlth they clean, whose sewers they dig, yet upon
                   which they must not stand too long lest the policeman bid them
                   ‘move on’; as long as they go from factory to factory, begging for the
                   opportunity to be a slave, receiving the insults of bosses and
                   foreman, getting the old ‘no,’ the old shake of the head, in these
                   factories they built, whose machines they wrought; so long as they
                   consent to be herd like cattle, in the cities, driven year after year,
                   more and more, oﬀ the mortgaged land, the land they cleared,
                   fertilised, cultivated, rendered of value . .. so long as they continue
## to do these things vaguely relying upon some power outside
                   themselves, be it god, or priest, or politician, or employer, or
                   charitable society, to remedy matters, so long deliverance will be
## delayed. When they conceive the possibility of a complete
                   international federation of labour, whose constituent groups shall
                   take possession of land, mines, factories, all the instruments of
## production … , in short, conduct their own industry without
                   regulative interference from law-makers or employers, then we may
                   hope for the only help which counts for aught — Self-Help; the only
                   condition which can guarantee free speech [along with their other
                   rights] (and no paper guarantee needed).” [Voltairine de Cleyre,
                   The Voltairine de Cleyre Reader, pp. 4–6]
                 To conclude, the idea that capitalism is based on self-ownership is radically
              at odds with reality if, by self-ownership, it is meant self-determination or
              individual autonomy. However, this is not surprising given that the rationale
              behind the self-ownership thesis is precisely to justify capitalist hierarchy and
              its resulting restrictions on liberty. Rather than being a defence of liberty, selfownership is designed to facilitate its erosion. In order to make the promise of
              autonomy implied by the concept of “self-ownership” a reality, private
              property will need to be abolished.
                 For more discussion of the limitations, contradictions and fallacies of
              deﬁning liberty in terms of self-ownership and property rights, see section F.2.
              B.4.3 But no one forces you to work for them!
                Of course it is claimed that entering wage labour is a “voluntary”
              undertaking, from which both sides allegedly beneﬁt. However, due to past
              initiations of force (e.g. the seizure of land by conquest), the control of the
              state by the capitalist class plus the tendency for capital to concentrate, a
              relative handful of people now control vast wealth, depriving all others access
              to the means of life. Thus denial of free access to the means of life is based
              ultimately on the principle of “might makes right.” And as Murray Bookchin
              so rightly points out, “the means of life must be taken for what they literally
              are: the means without which life is impossible. To deny them to people is
              more than ‘theft’ … it is outright homicide.” [Remaking Society, p. 187]
359 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
               David Ellerman has also noted that the past use of force has resulted in the
              majority being limited to those options allowed to them by the powers that be:
                   “It is a veritable mainstay of capitalist thought … that the moral
                   ﬂaws of chattel slavery have not survived in capitalism since the
                   workers, unlike the slaves, are free people making voluntary wage
                   contracts. But it is only that, in the case of capitalism, the denial of
                   natural rights is less complete so that the worker has a residual
                   legal personality as a free ‘commodity owner.’ He is thus allowed to
                   voluntarily put his own working life to traﬀic. When a robber denies
                   another person’s right to make an inﬁnite number of other choices
                   besides losing his money or his life and the denial is backed up by a
                   gun, then this is clearly robbery even though it might be said that
                   the victim making a ‘voluntary choice’ between his remaining
                   options. When the legal system itself denies the natural rights of
                   working people in the name of the prerogatives of capital, and this
                   denial is sanctioned by the legal violence of the state, then the
                   theorists of ‘libertarian’ capitalism do not proclaim institutional
                   robbery, but rather they celebrate the ‘natural liberty’ of working
                   people to choose between the remaining options of selling their
                   labour as a commodity and being unemployed.” [quoted by Noam
                   Chomsky, The Chomsky Reader, p. 186]
                Therefore the existence of the labour market depends on the worker being
              separated from the means of production. The natural basis of capitalism is
              wage labour, wherein the majority have little option but to sell their skills,
              labour and time to those who do own the means of production. In advanced
              capitalist countries, less than 10% of the working population are selfemployed (in 1990, 7.6% in the UK, 8% in the USA and Canada — however,
              this ﬁgure includes employers as well, meaning that the number of selfemployed workers is even smaller!). Hence for the vast majority, the labour
              market is their only option.
                Michael Bakunin notes that these facts put the worker in the position of a
              serf with regard to the capitalist, even though the worker is formally “free”
              and “equal” under the law:
                   “Juridically they are both equal; but economically the worker is the
                   serf of the capitalist … thereby the worker sells his person and his
                   liberty for a given time. The worker is in the position of a serf
                   because this terrible threat of starvation which daily hangs over his
                   head and over his family, will force him to accept any conditions
## imposed by the gainful calculations of the capitalist, the
                   industrialist, the employer… .The worker always has the right to
                   leave his employer, but has he the means to do so? No, he does it in
                   order to sell himself to another employer. He is driven to it by the
                   same hunger which forces him to sell himself to the ﬁrst employer.
                   Thus the worker’s liberty … is only a theoretical freedom, lacking
                   any means for its possible realisation, and consequently it is only a
                   ﬁctitious liberty, an utter falsehood. The truth is that the whole life
                   of the worker is simply a continuous and dismaying succession of
360 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   terms of serfdom — voluntary from the juridical point of view but
                   compulsory from an economic sense — broken up by momentarily
                   brief interludes of freedom accompanied by starvation; in other
                   words, it is real slavery.” [The Political Philosophy of Bakunin,
                   pp. 187–8]
                Obviously, a company cannot force you to work for them but, in general,
              you have to work for someone. How this situation developed is, of course,
              usually ignored. If not glossed over as irrelevant, some fairy tale is spun in
              which a few bright people saved and worked hard to accumulate capital and
              the lazy majority ﬂocked to be employed by these (almost superhuman)
              geniuses. In the words of one right-wing economist (talking speciﬁcally of the
              industrial revolution but whose argument is utilised today):
                   “The factory owners did not have the power to compel anybody to
                   take a factory job. They could only hire people who were ready to
                   work for the wages oﬀered to them. Low as these wage rates were,
                   they were nonetheless much more than these paupers could earn in
                   any other ﬁeld open to them.” [Ludwig von Mises, Human Action,

                Notice the assumptions. The workers just happen have such a terrible set of
              options — the employing classes have absolutely nothing to do with it. And
              these owners just happen to have all these means of production on their
              hands while the working class just happen to be without property and, as a
              consequence, forced to sell their labour on the owners’ terms. That the state
              enforces capitalist property rights and acts to defend the power of the owning
              class is just another co-incidence among many. The possibility that the
              employing classes might be directly implicated in state policies that reduced
              the available options of workers is too ludicrous even to mention.
                Yet in the real world, the power of coincidence to explain all is less
              compelling. Here things are more grim as the owning class clearly beneﬁted
              from numerous acts of state violence and a general legal framework which
              restricted the options available for the workers. Apparently we are meant to
              believe that it is purely by strange co-incidence the state was run by the
              wealthy and owning classes, not the working class, and that a whole host of
              anti-labour laws and practices were implemented by random chance.
                It should be stressed that this nonsense, with its underlying assumptions
              and inventions, is still being peddled today. It is being repeated to combat the
              protests that “multinational corporations exploit people in poor countries.”
              Yes, it will be readily admitted, multinationals do pay lower wages in
              developing countries than in rich ones: that is why they go there. However, it
              is argued, this represents economic advancement compares to what the other
              options available are. As the corporations do not force them to work for them
              and they would have stayed with what they were doing previously the charge
              of exploitation is wrong. Would you, it is stressed, leave your job for one with
              less pay and worse conditions? In fact, the bosses are doing them a favour in
              paying such low wages for the products the companies charge such high
              prices in the developed world for.
                And so, by the same strange co-incidence that marked the industrial

              revolution, capitalists today (in the form of multinational corporations)
              gravitate toward states with terrible human rights records. States where, at
              worse, death squads torture and “disappear” union and peasant co-operative
              organisers or where, at best, attempts to organise a union can get you
              arrested or ﬁred and blacklisted. States were peasants are being forced of
              their land as a result of government policies which favour the big landlords.
              By an equally strange coincidence, the foreign policy of the American and
              European governments is devoted to making sure such anti-labour regimes
              stay in power. It is a co-incidence, of course, that such regimes are favoured
              by the multinationals and that these states spend so much eﬀort in providing
              a “market friendly” climate to tempt the corporations to set up their
              sweatshops there. It is also, apparently, just a co-incidence that these states
              are controlled by the local wealthy owning classes and subject to economic
              pressure by the transnationals which invest and wish to invest there.
                It is clear that when a person who is mugged hands over their money to the
              mugger they do so because they prefer it to the “next best alternative.” As
              such, it is correct that people agree to sell their liberty to a boss because their
              “next best alternative” is worse (utter poverty or starvation are not found that
              appealing for some reason). But so what? As anarchists have been pointing
              out over a century, the capitalists have systematically used the state to create
              a limit options for the many, to create buyers’ market for labour by skewing
              the conditions under which workers can sell their labour in the bosses favour.
              To then merrily answer all criticisms of this set-up with the response that the
              workers “voluntarily agreed” to work on those terms is just hypocrisy. Does it
              really change things if the mugger (the state) is only the agent (hired thug) of
              another criminal (the owning class)?
                As such, hymns to the “free market” seem somewhat false when the reality
              of the situation is such that workers do not need to be forced at gun point to
              enter a speciﬁc workplace because of past (and more often than not, current)
              “initiation of force” by the capitalist class and the state which have created
              the objective conditions within which we make our employment decisions.
              Before any speciﬁc labour market contract occurs, the separation of workers
              from the means of production is an established fact (and the resulting
              “labour” market usually gives the advantage to the capitalists as a class). So
              while we can usually pick which capitalist to work for, we, in general, cannot
              choose to work for ourselves (the self-employed sector of the economy is tiny,
              which indicates well how spurious capitalist liberty actually is). Of course, the
              ability to leave employment and seek it elsewhere is an important freedom.
              However, this freedom, like most freedoms under capitalism, is of limited use
              and hides a deeper anti-individual reality.
                As Karl Polanyi puts it:
                   “In human terms such a postulate [of a labour market] implied for
                   the worker extreme instability of earnings, utter absence of
                   professional standards, abject readiness to be shoved and pushed
                   about indiscriminately, complete dependence on the whims of the
                   market. [Ludwig Von] Mises justly argued that if workers ‘did not
                   act as trade unionists, but reduced their demands and changed their
                   locations and occupations according to the labour market, they

                   would eventually ﬁnd work.’ This sums up the position under a
                   system based on the postulate of the commodity character of labour.
                   It is not for the commodity to decide where it should be oﬀered for
                   sale, to what purpose it should be used, at what price it should be
## allowed to change hands, and in what manner it should be
                   consumed or destroyed.” [The Great Transformation, p. 176]
                (Although we should point out that von Mises argument that workers will
              “eventually” ﬁnd work as well as being nice and vague — how long is
              “eventually”?, for example — is contradicted by actual experience. As the
              Keynesian economist Michael Stewart notes, in the nineteenth century
              workers “who lost their jobs had to redeploy fast or starve (and even this
              feature of the ninetheenth century economy… did not prevent prolonged
              recessions)” [Keynes in the 1990s, p. 31] Workers “reducing their demands”
              may actually worsen an economic slump, causing more unemployment in the
              short run and lengthening the length of the crisis. We address the issue of
              unemployment and workers “reducing their demands” in more detail in
              section C.9).
                It is sometimes argued that capital needs labour, so both have an equal say
              in the terms oﬀered, and hence the labour market is based on “liberty.” But
              for capitalism to be based on real freedom or on true free agreement, both
              sides of the capital/labour divide must be equal in bargaining power,
              otherwise any agreement would favour the most powerful at the expense of
              the other party. However, due to the existence of private property and the
              states needed to protect it, this equality is de facto impossible, regardless of
              the theory. This is because. in general, capitalists have three advantages on
              the “free” labour market-- the law and state placing the rights of property
              above those of labour, the existence of unemployment over most of the
              business cycle and capitalists having more resources to fall back on. We will
              discuss each in turn.
                The ﬁrst advantage, namely property owners having the backing of the law
              and state, ensures that when workers go on strike or use other forms of direct
              action (or even when they try to form a union) the capitalist has the full
              backing of the state to employ scabs, break picket lines or ﬁre “the ringleaders.” This obviously gives employers greater power in their bargaining
              position, placing workers in a weak position (a position that may make them,
              the workers, think twice before standing up for their rights).
                The existence of unemployment over most of the business cycle ensures that
              “employers have a structural advantage in the labour market, because there
              are typically more candidates… than jobs for them to ﬁll.” This means that
              ”[c]ompetition in labour markets us typically skewed in favour of employers: it
              is a buyers market. And in a buyer’s market, it is the sellers who compromise.
              Competition for labour is not strong enough to ensure that workers’ desires
              are always satisiﬁed.” [Juliet B. Schor, The Overworked American, p. 71, p.
              129] If the labour market generally favours the employer, then this obviously
              places working people at a disadvantage as the threat of unemployment and
              the hardships associated with it encourages workers to take any job and
              submit to their bosses demands and power while employed. Unemployment,
              in other words, serves to discipline labour. The higher the prevailing
363 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              unemployment rate, the harder it is to ﬁnd a new job, which raises the cost of
              job loss and makes it less likely for workers to strike, join unions, or to resist
              employer demands, and so on.
                As Bakunin argued, “the property owners... are likewise forced to seek out
              and purchase labour... but not in the same measure … [there is no] equality
              between those who oﬀer their labour and those who purchase it.” [Op. Cit., p.
              183] This ensures that any “free agreements” made beneﬁt the capitalists
              more than the workers (see the next section on periods of full employment,
              when conditions tilt in favour of working people).
                Lastly, there is the issue of inequalities in wealth and so resources. The
              capitalist generally has more resources to fall back on during strikes and
              while waiting to ﬁnd employees (for example, large companies with many
              factories can swap production to their other factories if one goes on strike).
              And by having more resources to fall back on, the capitalist can hold out
              longer than the worker, so placing the employer in a stronger bargaining
              position and so ensuring labour contracts favour them. This was recognised
              by Adam Smith:
                   “It is not diﬀicult to foresee which of the two parties [workers and
                   capitalists] must, upon all ordinary occasions... force the other into
                   a compliance with their terms... In all such disputes the masters can
## hold out much longer... though they did not employ a single
                   workman [the masters] could generally live a year or two upon the
## stocks which they already acquired. Many workmen could not
                   subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scare any a year
## without employment. In the long-run the workman may be as
                   necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is
                   not so immediate… [I]n disputes with their workmen, masters must
                   generally have the advantage.” [Wealth of Nations, pp. 59–60]

## How little things have changed.
                So, while it is deﬁnitely the case that no one forces you to work for them,
              the capitalist system is such that you have little choice but to sell your liberty
              and labour on the “free market.” Not only this, but the labour market (which
              is what makes capitalism capitalism) is (usually) skewed in favour of the
              employer, so ensuring that any “free agreements” made on it favour the boss
              and result in the workers submitting to domination and exploitation. This is
              why anarchists support collective organisation (such as unions) and
              resistance (such as strikes), direct action and solidarity to make us as, if not
              more, powerful than our exploiters and win important reforms and
              improvements (and, ultimately, change society), even when faced with the
              disadvantages on the labour market we have indicated. The despotism
              associated with property (to use Proudhon’s expression) is resisted by those
              subject to it and, needless to say, the boss does not always win.
              B.4.4 But what about periods of high demand for
              labour?
364 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                Of course there are periods when the demand for labour exceeds supply, but
              these periods hold the seeds of depression for capitalism, as workers are in an
              excellent position to challenge, both individually and collectively, their allotted
              role as commodities. This point is discussed in more detail in section C.7
              (What causes the capitalist business cycle? ) and so we will not do so here.
              For now it’s enough to point out that during normal times (i.e. over most of
              the business cycle), capitalists often enjoy extensive authority over workers,
              an authority deriving from the unequal bargaining power between capital and
              labour, as noted by Adam Smith and many others.
                However, this changes during times of high demand for labour. To illustrate,
              let us assume that supply and demand approximate each other. It is clear that
              such a situation is only good for the worker. Bosses cannot easily ﬁre a worker
              as there is no one to replace them and the workers, either collectively by
              solidarity or individually by “exit” (i.e. quitting and moving to a new job), can
              ensure a boss respects their interests and, indeed, can push these interests to
              the full. The boss ﬁnds it hard to keep their authority intact or from stopping
              wages rising and causing a proﬁts squeeze. In other words, as unemployment
              drops, workers power increases.
                Looking at it another way, giving someone the right to hire and ﬁre an input
              into a production process vests that individual with considerable power over
              that input unless it is costless for that input to move; that is unless the input is
              perfectly mobile. This is only approximated in real life for labour during
              periods of full employment, and so perfect mobility of labour costs problems
              for a capitalist ﬁrm because under such conditions workers are not dependent
              on a particular capitalist and so the level of worker eﬀort is determined far
              more by the decisions of workers (either collectively or individually) than by
              managerial authority. The threat of ﬁring cannot be used as a threat to
              increase eﬀort, and hence production, and so full employment increases
              workers power.
                With the capitalist ﬁrm being a ﬁxed commitment of resources, this
              situation is intolerable. Such times are bad for business and so occur rarely
              with free market capitalism (we must point out that in neo-classical
              economics, it is assumed that all inputs — including capital — are perfectly
              mobile and so the theory ignores reality and assumes away capitalist
              production itself!).
                During the last period of capitalist boom, the post-war period, we can see
              the breakdown of capitalist authority and the fear this held for the ruling
              elite. The Trilateral Commission’s 1975 report, which attempted to
              “understand” the growing discontent among the general population, makes
              our point well. In periods of full employment, according to the report, there is
              “an excess of democracy.” In other words, due to the increased bargaining
              power workers gained during a period of high demand for labour, people
              started thinking about and acting upon their needs as humans, not as
              commodities embodying labour power. This naturally had devastating eﬀects
              on capitalist and statist authority: “People no longer felt the same compulsion
              to obey those whom they had previously considered superior to themselves in
              age, rank, status, expertise, character, or talent”.
                This loosening of the bonds of compulsion and obedience led to “previously
              passive or unorganised groups in the population, blacks, Indians, Chicanos,
365 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              white ethnic groups, students and women... embark[ing] on concerted eﬀorts
              to establish their claims to opportunities, rewards, and privileges, which they
              had not considered themselves entitled to before.”
                Such an “excess” of participation in politics of course posed a serious threat
              to the status quo, since for the elites who authored the report, it was
              considered axiomatic that “the eﬀective operation of a democratic political
              system usually requires some measure of apathy and non-involvement on the
              part of some individuals and groups… . In itself, this marginality on the part of
              some groups is inherently undemocratic, but it is also one of the factors which
              has enabled democracy to function eﬀectively.” Such a statement reveals the
              hollowness of the establishment’s concept of ‘democracy,’ which in order to
              function eﬀectively (i.e. to serve elite interests) must be “inherently
              undemocratic.”
                Any period where people feel empowered allows them to communicate with
              their fellows, identify their needs and desires, and resist those forces that
              deny their freedom to manage their own lives. Such resistance strikes a
              deadly blow at the capitalist need to treat people as commodities, since (to requote Polanyi) people no longer feel that it “is not for the commodity to decide
              where it should be oﬀered for sale, to what purpose it should be used, at what
              price it should be allowed to change hands, and in what manner it should be
              consumed or destroyed.” Instead, as thinking and feeling people, they act to
              reclaim their freedom and humanity.
                As noted at the beginning of this section, the economic eﬀects of such
              periods of empowerment and revolt are discussed in section C.7. We will end
              by quoting the Polish economist Michal Kalecki, who noted that a continuous
              capitalist boom would not be in the interests of the ruling class. In 1943, in
              response to the more optimistic Keynesians, he noted that “to maintain the
              high level of employment… in the subsequent boom, a strong opposition of
              ‘business leaders’ is likely to be encountered… lasting full employment is not
              at all to their liking. The workers would ‘get out of hand’ and the ‘captains of
              industry’ would be anxious ‘to teach them a lesson’” because “under a regime
              of permanent full employment, ‘the sack’ would cease to play its role as a
              disciplinary measure. The social position of the boss would be undermined
              and the self assurance and class consciousness of the working class would
              grow. Strikes for wage increases and improvements in conditions of work
              would create political tension… ‘discipline in the factories’ and ‘political
              stability’ are more appreciated by business leaders than proﬁts. Their class
              interest tells them that lasting full employment is unsound from their point of
              view and that unemployment is an integral part of the normal capitalist
              system.” [quoted by Malcolm C. Sawyer, The Economics of Michal Kalecki,
              p. 139 and p. 138]
                Therefore, periods when the demand for labour outstrips supply are not
              healthy for capitalism, as they allow people to assert their freedom and
              humanity — both fatal to the system. This is why news of large numbers of
              new jobs sends the stock market plunging and why capitalists are so keen
              these days to maintain a “natural” rate of unemployment (that it has to be
              maintained indicates that it is not “natural”). Kalecki, we must point out, also
              correctly predicted the rise of “a powerful bloc” between “big business and
              the rentier interests” against full employment and that “they would probably

              ﬁnd more than one economist to declare that the situation was manifestly
              unsound.” The resulting “pressure of all these forces, and in particular big
              business” would “induce the Government to return to… orthodox policy.”
              [Kalecki, quoted by Sawyer, Op. Cit., p. 140] This is exactly what happened in
              the 1970s, with the monetarists and other sections of the “free market” right
              providing the ideological support for the business lead class war, and whose
              “theories” (when applied) promptly generated massive unemployment, thus
              teaching the working class the required lesson.
                 So, although detrimental to proﬁt-making, periods of recession and high
              unemployment are not only unavoidable but are necessary to capitalism in
              order to “discipline” workers and “teach them a lesson.” And in all, it is little
              wonder that capitalism rarely produces periods approximating full
              employment — they are not in its interests (see also section C.9). The
              dynamics of capitalism makes recession and unemployment inevitable, just as
              it makes class struggle (which creates these dynamics) inevitable.
              B.4.5 But I want to be “left alone”!
                It is ironic that supporters of laissez-faire capitalism, such as “Libertarians”
              and “anarcho”-capitalists, should claim that they want to be “left alone,” since
              capitalism never allows this. As Max Stirner expressed it:
                   “Restless acquisition does not let us take breath, take a calm
                   enjoyment. We do not get the comfort of our possessions…” [Max
                   Stirner The Ego and Its Own, p. 268]
                Capitalism cannot let us “take breath” simply because it needs to grow or
              die, which puts constant pressure on both workers and capitalists (see section
              D.4.1). Workers can never relax or be free of anxiety about losing their jobs,
              because if they do not work, they do not eat, nor can they ensure that their
              children will get a better life. Within the workplace, they are not “left alone”
              by their bosses in order to manage their own activities. Instead, they are told
              what to do, when to do it and how to do it. Indeed, the history of experiments
              in workers’ control and self-management within capitalist companies conﬁrms
              our claims that, for the worker, capitalism is incompatible with the desire to
              be “left alone.” As an illustration we will use the
                “Pilot Program” conducted by General Electric between 1968 and 1972.
                General Electric proposed the “Pilot Program” as a means of overcoming
              the problems they faced with introducing Numeric Control (N/C) machinery
              into its plant at Lynn River Works, Massachusetts. Faced with rising tensions
              on the shop ﬂoor, bottle-necks in production and low-quality products, GE
              management tried a scheme of “job enrichment” based on workers’ control of
              production in one area of the plant. By June 1970 the workers’ involved were
              “on their own” (as one manager put it) and ”[i]n terms of group job
              enlargement this was when the Pilot Project really began, with immediate
              results in increased output and machine utilisation, and a reduction on
              manufacturing losses. As one union oﬀicial remarked two years later, ‘The fact
              that we broke down a traditional policy of GE [that the union could never have
              a hand in managing the business] was in itself satisfying, especially when we

              could throw success up to them to boot.’” [David Noble, Forces of
              Production, p. 295]
                The project, after some initial scepticism, proved to be a great success with
              the workers involved. Indeed, other workers in the factory desired to be
              included and the union soon tried to get it spread throughout the plant and
              into other GE locations. The success of the scheme was that it was based on
              workers’ managing their own aﬀairs rather than being told what to do by
              their bosses — “We are human beings,” said one worker, “and want to be
              treated as such.” [quoted by Noble, Op. Cit., p. 292] To be fully human means
              to be free to govern oneself in all aspects of life, including production.
                However, just after a year of the workers being given control over their
              working lives, management stopped the project. Why? “In the eyes of some
              management supporters of the ‘experiment,’ the Pilot Program was
              terminated because management as a whole refused to give up any of its
              traditional authority … [t]he Pilot Program foundered on the basic
              contradiction of capitalist production: Who’s running the shop?” [Noble, Op.
              Cit., p. 318]
                Noble goes on to argue that to GE’s top management, “the union’s desire to
              extend the program appeared as a step toward greater workers control over
              production and, as such, a threat to the traditional authority rooted in private
              ownership of the means of production. Thus the decision to terminate
              represented a defence not only of the prerogatives of production supervisors
              and plant managers but also of the power vested in property ownership.” He
              notes that this result was not an isolated case and that the “demise of the GE
              Pilot Program followed the typical pattern for such ‘job enrichment
              experiments’” [Op. Cit., p. 318 and p. 320] Even though ”[s]everal dozen
              well-documented experiments show that productivity increases and social
              problems decrease when workers participate in the work decisions aﬀecting
              their lives” [Department of Health, Education and Welfare study quoted by
              Noble, Op. Cit., p. 322] such schemes are ended by bosses seeking to
              preserve their own power, the power that ﬂows from private property.
                As one worker in the GE Pilot Program stated, ”[w]e just want to be left
              alone.” They were not — capitalist social relations prohibit such a possibility
              (as Noble correctly notes, “the ‘way of life’ for the management meant
              controlling the lives of others” [Op. Cit., p. 294 and p. 300]). In spite of
              improved productivity, projects in workers’ control are scrapped because they
              undermined both the power of the capitalists — and by undermining their
              power, you potentially undermine their proﬁts too (“If we’re all one, for
              manufacturing reasons, we must share in the fruits equitably, just like a co-op
              business.” [GE Pilot Program worker, quoted by Noble, Op. Cit., p. 295]).
                As we argue in more detail in section J.5.12, proﬁt maximisation can work
              against eﬀiciency, meaning that capitalism can harm the overall economy by
              promoting less eﬀicient production techniques (i.e. hierarchical ones against
              egalitarian ones) because it is in the interests of capitalists to do so and the
              capitalist market rewards that behaviour. This is because, ultimately, proﬁts
              are unpaid labour. If you empower labour, give workers’ control over their
              work then they will increase eﬀiciency and productivity (they know how to do
              their job the best) but you also erode authority structures within the
              workplace. Workers’ will seek more and more control (freedom naturally tries
368 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              to grow) and this, as the Pilot Program worker clearly saw, implies a cooperative workplace in which workers’, not managers, decide what to do with
              the surplus produced. By threatening power, you threaten proﬁts (or, more
              correctly, who controls the proﬁt and where it goes). With the control over
              production and who gets to control any surplus in danger, it is unsurprising
              that companies soon abandon such schemes and return to the old, less
              eﬀicient, hierarchical schemes based on “Do what you are told, for as long as
              you are told.” Such a regime is hardly ﬁt for free people and, as Noble notes,
              the regime that replaced the GE Pilot Program was “designed to ‘break’ the
              pilots of their new found ‘habits’ of self-reliance, self-discipline, and selfrespect.” [Op. Cit., p. 307]
                Thus the experience of workers’ control project within capitalist ﬁrms
              indicates well that capitalism cannot “leave you alone” if you are a wage
              slave.
                Moreover, capitalists themselves cannot relax because they must ensure
              their workers’ productivity rises faster than their workers’ wages, otherwise
              their business will fail (see sections C.2 and C.3). This means that every
              company has to innovate or be left behind, to be put out of business or work.
              Hence the boss is not “left alone” — their decisions are made under the
              duress of market forces, of the necessities imposed by competition on
              individual capitalists. Restless acquisition — in this context, the necessity to
              accumulate capital in order to survive in the market — always haunts the
              capitalist. And since unpaid labour is the key to capitalist expansion, work
              must continue to exist and grow — necessitating the boss to control the
              working hours of the worker to ensure that they produce more goods than
              they receive in wages. The boss is not “left alone” nor do they leave the
              worker alone.
                These facts, based upon the authority relations associated with private
              property and relentless competition, ensure that the desire to be “left alone”
              cannot be satisﬁed under capitalism.
                As Murray Bookchin observes:
                   “Despite their assertions of autonomy and distrust of state authority
                   . .. classical liberal thinkers did not in the last instance hold to the
                   notion that the individual is completely free from lawful guidance.
                   Indeed, their interpretation of autonomy actually presupposed quite
                   deﬁnite arrangements beyond the individual — notably, the laws of
                   the marketplace. Individual autonomy to the contrary, these laws
                   constitute a social organising system in which all ‘collections of
                   individuals’ are held under the sway of the famous ‘invisible hand’
                   of competition. Paradoxically, the laws of the marketplace override
                   the exercise of ‘free will’ by the same sovereign individuals who
                   otherwise constitute the “collection of individuals.” [“Communalism:
## The Democratic Dimension of Anarchism”, pp. 1–17, Democracy
                   and Nature no. 8, p. 4]
                Human interaction is an essential part of life. Anarchism proposes to
              eliminate only undesired social interactions and authoritarian impositions,
              which are inherent in capitalism and indeed in any hierarchical form of socioeconomic organisation (e.g. state socialism). Hermits soon become less than
369 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              human, as social interaction enriches and develops individuality. Capitalism
              may attempt to reduce us to hermits, only “connected” by the market, but
              such a denial of our humanity and individuality inevitably feeds the spirit of
              revolt. In practice the “laws” of the market and the hierarchy of capital will
              never “leave one alone,” but instead, crush one’s individuality and freedom.
              Yet this aspect of capitalism conﬂicts with the human “instinct for freedom,”
              as Noam Chomsky describes it, and hence there arises a counter-tendency
              toward radicalisation and rebellion among any oppressed people (see section
              J).
                 One last point. The desire to “be left alone” often expresses two drastically
              diﬀerent ideas — the wish to be your own master and manage your own
              aﬀairs and the desire by bosses and landlords to have more power over their
              property. However, the authority exercised by such owners over their property
              is also exercised over those who use that property. Therefore, the notion of
              “being left alone” contains two contradictory aspects within a class ridden
              and hierarchical society. Obviously anarchists are sympathetic to the ﬁrst,
              inherently libertarian, aspect — the desire to manage your own life, in your
              own way — but we reject the second aspect and any implication that it is in
              the interests of the governed to leave those in power alone. Rather, it is in the
              interest of the governed to subject those with authority over them to as much
              control as possible — for obvious reasons.
                 Therefore, working people are more or less free to the extent that they
              restrict the ability of their bosses to be “left alone.” One of the aims of
              anarchists within a capitalist society is ensure that those in power are not
              “left alone” to exercise their authority over those subject to it. We see
              solidarity, direct action and workplace and community organisation as a
              means of interfering with the authority of the state, capitalists and property
              owners until such time as we can destroy such authoritarian social
              relationships once and for all.
                 Hence anarchist dislike of the term “laissez-faire” — within a class society it
              can only mean protecting the powerful against the working class (under the
              banner of “neutrally” enforcing property rights and so the power derived
              from them). However, we are well aware of the other, libertarian, vision
              expressed in the desire to be “left alone.” That is the reason we have
              discussed why capitalist society can never actually achieve that desire — it is
              handicapped by its hierarchical and competitive nature — and how such a
              desire can be twisted into a means of enhancing the power of the few over the
              many.
              B.5 Is capitalism empowering and based on
              human action?
                 A key element of the social vision propounded by capitalism, particularly
              “libertarian” capitalism, is that of “voting” by the “customer,” which is
              compared to political voting by the “citizen.” According to Milton Friedman,
              “when you vote in the supermarket, you get precisely what you voted for and
              so does everyone else.” Such “voting” with one’s pocket is then claimed to be
              an example of the wonderful “freedom” people enjoy under capitalism (as
370 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              opposed to “socialism,” always equated by right-wingers with state socialism,
              which will be discussed in section H). However, in evaluating this claim, the
              diﬀerence between customers and citizens is critical.
                 The customer chooses between products on the shelf that have been
              designed and built by others for the purpose of proﬁt. The consumer is the
              end-user, essentially a spectator rather than an actor, merely choosing
              between options created elsewhere by others. Market decision making is
              therefore fundamentally passive and reactionary, i.e. based on reacting to
              developments initiated by others. In contrast, the “citizen” is actively
              involved, at least ideally, in all stages of the decision making process, either
              directly or through elected delegates. Therefore, given decentralised and
              participatory-democratic organisations, decision making by citizens can be
              pro-active, based on human action in which one takes the initiative and sets
              the agenda oneself. Indeed, most supporters of the “citizen” model support it
              precisely because it actively involves individuals in participating in social
              decision making, so creating an educational aspect to the process and
              developing the abilities and powers of those involved.
                 In addition, the power of the consumer is not evenly distributed across
              society. Thus the expression “voting” when used in a market context
              expresses a radically diﬀerent idea than the one usually associated with it. In
              political voting everyone gets one vote, in the market it is one vote per dollar.
              What sort of “democracy” is it that gives one person more votes than tens of
              thousands of others combined?
                 Therefore the “consumer” idea fails to take into account the diﬀerences in
              power that exist on the market as well as assigning an essentially passive role
              to the individual. At best they can act on the market as isolated individuals
              through their purchasing power. However, such a position is part of the
              problem for, as E.F. Schumacher argues, the “buyer is essentially a bargain
              hunter; he is not concerned with the origin of the goods or the conditions
              under which they have been produced. His sole concern is to obtain the best
              value for money.” He goes on to note that the market “therefore respects only
              the surface of society and its signiﬁcance relates to the momentary situation
              as it exists there and then. There is no probing into the depths of things, into
              the natural or social facts that lie behind them.” [Small is Beautiful, p. 29]
                 Indeed, the “customer” model actually works against any attempt to
              “probe” the facts of things. Firstly, consumers rarely know the signiﬁcance or
              implications of the goods they are oﬀered because the price mechanism
              withholds such information from them. Secondly, because the atomistic nature
              of the market makes discussion about the “why” and “how” of production
              diﬀicult — we get to choose between various “whats”. Instead of critically
              evaluating the pros and cons of certain economic practices, all we are oﬀered
              is the option of choosing between things already produced. We can only re-act
              when the damage is already done by picking the option which does least
              damage (often we do not have even that choice). And to discover a given
              products social and ecological impact we have to take a pro-active role by
              joining groups which provide this sort of information (information which,
              while essential for a rational decision, the market does not and cannot
              provide).
                 Moreover, the “consumer” model fails to recognise that the decisions we
371 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              make on the market to satisfy our “wants” are determined by social and
              market forces. What we are capable of wanting is relative to the forms of
              social organisation we live in. For example, people choose to buy cars because
              General Motors bought up and destroyed the tram network in the 1930s and
              people buy “fast food” because they have no time to cook because of
              increasing working hours. This means that our decisions within the market
              are often restricted by economic pressures. For example, the market forces
              ﬁrms, on pain of bankruptcy, to do whatever possible to be cost-eﬀective.
              Firms that pollute, have bad working conditions and so on often gain
              competitive advantage in so doing and other ﬁrms either have to follow suit or
              go out of business. A “race to the bottom” ensures, with individuals making
              “decisions of desperation” just to survive. Individual commitments to certain
              values, in other words, may become irrelevant simply because the
              countervailing economic pressures are simply too intense (little wonder
              Robert Owen argued that the proﬁt motive was “a principle entirely
              unfavourable to individual and public happiness”).
                And, of course, the market also does not, and cannot, come up with goods
              that we do not want in our capacity as consumers but desire to protect for
              future generations or because of ecological reasons. By making the protection
              of the planet, eco-systems and other such “goods” dependent on the market,
              capitalism ensures that unless we put our money where our mouth is we can
              have no say in the protection of such goods as eco-systems, historical sites,
              and so on. The need to protect such “resources” in the long term is ignored in
              favour of short-termism — indeed, if we do not “consume” such products
              today they will not be there tomorrow. Placed within a society that the vast
              majority of people often face diﬀiculties making ends meet, this means that
              capitalism can never provide us with goods which we would like to see
              available as people (either for others or for future generations or just to
              protect the planet) but cannot aﬀord or desire as consumers.
                It is clearly a sign of the increasing dominance of capitalist ideology that the
              “customer” model is being transferred to the political arena. This reﬂects the
              fact that the increasing scale of political institutions has reinforced the
              tendency noted earlier for voters to become passive spectators, placing their
              “support” behind one or another “product” (i.e. party or leader). As Murray
              Bookchin comments, “educated, knowledgeable citizens become reduced to
              mere taxpayers who exchange money for ‘services.’” [Remaking Society, p.
              71] In practice, due to state centralism, this turns the political process into an
              extension of the market, with “citizens” being reduced to “consumers.” Or, in
              Erich Fromm’s apt analysis, “The functioning of the political machinery in a
              democratic country is not essentially diﬀerent from the procedure on the
              commodity market. The political parties are not too diﬀerent from big
              commercial enterprises, and the professional politicians try to sell their wares
              to the public.” [The Sane Society, pp. 186–187]
                But does it matter? Friedman suggests that being a customer is better than
              being a citizen as you get “precisely” what you, and everyone else, wants.
                The key questions here are whether people always get what they want when
              they shop. Do consumers who buy bleached newsprint and toilet paper really
              want tons of dioxins and other organochlorides in rivers, lakes and coastal
              waters? Do customers who buy cars really want traﬀic jams, air pollution,
372 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              motorways carving up the landscape and the greenhouse eﬀect? And what of
              those who do not buy these things? They are also aﬀected by the decisions of
              others. The notion that only the consumer is aﬀected by his or her decision is
              nonsense — as is the childish desire to get “precisely” what you want,
              regardless of the social impact.
                Perhaps Friedman could claim that when we consume we also approve of its
              impact. But when we “vote” on the market we cannot say that we approved of
              the resulting pollution (or distribution of income or power) because that was
              not a choice on oﬀer. Such changes are pre-deﬁned or an aggregate outcome
              and can only be chosen by a collective decision. In this way we can modify
              outcomes we could bring about individually but which harm us collectively.
              And unlike the market, in politics we can change our minds and revert back
              to a former state, undoing the mistakes made. No such option is available on
              the market.
                So Friedman’s claims that in elections “you end up with something diﬀerent
              from what you voted for” is equally applicable to the market place.
                These considerations indicate that the “consumer” model of human action is
              somewhat limited (to say the least!). Instead we need to recognise the
              importance of the “citizen” model, which we should point out includes the
              “consumer” model within it. Taking part as an active member of the
              community does not imply that we stop making individual consumption
              choices between those available, all it does is potentially enrich our available
              options by removing lousy choices (such as ecology or proﬁt, cheap goods or
              labour rights, family or career).
                In addition we must stress its role in developing those who practice the
              “citizen” model and how it can enrich our social and personal life. Being
              active within participatory institutions fosters and develops an active, “publicspirited” type of character. Citizens, because they are making collective
              decisions have to weight other interests as well as their own and so consider
              the impact on themselves, others, society and the environment of possible
              decisions. It is, by its very nature, an educative process by which all beneﬁt by
              developing their critical abilities and expanding their deﬁnition of self-interest
              to take into account themselves as part of a society and eco-system as well as
              as an individual. The “consumer” model, with its passive and exclusively
              private/money orientation develops few of people’s faculties and narrows
              their self-interest to such a degree that their “rational” actions can actually
              (indirectly) harm them.
                As Noam Chomsky argues, it is “now widely realised that the economists
              ‘externalities’ can no longer be consigned to footnotes. No one who gives a
              moment’s thought to the problems of contemporary society can fail to be
              aware of the social costs of consumption and production, the progressive
              destruction of the environment, the utter irrationality of the utilisation of
              contemporary technology, the inability of a system based on proﬁt or growth
              maximisation to deal with needs that can only be expressed collectively, and
              the enormous bias this system imposes towards maximisation of commodities
              for personal use in place of the general improvement of the quality of life.”
              [Radical Priorities, pp. 190–1]
                The “citizen” model takes on board the fact that the sum of rational
              individual decisions may not yield a rational collective outcome (which, we
373 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              must add, harms the individuals involved and so works against their selfinterest). Social standards, created and enriched by a process of discussion
              and dialogue can be eﬀective in realms where the atomised “consumer”
              model is essentially powerless to achieve constructive social change, never
              mind protect the individual from “agreeing” to “decisions of desperation” that
              leave them and society as a whole worse oﬀ (see also sections E.3 and E.5).
                This is not to suggest that anarchists desire to eliminate individual decision
              making, far from it. An anarchist society will be based upon individuals
              making decisions on what they want to consume, where they want to work,
              what kind of work they want to do and so on. So the aim of the “citizen”
              model is not to “replace” the “consumer” model, but only to improve the
              social environment within which we make our individual consumption
              decisions. What the “citizen” model of human action desires is to place such
              decisions within a social framework, one that allows each individual to take an
              active part in improving the quality of life for us all by removing “Hobson
              choices” as far as possible.
              B.6 But won’t decisions made by individuals
              with their own money be the best?
                This question refers to an argument commonly used by capitalists to justify
              the fact that investment decisions are removed from public control under
              capitalism, with private investors making all the decisions. Clearly the
              assumption behind this argument is that individuals suddenly lose their
              intelligence when they get together and discuss their common interests. But
              surely, through debate, we can enrich our ideas by social interaction. In the
              marketplace we do not discuss but instead act as atomised individuals.
                This issue involves the “Isolation Paradox,” according to which the very
              logic of individual decision-making is diﬀerent from that of collective decisionmaking. An example is the “tyranny of small decisions.” Let us assume that in
              the soft drink industry some companies start to produce (cheaper) nonreturnable bottles. The end result of this is that most, if not all, the companies
              making returnable bottles lose business and switch to non-returnables.
              Result? Increased waste and environmental destruction.
                This is because market price fails to take into account social costs and
              beneﬁts, indeed it mis-estimates them for both buyer/seller and to others not
              involved in the transaction. This is because, as Schumacher points out, the
              “strength of the idea of private enterprise lies in its terrifying simplicity. It
              suggests that the totality of life can be reduced to one aspect — proﬁts...”
              [Small is Beautiful, p. 215] But life cannot be reduced to one aspect without
              impoverishing it and so capitalism “knows the price of everything but the
              value of nothing.”
                Therefore the market promotes “the tyranny of small decisions” and this
              can have negative outcomes for those involved. The capitalist “solution” to
              this problem is no solution, namely to act after the event. Only after the
              decisions have been made and their eﬀects felt can action be taken. But by
              then the damage has been done. Can suing a company really replace a fragile
              eco-system? In addition, the economic context has been signiﬁcantly altered,
374 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              because investment decisions are often diﬀicult to unmake.
                In other words, the operations of the market provide an unending source of
              examples for the argument that the aggregate results of the pursuit of private
              interest may well be collectively damaging. And as collectives are made up of
              individuals, that means damaging to the individuals involved. The remarkable
              ideological success of “free market” capitalism is to identify the anti-social
              choice with self-interest, so that any choice in the favour of the interests
              which we share collectively is treated as a piece of self-sacriﬁce. However, by
              atomising decision making, the market often actively works against the selfinterest of the individuals that make it up.
                Game theory is aware that the sum of rational choices do not automatically
              yield a rational group outcome. Indeed, it terms such situations as “collective
              action” problems. By not agreeing common standards, a “race to the bottom”
              can ensue in which a given society reaps choices that we as individuals really
              don’t want. The rational pursuit of individual self-interest leaves the group,
              and so most individuals, worse oﬀ. The problem is not bad individual
              judgement (far from it, the individual is the only person able to know what is
              best for them in a given situation). It is the absence of social discussion and
              remedies that compels people to make unbearable choices because the
              available menu presents no good options.
                By not discussing the impact of their decisions with everyone who will be
              aﬀected, the individuals in question have not made a better decision. Of
              course, under our present highly centralised statist and capitalist system,
              such a discussion would be impossible to implement, and its closest
              approximation — the election process — is too vast, bureaucratic and
              dominated by wealth to do much beyond passing a few toothless laws which
              are generally ignored when they hinder proﬁts.
                However, let’s consider what the situation would be like under libertarian
              socialism, where the local community assemblies discuss the question of
              returnable bottles along with the workforce. Here the function of speciﬁc
              interest groups (such as consumer co-operatives, ecology groups, workplace
              Research and Development action committees and so on) would play a critical
              role in producing information. Knowledge, as Bakunin, Kropotkin, etc. knew,
              is widely dispersed throughout society and the role of interested parties is
              essential in making it available to others. Based upon this information and the
              debate it provokes, the collective decision reached would most probably
              favour returnables over waste. This would be a better decision from a social
              and ecological point of view, and one that would beneﬁt the individuals who
              discussed and agreed upon its eﬀects on themselves and their society.
                In other words, anarchists think we have to take an active part in creating
              the menu as well as picking options from it which reﬂect our individual tastes
              and interests.
                It needs to be emphasised that such a system does not involve discussing
              and voting on everything under the sun, which would paralyse all activity. To
              the contrary, most decisions would be left to those interested (e.g. workers
              decide on administration and day-to-day decisions within the factory), the
              community decides upon policy (e.g. returnables over waste). Neither is it a
              case of electing people to decide for us, as the decentralised nature of the
              confederation of communities ensures that power lies in the hands of local
375 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              people.
                This process in no way implies that “society” decides what an individual is
              to consume. That, like all decisions aﬀecting the individual only, is left entirely
              up to the person involved. Communal decision-making is for decisions that
              impact both the individual and society, allowing those aﬀected by it to discuss
              it among themselves as equals, thus creating a rich social context within
              which individuals can act. This is an obvious improvement over the current
              system, where decisions that often profoundly alter people’s lives are left to
              the discretion of an elite class of managers and owners, who are supposed to
              “know best.”
                There is, of course, the danger of “tyranny of the majority” in any
              democratic system, but in a direct libertarian democracy, this danger would
              be greatly reduced, for reasons discussed in section I.5.6 ( Won’t there be a
              danger of a “tyranny of the majority” under libertarian socialism?).
              B.7 What classes exist within modern society?
                For anarchists, class analysis is an important means of understanding the
              world and what is going on in it. While recognition of the fact that classes
              actually exist is less prevalent now than it once was, this does not mean that
              classes have ceased to exist. Quite the contrary. As we’ll see, it means only
              that the ruling class has been more successful than before in obscuring the
              existence of class.
                Class can be objectively deﬁned: the relationship between an individual and
              the sources of power within society determines his or her class. We live in a
              class society in which a few people possess far more political and economic
              power than the majority, who usually work for the minority that controls them
              and the decisions that aﬀect them. This means that class is based both on
              exploitation and oppression, with some controlling the labour of others for
              their own gain. The means of oppression have been indicated in earlier parts
              of section B, while section C (What are the myths of capitalist economics?)
              indicates exactly how exploitation occurs within a society apparently based on
              free and equal exchange. In addition, it also highlights the eﬀects on the
              economic system itself of this exploitation. The social and political impact of
              the system and the classes and hierarchies it creates is discussed in depth in
              section D (How do statism and capitalism aﬀect society?).
                We must emphasise at the outset that the idea of the “working class” as
              composed of nothing but industrial workers is simply false. It is not
              applicable today, if it ever was. Power, in terms of hire/ﬁre and investment
              decisions, is the important thing. Ownership of capital as a means of
              determining a person’s class, while still important, does not tell the whole
              story. An obvious example is that of the higher layers of management within
              corporations. They have massive power within the company, basically taking
              over the role held by the actual capitalist in smaller ﬁrms. While they may
              technically be “salary slaves” their power and position in the social hierarchy
              indicate that they are members of the ruling class in practice (and,
              consequently, their income is best thought of as a share of proﬁts rather than
              a wage). Much the same can be said of politicians and state bureaucrats
              whose power and inﬂuence does not derive from the ownership of the means
376 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              of production but rather then control over the means of coercion. Moreover,
              many large companies are owned by other large companies, through pension
              funds, multinationals, etc. (in 1945, 93% of shares were owned by individuals;
              by 1997, this had fallen to 43%). Needless to say, if working-class people own
              shares that does not make them capitalists as the dividends are not enough to
              live on nor do they give them any say in how a company is run).
                 For most anarchists, there are two main classes:
                   (1) Working class - those who have to work for a living but have no
                   real control over that work or other major decisions that aﬀect
                   them, i.e. order-takers. This class also includes the unemployed,
                   pensioners, etc., who have to survive on handouts from the state.
                   They have little wealth and little (oﬀicial) power. This class includes
                   the growing service worker sector, most (if not the vast majority) of
                   "white collar" workers as well as traditional "blue collar" workers.
                   Most self-employed people would be included in this class, as would
                   the bulk of peasants and artisans (where applicable). In a nutshell,
                   the producing classes and those who either were producers or will
## be producers. This group makes up the vast majority of the
## population.

                   (2) Ruling class - those who control investment decisions,
                   determine high level policy, set the agenda for capital and state.
                   This is the elite at the top, owners or top managers of large
                   companies, multinationals and banks (i.e., the capitalists), owners of
                   large amounts of land (i.e. landlords or the aristocracy, if
                   applicable), top-level state oﬀicials, politicians, and so forth. They
                   have real power within the economy and/or state, and so control
                   society. In a nutshell, the owners of power (whether political, social
                   or economic) or the master class. This group consists of around the
## top 5-15% of the population.

                Obviously there are “grey” areas in any society, individuals and groups who
              do not ﬁt exactly into either the working or ruling class. Such people include
              those who work but have some control over other people, e.g. power of hire/
              ﬁre. These are the people who make the minor, day-to-day decisions
              concerning the running of capital or state. This area includes lower to middle
              management, professionals, and small capitalists.
                There is some argument within the anarchist movement whether this “grey”
              area constitutes another (“middle”) class or not. Most anarchists say no, most
              of this “grey” area are working class, others (such as the British Class War
              Federation) argue it is a diﬀerent class. One thing is sure, all anarchists
              agree that most people in this “grey” area have an interest in getting rid of
              the current system just as much as the working class (we should point out
              here that what is usually called “middle class” in the USA and elsewhere is
              nothing of the kind, and usually refers to working class people with decent
              jobs, homes, etc. As class is considered a rude word in polite society in the
              USA, such mystiﬁcation is to be expected).
                So, there will be exceptions to this classiﬁcation scheme. However, most of
              society share common interests, as they face the economic uncertainties and
377 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              hierarchical nature of capitalism.
                 We do not aim to ﬁt all of reality into this class scheme, but only to develop
              it as reality indicates, based on our own experiences of the changing patterns
              of modern society. Nor is this scheme intended to suggest that all members of
              a class have identical interests or that competition does not exist between
              members of the same class, as it does between the classes. Capitalism, by its
              very nature, is a competitive system. As Malatesta pointed out, “one must
              bear in mind that on the one hand the bourgeoisie (the property owners) are
              always at war amongst themselves… and that on the other hand the
              government, though springing from the bourgeoisie and its servant and
              protector, tends, as every servant and every protector, to achieve its own
              emancipation and to dominate whoever it protects. Thus the game of the
              swings, the manoeuvres, the concessions and the withdrawals, the attempts
              to ﬁnd allies among the people and against the conservatives, and among
              conservatives against the people, which is the science of the governors, and
              which blinds the ingenuous and phlegmatic who always wait for salvation to
              come down to them from above.” [Anarchy, p. 25]
                 However, no matter how much inter-elite rivalry goes on, at the slightest
              threat to the system from which they beneﬁt, the ruling class will unite to
              defend their common interests. Once the threat passes, they will return to
              competing among themselves for power, market share and wealth.
              Unfortunately, the working class rarely unites as a class, mainly due to its
              chronic economic and social position. At best, certain sections unite and
              experience the beneﬁts and pleasure of co-operation. Anarchists, by their
              ideas and action try to change this situation and encourage solidarity within
              the working class in order to resist, and ultimately get rid of, capitalism.
              However, their activity is helped by the fact that those in struggle often
              realise that “solidarity is strength” and so start to work together and unite
              their struggles against their common enemy. Indeed, history is full of such
              developments.
              B.7.1 But do classes actually exist?
                So do classes actually exist, or are anarchists making them up? The fact
              that we even need to consider this question points to the pervasive
              propaganda eﬀorts by the ruling class to suppress class consciousness, which
              will be discussed further on. First, however, let’s examine some statistics,
              taking the USA as an example. We have done so because the state has the
              reputation of being a land of opportunity and capitalism. Moreover, class is
              seldom talked about there (although its business class is very class
              conscious). Moreover, when countries have followed the US model of freer
              capitalism (for example, the UK), a similar explosion of inequality develops
              along side increased poverty rates and concentration of wealth into fewer and
              fewer hands.
                There are two ways of looking into class, by income and by wealth. Of the
              two, the distribution of wealth is the most important to understanding the
              class structure as this represents your assets, what you own rather than what
              you earn in a year. Given that wealth is the source of income, this represents

              the impact and power of private property and the class system it represents.
              After all, while all employed workers have an income (i.e. a wage), their
              actual wealth usually amounts to their personal items and their house (if they
              are lucky). As such, their wealth generates little or no income, unlike the
              owners of resources like companies, land and patents. Unsurprisingly, wealth
              insulates its holders from personal economic crises, like unemployment and
              sickness, as well as gives its holders social and political power. It, and its
              perks, can also be passed down the generations. Equally unsurprisingly, the
              distribution of wealth is much more unequal than the distribution of income.
                At the start of the 1990s, the share of total US income was as follows: one
              third went to the top 10% of the population, the next 30% gets another third
              and the bottom 60% gets the last third. Dividing the wealth into thirds, we
              ﬁnd that the top 1% owns a third, the next 9% owns a third, and bottom 90%
              owns the rest. [David Schweickart, After Capitalism, p. 92] Over the 1990s,
              the inequalities in US society have continued to increase. In 1980, the richest
              ﬁfth of Americans had incomes about ten times those of the poorest ﬁfth. A
              decade later, they has twelve times. By 2001, they had incomes over fourteen
              times greater. [Doug Henwood, After the New Economy, p. 79] Looking at
              the ﬁgures for private family wealth, we ﬁnd that in 1976 the wealthiest one
              percent of Americans owned 19% of it, the next 9% owned 30% and the
              bottom 90% of the population owned 51%. By 1995 the top 1% owned 40%,
              more than owned by the bottom 92% of the US population combined — the
              next 9% had 31% while the bottom 90% had only 29% of total (see Edward N.
              Wolﬀ, Top Heavy: A Study of Increasing Inequality in America for
              details).
                So in terms of wealth ownership, we see a system in which a very small
              minority own the means of life. In 1992 the richest 1% of households — about
              2 million adults — owned 39% of the stock owned by individuals. The top 10%,
              owned over 81%. In other words, the bottom 90% of the population had a
              smaller share (23%) of investable capital of all kinds than the richest 1/2%
              (29%). Stock ownership was even more densely concentrated, with the richest
              5% holding 95% of all shares. [Doug Henwood, Wall Street: Class racket]
              Three years later, “the richest 1% of households … owned 42% of the stock
              owned by individuals, and 56% of the bonds … the top 10% together owned
              nearly 90% of both.” Given that around 50% of all corporate stock is owned by
              households, this means that 1% of the population “owns a quarter of the
              productive capital and future proﬁts of corporate America; the top 10% nearly
              half.” [Doug Henwood, Wall Street, pp. 66–7] Unsurprisingly, the
              Congressional Budget Oﬀice estimates that more than half of corporate
              proﬁts ultimately accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers, while only
              about 8 percent go to the bottom 60 percent.
                Henwood summarises the situation by noting that “the richest tenth of the
              population has a bit over three-quarters of all the wealth in this society, and
              the bottom half has almost none — but it has lots of debt.” Most middleincome people have most of their (limited) wealth in their homes and if we
              look at non-residential wealth we ﬁnd a “very, very concentrated” situation.
              The “bottom half of the population claimed about 20% of all income in 2001 —
              but only 2% of non-residential wealth. The richest 5% of the population
              claimed about 23% of income, a bit more than the entire bottom half. But it

              owned almost two-thirds — 65% — of the wealth.” [After the New Economy,
              p. 122]
                In terms of income, the period since 1970 has also been marked by
              increasing inequalities and concentration:
                   “According to estimates by the economists Thomas Piketty and
## Emmanuel Saez — conﬁrmed by data from the Congressional
                   Budget Oﬀice — between 1973 and 2000 the average real income of
                   the bottom 90 percent of American taxpayers actually fell by 7
                   percent. Meanwhile, the income of the top 1 percent rose by 148
                   percent, the income of the top 0.1 percent rose by 343 percent and
## the income of the top 0.01 percent rose 599 percent.” [Paul
                   Krugman, “The Death of Horatio Alger”, The Nation, January 5,
                   2004]
                Doug Henwood provides some more details on income [Op. Cit., p. 90]:

                By far the biggest gainers from the wealth concentration since the 1980s
              have been the super-rich. The closer you get to the top, the bigger the gains.
              In other words, it is not simply that the top 20 percent of families have had
              bigger percentage gains than the rest. Rather, the top 5 percent have done
              better than the next 15, the top 1 percent better than the next 4 per cent, and
              so on.
                As such, if someone argues that while the share of national income going to
              the top 10 percent of earners has increased that it does not matter because
              anyone with an income over $81,000 is in that top 10 percent they are
              missing the point. The lower end of the top ten per cent were not the big
              winners over the last 30 years. Most of the gains in the share in that top ten
              percent went to the top 1 percent (who earn at least $230,000). Of these
              gains, 60 percent went to the top 0.1 percent (who earn more than $790,000).
              And of these gains, almost half went to the top 0.01 percent (a mere 13,000
              people who had an income of at least $3.6 million and an average income of
              $17 million). [Paul Krugman, “For Richer”, New York Times, 20/10/02]
                All this proves that classes do in fact exist, with wealth and power
              concentrating at the top of society, in the hands of the few.
                To put this inequality of income into some perspective, the average full-time
              Wal-Mart employee was paid only about $17,000 a year in 2004. Beneﬁts are
              few, with less than half the company’s workers covered by its health care
              plan. In the same year Wal-Mart’s chief executive, Scott Lee Jr., was paid
              $17.5 million. In other words, every two weeks he was paid about as much as
              his average employee would earn after a lifetime working for him.
                Since the 1970s, most Americans have had only modest salary increases (if
              that). The average annual salary in America, expressed in 1998 dollars (i.e.,
              adjusted for inﬂation) went from $32,522 in 1970 to $35,864 in 1999. That is
              a mere 10 percent increase over nearly 30 years. Over the same period,
              however, according to Fortune magazine, the average real annual
              compensation of the top 100 C.E.O.‘s went from $1.3 million — 39 times the
              pay of an average worker — to $37.5 million, more than 1,000 times the pay
              of ordinary workers.
                Yet even here, we are likely to miss the real picture. The average salary is
              misleading as this does not reﬂect the distribution of wealth. For example, in
              the UK in the early 1990s, two-thirds of workers earned the average wage or
              below and only a third above. To talk about the “average” income, therefore,
              is to disguise remarkable variation. In the US, adjusting for inﬂation, average
              family income — total income divided by the number of families — grew 28%
              between 1979 and 1997. The median family income — the income of a family
              in the middle (i.e. the income where half of families earn more and half less)
              grew by only 10%. The median is a better indicator of how typical American
              families are doing as the distribution of income is so top heavy in the USA (i.e.
              the average income is considerably higher than the median). It should also be
              noted that the incomes of the bottom ﬁfth of families actually fell slightly. In
              other words, the beneﬁts of economic growth over nearly two decades have
              not trickled down to ordinary families. Median family income has risen only
              about 0.5% per year. Even worse, “just about all of that increase was due to
381 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              wives working longer hours, with little or no gain in real wages.” [Paul
              Krugman, “For Richer”, Op. Cit.]
                So if America does have higher average or per capita income than other
              advanced countries, it is simply because the rich are richer. This means that a
              high average income level can be misleading if a large amount of national
              income is concentrated in relatively few hands. This means that large
              numbers of Americans are worse oﬀ economically than their counterparts in
              other advanced countries. Thus Europeans have, in general, shorter working
              weeks and longer holidays than Americans. They may have a lower average
              income than the United States but they do not have the same inequalities.
              This means that the median European family has a standard of living roughly
              comparable with that of the median U.S. family — wages may even be higher.
                As Doug Henwood notes, ”[i]nternational measures put the United States in
              a disgraceful light… The soundbite version of the LIS [Luxembourg Income
              Study] data is this: for a country th[at] rich, [it] ha[s] a lot of poor people.”
              Henwood looked at both relative and absolute measures of income and
              poverty using the cross-border comparisons of income distribution provided
              by the LIS and discovered that ”[f]or a country that thinks itself universally
              middle class [i.e. middle income], the United States has the second-smallest
              middle class of the nineteen countries for which good LIS data exists.” Only
              Russia, a country in near-total collapse was worse (40.9% of the population
              were middle income compared to 46.2% in the USA. Households were classed
              as poor if their incomes were under 50 percent of the national medium; nearpoor, between 50 and 62.5 percent; middle, between 62.5 and 150 percent;
              and well-to-do, over 150 percent. The USA rates for poor (19.1%), near-poor
              (8.1%) and middle (46.2%) were worse than European countries like Germany
              (11.1%, 6.5% and 64%), France (13%, 7.2% and 60.4%) and Belgium (5.5%,
              8.0% and 72.4%) as well as Canada (11.6%, 8.2% and 60%) and Australia
              (14.8%, 10% and 52.5%).
                The reasons for this? Henwood states that the “reasons are clear — weak
              unions and a weak welfare state. The social-democratic states — the ones that
              interfere most with market incomes — have the largest [middles classes]. The
              US poverty rate is nearly twice the average of the other eighteen.” Needless
              to say, “middle class” as deﬁned by income is a very blunt term (as Henwood
              states). It says nothing about property ownership or social power, for
              example, but income is often taken in the capitalist press as the deﬁning
              aspect of “class” and so is useful to analyse in order to refute the claims that
              the free-market promotes general well-being (i.e. a larger “middle class”).
              That the most free-market nation has the worse poverty rates and the
              smallest “middle class” indicates well the anarchist claim that capitalism, left
              to its own devices, will beneﬁt the strong (the ruling class) over the weak (the
              working class) via “free exchanges” on the “free” market (as we argue in
              section C.7, only during periods of full employment — and/or wide scale
              working class solidarity and militancy — does the balance of forces change in
              favour of working class people. Little wonder, then, that periods of full
              employment also see falling inequality — see James K. Galbraith’s Created
              Unequal for more details on the correlation of unemployment and inequality).
                Of course, it could be objected that this relative measure of poverty and
              income ignores the fact that US incomes are among the highest in the world,
382 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              meaning that the US poor may be pretty well oﬀ by foreign standards.
              Henwood refutes this claim, noting that “even on absolute measures, the US
              performance is embarrassing. LIS researcher Lane Kenworthy estimated
              poverty rates for ﬁfteen countries using the US poverty line as the
              benchmark… Though the United States has the highest average income, it’s
              far from having the lowest poverty rate.” Only Italy, Britain and Australia had
              higher levels of absolute poverty (and Australia exceeded the US value by
              0.2%, 11.9% compared to 11.7%). Thus, in both absolute and relative terms,
              the USA compares badly with European countries. [Doug Henwood,
              “Booming, Borrowing, and Consuming: The US Economy in 1999”, pp.120–33,
              Monthly Review, vol. 51, no. 3, pp. 129–31]
                In summary, therefore, taking the USA as being the most capitalist nation in
              the developed world, we discover a class system in which a very small
              minority own the bulk of the means of life and get most of the income.
              Compared to other Western countries, the class inequalities are greater and
              the society is more polarised. Moreover, over the last 20–30 years those
              inequalities have increased spectacularly. The ruling elite have become richer
              and wealth has ﬂooded upwards rather than trickled down.
                The cause of the increase in wealth and income polarisation is not hard to
              ﬁnd. It is due to the increased economic and political power of the capitalist
              class and the weakened position of working class people. As anarchists have
              long argued, any “free contract” between the powerful and the powerless will
              beneﬁt the former far more than the latter. This means that if the working
              class’s economic and social power is weakened then we will be in a bad
              position to retain a given share of the wealth we produce but is owned by our
              bosses and accumulates in the hands of the few.
                Unsurprisingly, therefore, there has been an increase in the share of total
              income going to capital (i.e., interest, dividends, and rent) and a decrease in
              the amount going to labour (wages, salaries, and beneﬁts). Moreover, an
              increasing part of the share to labour is accruing to high-level management
              (in electronics, for example, top executives used to paid themselves 42 times
              the average worker in 1991, a mere 5 years later it was 220 times as much).
                Since the start of the 1980s, unemployment and globalisation has weakened
              the economic and social power of the working class. Due to the decline in the
              unions and general labour militancy, wages at the bottom have stagnated (real
              pay for most US workers is lower in 2005 than it was in 1973!). This,
              combined with “trickle-down” economic policies of tax cuts for the wealthy,
              tax raises for the working classes, the maintaining of a “natural” law of
              unemployment (which weakens unions and workers power) and cutbacks in
              social programs, has seriously eroded living standards for all but the upper
              strata — a process that is clearly leading toward social breakdown, with
              eﬀects that will be discussed later (see section D.9).
                Little wonder Proudhon argued that the law of supply and demand was a
              “deceitful law … suitable only for assuring the victory of the strong over the
              weak, of those who own property over those who own nothing.” [quoted by
              Alan Ritter, The Political Thought of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, p. 121]
              B.7.2 Does social mobility make up for class
383 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              inequality?
                Faced with the massive diﬀerences between classes under capitalism we
              highlighted in the last section, many supporters of capitalism still deny the
              obvious. They do so by confusing a caste system with a class system. In a
              caste system, those born into it stay in it all their lives. In a class system, the
              membership of classes can and does change over time.
                Therefore, it is claimed, what is important is not the existence of classes but
              of social mobility (usually reﬂected in income mobility). According to this
              argument, if there is a high level of social/income mobility then the degree of
              inequality in any given year is unimportant. This is because the redistribution
              of income over a person’s life time would be very even. Thus the inequalities
              of income and wealth of capitalism does not matter as capitalism has high
              social mobility.
                Milton Friedman puts the argument in this way:
                   “Consider two societies that have the same distribution of annual
                   income. In one there is a great mobility and change so that the
                   position of particular families in the income hierarchy varies widely
                   from year to year. In the other, there is great rigidity so that each
                   family stays in the same position. Clearly, in any meaningful sense,
                   the second would be the more unequal society. The one kind of
                   inequality is a sign of dynamic change, social mobility, equality of
                   opportunity; the other of a status society. The confusion behind
                   these two kinds of inequality is particularly important, precisely
                   because competitive free-enterprise capitalism tends to substitute
                   the one for the other.” [Capitalism and Freedom, p. 171]
                 As with so many things, Friedman is wrong in his assertion (and that is all it
              is, no evidence is provided). The more free market capitalist regimes have
              less social mobility than those, like Western Europe, which have extensive
              social intervention in the economy. As an added irony, the facts suggest that
              implementing Friedman’s suggested policies in favour of his beloved
              “competitive free-enterprise capitalism” has made social mobility less, not
              greater. In eﬀect, as with so many things, Friedman ensured the refutation of
              his own dogmas.
                 Taking the USA as an example (usually considered one of the most capitalist
              countries in the world) there is income mobility, but not enough to make
              income inequality irrelevant. Census data show that 81.6 percent of those
              families who were in the bottom quintile of the income distribution in 1985
              were still there in the next year; for the top quintile, it was 76.3 percent.
                 Over longer time periods, there is more mixing but still not that much and
              those who do slip into diﬀerent quintiles are typically at the borders of their
              category (e.g. those dropping out of the top quintile are typically at the
              bottom of that group). Only around 5% of families rise from bottom to top, or
              fall from top to bottom. In other words, the class structure of a modern
              capitalist society is pretty solid and “much of the movement up and down
              represents ﬂuctuations around a fairly ﬁxed long term distribution.” [Paul
              Krugman, Peddling Prosperity, p. 143]
384 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                Perhaps under a “pure” capitalist system things would be diﬀerent? Ronald
              Reagan helped make capitalism more “free market” in the 1980s, but there is
              no indication that income mobility increased signiﬁcantly during that time. In
              fact, according to one study by Greg Duncan of the University of Michigan,
              the middle class shrank during the 1980s, with fewer poor families moving up
              or rich families moving down. Duncan compared two periods. During the ﬁrst
              period (1975 to 1980) incomes were more equal than they are today. In the
              second (1981 to 1985) income inequality began soaring. In this period there
              was a reduction in income mobility upward from low to medium incomes of
              over 10%.
                Here are the exact ﬁgures [cited by Paul Krugman, “The Rich, the Right,
              and the Facts,” The American Prospect no. 11, Fall 1992, pp. 19–31]:
                Percentages of families making transitions to and from middle class
              (5-year period before and after 1980)

## Transition Before 1980 After 1980
## Middle income to low income 8.5 9.8
## Middle income to high income 5.8 6.8
## Low income to middle income 35.1 24.6
## High income to middle income 30.8 27.6

                Writing in 2004, Krugman returned to this subject. The intervening twelve
              years had made things worse. America, he notes, is “more of a caste society
              than we like to think. And the caste lines have lately become a lot more rigid.”
              Before the rise of neo-liberalism in the 1980s, America had more
              intergenerational mobility. “A classic 1978 survey found that among adult men
              whose fathers were in the bottom 25 percent of the population as ranked by
              social and economic status, 23 percent had made it into the top 25 percent. In
              other words, during the ﬁrst thirty years or so after World War II, the
              American dream of upward mobility was a real experience for many people.”
              However, a new survey of today’s adult men “ﬁnds that this number has
              dropped to only 10 percent. That is, over the past generation upward mobility
              has fallen drastically. Very few children of the lower class are making their
              way to even moderate aﬄuence. This goes along with other studies indicating
              that rags-to-riches stories have become vanishingly rare, and that the
              correlation between fathers’ and sons’ incomes has risen in recent decades. In
              modern America, it seems, you’re quite likely to stay in the social and
              economic class into which you were born.” [Paul Krugman, “The Death of
              Horatio Alger”, The Nation, January 5, 2004]
                British Keynesian economist Will Hutton quotes US data from 2000–1 which
              “compare[s] the mobility of workers in America with the four biggest
              European economies and three Nordic economies.” The US “has the lowest
              share of workers moving from the bottom ﬁfth of workers into the second
              ﬁfth, the lowest share moving into the top 60 per cent and the highest share
              unable to sustain full-time employment.” He cites an OECD study which
              “conﬁrms the poor rates of relative upward mobility for very low-paid
              American workers; it also found that full-time workers in Britain, Italy and
385 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              Germany enjoy much more rapid growth in their earnings than those in the
              US … However, downward mobility was more marked in the US; American
              workers are more likely to suﬀer a reduction in their real earnings than
              workers in Europe.” Thus even the OECD (the “high priest of deregulation”)
              was “forced to conclude that countries with more deregulated labour and
              product markets (pre-eminently the US) do not appear to have higher relative
              mobility, nor do low-paid workers in these economies experience more
              upward mobility. The OECD is pulling its punches. The US experience is
              worse than Europe’s.” Numerous studies have shown that “either there is no
              diﬀerence” in income mobility between the USA and Europe “or that there is
              less mobility in the US.” [The World We’re In, pp. 166–7]
                Little wonder, then, that Doug Henwood argues that “the ﬁnal appeal of
              apologists of the American way is an appeal to our legendary mobility” fails.
              In fact, “people generally don’t move far from the income class they are born
              into, and there is little diﬀerence between US and European mobility
              patterns. In fact, the United States has the largest share of what the OECD
              called ‘low-wage’ workers, and the poorest performance on the emergence
              from the wage cellar of any country it studied.” [Op. Cit., p. 130]
                Indeed, “both the US and British poor were more likely to stay poor for a
              long period of time: almost half of all people who were poor for one year
              stayed poor for ﬁve or more years, compared with 30% in Canada and 36% in
              Germany. And, despite claims of great upward mobility in the US, 45% of the
              poor rose out of poverty in a given year, compared with 45% in the UK, 53%
              in Germany, and 56% in Canada. And of those who did exit poverty, 15% of
              Americans were likely to make a round trip back under the poverty line,
              compared with 16% in Germany, 10% in the UK, and 7% in Canada.” [Doug
              Henwood, After the New Economy, pp. 136–7]
                A 2005 study of income mobility by researchers at the London School of
              Economics (on behalf of the educational charity the Sutton Trust) conﬁrms
              that the more free market a country, the worse is its levels of social mobility.
              [Jo Blanden, Paul Gregg and Stephen Machin, Intergenerational Mobility
              in Europe and North America, April, 2005] They found that Britain has one
              of the worst records for social mobility in the developed world, beaten only by
              the USA out of eight European and North American countries. Norway was
              the best followed by Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany and Canada.
                This means that children born to poor families in Britain and the USA are
              less likely to fulﬁl their full potential than in other countries and are less likely
              to break free of their backgrounds than in the past. In other words, we ﬁnd it
              harder to earn more money and get better jobs than our parents. Moreover,
              not only is social mobility in Britain much lower than in other advanced
              countries, it is actually declining and has fallen markedly over time. The
              ﬁndings were based on studies of two groups of children, one set born in the
              1950s and the other in the 1970s. In the UK, while 17 per cent of the former
              made it from the bottom quarter income group to the top, only 11 per cent of
              the latter did so. Mobility in the Nordic countries was twice that of the UK.
              While only the US did worse than the UK in social mobility
                The puzzle of why, given that there is no evidence of American
              exceptionalism or higher social mobility, the myth persists has an easy
              solution. It has utility for the ruling class in maintaining the system. By

              promoting the myth that people can ﬁnd the path to the top easy then the
              institutions of power will not be questioned, just the moral character of the
              many who do not.
                Needless to say, income mobility does not tell the whole story. Increases in
              income do not automatically reﬂect changes in class, far from it. A better paid
              worker is still working class and, consequently, still subject to oppression and
              exploitation during working hours. As such, income mobility, while important,
              does not address inequalities in power. Similarly, income mobility does not
              make up for a class system and its resulting authoritarian social relationships
              and inequalities in terms of liberty, health and social inﬂuence. And the facts
              suggest that the capitalist dogma of “meritocracy” that attempts to justify this
              system has little basis in reality. Capitalism is a class ridden system and while
              there is some changes in the make-up of each class they are remarkably ﬁxed,
              particularly once you get to the top 5–10% of the population (i.e. the ruling
              class).
                Logically, this is not surprising. There is no reason to think that more
              unequal societies should be more mobile. The greater the inequality, the more
              economic power those at the top will have and, consequently, the harder it
              will be those at the bottom to climb upwards. To suggest otherwise is to argue
              that it is easier to climb a mountain than a hill! Unsurprisingly the facts
              support the common sense analysis that the higher the inequality of incomes
              and wealth, the lower the equality of opportunity and, consequently, the lower
              the social mobility.
                Finally, we should point out even if income mobility was higher it does not
              cancel out the fact that a class system is marked by diﬀerences in power
              which accompany the diﬀerences in income. In other words, because it is
              possible (in theory) for everyone to become a boss this does not make the
              power and authority that bosses have over their workers (or the impact of
              their wealth on society) any more legitimate (just because everyone — in
              theory — can become a member of the government does not make
              government any less authoritarian). Because the membership of the boss
              class can change does not negate the fact that such a class exists.
                Ultimately, using (usually highly inﬂated) notions of social mobility to
              defend a class system is unconvincing. After all, in most slave societies slaves
              could buy their freedom and free people could sell themselves into slavery (to
              pay oﬀ debts). If someone tried to defend slavery with the reference to this
              fact of social mobility they would be dismissed as mad. The evil of slavery is
              not mitigated by the fact that a few slaves could stop being slaves if they
              worked hard enough.
              B.7.3 Why is the existence of classes denied?
                It is clear, then, that classes do exist, and equally clear that individuals can
              rise and fall within the class structure — though, of course, it’s easier to
              become rich if you’re born in a rich family than a poor one. Thus James W.
              Loewen reports that “ninety-ﬁve percent of the executives and ﬁnanciers in
              America around the turn of the century came from upper-class or uppermiddle-class backgrounds. Fewer than 3 percent started as poor immigrants
387 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              or farm children. Throughout the nineteenth century, just 2 percent of
              American industrialists came from working-class origins” [in “Lies My
              Teacher Told Me” citing William Miller, “American Historians and the Business
              Elite,” in Men in Business, pp. 326–28; cf. David Montgomery, Beyond
              Equality, pg. 15] And this was at the height of USA “free market” capitalism.
              According to a survey done by C. Wright Mills and reported in his book The
              Power Elite, about 65% of the highest-earning CEOs in American
              corporations come from wealthy families. Meritocracy, after all, does not
              imply a “classless” society, only that some mobility exists between classes. Yet
              we continually hear that class is an outmoded concept; that classes don’t exist
              any more, just atomised individuals who all enjoy “equal opportunity,”
              “equality before the law,” and so forth. So what’s going on?
                 The fact that the capitalist media are the biggest promoters of the “end-ofclass” idea should make us wonder exactly why they do it. Whose interest is
              being served by denying the existence of classes? Clearly it is those who run
              the class system, who gain the most from it, who want everyone to think we
              are all “equal.” Those who control the major media don’t want the idea of
              class to spread because they themselves are members of the ruling class, with
              all the privileges that implies. Hence they use the media as propaganda
              organs to mould public opinion and distract the middle and working classes
              from the crucial issue, i.e., their own subordinate status. This is why the
              mainstream news sources give us nothing but superﬁcial analyses, biased and
              selective reporting, outright lies, and an endless barrage of yellow journalism,
              titillation, and “entertainment,” rather than talking about the class nature of
              capitalist society (see section D.3 — “How does wealth inﬂuence the mass
              media?”)
                 The universities, think tanks, and private research foundations are also
              important propaganda tools of the ruling class. This is why it is virtually taboo
              in mainstream academic circles to suggest that anything like a ruling class
              even exists in the United States. Students are instead indoctrinated with the
              myth of a “pluralist” and “democratic” society — a Never-Never Land where
              all laws and public policies supposedly get determined only by the amount of
              “public support” they have — certainly not by any small faction wielding
              power in disproportion to its size.
                 To deny the existence of class is a powerful tool in the hands of the
              powerful. As Alexander Berkman points out, ”[o]ur social institutions are
              founded on certain ideas; so long as the latter are generally believed, the
              institutions built on them are safe. Government remains strong because
              people think political authority and legal compulsion necessary. Capitalism
              will continue as long as such an economic system is considered adequate and
              just. The weakening of the ideas which support the evil and oppressive
              present day conditions means the ultimate breakdown of government and
              capitalism.” [“Author’s Foreword,” What is Anarchism?, p. xii]
                 Unsurprisingly, to deny the existence of classes is an important means of
              bolstering capitalism, to undercut social criticism of inequality and
              oppression. It presents a picture of a system in which only individuals exist,
              ignoring the diﬀerences between one set of people (the ruling class) and the
              others (the working class) in terms of social position, power and interests.
              This obviously helps those in power maintain it by focusing analysis away
388 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              from that power and its sources (wealth, hierarchy, etc.).
                It also helps maintain the class system by undermining collective struggle.
              To admit class exists means to admit that working people share common
              interests due to their common position in the social hierarchy. And common
              interests can lead to common action to change that position. Isolated
              consumers, however, are in no position to act for themselves. One individual
              standing alone is easily defeated, whereas a union of individuals supporting
              each other is not. Throughout the history of capitalism there have been
              attempts by the ruling class — often successful — to destroy working class
              organisations. Why? Because in union there is power — power which can
              destroy the class system as well as the state and create a new world.
                That’s why the very existence of class is denied by the elite. It’s part of their
              strategy for winning the battle of ideas and ensuring that people remain as
              atomised individuals. By “manufacturing consent” (to use Walter Lipman’s
              expression for the function of the media), force need not be used. By limiting
              the public’s sources of information to propaganda organs controlled by state
              and corporate elites, all debate can be conﬁned within a narrow conceptual
              framework of capitalist terminology and assumptions, and anything premised
              on a diﬀerent conceptual framework can be marginalised. Thus the average
              person is brought to accept current society as “fair” and “just,” or at least as
              “the best available,” because no alternatives are ever allowed to be discussed.
              B.7.4 What do anarchists mean by “class
              consciousness”?
                Given that the existence of classes is often ignored or considered
              unimportant (“boss and worker have common interests”) in mainstream
              culture, its important to continually point out the facts of the situation: that a
              wealthy elite run the world and the vast majority are subjected to hierarchy
              and work to enrich this elite. To be class conscious means that we are aware
              of the objective facts and act appropriately to change them.
                This is why anarchists stress the need for “class consciousness,” for
              recognising that classes exist and that their interests are in conﬂict. The
              reason why this is the case is obvious enough. As Alexander Berkman argues,
              “the interests of capital and labour are not the same. No greater lie was ever
              invented than the so-called ‘identity of interests’ [between capital and labour]
              … labour produces all the wealth of the world … [and] capital is owned by the
              masters is stolen property, stolen products of labour. Capitalist industry is the
              process of continuing to appropriate the products of labour for the beneﬁt of
              the master class … It is clear that your interests as a worker are diﬀerent
              from the interests of your capitalistic masters. More than diﬀerent: they are
              entirely opposite; in fact, contrary, antagonistic to each other. The better
              wages the boss pays you, the less proﬁt he makes out of you. It does not
              require great philosophy to understand that.” [What is Anarchism?, pp. 75–
              6]
                That classes are in conﬂict can be seen from the post-war period in most
              developed countries. Taking the example of the USA, the immediate post-war
              period (the 1950s to the 1970s) were marked by social conﬂict, strikes and so
389 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              forth. From the 1980s onwards, there was a period of relative social peace
              because the bosses managed to inﬂict a series of defeats on the working class.
              Workers became less militant, the trade unions went into a period of decline
              and the success of capitalism proclaimed. If the interests of both classes were
              the same we would expect that all sections of society would have beneﬁted
              more in the 1980s onwards than between the 1950s to 1970s. This is not the
              case. While income grew steadily across the board between 1950 and 1980s,
              since then wealth has ﬂooded up to the top while those at the bottom found it
              harder to make ends meet.
                A similar process occurred in the 1920s when Alexander Berkman stated
              the obvious:

## “The masters have found a very eﬀective way to paralyse the
                   strength of organised labour. They have persuaded the workers that
                   they have the same interests as the employers … that what is good
                   for the employer is good for his employees … [that] the workers will
                   not think of ﬁghting their masters for better conditions, but they will
                   be patient and wait till the employer can ‘share his prosperity’ with
                   them. They will also consider the interests of ‘their’ country and
                   they will not ‘disturb industry’ and the ‘orderly life of the
                   community’ by strikes and stoppage of work. If you listen to your
                   exploiters and their mouthpieces you will be ‘good’ and consider
                   only the interests of your masters, of your city and country — but no
                   one cares about your interests and those of your family, the
                   interests of your union and of your fellow workers of the labouring
                   class. ‘Don’t be selﬁsh,’ they admonish you, while the boss is getting
                   rich by your being good and unselﬁsh. And they laugh in their
                   sleeves and thank the Lord that you are such an idiot.” [Op. Cit.,
                   pp. 74–5]
                So, in a nutshell, class consciousness is to look after your own interest as a
              member of the working class. To be aware that there is inequality in society
              and that you cannot expect the wealthy and powerful to be concerned about
              anyone’s interest except their own. That only by struggle can you gain respect
              and an increased slice of the wealth you produce but do not own. And that
              there is “an irreconcilable antagonism” between the ruling class and working
              class “which results inevitably from their respective stations in life.” The
              riches of the former are “based on the exploitation and subjugation of the
              latter’s labour” which means “war between” the two “is unavoidable.” For the
              working class desires “only equality” while the ruling elite “exist[s] only
              through inequality.” For the latter, “as a separate class, equality is death”
              while for the former “the least inequality is slavery.” [Bakunin, The Basic
              Bakunin, p. 97 and pp. 91–2]
                Although class analysis may at ﬁrst appear to be a novel idea, the
              conﬂicting interests of the classes is well recognised on the other side of the
              class divide. For example, James Madison in the Federalist Paper #10 states
              that “those who hold and those who are without have ever formed distinct
              interests in society.” For anarchists, class consciousness means to recognise
              what the bosses already know: the importance of solidarity with others in the
              same class position as oneself and of acting together as equals to attain
390 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              common goals. The diﬀerence is that the ruling class wants to keep the class
              system going while anarchists seek to end it once and for all.
                 It could therefore be argued that anarchists actually want an “anti-class”
              consciousness to develop — that is, for people to recognise that classes exist,
              to understand why they exist, and act to abolish the root causes for their
              continued existence (“class consciousness,” argues Vernon Richards, “but not
              in the sense of wanting to perpetuate classes, but the consciousness of their
              existence, an understanding of why they exist, and a determination, informed
              by knowledge and militancy, to abolish them.” [The Impossibilities of
              Social Democracy, p. 133]). In short, anarchists want to eliminate classes,
              not universalise the class of “wage worker” (which would presuppose the
              continued existence of capitalism).
                 More importantly, class consciousness does not involve “worker worship.”
              To the contrary, as Murray Bookchin points out, ”[t]he worker begins to
              become a revolutionary when he undoes his [or her] ‘workerness’, when he
              [or she] comes to detest his class status here and now, when he begins to
              shed… his work ethic, his character-structure derived from industrial
              discipline, his respect for hierarchy, his obedience to leaders, his
              consumerism, his vestiges of puritanism.” [Post-Scarcity Anarchism, p. 119]
              For, in the end, anarchists “cannot build until the working class gets rid of its
              illusions, its acceptance of bosses and faith in leaders.” [Marie-Louise Berneri,
              Neither East Nor West, p. 19]
                 It may be objected that there are only individuals and anarchists are trying
              to throw a lot of people in a box and put a label like “working class” on them.
              In reply, anarchists agree, yes, there are “only” individuals but some of them
              are bosses, most of them are working class. This is an objective division
              within society which the ruling class does its best to hide but which comes out
              during social struggle. And such struggle is part of the process by which more
              and more oppressed people subjectivity recognise the objective facts. And by
              more and more people recognising the facts of capitalist reality, more and
              more people will want to change them.
                 Currently there are working class people who want an anarchist society and
              there are others who just want to climb up the hierarchy to get to a position
              where they can impose their will to others. But that does not change the fact
              that their current position is that they are subjected to the authority of
              hierarchy and so can come into conﬂict with it. And by so doing, they must
              practise self-activity and this struggle can change their minds, what they
              think, and so they become radicalised. This, the radicalising eﬀects of selfactivity and social struggle, is a key factor in why anarchists are involved in it.
              It is an important means of creating more anarchists and getting more and
              more people aware of anarchism as a viable alternative to capitalism.
                 Ultimately, it does not matter what class you are, it’s what you believe in
              that matters. And what you do. Hence we see anarchists like Bakunin and
              Kropotkin, former members of the Russian ruling class, or like Malatesta,
              born into an Italian middle class family, rejecting their backgrounds and its
              privileges and becoming supporters of working class self-liberation. But
              anarchists base their activity primarily on the working class (including
              peasants, self-employed artisans and so on) because the working class is
              subject to hierarchy and so have a real need to resist to exist. This process of
391 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              resisting the powers that be can and does have a radicalising eﬀect on those
              involved and so what they believe in and what they do changes. Being
              subject to hierarchy, oppression and exploitation means that it is in the
              working class people’s “own interest to abolish them. It has been truly said
              that ‘the emancipation of the workers must be accomplished by the workers
              themselves,’ for no social class will do it for them … It is … the interest of
              the proletariat to emancipate itself from bondage … It is only be growing to a
              true realisation of their present position, by visualising their possibilities and
              powers, by learning unity and co-operation, and practising them, that the
              masses can attain freedom.” [Alexander Berkman, Op. Cit., pp. 187–8]
                We recognise, therefore, that only those at the bottom of society have a
              self-interest in freeing themselves from the burden of those at the top, and so
              we see the importance of class consciousness in the struggle of oppressed
              people for self-liberation. Thus, ”[f]ar from believing in the messianic role of
              the working class, the anarchists’ aim is to abolish the working class in so far
              as this term refers to the underprivileged majority in all existing societies…
              What we do say is that no revolution can succeed without the active
              participation of the working, producing, section of the population… The power
              of the State, the values of authoritarian society can only be challenged and
              destroyed by a greater power and new values.” [Vernon Richards, The
              Raven, no. 14, pp. 183–4] Anarchists also argue that one of the eﬀects of
              direct action to resist oppression and exploitation of working class people
              would be the creation of such a power and new values, values based on
              respect for individual freedom and solidarity (see sections J.2 and J.4 on direct
              action and its liberating potential).
                As such, class consciousness also means recognising that working class
              people not only have an interest in ending its oppression but that we also
              have the power to do so. “This power, the people’s power,” notes Berkman, “is
              actual: it cannot be taken away, as the power of the ruler, of the politician, or
              of the capitalist can be. It cannot be taken away because it does not consist of
              possessions but in ability. It is the ability to create, to produce; the power that
              feeds and clothes the world, that gives us life, health and comfort, joy and
              pleasure.” The power of government and capital “disappear when the people
              refuse to acknowledge them as masters, refuse to let them lord it over them.”
              This is “the all-important economic power” of the working class. [Op. Cit.,
              p. 87, p. 86 and p. 88]
                This potential power of the oppressed, anarchist argue, shows that not only
              are classes wasteful and harmful, but that they can be ended once those at
              the bottom seek to do so and reorganise society appropriately. This means
              that we have the power to transform the economic system into a nonexploitative and classless one as “only a productive class may be libertarian in
              nature, because it does not need to exploit.” [Albert Meltzer, Anarchism:
              Arguments For and Against, p. 23]
                Finally, it is important to stress that anarchists think that class
              consciousness must also mean to be aware of all forms of hierarchical power,
              not just economic oppression. As such, class consciousness and class conﬂict
              is not simply about inequalities of wealth or income but rather questioning all
              forms of domination, oppression and exploitation.
                For anarchists, ”[t]he class struggle does not centre around material
392 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              exploitation alone but also around spiritual exploitation, … [as well as]
              psychological and environmental oppression.” [Bookchin, Op. Cit., p. 151]
              This means that we do not consider economic oppression to be the only
              important thing, ignoring struggles and forms of oppression outside the
              workplace. To the contrary, workers are human beings, not the economically
              driven robots of capitalist and Leninist mythology. They are concerned about
              everything that aﬀects them — their parents, their children, their friends,
              their neighbours, their planet and, very often, total strangers.
              Section C — What are the myths of
              capitalist economics?
                 Within capitalism, economics plays an important ideological role. Economics
              has been used to construct a theory from which exploitation and oppression
              are excluded, by deﬁnition. We will attempt here to explain why capitalism is
              deeply exploitative. Elsewhere, in section B, we have indicated why capitalism
              is oppressive and will not repeat ourselves here.
                 In many ways economics plays the role within capitalism that religion
              played in the Middle Ages, namely to provide justiﬁcation for the dominant
              social system and hierarchies. “The priest keeps you docile and subjected,”
              argued Malatesta, “telling you everything is God’s will; the economist say it’s
              the law of nature.” They “end up saying that no one is responsible for poverty,
              so there’s no point rebelling against it.” [Fra Contadini, p. 21] Even worse,
              they usually argue that collective action by working class people is
              counterproductive and, like the priest, urge us to tolerate current oppression
              and exploitation with promises of a better future (in heaven for the priest, for
              the economist it is an unspeciﬁed “long run”). It would be no generalisation to
              state that if you want to ﬁnd someone to rationalise and justify an obvious
              injustice or form of oppression then you should turn to an economist
              (preferably a “free market” one).
                 That is not the only similarity between the “science” of economics and
              religion. Like religion, its basis in science is usually lacking and its theories
              more based upon “leaps of faith” than empirical fact. Indeed, it is hard to ﬁnd
              a “science” more unconcerned about empirical evidence or building realistic
              models than economics. Just looking at the assumptions made in “perfect
              competition” shows that (see section C.1 for details). This means that
              economics is immune to such trivialities as evidence and fact, although that
              does not stop economics being used to rationalise and justify certain of these
              facts (such as exploitation and inequality). A classic example is the various
              ways economists have sought to explain what anarchists and other socialists
              have tended to call “surplus value” (i.e. proﬁts, interest and rent). Rather
              than seek to explain its origin by an empirical study of the society it exists in
              (capitalism), economists have preferred to invent “just-so” stories, little ahistoric parables about a past which never existed is used to illustrate (and so
              defend) a present class system and its inequalities and injustices. The lessons
              of a fairy tale about a society that has never existed are used as a guide for
              one which does and, by some strange co-incidence, they happen to justify the
393 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              existing class system and its distribution of income. Hence the love of
              Robinson Crusoe in economics.
                Ironically, this favouring of theory (ideology would be a better term) is
              selective as their exposure as fundamentally ﬂawed does not stop them being
              repeated. As we discuss in section C.2, the neoclassical theory of capital was
              proven to be incorrect by left-wing economists. This was admitted by their
              opponents: “The question that confronts us is not whether the Cambridge
              Criticism is theoretically valid. It is. Rather the question is an empirical or
              econometric one: is there suﬀicient substitutability within the system to
              establish neo-classical results?” Yet this did not stop this theory being taught
              to this day and the successful critique forgotten. Nor has econometrics
              successfully refuted the analysis, as capital speciﬁed in terms of money
              cannot reﬂect a theoretical substance (neo-classical “capital”) which could not
              exist in reality. However, that is unimportant for ”[u]ntil the econometricians
              have the answer for us, placing reliance upon neo-classical economic theory is
              a matter of faith,” which, of course, he had [C. E. Ferguson, The Neoclassical Theory of Production and Distribution, p. 266 and p. xvii]
                Little wonder that Joan Robinson, one of the left-wing economists who
              helped expose the bankruptcy of the neo-classical theory of capital, stated
              that economics was “back where it was, a branch of theology.” [Collected
              Economic Papers, Vol. 4, p. 127] It remains there more than thirty years
              later:
                   “Economics is not a science. Many economists — particularly those
## who believe that decisions on whether to get married can be
                   reduced to an equation — see the world as a complex organism that
## can be understood using the right diﬀerential calculus. Yet
                   everything we know about economics suggests that it is a branch
                   and not a particularly advanced one, of witchcraft.” [Larry Elliot and
                   Dan Atkinson, The Age of Insecurity, p. 226]
                The weakness of economics is even acknowledged by some within the
              profession itself. According to Paul Ormerod, “orthodox economics is in many
              ways an empty box. Its understanding of the world is similar to that of the
              physical sciences in the Middle Ages. A few insights have been obtained
              which stand the test of time, but they are very few indeed, and the whole
              basis of conventional economics is deeply ﬂawed.” Moreover, he notes the
              “overwhelming empirical evidence against the validity of its theories.” It is
              rare to see an economist be so honest. The majority of economists seem happy
              to go on with their theories, trying to squeeze life into the Procrustean bed of
              their models. And, like the priests of old, make it hard for non-academics to
              question their dogmas as “economics is often intimidating. Its practitioners …
              have erected around the discipline a barrier of jargon and mathematics which
              makes the subject diﬀicult to penetrate for the non-initiated.” [The Death of
              Economics, p. ix, p. 67 and p. ix]
                So in this section of our FAQ, we will try to get to the heart of modern
              capitalism, cutting through the ideological myths that supporters of the
              system have created around it. This will be a diﬀicult task, as the divergence
              of the reality of capitalism and the economics that is used to explain (justify,
              more correctly) it is large. For example, the preferred model used in neo394 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM

              classical economics is that of “perfect competition” which is based on a
              multitude of small ﬁrms producing homogenous products in a market which
              none of them are big enough to inﬂuence (i.e. have no market power). This
              theory was developed in the late 19th century when the real economy was
              marked by the rise of big business, a dominance which continues to this day.
              Nor can it be said that even small ﬁrms produce identical products — product
              diﬀerentiation and brand loyalty are key factors for any business. In other
              words, the model reﬂected (and still reﬂects) the exact opposite of reality.
                 In spite of the theoretical models of economics having little or no relation to
              reality, they are used to both explain and justify the current system. As for the
              former, the truly staggering aspect of economics for those who value the
              scientiﬁc method is the immunity of its doctrines to empirical refutation (and,
              in some cases, theoretical refutation). The latter is the key to not only
              understanding why economics is in such a bad state but also why it stays like
              that. While economists like to portray themselves as objective scientists,
              merely analysing the system, the development of their “science” has always
              been marked with apologetics, with rationalising the injustices of the existing
              system. This can be seen best in attempts by economists to show that Chief
              Executive Oﬀicers (CEOs) of ﬁrms, capitalists and landlords all deserve their
              riches while workers should be grateful for what they get. As such, economics
              has never been value free simply because what it says aﬀects people and
              society. This produces a market for economic ideology in which those
              economists who supply the demand will prosper. Thus we ﬁnd many “ﬁelds of
              economics and economic policy where the responses of important economic
              professionals and the publicity given economic ﬁndings are correlated with
              the increased market demand for speciﬁc conclusions and a particular
              ideology.” [Edward S. Herman, “The Selling of Market Economics,” pp. 173–
              199, New Ways of Knowing, Marcus G. Raskin and Herbert J. Bernstein
              (eds.), p.192]
                 Even if we assume the impossible, namely that economists and their
              ideology can truly be objective in the face of market demand for their
              services, there is a root problem with capitalist economics. This is that it the
              speciﬁc social relations and classes produced by capitalism have become
              embedded into the theory. Thus, as an example, the concepts of the marginal
              productivity of land and capital are assumed to universal in spite the fact that
              neither makes any sense outside an economy where one class of people owns
              the means of life while another sells their labour to them. Thus in an artisan/
              peasant society or one based around co-operatives, there would be no need
              for such concepts for in such societies, the distinction between wages and
              proﬁts has no meaning and, as a result, there is no income to the owners of
              machinery and land and no need to explain it in terms of the “marginal
              productivity” of either. Thus mainstream economics takes the class structure
              of capitalism as a natural, eternal, fact and builds up from there. Anarchists,
              like other socialists, stress the opposite, namely that capitalism is a speciﬁc
              historical phase and, consequently, there are no universal economic laws and
              if you change the system the laws of economics change. Unless you are a
              capitalist economist, of course, when the same laws apply no matter what.
                 In our discussion, it is important to remember that capitalist economics is
              not the same as the capitalist economy. The latter exists quite independently

              of the former (and, ironically, usually ﬂourishes best when the policy makers
              ignore it). Dissident economist Steve Keen provides a telling analogy between
              economics and meteorology. Just as “the climate would exist even if there
              were no intellectual discipline of meteorology, the economy itself would exist
              whether or not the intellectual pursuit of economics existed.” Both share “a
              fundamental raison d’etre,” namely “that of attempting to understand a
              complex system.” However, there are diﬀerences. Like weather forecasters,
              “economists frequently get their forecasts of the economic future wrong. But
              in fact, though weather forecasts are sometimes incorrect, overall
              meteorologists have an enviable record of accurate prediction — whereas the
              economic record is tragically bad.” This means it is impossible to ignore
              economics (“to treat it and its practitioners as we these days treat
              astrologers”) as it is a social discipline and so what we “believe about
              economics therefore has an impact upon human society and the way we relate
              to one another.” Despite “the abysmal predictive record of their discipline,”
              economists “are forever recommending ways in which the institutional
              environment should be altered to make the economy work better.” By that
              they mean make the real economy more like their models, as “the
              hypothetical pure market performs better than the mixed economy in which
              we live.” [Debunking Economics, pp. 6–8] Whether this actually makes the
              world a better place is irrelevant (indeed, economics has been so developed
              as to make such questions irrelevant as what happens on the market is, by
              deﬁnition, for the best).
                Here we expose the apologetics for what they are, expose the ideological
              role of economics as a means to justify, indeed ignore, exploitation and
              oppression. In the process of our discussion we will often expose the
              ideological apologetics that capitalist economics create to defend the status
              quo and the system of oppression and exploitation it produces. We will also
              attempt to show the deep ﬂaws in the internal inconsistencies of mainstream
              economics. In addition, we will show how important reality is when evaluating
              the claims of economics.
                That this needs to be done can be seen by comparing the promise of
              economics with its actual results when applied in reality. Mainstream
              economics argues that it is based on the idea of “utility” in consumption, i.e.
              the subjective pleasure of individuals. Thus production is, it is claimed, aimed
              at meeting the demands of consumers. Yet for a system supposedly based on
              maximising individual happiness (“utility”), capitalism produces a hell of a lot
              of unhappy people. Some radical economists have tried to indicate this and
              have created an all-embracing measure of well-being called the Index of
              Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). Their conclusions, as summarised by
              Elliot and Atkinson, are signiﬁcant:
                   “In the 1950s and 1960s the ISEW rose in tandem with per capita
                   GDP. It was a time not just of rising incomes, but of greater social
                   equity, low crime, full employment and expanding welfare states.
                   But from the mid-1970s onwards the two measures started to move
                   apart. GDP per head continued its inexorable rise, but the ISEW
                   started to decline as a result of lengthening dole queues, social
                   exclusion, the explosion in crime, habitat loss, environmental

                   degradation and the growth of environment- and stress-related
                   illness. By the start of the 1990s, the ISEW was almost back to the
                   levels at which it started in the early 1950s.” [Larry Elliot and Dan
                   Atkinson, Op. Cit., p. 248]
                So while capitalism continues to produce more and more goods and,
              presumably, maximises more and more individual utility, actual real people
              are being “irrational” and not realising they are, in fact, better oﬀ and
              happier. Ironically, when such unhappiness is pointed out most defenders of
              capitalism dismiss people’s expressed woe’s as irrelevant. Apparently some
              subjective evaluations are considered more important than others!
                Given that the mid-1970s marked the start of neo-liberalism, the promotion
              of the market and the reduction of government interference in the economy,
              this is surely signiﬁcant. After all, the “global economy of the early 21st
              century looks a lot more like the economic textbook ideal that did the world of
              the 1950s … All these changes have followed the advance of economists that
              the unfettered market is the best way to allocate resources, and that wellintentioned interventions which oppose market forces will actually do more
              harm than good.” As such, ”[w]ith the market so much more in control of the
              global economy now than ﬁfty years ago, then if economists are right, the
              world should be a manifestly better place: it should be growing faster, with
              more stability, and income should go to those who deserve it.” However,
              ”[u]nfortunately, the world refuses to dance the expected tune. In particularly,
              the ﬁnal ten years of the 20th century were marked, not by tranquil growth,
              but by crises.” [Steve Keen, Op. Cit., p. 2]
                These problems and the general unhappiness with the way society is going
              is related to various factors, most of which are impossible to reﬂect in
              mainstream economic analysis. They ﬂow from the fact that capitalism is a
              system marked by inequalities of wealth and power and so how it develops is
              based on them, not the subjective evaluations of atomised individuals that
              economics starts with. This in itself is enough to suggest that capitalist
              economics is deeply ﬂawed and presents a distinctly ﬂawed picture of
              capitalism and how it actually works.
                Anarchists argue that this is unsurprising as economics, rather than being a
              science is, in fact, little more than an ideology whose main aim is to justify
              and rationalise the existing system. We agree with libertarian Marxist Paul
              Mattick’s summation that economics is “actually no more than a sophisticated
              apology for the social and economic status quo” and hence the “growing
              discrepancy between [its] theories and reality.” [Economics, Politics and
              the Age of Inﬂation, p. vii] Anarchists, unsurprisingly, see capitalism as a
              fundamentally exploitative system rooted in inequalities of power and wealth
              dominated by hierarchical structures (capitalist ﬁrms). In the sections that
              follow, the exploitative nature of capitalism is explained in greater detail. We
              would like to point out that for anarchists, exploitation is not more important
              than domination. Anarchists are opposed to both equally and consider them to
              be two sides of the same coin. You cannot have domination without
              exploitation nor exploitation without domination. As Emma Goldman pointed
              out, under capitalism:
                   “wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the
397 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade … Nor is this the only
                   crime … Still more fatal is the crime of turning the producer into a
                   mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his
                   master of steel and iron. Man is being robbed not merely of the
                   products of his labour, but of the power of free initiative, of
                   originality, and the interest in, or desire for, the things he is
                   making.” [Red Emma Speaks, pp. 66–7]
                Needless to say, it would be impossible to discuss or refute every issue
              covered in a standard economics book or every school of economics. As
              economist Nicholas Kaldor notes, ”[e]ach year new fashions sweep the
              ‘politico-economic complex’ only to disappear again with equal suddenness …
              These sudden bursts of fashion are a sure sign of the ‘pre-scientiﬁc’ stage
              [economics is in], where any crazy idea can get a hearing simply because
              nothing is known with suﬀicient conﬁdence to rule it out.” [The Essential
              Kaldor, p. 377] We will have to concentrate on key issues like the ﬂaws in
              mainstream economics, why capitalism is exploitative, the existence and role
              of economic power, the business cycle, unemployment and inequality.
                Nor do we wish to suggest that all forms of economics are useless or equally
              bad. Our critique of capitalist economics does not suggest that no economist
              has contributed worthwhile and important work to social knowledge or our
              understanding of the economy. Far from it. As Bakunin put it, property “is a
              god” and has “its metaphysics. It is the science of the bourgeois economists.
              Like any metaphysics it is a sort of twilight, a compromise between truth and
              falsehood, with the latter beneﬁting from it. It seeks to give falsehood the
              appearance of truth and leads truth to falsehood.” [The Political Philosophy
              of Bakunin, p. 179] How far this is true varies form school to school,
              economist to economist. Some have a better understanding of certain aspects
              of capitalism than others. Some are more prone to apologetics than others.
              Some are aware of the problems of modern economics and “some of the most
              committed economists have concluded that, if economics is to become less of
              a religion and more of a science, then the foundations of economics should be
              torn down and replaced” (although, “left to [their] own devices”, economists
              “would continue to build an apparently grand ediﬁce upon rotten
              foundations.”). [Keen, Op. Cit., p. 19]
                As a rule of thumb, the more free market a particular economist or school of
              economics is, the more likely they will be prone to apologetics and unrealistic
              assumptions and models. Nor are we suggesting that if someone has made a
              positive contribution in one or more areas of economic analysis that their
              opinions on other subjects are correct or compatible with anarchist ideas. It is
              possible to present a correct analysis of capitalism or capitalist economics
              while, at the same time, being blind to the problems of Keynesian economics
              or the horrors of Stalinism. As such, our quoting of certain critical economists
              does not imply agreement with their political opinions or policy suggestions.
                Then there is the issue of what do we mean by the term “capitalist
              economics”? Basically, any form of economic theory which seeks to rationalise
              and defend capitalism. This can go from the extreme of free market capitalist
              economics (such as the so-called “Austrian” school and Monetarists) to those
              who advocate state intervention to keep capitalism going (Keynesian
398 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              economists). We will not be discussing those economists who advocate state
              capitalism. As a default, we will take “capitalist economics” to refer to the
              mainstream “neoclassical” school as this is the dominant form of the ideology
              and many of its key features are accepted by the others. This seems
              applicable, given that the current version of capitalism being promoted is neoliberalism where state intervention is minimised and, when it does happen,
              directed towards beneﬁting the ruling elite.
                 Lastly, one of the constant refrains of economists is the notion that the
              public is ignorant of economics. The implicit assumption behind this
              bemoaning of ignorance by economists is that the world should be run either
              by economists or on their recommendations. In section C.11 we present a
              case study of a nation, Chile, unlucky enough to have that fate subjected upon
              it. Unsurprisingly, this rule by economists could only be imposed as a result of
              a military coup and subsequent dictatorship. As would be expected, given the
              biases of economics, the wealthy did very well, workers less so (to put it
              mildly), in this experiment. Equally unsurprising, the system was proclaimed
              an economic miracle — before it promptly collapsed.
                 So this section of the FAQ is our modest contribution to making economists
              happier by making working class people less ignorant of their subject. As Joan
              Robinson put it:
                   “In short, no economic theory gives us ready-made answers. Any
                   theory that we follow blindly will lead us astray. To make good use
                   of an economic theory, we must ﬁrst sort out the relations of the
                   propagandist and the scientiﬁc elements in it, then by checking with
                   experience, see how far the scientiﬁc element appears convincing,
                   and ﬁnally recombine it with our own political views. The purpose of
                   studying economics is not to acquire a set of ready-made answers to
                   economic questions, but to learn how to avoid being deceived by
                   economists.” [Contributions to Modern Economics, p. 75]
              C.1 What is wrong with economics?
                In a nutshell, a lot. While economists like to portray their discipline as
              “scientiﬁc” and “value free”, the reality is very diﬀerent. It is, in fact, very far
              from a science and hardly “value free.” Instead it is, to a large degree, deeply
              ideological and its conclusions almost always (by a strange co-incidence) what
              the wealthy, landlords, bosses and managers of capital want to hear. The
              words of Kropotkin still ring true today:
                   “Political Economy has always conﬁned itself to stating facts
                   occurring in society, and justifying them in the interest of the
                   dominant class … Having found [something] proﬁtable to capitalists,
                   it has set it up as a principle.” [The Conquest of Bread, p. 181]
                This is at its best, of course. At its worse economics does not even bother
              with the facts and simply makes the most appropriate assumptions necessary
              to justify the particular beliefs of the economists and, usually, the interests of
              the ruling class. This is the key problem with economics: it is not a science. It

              is not independent of the class nature of society, either in the theoretical
              models it builds or in the questions it raises and tries to answer. This is due, in
              part, to the pressures of the market, in part due to the assumptions and
              methodology of the dominant forms of economics. It is a mishmash of ideology
              and genuine science, with the former (unfortunately) being the bulk of it.
                The argument that economics, in the main, is not a science it not one
              restricted to anarchists or other critics of capitalism. Some economists are
              well aware of the limitations of their profession. For example, Steve Keen lists
              many of the ﬂaws of mainstream (neoclassical) economics in his excellent
              book Debunking Economics, noting that (for example) it is based on a
              “dynamically irrelevant and factually incorrect instantaneous static snap-shot”
              of the real capitalist economy. [Debunking Economics, p. 197] The late Joan
              Robinson argued forcefully that the neoclassical economist “sets up a ‘model’
              on arbitrarily constructed assumptions, and then applies ‘results’ from it to
              current aﬀairs, without even trying to pretend that the assumptions conform
              to reality.” [Collected Economic Papers, vol. 4, p. 25] More recently,
              economist Mark Blaug has summarised many of the problems he sees with the
              current state of economics:
                   “Economics has increasing become an intellectual games played for
                   its own sake and not for its practical consequences. Economists
## have gradually converted the subject into a sort of social
## mathematics in which analytical rigor as understood in math
                   departments is everything and empirical relevance (as understood
                   in physics departments) is nothing … general equilibrium theory …
                   using economic terms like ‘prices’, ‘quantities’, ‘factors of
                   production,’ and so on, but that nevertheless is clearly and even
## scandalously unrepresentative of any recognisable economic
## system…

                   “Perfect competition never did exist and never could exist because,
                   even when ﬁrms are small, they do not just take the price but strive
                   to make the price. All the current textbooks say as much, but then
                   immediately go on to say that the ‘cloud-cuckoo’ fantasyland of
                   perfect competition is the benchmark against which we may say
                   something signiﬁcant about real-world competition … But how can
                   an idealised state of perfection be a benchmark when we are never
                   told how to measure the gap between it and real-world competition?
                   It is implied that all real-world competition is ‘approximately’ like
                   perfect competition, but the degree of the approximation is never

                   capital investment, and so on, and so on — all these are not just
                   unrealistic but also unrobust assumptions. And yet they ﬁgure
                   critically in leading economic theories.” [“Disturbing Currents in
                   Modern Economics”, Challenge!, Vol. 41, No. 3, May-June, 1998]
                So neoclassical ideology is based upon special, virtually ad hoc,
              assumptions. Many of the assumptions are impossible, such as the popular
              assertion that individuals can accurately predict the future (as required by
              “rational expectations” and general equilibrium theory), that there are a
              inﬁnite number of small ﬁrms in every market or that time is an unimportant
              concept which can be abstracted from. Even when we ignore those
              assumptions which are obviously nonsense, the remaining ones are hardly
              much better. Here we have a collection of apparently valid positions which, in
              fact, rarely have any basis in reality. As we discuss in section C.1.2, an
              essential one, without which neoclassical economics simply disintegrates, has
              very little basis in the real world (in fact, it was invented simply to ensure the
              theory worked as desired). Similarly, markets often adjust in terms of
              quantities rather than price, a fact overlooked in general equilibrium theory.
              Some of the assumptions are mutually exclusive. For example, the neoclassical theory of the supply curve is based on the assumption that some
              factor of production cannot be changed in the short run. This is essential to
              get the concept of diminishing marginal productivity which, in turn, generates
              a rising marginal cost and so a rising supply curve. This means that ﬁrms
              within an industry cannot change their capital equipment. However, the
              theory of perfect competition requires that in the short period there are no
              barriers to entry, i.e. that anyone outside the industry can create capital
              equipment and move into the market. These two positions are logically
              inconsistent.
                In other words, although the symbols used in mainstream may have
              economic sounding names, the theory has no point of contact with empirical
              reality (or, at times, basic logic):
                   “Nothing in these abstract economic models actually works in the
                   real world. It doesn’t matter how many footnotes they put in, or how
                   many ways they tinker around the edges. The whole enterprise is
                   totally rotten at the core: it has no relation to reality.” [Noam
                   Chomsky, Understanding Power, pp. 254–5]
                As we will indicate, while its theoretical underpinnings are claimed to be
              universal, they are speciﬁc to capitalism and, ironically, they fail to even
              provide an accurate model of that system as it ignores most of the real
              features of an actual capitalist economy. So if an economist does not say that
              mainstream economics has no bearing to reality, you can be sure that what he
              or she tells you will be more likely ideology than anything else. “Economic
              reality” is not about facts; it’s about faith in capitalism. Even worse, it is about
              blind faith in what the economic ideologues say about capitalism. The key to
              understanding economists is that they believe that if it is in an economic
              textbook, then it must be true — particularly if it conﬁrms any initial
              prejudices. The opposite is usually the case.
                The obvious fact that the real world is not like that described by economic

              text books can have some funny results, particularly when events in the real
              world contradict the textbooks. For most economists, or those who consider
              themselves as such, the textbook is usually preferred. As such, much of
              capitalist apologetics is faith-driven. Reality has to be adjusted accordingly.
                 A classic example was the changing positions of pundits and “experts” on
              the East Asian economic miracle. As these economies grew spectacularly
              during the 1970s and 1980s, the experts universally applauded them as
              examples of the power of free markets. In 1995, for example, the right-wing
              Heritage Foundation’s index of economic freedom had four Asian countries in
              its top seven countries. The Economist explained at the start of 1990s that
              Taiwan and South Korea had among the least price-distorting regimes in the
              world. Both the Word Bank and IMF agreed, downplaying the presence of
              industrial policy in the region. This was unsurprising. After all, their ideology
              said that free markets would produce high growth and stability and so,
              logically, the presence of both in East Asia must be driven by the free market.
              This meant that, for the true believers, these nations were paradigms of the
              free market, reality not withstanding. The markets agreed, putting billions
              into Asian equity markets while foreign banks loaned similar vast amounts.
                 In 1997, however, all this changed when all the Asian countries previously
              qualiﬁed as “free” saw their economies collapse. Overnight the same experts
              who had praised these economies as paradigms of the free market found the
              cause of the problem — extensive state intervention. The free market paradise
              had become transformed into a state regulated hell! Why? Because of
              ideology — the free market is stable and produces high growth and,
              consequently, it was impossible for any economy facing crisis to be a free
              market one! Hence the need to disown what was previously praised, without
              (of course) mentioning the very obvious contradiction.
                 In reality, these economies had always been far from the free market. The
              role of the state in these “free market” miracles was extensive and well
              documented. So while East Asia “had not only grown faster and done better at
              reducing poverty than any other region of the world … it had also been more
              stable,” these countries “had been successful not only in spite of the fact that
              they had not followed most of the dictates of the Washington Consensus [i.e.
              neo-liberalism], but because they had not.” The government had played
              “important roles … far from the minimalist [ones] beloved” of neo-liberalism.
              During the 1990s, things had changed as the IMF had urged a “excessively
              rapid ﬁnancial and capital market liberalisation” for these countries as sound
              economic policies. This “was probably the single most important cause of the
              [1997] crisis” which saw these economies suﬀer meltdown, “the greatest
              economic crisis since the Great Depression” (a meltdown worsened by IMF
              aid and its underlying dogmas). Even worse for the believers in market
              fundamentalism, those nations (like Malaysia) that refused IMF suggestions
              and used state intervention has a “shorter and shallower” downturn than
              those who did not. [Joseph Stiglitz, Globalisation and its Discontents, p.
              89, p. 90, p. 91 and p. 93] Even worse, the obvious conclusion from these
              events is more than just the ideological perspective of economists, it is that
              “the market” is not all-knowing as investors (like the experts) failed to see the
              statist policies so bemoaned by the ideologues of capitalism after 1997.
                 This is not to say that the models produced by neoclassical economists are
402 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              not wonders of mathematics or logic. Few people would deny that a lot of very
              intelligent people have spent a lot of time producing some quite impressive
              mathematical models in economics. It is a shame that they are utterly
              irrelevant to reality. Ironically, for a theory claims to be so concerned about
              allocating scarce resources eﬀiciently, economics has used a lot of time and
              energy reﬁning the analyses of economies which have not, do not, and will not
              ever exist. In other words, scare resources have been ineﬀiciently allocated to
              produce waste.
                Why? Perhaps because there is a demand for such nonsense? Some
              economists are extremely keen to apply their methodology in all sorts of areas
              outside the economy. No matter how inappropriate, they seek to colonise
              every aspect of life. One area, however, seems immune to such analysis. This
              is the market for economic theory. If, as economists stress, every human
              activity can be analysed by economics then why not the demand and supply of
              economics itself? Perhaps because if that was done some uncomfortable
              truths would be discovered?
                Basic supply and demand theory would indicate that those economic
              theories which have utility to others would be provided by economists. In a
              system with inequalities of wealth, eﬀective demand is skewed in favour of
              the wealthy. Given these basic assumptions, we would predict that only these
              forms of economists which favour the requirements of the wealthy would gain
              dominance as these meet the (eﬀective) demand. By a strange co-incidence,
              this is precisely what has happened. This did and does not stop economists
              complaining that dissidents and radicals were and are biased. As Edward
              Herman points out:
                   “Back in 1849, the British economist Nassau Senior chided those
## defending trade unions and minimum wage regulations for
                   expounding an ‘economics of the poor.’ The idea that he and his
                   establishment confreres were putting forth an ‘economics of the
                   rich’ never occurred to him; he thought of himself as a scientist and
                   spokesperson of true principles. This self-deception pervaded
                   mainstream economics up to the time of the Keynesian Revolution of
                   the 1930s. Keynesian economics, though quickly tamed into an
                   instrument of service to the capitalist state, was disturbing in its
                   stress on the inherent instability of capitalism, the tendency toward
                   chronic unemployment, and the need for substantial government
                   intervention to maintain viability. With the resurgent capitalism of
                   the past 50 years, Keynesian ideas, and their implicit call for
## intervention, have been under incessant attack, and, in the
                   intellectual counterrevolution led by the Chicago School, the
                   traditional laissez-faire (‘let-the-fur-ﬂy’) economics of the rich has
                   been re-established as the core of mainstream economics.” [The
                   Economics of the Rich ]
                Herman goes on to ask ”[w]hy do the economists serve the rich?” and
              argues that ”[f]or one thing, the leading economists are among the rich, and
              others seek advancement to similar heights. Chicago School economist Gary
              Becker was on to something when he argued that economic motives explain a
              lot of actions frequently attributed to other forces. He of course never applied

              this idea to economics as a profession .. .” There are a great many well paying
              think tanks, research posts, consultancies and so on that create an ”‘eﬀective
              demand’ that should elicit an appropriate supply resource.”
                Elsewhere, Herman notes the “class links of these professionals to the
              business community were strong and the ideological element was realised in
              the neoclassical competitive model … Spin-oﬀ negative eﬀects on the lower
              classes were part of the ‘price of progress.’ It was the elite orientation of
              these questions [asked by economics], premises, and the central paradigm [of
              economic theory] that caused matters like unemployment, mass poverty, and
              work hazards to escape the net of mainstream economist interest until well
              into the twentieth century.” Moreover, “the economics profession in the years
              1880–1930 was by and large strongly conservative, reﬂecting in its core
              paradigm its class links and sympathy with the dominant business community,
              fundamentally anti-union and suspicious of government, and tending to view
              competition as the true and durable state of nature.” [Edward S. Herman,
              “The Selling of Market Economics,” pp. 173–199, New Ways of Knowing,
              Marcus G. Raskin and Herbert J. Bernstein (eds.),p. 179–80 and p. 180]
                Rather than scientiﬁc analysis, economics has always been driven by the
              demands of the wealthy (“How did [economics] get instituted? As a weapon of
              class warfare.” [Chomsky, Op. Cit., p. 252]). This works on numerous levels.
              The most obvious is that most economists take the current class system and
              wealth/income distribution as granted and generate general “laws” of
              economics from a speciﬁc historical society. As we discuss in the next section,
              this inevitably skews the “science” into ideology and apologetics. The analysis
              is also (almost inevitably) based on individualistic assumptions, ignoring or
              downplaying the key issues of groups, organisations, class and the economic
              and social power they generate. Then there are the assumptions used and
              questions raised. As Herman argues, this has hardly been a neutral process:
                   “the theorists explicating these systems, such as Carl Menger, Leon
## Walras, and Alfred Marshall, were knowingly assuming away
                   formulations that raised disturbing questions (income distribution,
## class and market power, instability, and unemployment) and
                   creating theoretical models compatible with their own policy biases
                   of status quo or modest reformism … Given the choice of ‘problem,’
                   ideology and other sources of bias may still enter economic analysis
                   if the answer is predetermined by the structure of the theory or
                   premises, or if the facts are selected or bent to prove the desired
                   answer.” [Op. Cit., p. 176]
                 Needless to say, economics is a “science” with deep ramiﬁcations within
              society. As a result, it comes under pressure from outside inﬂuences and
              vested interests far more than, say, anthropology or physics. This has meant
              that the wealthy have always taken a keen interest that the “science” teaches
              the appropriate lessons. This has resulted in a demand for a “science” which
              reﬂects the interests of the few, not the many. Is it really just a co-incidence
              that the lessons of economics are just what the bosses and the wealthy would
              like to hear? As non-neoclassical economist John Kenneth Galbraith noted in
              1972:
404 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   “Economic instruction in the United States is about a hundred years
                   old. In its ﬁrst half century economists were subject to censorship
                   by outsiders. Businessmen and their political and ideological
## acolytes kept watch on departments of economics and reacted
                   promptly to heresy, the latter being anything that seemed to
                   threaten the sanctity of property, proﬁts, a proper tariﬀ policy and a
                   balanced budget, or that suggested sympathy for unions, public
                   ownership, public regulation or, in any organised way, for the poor.”
                   [The Essential Galbraith, p. 135]
                 It is really surprising that having the wealthy fund (and so control) the
              development of a “science” has produced a body of theory which so beneﬁts
              their interests? Or that they would be keen to educate the masses in the
              lessons of said “science”, lessons which happen to conclude that the best
              thing workers should do is obey the dictates of the bosses, sorry, the market?
              It is really just a co-incidence that the repeated use of economics is to spread
              the message that strikes, unions, resistance and so forth are counterproductive and that the best thing worker can do is simply wait patiently for
              wealth to trickle down?
                 This co-incidence has been a feature of the “science” from the start. The
              French Second Empire in the 1850s and 60s saw “numerous private
              individuals and organisation, municipalities, and the central government
              encouraged and founded institutions to instruct workers in economic
              principles.” The aim was to “impress upon [workers] the salutary lessons of
              economics.” Signiﬁcantly, the “weightiest motive” for so doing “was fear that
              the inﬂuence of socialist ideas upon the working class threatened the social
              order.” The revolution of 1848 “convinced many of the upper classes that the
              must prove to workers that attacks upon the economic order were both
              unjustiﬁed and futile.” Another reason was the recognition of the right to
              strike in 1864 and so workers “had to be warned against abuse of the new
              weapon.” The instruction “was always with the aim of refuting socialist
              doctrines and exposing popular misconceptions. As one economist stated, it
              was not the purpose of a certain course to initiate workers into the
              complexities of economic science, but to deﬁne principles useful for ‘our
              conduct in the social order.’” The interest in such classes was related to the
              level of “worker discontent and agitation.” The impact was less than desired:
              “The future Communard Lefrancais referred mockingly to the economists …
              and the ‘banality’ and ‘platitudes’ of the doctrine they taught. A newspaper
              account of the reception given to the economist Joseph Garnier states that
              Garnier was greeted with shouts of: ‘He is an economist’ … It took courage,
              said the article, to admit that one was an economist before a public meeting.”
              [David I. Kulstein, “Economics Instruction for Workers during the Second
              Empire,” pp. 225–234, French Historical Studies, vol. 1, no. 2, p. 225, p.
              226, p. 227 and p. 233]
                 This process is still at work, with corporations and the wealthy funding
              university departments and posts as well as their own “think tanks” and paid
              PR economists. The control of funds for research and teaching plays it part in
              keeping economics the “economics of the rich.” Analysing the situation in the
              1970s, Herman notes that the “enlarged private demand for the services of
405 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              economists by the business community … met a warm supply response.” He
              stressed that “if the demand in the market is for speciﬁc policy conclusions
              and particular viewpoints that will serve such conclusions, the market will
              accommodate this demand.” Hence “blatantly ideological models … are being
              spewed forth on a large scale, approved and often funded by large vested
              interests” which helps “shift the balance between ideology and science even
              more ﬁrmly toward the former.” [Op. Cit., p. 184, p. 185 and p. 179] The idea
              that “experts” funded and approved by the wealthy would be objective
              scientists is hardly worth considering. Unfortunately, many people fail to
              exercise suﬀicient scepticism about economists and the economics they
              support. As with most experts, there are two obvious questions with which
              any analysis of economics should begin: “Who is funding it?” and “Who
              beneﬁts from it?”
                However, there are other factors as well, namely the hierarchical
              organisation of the university system. The heads of economics departments
              have the power to ensure the continuation of their ideological position due to
              the position as hirer and promoter of staﬀ. As economics “has mixed its
              ideology into the subject so well that the ideologically unconventional usually
              appear to appointment committees to be scientiﬁcally incompetent.”
              [Benjamin Ward, What’s Wrong with Economics?, p. 250] Galbraith termed
              this “a new despotism,” which consisted of “deﬁning scientiﬁc excellence in
              economics not as what is true but as whatever is closest to belief and method
              to the scholarly tendency of the people who already have tenure in the
              subject. This is a pervasive test, not the less oppress for being, in the frequent
              case, both self-righteous and unconscious. It helps ensure, needless to say, the
              perpetuation of the neoclassical orthodoxy.” [Op. Cit., p. 135] This plays a key
              role in keeping economics an ideology rather than a science:
                   “The power inherent in this system of quality control within the
                   economics profession is obviously very great. The discipline’s
                   censors occupy leading posts in economics departments at the
                   major institutions … Any economist with serious hopes of obtaining
                   a tenured position in one of these departments will soon be made
                   aware of the criteria by which he is to be judged … the entire
                   academic program … consists of indoctrination in the ideas and
                   techniques of the science.” [Ward, Op. Cit., pp. 29–30]
                All this has meant that the “science” of economics has hardly changed in its
              basics in over one hundred years. Even notions which have been debunked
              (and have been acknowledged as such) continue to be taught:
                   “The so-called mainline teaching of economic theory has a curious
                   self-sealing capacity. Every breach that is made in it by criticism is
                   somehow ﬁlled up by admitting the point but refusing to draw any
                   consequence from it, so that the old doctrines can be repeated as
## before. Thus the Keynesian revolution was absorbed into the
                   doctrine that, ‘in the long run,’ there is a natural tendency for a
                   market economy to achieve full employment of available labour and
                   full utilisation of equipment; that the rate of accumulation is
                   determined by household saving; and that the rate of interest is
406 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                   identical with the rate of proﬁt on capital. Similarly, Piero Sraﬀa’s
                   demolition of the neoclassical production function in labour and
                   ‘capital’ was admitted to be unanswerable, but it has not been
                   allowed to aﬀect the propagation of the ‘marginal productivity’
## theory of wages and proﬁts.

                   “The most sophisticated practitioners of orthodoxy maintain that the
                   whole structure is an exercise in pure logic which has no application
                   to real life at all. All the same they give their pupils the impression
                   that they are being provided with an instrument which is valuable,
                   indeed necessary, for the analysis of actual problems.” [Joan
                   Robinson, Op. Cit., vol. 5, p. 222]
                The social role of economics explains this process, for “orthodox traditional
              economics … was a plan for explaining to the privileged class that their
              position was morally right and was necessary for the welfare of society. Even
              the poor were better oﬀ under the existing system that they would be under
              any other … the doctrine [argued] that increased wealth of the propertied
              class brings about an automatic increase of income to the poor, so that, if the
              rich were made poorer, the poor would necessarily become poorer too.”
              [Robinson, Op. Cit., vol. 4, p. 242]
                In such a situation, debunked theories would continue to be taught simply
              because what they say has a utility to certain sections of society:
                   “Few issues provide better examples of the negative impact of
## economic theory on society than the distribution of income.
                   Economists are forever opposing ‘market interventions’ which might
                   raise the wages of the poor, while defending astronomical salary
                   levels for top executives on the basis that if the market is willing to
                   pay them so much, they must be worth it. In fact, the inequality
                   which is so much a characteristic of modern society reﬂects power
                   rather than justice. This is one of the many instances where
## unsound economic theory makes economists the champions of
                   policies which, is anything, undermine the economic foundations of
                   modern society.” [Keen, Op. Cit., p. 126]
                 This argument is based on the notion that wages equal the marginal
              productivity of labour. This is supposed to mean that as the output of workers
              increase, their wages rise. However, as we note in section C.1.5, this law of
              economics has been violated for the last thirty-odd years in the US. Has this
              resulted in a change in the theory? Of course not. Not that the theory is
              actually correct. As we discuss in section C.2.5, marginal productivity theory
              has been exposed as nonsense (and acknowledged as ﬂawed by leading neoclassical economists) since the early 1960s. However, its utility in defending
              inequality is such that its continued use does not really come as a surprise.
                 This is not to suggest that mainstream economics is monolithic. Far from it.
              It is riddled with argument and competing policy recommendations. Some
              theories rise to prominence, simply to disappear again (“See, the ‘science’
              happens to be a very ﬂexible one: you can change it to do whatever you feel
              like, it’s that kind of ‘science.’” [Chomsky, Op. Cit., p. 253]). Given our
407 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              analysis that economics is a commodity and subject to demand, this comes as
              no surprise. Given that the capitalist class is always in competition within
              itself and diﬀerent sections have diﬀerent needs at diﬀerent times, we would
              expect a diversity of economics beliefs within the “science” which rise and fall
              depending on the needs and relative strengths of diﬀerent sections of capital.
              While, overall, the “science” will support basic things (such as proﬁts, interest
              and rent are not the result of exploitation) but the actual policy
              recommendations will vary. This is not to say that certain individuals or
              schools will not have their own particular dogmas or that individuals rise
              above such inﬂuences and act as real scientists, of course, just that (in
              general) supply is not independent of demand or class inﬂuence.
                 Nor should we dismiss the role of popular dissent in shaping the “science.”
              The class struggle has resulted in a few changes to economics, if only in terms
              of the apologetics used to justify non-labour income. Popular struggles and
              organisation play their role as the success of, say, union organising to reduce
              the working day obviously refutes the claims made against such movements
              by economists. Similarly, the need for economics to justify reforms can
              become a pressing issue when the alternative (revolution) is a possibility. As
              Chomsky notes, during the 19th century (as today) popular struggle played as
              much of a role as the needs of the ruling class in the development of the
              “science”:
                   ”[Economics] changed for a number of reasons. For one thing, these
                   guys had won, so they didn’t need it so much as an ideological
                   weapon anymore. For another, they recognised that they themselves
                   needed a powerful interventionist state to defend industry form the
                   hardships of competition in the open market — as they had always
                   had in fact. And beyond that, eliminating people’s ‘right to live’ was
                   starting to have some negative side-eﬀects. First of all, it was
                   causing riots all over the place … Then something even worse
                   happened — the population started to organise: you got the
                   beginning of an organised labour movement … then a socialist
                   movement developed. And at that point, the elites … recognised that
                   the game had to be called oﬀ, else they really would be in trouble …
                   it wasn’t until recent years that laissez-faire ideology was revived
                   again — and again, it was a weapon of class warfare … And it
                   doesn’t have any more validity than it had in the early nineteenth
                   century — in fact it has even less. At least in the early nineteenth
                   century … [the] assumptions had some relation to reality. Today
                   those assumptions have not relation to reality.” [Op. Cit., pp. 253–
                   4]
                 Whether the “economics of the rich” or the “economics of the poor” win out
              in academia is driven far more by the state of the class war than by abstract
              debating about unreal models. Thus the rise of monetarism came about due to
              its utility to the dominant sections of the ruling class rather than it winning
              any intellectual battles (it was decisively refuted by leading Keynesians like
              Nicholas Kaldor who saw their predicted fears become true when it was
              applied — see section C.8). Hopefully by analysing the myths of capitalist
              economics we will aid those ﬁghting for a better world by giving them the

              means of counteracting those who claim the mantle of “science” to foster the
              “economics of the rich” onto society.
                To conclude, neo-classical economics shows the viability of an unreal system
              and this is translated into assertions about the world that we live in. Rather
              than analyse reality, economics evades it and asserts that the economy works
              “as if” it matched the unreal assumptions of neoclassical economics. No other
              science would take such an approach seriously. In biology, for example, the
              notion that the world can be analysed “as if” God created it is called
              Creationism and rightly dismissed. In economics, such people are generally
              awarded professorships or even the (so-called) Nobel prize in economics
              (Keen critiques the “as if” methodology of economics in chapter 7 of his
              Debunking Economics ). Moreover, and even worse, policy decisions will be
              enacted based on a model which has no bearing in reality — with disastrous
              results (for example, the rise and fall of Monetarism).
                Its net eﬀect to justify the current class system and diverts serious attention
              from critical questions facing working class people (for example, inequality
              and market power, what goes on in production, how authority relations impact
              on society and in the workplace). Rather than looking to how things are
              produced, the conﬂicts generated in the production process and the
              generation as well as division of products/surplus, economics takes what was
              produced as given, as well as the capitalist workplace, the division of labour
              and authority relations and so on. The individualistic neoclassical analysis by
              deﬁnition ignores such key issues as economic power, the possibility of a
              structural imbalance in the way economic growth is distributed, organisation
              structure, and so on.
                Given its social role, it comes as no surprise that economics is not a genuine
              science. For most economists, the “scientiﬁc method (the inductive method of
              natural sciences) [is] utterly unknown to them.” [Kropotkin, Anarchism, p.
              179] The argument that most economics is not a science is not limited to just
              anarchists or other critics of capitalism. Many dissident economics recognise
              this fact as well, arguing that the profession needs to get its act together if it
              is to be taken seriously. Whether it could retain its position as defender of
              capitalism if this happens is a moot point as many of the theorems developed
              were done so explicitly as part of this role (particularly to defend non-labour
              income — see section C.2). That economics can become much broader and
              more relevant is always a possibility, but to do so would mean to take into
              account an unpleasant reality marked by class, hierarchy and inequality
              rather than logic deductions derived from Robinson Crusoe. While the latter
              can produce mathematical models to reach the conclusions that the market is
              already doing a good job (or, at best, there are some imperfections which can
              be counterbalanced by the state), the former cannot.
                Anarchists, unsurprisingly, take a diﬀerent approach to economics. As
              Kropotkin put it, “we think that to become a science, Political Economy has to
              be built up in a diﬀerent way. It must be treated as a natural science, and use
              the methods used in all exact, empirical sciences.” [Evolution and
              Environment, p. 93] This means that we must start with the world as it is,
              not as economics would like it to be. It must be placed in historical context
              and key facts of capitalism, like wage labour, not taken for granted. It must
              not abstract from such key facts of life as economic and social power. In a
409 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              word, economics must reject those features which turn it into a sophisticated
              defence of the status quo. Given its social role within capitalism (and the
              history and evolution of economic thought), it is doubtful it will ever become a
              real science simply because it if did it would hardly be used to defend that
              system.
              C.1.1 Is economics really value free?
                Modern economists try and portray economics as a “value-free science.” Of
              course, it rarely dawns on them that they are usually just taking existing
              social structures for granted and building economic dogmas around them, so
              justifying them. At best, as Kropotkin pointed out:
                   ”[A]ll the so-called laws and theories of political economy are in
                   reality no more than statements of the following nature: ‘Granting
                   that there are always in a country a considerable number of people
                   who cannot subsist a month, or even a fortnight, without earning a
                   salary and accepting for that purpose the conditions of work
                   imposed upon them by the State, or oﬀered to them by those whom
                   the State recognises as owners of land, factories, railways, etc.,
## then the results will be so and so.’

                   “So far academic political economy has been only an enumeration of
                   what happens under these conditions — without distinctly stating
                   the conditions themselves. And then, having described the facts
                   which arise in our society under these conditions, they represent to
                   us these facts as rigid, inevitable economic laws.” [Anarchism,
                   p. 179]
                In other words, economists usually take the political and economic aspects
              of capitalist society (such as property rights, inequality and so on) as given
              and construct their theories around it. At best. At worse, economics is simply
              speculation based on the necessary assumptions required to prove the desired
              end. By some strange coincidence these ends usually bolster the power and
              proﬁts of the few and show that the free market is the best of all possible
              worlds. Alfred Marshall, one of the founders of neoclassical economics, once
              noted the usefulness of economics to the elite:
                   “From Metaphysics I went to Ethics, and found that the justiﬁcation
                   of the existing conditions of society was not easy. A friend, who had
                   read a great deal of what are called the Moral Sciences, constantly
                   said: ‘Ah! if you understood Political Economy you would not say
                   that’” [quoted by Joan Robinson, Collected Economic Papers, vol.
                   4, p. 129]
                Joan Robinson added that ”[n]owadays, of course, no one would put it so
              crudely. Nowadays, the hidden persuaders are concealed behind scientiﬁc
              objectivity, carefully avoiding value judgements; they are persuading all the
              better so.” [Op. Cit., p. 129] The way which economic theory systematically

              says what bosses and the wealthy want to hear is just one of those strange coincidences of life, one which seems to befall economics with alarming
              regularity.
                 How does economics achieve this strange co-incidence, how does the “value
              free” “science” end up being wedded to producing apologetics for the current
              system? A key reason is the lack of concern about history, about how the
              current distribution of income and wealth was created. Instead, the current
              distribution of wealth and income is taken for granted.
                 This ﬂows, in part, from the static nature of neoclassical economics. If your
              economic analysis starts and ends with a snapshot of time, with a given set of
              commodities, then how those commodities get into a speciﬁc set of hands can
              be considered irrelevant — particularly when you modify your theory to
              exclude the possibility of proving income redistribution will increase overall
              utility (see section C.1.3). It also ﬂows from the social role of economics as
              defender of capitalism. By taking the current distribution of income and
              wealth as given, then many awkward questions can be automatically excluded
              from the “science.”
                 This can be seen from the rise of neoclassical economics in the 1870s and
              1880s. The break between classical political economy and economics was
              marked by a change in the kind of questions being asked. In the former, the
              central focus was on distribution, growth, production and the relations
              between social classes. The exact determination of individual prices was of
              little concern, particularly in the short run. For the new economics, the focus
              became developing a rigorous theory of price determination. This meant
              abstracting from production and looking at the amount of goods available at
              any given moment of time. Thus economics avoided questions about class
              relations by asking questions about individual utility, so narrowing the ﬁeld of
              analysis by asking politically harmless questions based on unrealistic models
              (for all its talk of rigour, the new economics did not provide an answer to how
              real prices were determined any more than classical economics had simply
              because its abstract models had no relation to reality).
                 It did, however, provide a naturalistic justiﬁcation for capitalist social
              relations by arguing that proﬁt, interest and rent are the result of individual
              decisions rather than the product of a speciﬁc social system. In other words,
              economics took the classes of capitalism, internalised them within itself, gave
              them universal application and, by taking for granted the existing distribution
              of wealth, justiﬁed the class structure and diﬀerences in market power this
              produces. It does not ask (or investigate) why some people own all the land
              and capital while the vast majority have to sell their labour on the market to
              survive. As such, it internalises the class structure of capitalism. Taking this
              class structure as a given, economics simply asks the question how much does
              each “factor” (labour, land, capital) contribute to the production of goods.
                 Alfred Marshall justiﬁed this perspective as follows:
                   “In the long run the earnings of each agent (of production) are, as a
                   rule, suﬀicient only to recompense the sum total of the eﬀorts and
                   sacriﬁces required to produce them … with a partial exception in
                   the case of land … especially much land in old countries, if we could
                   trace its record back to their earliest origins. But the attempt would

                   raise controversial questions in history and ethics as well as in
                   economics; and the aims of our present inquiry are prospective
                   rather than retrospective.” [Principles of Economics, p. 832]
                Which is wonderfully handy for those who beneﬁted from the theft of the
              common heritage of humanity. Particularly as Marshall himself notes the dire
              consequences for those without access to the means of life on the market:
                   “When a workman is in fear of hunger, his need of money is very
                   great; and, if at starting he gets the worst of the bargaining, it
                   remains great … That is all the more probably because, while the
                   advantage in bargaining is likely to be pretty well distributed
                   between the two sides of a market for commodities, it is more often
                   on the side of the buyers than on that of the sellers in a market for
                   labour.” [Op. Cit., pp. 335–6]
                 Given that market exchanges will beneﬁt the stronger of the parties
              involved, this means that inequalities become stronger and more secure over
              time. Taking the current distribution of property as a given (and, moreover,
              something that must not be changed) then the market does not correct this
              sort of injustice. In fact, it perpetuates it and, moreover, it has no way of
              compensating the victims as there is no mechanism for ensuring reparations.
              So the impact of previous acts of aggression has an impact on how a speciﬁc
              society developed and the current state of the world. To dismiss
              “retrospective” analysis as it raises “controversial questions” and “ethics” is
              not value-free or objective science, it is pure ideology and skews any
              “prospective” enquiry into apologetics.
                 This can be seen when Marshall noted that labour “is often sold under
              special disadvantages, arising from the closely connected group of facts that
              labour power is ‘perishable,’ that the sellers of it are commonly poor and have
              no reserve fund, and that they cannot easily withhold it from the market.”
              Moreover, the “disadvantage, wherever it exists, is likely to be cumulative in
              its eﬀects.” Yet, for some reason, he still maintains that “wages of every class
              of labour tend to be equal to the net product due to the additional labourer of
              this class.” [Op. Cit., p. 567, p. 569 and p. 518] Why should it, given the
              noted fact that workers are at a disadvantage in the market place? Hence
              Malatesta:
                   “Landlords, capitalists have robbed the people, with violence and
                   dishonesty, of the land and all the means of production, and in
                   consequence of this initial theft can each day take away from
                   workers the product of their labour.” [Errico Malatesta: His Life
                   and Ideas, p. 168]
                As such, how could it possibly be considered “scientiﬁc” or “value-free” to
              ignore history? It is hardly “retrospective” to analyse the roots of the current
              disadvantage working class people have in the current and “prospective”
              labour market, particularly given that Marshall himself notes their results.
              This is a striking example of what Kropotkin deplored in economics, namely
              that in the rare situations when social conditions were “mentioned, they were
412 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              forgotten immediately, to be spoken of no more.” Thus reality is mentioned,
              but any impact this may have on the distribution of income is forgotten for
              otherwise you would have to conclude, with the anarchists, that the
              “appropriation of the produce of human labour by the owners of capital [and
              land] exists only because millions of men [and women] have literally nothing
              to live upon, unless they sell their labour force and their intelligence at a
              price that will make the net proﬁt of the capitalist and ‘surplus value’
              possible.” [Evolution and Environment, p. 92 and p. 106]
                 This is important, for respecting property rights is easy to talk about but it
              only faintly holds some water if the existing property ownership distribution is
              legitimate. If it is illegitimate, if the current property titles were the result of
              theft, corruption, colonial conquest, state intervention, and other forms of
              coercion then things are obviously diﬀerent. That is why economics rarely, if
              ever, discusses this. This does not, of course, stop economists arguing against
              current interventions in the market (particularly those associated with the
              welfare state). In eﬀect, they are arguing that it is okay to reap the beneﬁts of
              past initiations of force but it is wrong to try and rectify them. It is as if
              someone walks into a room of people, robs them at gun point and then asks
              that they should respect each others property rights from now on and only
              engage in voluntary exchanges with what they had left. Any attempt to
              establish a moral case for the “free market” in such circumstances would be
              unlikely to succeed. This is free market capitalist economics in a nutshell:
              never mind past injustices, let us all do the best we can given the current
              allocations of resources.
                 Many economists go one better. Not content in ignoring history, they create
              little ﬁctional stories in order to justify their theories or the current
              distribution of wealth and income. Usually, they start from isolated individual
              or a community of approximately equal individuals (a community usually
              without any communal institutions). For example, the “waiting” theories of
              proﬁt and interest (see section C.2.7) requires such a ﬁction to be remotely
              convincing. It needs to assume a community marked by basic equality of
              wealth and income yet divided into two groups of people, one of which was
              industrious and farsighted who abstained from directly consuming the
              products created by their own labour while the other was lazy and consumed
              their income without thought of the future. Over time, the descendants of the
              diligent came to own the means of life while the descendants of the lazy and
              the prodigal have, to quote Marx, “nothing to sell but themselves.” In that
              way, modern day proﬁts and interest can be justiﬁed by appealing to such
              “insipid childishness.” [Capital, vol. 1, p. 873] The real history of the rise of
              capitalism is, as we discuss in section F.8, grim.
                 Of course, it may be argued that this is just a model and an abstraction and,
              consequently, valid to illustrate a point. Anarchists disagree. Yes, there is
              often the need for abstraction in studying an economy or any other complex
              system, but this is not an abstraction, it is propaganda and a historical
              invention used not to illustrate an abstract point but rather a speciﬁc system
              of power and class. That these little parables and stories have all the
              necessary assumptions and abstractions required to reach the desired
              conclusions is just one of those co-incidences which seem to regularly befall
              economics.
413 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
                The strange thing about these ﬁctional stories is that they are given much
              more credence than real history within economics. Almost always, ﬁctional
              “history” will always top actual history in economics. If the actual history of
              capitalism is mentioned, then the defenders of capitalism will simply say that
              we should not penalise current holders of capital for actions in the dim and
              distant past (that current and future generations of workers are penalised
              goes unmentioned). However, the ﬁctional “history” of capitalism suﬀers from
              no such dismissal, for invented actions in the dim and distant past justify the
              current owners holdings of wealth and the income that generates. In other
              words, heads I win, tails you loose.
                Needless to say, this (selective) myopia is not restricted to just history. It is
              applied to current situations as well. Thus we ﬁnd economists defending
              current economic systems as “free market” regimes in spite of obvious forms
              of state intervention. As Chomsky notes:
                   “when people talk about … free-market ‘trade forces’ inevitably
                   kicking all these people out of work and driving the whole world
                   towards a kind of a Third World-type polarisation of wealth … that’s
                   true if you take a narrow enough perspective on it. But if you look
                   into the factors that made things the way they are, it doesn’t even
                   come close to being true, it’s not remotely in touch with reality. But
                   when you’re studying economics in the ideological institutions,
                   that’s all irrelevant and you’re not supposed to ask questions like
                   these.” [Understanding Power, p. 260]
                 To ignore all that and simply take the current distribution of wealth and
              income as given and then argue that the “free market” produces the best
              allocation of resources is staggering. Particularly as the claim of “eﬀicient
              allocation” does not address the obvious question: “eﬀicient” for whose
              beneﬁt? For the idealisation of freedom in and through the market ignores the
              fact that this freedom is very limited in scope to great numbers of people as
              well as the consequences to the individuals concerned by the distribution of
              purchasing power amongst them that the market throws up (rooted, of course
              in the original endowments). Which, of course, explains why, even if these
              parables of economics were true, anarchists would still oppose capitalism. We
              extend Thomas Jeﬀerson’s comment that the “earth belongs always to the
              living generation” to economic institutions as well as political — the past
              should not dominate the present and the future (Jeﬀerson: “Can one
              generation bind another and all others in succession forever? I think not. The
              Creator has made the earth for the living, not for the dead. Rights and powers
              can only belong to persons, not to things, not to mere matter unendowed with
              will”). For, as Malatesta argued, people should “not have the right … to
              subject people to their rule and even less of bequeathing to the countless
              successions of their descendants the right to dominate and exploit future
              generations.” [At the Cafe, p. 48]
                 Then there is the strange co-incidence that “value free” economics
              generally ends up blaming all the problems of capitalism on workers.
              Unemployment? Recession? Low growth? Wages are too high! Proudhon
              summed up capitalist economic theory well when he stated that “Political
              economy — that is, proprietary despotism — can never be in the wrong: it
414 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              must be the proletariat.” [System of Economical Contradictions, p. 187]
              And little has changed since 1846 (or 1776!) when it comes to economics
              “explaining” capitalism’s problems (such as the business cycle or
              unemployment).
                As such, it is hard to consider economics as “value free” when economists
              regularly attack unions while being silent or supportive of big business.
              According to neo-classical economic theory, both are meant to be equally bad
              for the economy but you would be hard pressed to ﬁnd many economists who
              would urge the breaking up of corporations into a multitude of small ﬁrms as
              their theory demands, the number who will thunder against “monopolistic”
              labour is substantially higher (ironically, as we note in section C.1.4, their own
              theory shows that they must urge the break up of corporations or support
              unions for, otherwise, unorganised labour is exploited). Apparently arguing
              that high wages are always bad but high proﬁts are always good is value free.
                So while big business is generally ignored (in favour of arguments that the
              economy works “as if” it did not exist), unions are rarely given such favours.
              Unlike, say, transnational corporations, unions are considered monopolistic.
              Thus we see the strange situation of economists (or economics inﬂuenced
              ideologies like right-wing “libertarians”) enthusiastically defending companies
              that raise their prices in the wake of, say, a natural disaster and making
              windfall proﬁts while, at the same time, attacking workers who decide to raise
              their wages by striking for being selﬁsh. It is, of course, unlikely that they
              would let similar charges against bosses pass without comment. But what can
              you expect from an ideology which presents unemployment as a good thing
              (namely, increased leisure — see section C.1.5) and being rich as, essentially,
              a disutility (the pain of abstaining from present consumption falls heaviest on
              those with wealth — see section C.2.7).
                Ultimately, only economists would argue, with a straight face, that the
              billionaire owner of a transnational corporation is exploited when the workers
              in his sweatshops successfully form a union (usually in the face of the
              economic and political power wielded by their boss). Yet that is what many
              economists argue: the transnational corporation is not a monopoly but the
              union is and monopolies exploit others! Of course, they rarely state it as
              bluntly as that. Instead they suggest that unions get higher wages for their
              members be forcing other workers to take less pay (i.e. by exploiting them).
              So when bosses break unions they are doing this not to defend their proﬁts
              and power but really to raise the standard of other, less fortunate, workers?
              Hardly. In reality, of course, the reason why unions are so disliked by
              economics is that bosses, in general, hate them. Under capitalism, labour is a
              cost and higher wages means less proﬁts (all things being equal). Hence the
              need to demonise unions, for one of the less understood facts is that while
              unions increase wages for members, they also increase wages for non-union
              workers. This should not be surprising as non-union companies have to raise
              wages stop their workers unionising and to compete for the best workers who
              will be drawn to the better pay and conditions of union shops (as we discuss
              in section C.9, the neoclassical model of the labour market is seriously
              ﬂawed).
                Which brings us to another key problem with the claim that economics is
              “value free,” namely the fact that it takes the current class system of
415 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              capitalism and its distribution of wealth as not only a fact but as an ideal. This
              is because economics is based on the need to be able to diﬀerentiate between
              each factor of production in order to determine if it is being used optimally. In
              other words, the given class structure of capitalism is required to show that
              an economy uses the available resources eﬀiciently or not. It claims to be
              “value free” simply because it embeds the economic relationships of capitalist
              society into its assumptions about nature.
                Yet it is impossible to deﬁne proﬁt, rent and interest independently of the
              class structure of any given society. Therefore, this “type of distribution is the
              peculiarity of capitalism. Under feudalism the surplus was extracted as land
              rent. In an artisan economy each commodity is produced by a men with his
              own tools; the distinction between wages and proﬁts has no meaning there.”
              This means that “the very essence of the theory is bound up with a particular
              institution — wage labour. The central doctrine is that ‘wages tend to equal
              marginal product of labour.’ Obviously this has no meaning for a peasant
              household where all share the work and the income of their holding according
              to the rules of family life; nor does it apply in a [co-operative] where, the
              workers’ council has to decide what part of net proceeds to allot to
              investment, what part to a welfare found and what part to distribute as
              wage.” [Joan Robinson, Collected Economic Papers, p. 26 and p. 130]
                This means that the “universal” principles of economics end up by making
              any economy which does not share the core social relations of capitalism
              inherently “ineﬀicient.” If, for example, workers own all three “factors of
              production” (labour, land and capital) then the “value-free” laws of economics
              concludes that this will be ineﬀicient. As there is only “income”, it is
              impossible to say which part of it is attributable to labour, land or machinery
              and, consequently, if these factors are being eﬀiciently used. This means that
              the “science” of economics is bound up with the current system and its
              speciﬁc class structure and, therefore, as a “ruling class paradigm, the
              competitive model” has the “substantial” merit that “it can be used to rule oﬀ
              the agenda any proposals for substantial reform or intervention detrimental to
              large economic interests … as the model allows (on its assumptions) a formal
              demonstration that these would reduce eﬀiciency.” [Edward S. Herman, “The
              Selling of Market Economics,” pp. 173–199, New Ways of Knowing, Marcus
              G. Raskin and Herbert J. Bernstein (eds.), p. 178]
                Then there are the methodological assumptions based on individualism. By
              concentrating on individual choices, economics abstracts from the social
              system within which such choices are made and what inﬂuences them. Thus,
              for example, the analysis of the causes of poverty is turned towards the
              failings of individuals rather than the system as a whole (to be poor becomes
              a personal stigma). That the reality on the ground bears little resemblance to
              the myth matters little — when people with two jobs still fail to earn enough
              to feed their families, it seems ridiculous to call them lazy or selﬁsh. It
              suggests a failure in the system, not in the poor themselves. An individualistic
              analysis is guaranteed to exclude, by deﬁnition, the impact of class, inequality,
              social hierarchies and economic/social power and any analysis of any inherent
              biases in a given economic system, its distribution of wealth and,
              consequently, its distribution of income between classes.
                This abstracting of individuals from their social surroundings results in the

              generating economic “laws” which are applicable for all individuals, in all
              societies, for all times. This results in all concrete instances, no matter how
              historically diﬀerent, being treated as expressions of the same universal
              concept. In this way the uniqueness of contemporary society, namely its basis
              in wage labour, is ignored (“The period through which we are passing … is
              distinguished by a special characteristic — WAGES.” [Proudhon, Op. Cit., p.
              199]). Such a perspective cannot help being ideological rather than scientiﬁc.
              By trying to create a theory applicable for all time (and so, apparently, value
              free) they just hide the fact their theory assumes and justiﬁes the inequalities
              of capitalism (for example, the assumption of given needs and distribution of
              wealth and income secretly introduces the social relations of the current
              society back into the model, something which the model had supposedly
              abstracted from). By stressing individualism, scarcity and competition, in
              reality economic analysis reﬂects nothing more than the dominant ideological
              conceptions found in capitalist society. Every few economic systems or
              societies in the history of humanity have actually reﬂected these aspects of
              capitalism (indeed, a lot of state violence has been used to create these
              conditions by breaking up traditional forms of society, property rights and
              customs in favour of those desired by the current ruling elite).
                 The very general nature of the various theories of proﬁt, interest and rent
              should send alarm bells ringing. Their authors construct these theories based
              on the deductive method and stress how they are applicable in every social
              and economic system. In other words, the theories are just that, theories
              derived independently of the facts of the society they are in. It seems
              somewhat strange, to say the least, to develop a theory of, say, interest
              independently of the class system within which it is charged but this is
              precisely what these “scientists” do. It is understandable why. By ignoring the
              current system and its classes and hierarchies, the economic aspects of this
              system can be justiﬁed in terms of appeals to universal human existence. This
              will raise less objections than saying, for example, that interest exists because
              the rich will only part with their money if they get more in return and the poor
              will pay for this because they have little choice due to their socio-economic
              situation. Far better to talk about “time preference” rather than the reality of
              class society (see section C.2.6).
                 Neoclassical economics, in eﬀect, took the “political” out of “political
              economy” by taking capitalist society for granted along with its class system,
              its hierarchies and its inequalities. This is reﬂected in the terminology used.
              These days even the term capitalism has gone out of fashion, replaced with
              the approved terms “market system,” the “free market” or “free enterprise.”
              Yet, as Chomsky noted, terms such as “free enterprise” are used “to designate
              a system of autocratic governance of the economy in which neither the
              community nor the workforce has any role (a system we would call ‘fascist’ if
              translated to the political sphere).” [Language and Politics, p. 175] As such,
              it seems hardly “value-free” to proclaim a system free when, in reality, most
              people are distinctly not free for most of their waking hours and whose
              choices outside production are inﬂuenced by the inequality of wealth and
              power which that system of production create.
                 This shift in terminology reﬂects a political necessity. It eﬀectively removes
              the role of wealth (capital) from the economy. Instead of the owners and
417 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              manager of capital being in control or, at the very least, having signiﬁcant
              impact on social events, we have the impersonal activity of “the markets” or
              “market forces.” That such a change in terminology is the interest of those
              whose money accords them power and inﬂuence goes without saying. By
              focusing on the market, economics helps hide the real sources of power in an
              economy and attention is drawn away from such a key questions of how
              money (wealth) produces power and how it skews the “free market” in its
              favour. All in all, as dissident economist John Kenneth Galbraith once put it,
              ”[w]hat economists believe and teach is rarely hostile to the institutions that
              reﬂect the dominant economic power. Not to notice this takes eﬀort, although
              many succeed.” [The Essential Galbraith, p. 180]
                 This becomes obvious when we look at how the advice economics gives to
              working class people. In theory, economics is based on individualism and
              competition yet when it comes to what workers should do, the “laws” of
              economics suddenly switch. The economist will now deny that competition is a
              good idea and instead urge that the workers co-operate (i.e. obey) their boss
              rather than compete (i.e. struggle over the division of output and authority in
              the workplace). They will argue that there is “harmony of interests” between
              worker and boss, that it is in the self-interest of workers not to be selﬁsh but
              rather to do whatever the boss asks to further the bosses interests (i.e.
              proﬁts).
                 That this perspective implicitly recognises the dependent position of
              workers, goes without saying. So while the sale of labour is portrayed as a
              market exchange between equals, it is in fact an authority relation between
              servant and master. The conclusions of economics is simply implicitly
              acknowledging that authoritarian relationship by identifying with the
              authority ﬁgure in the relationship and urging obedience to them. It simply
              suggests workers make the best of it by refusing to be independent
              individuals who need freedom to ﬂourish (at least during working hours,
              outside they can express their individuality by shopping).
                 This should come as no surprise, for, as Chomsky notes, economics is rooted
              in the notion that “you only harm the poor by making them believe that they
              have rights other than what they can win on the market, like a basic right to
              live, because that kind of right interferes with the market, and with eﬀiciency,
              and with growth and so on — so ultimately people will just be worse oﬀ if you
              try to recognise them.” [Op. Cit., p. 251] Economics teaches that you must
              accept change without regard to whether it is appropriate it not. It teaches
              that you must not struggle, you must not ﬁght. You must simply accept
              whatever change happens. Worse, it teaches that resisting and ﬁghting back
              are utterly counter-productive. In other words, it teaches a servile mentality
              to those subject to authority. For business, economics is ideal for getting their
              employees to change their attitudes rather than collectively change how their
              bosses treat them, structure their jobs or how they are paid — or, of course,
              change the system.
                 Of course, the economist who says that they are conducting “value free”
              analysis are indiﬀerent to the kinds of relationships within society is being
              less than honest. Capitalist economic theory is rooted in very speciﬁc
              assumptions and concepts such as “economic man” and “perfect competition.”
              It claims to be “value-free” yet its preferred terminology is riddled with value
418 of 3436 10/1/25, 7:46 PM An Anarchist FAQ https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-...
              connotations. For example, the behaviour of “economic man” (i.e., people who
              are self-interested utility maximisation machines) is described as “rational.”
              By implication, then, the behaviour of real people is “irrational” whenever
              they depart from this severely truncated account of human nature and society.
              Our lives consist of much more than buying and selling. We have goals and
              concerns which cannot be bought or sold in markets. In other words,
              humanity and liberty transcend the limits of property and, as a result,
              economics. This, unsurprisingly, aﬀects those who study the “science” as well:
                   “Studying economics also seems to make you a nastier person.
                   Psychological studies have shown that economics graduate students
## are more likely to ‘free ride’ — shirk contributions to an
                   experimental ‘public goods’ account in the pursuit of higher private
## returns — than the general public. Economists also are less
                   generous that other academics in charitable giving. Undergraduate
                   economics majors are more likely to defect in the classic prisoner’s
                   dilemma game that are other majors. And on other tests, students
                   grow less honest — expressing less of a tendency, for example, to
                   return found money — after studying economics, but not studying a
## control subject like astronomy.

                   “This is no surprise, really. Mainstream economics is built entirely
                   on a notion of self-interested individuals, rational self-maximisers
                   who can order their wants and spend accordingly. There’s little
                   room for sentiment, uncertainty, selﬂessness, and social institutions.
                   Whether this is an accurate picture of the average human is open to
                   question, but there’s no question that capitalism as a system and
                   economics as a discipline both reward people who conform to the
                   model.” [Doug Henwood, Wall Street, p, 143]
                So is economics “value free”? Far from it. Given its social role, it would be
              surprising that it were. That it tends to produce policy recommendations that
              beneﬁt the capitalist class is not an accident. It is rooted in the ﬁbre of the
              “science” as it reﬂects the assumptions of capitalist society and its class
              structure. Not only does it take the power and class structures of capitalism
              for granted, it also makes them the ideal for any and every economy. Given
              this, it should come as no surprise that economists will tend to support
              policies which will make the real world conform more closely to the standard
              (usually neoclassical) economic model. Thus the models of economics become
              more than a set of abstract assumptions, used simply as a tool in theoretical
              analysis of the casual relations of facts. Rather they become political goals, an
              ideal towards which reality should be forced to travel.
                This means that economics has a dual character. On the one hand, it
              attempts to prove that certain things (for example, that free market capitalism
              produces an optimum allocation of resources or that, given free competition,
              price formation will ensure that each person’s income corresponds to their
              productive contribution). On the other, economists stress that economic
              “science” has nothing to do with the question of the justice of existing
              institutions, class structures or the current economic system. And some
              people seem surprised that this results in policy recommendations which

              consistently and systematically favour the ruling class.
              C.1.2 Is economics a science?
                In a word, no. If by “scientiﬁc” it is meant in the usual sense of being based
              on empirical observation and on developing an analysis that was consistent
              with and made sense of the data, then most forms of economics are not a
              science.
                Rather than base itself on a study of reality and the generalisation of theory
              based on the data gathered, economics has almost always been based on
              generating theories rooted on whatever assumptions were required to make
              the theory work. Empirical conﬁrmation, if it happens at all, is usually done
              decades later and if the facts contradict the economics, so much the worse for
              the facts.
                A classic example of this is the neo-classical theory of production. As noted
              previously, neoclassical economics is focused on individual evaluations of
              existing products and, unsurprisingly, economics is indelibly marked by “the
              dominance of a theoretical vision that treats the inner workings of the
              production process as a ‘black box.’” This means that the “neoclassical theory
              of the ‘capitalist’ economy makes no qualitative distinction between the
              corporate enterprise that employs tens of thousands of people and the small
              family undertaking that does no employ any wage labour at all. As far as
              theory is concerned, it is technology and market forces, not structures of
              social power, that govern the activities of corporate capitalists and petty
              proprietors alike.” [William Lazonick, Competitive Advantage on the Shop
              Floor, p. 34 and pp. 33–4] Production in this schema just happens — inputs
              go in, outputs go out — and what happens inside is considered irrelevant, a
              technical issue independent of the social relationships those who do the
              actual production form between themselves — and the conﬂicts that ensure.
                The theory does have a few key assumptions associated with it, however.
              First, there are diminishing returns. This plays a central role. In mainstream
              diminishing returns are required to produce a downward sloping demand
              curve for a given factor. Second, there is a rising supply curve based on rising
              marginal costs produced by diminishing returns. The average variable cost
              curve for a ﬁrm is assumed to be U-shaped, the result of ﬁrst increasing and
              then diminishing returns. These are logically necessary for the neo-classical
              theory to work.
                Non-economists would, of course, think that these assumptions are
              generalisations based on empirical evidence. However, they are not. Take the
              U-shaped average cost curve. This was simply invented by A. C. Pigou, “a
              loyal disciple of [leading neo-classical Alfred] Marshall and quite innocent of
              any knowledge of industry. He therefore constructed a U-shaped average cost
              curve for a ﬁrm, showing economies of scale up to a certain size and rising
              costs beyond it.” [Joan Robinson, Collected Economic Papers, vol. 5, p. 11]
              The invention was driven by need of the theory, not the facts. With increasing
              returns to scale, then large ﬁrms would have cost advantages against small
              ones and would drive them out of business in competition. This would destroy
              the concept of perfect competition. However, the invention of the average cost

              curve allowed the theory to work as “proved” that a competitive market could
              not become dominated by a few large ﬁrms, as feared.
                 The model, in other words, was adjusted to ensure that it produced the
              desired result rather than reﬂect reality. The theory was required to prove
              that markets remained competitive and the existence of diminishing marginal
              returns to scale of production did tend by itself to limit the size of individual
              ﬁrms. That markets did become dominated by a few large ﬁrms was neither
              here nor there. It did not happen in theory and, consequently, that was the
              important thing and so “when the great concentrations of power in the
              multinational corporations are bringing the age of national employment policy
              to an end, the text books are still illustrated by U-shaped curves showing the
              limitation on the size of ﬁrms in a perfectly competitive market.” [Joan
              Robinson, Contributions to Modern Economics, p. 5]
                 To be good, a theory must have two attributes: They accurately describe the
              phenomena in question and they make accurate predictions. Neither holds for
              Pigou’s invention: reality keeps getting in the way. Not only did the rise of a
              few large ﬁrms dominating markets indirectly show that the theory was
              nonsense, when empirical testing was ﬁnally done decades after the theory
              was proposed it showed that in most cases the opposite is the case: that there
              were constant or even falling costs in production. Just as the theories of
              marginality and diminishing marginal returns taking over economics, the real
              world was showing how wrong it was with the rise of corporations across the
              world.
                 So the reason why the market become dominated by a few ﬁrms should be
              obvious enough: actual corporate price is utterly diﬀerent from the economic
              theory. This was discovered when researchers did what the original theorists
              did not think was relevant: they actually asked ﬁrms what they did and the
              researchers consistently found that, for the vast majority of manufacturing
              ﬁrms their average costs of production declined as output rose, their marginal
              costs were always well below their average costs, and substantially smaller
              than ‘marginal revenue’, and the concept of a ‘demand curve’ (and therefore
              its derivative ‘marginal revenue’) was simply irrelevant.
                 Unsurprisingly, real ﬁrms set their prices prior to sales, based on a mark-up
              on costs at a target rate of output. In other words, they did not passively react
              to the market. These prices are an essential feature of capitalism as prices are
              set to maintain the long-term viability of the ﬁrm. This, and the underlying
              reality that per-unit costs fell as output levels rose, resulted in far more stable
              prices than were predicted by traditional economic theory. One researcher
              concluded that administered prices “diﬀer so sharply from the behaviour to
              be expected from” the theory “as to challenge the basic conclusions” of it. He
              warned that until such time as “economic theory can explain and take into
              account the implications” of this empirical data, “it provides a poor basis for
              public policy.” Needless to say, this did not disturb neo-classical economists or
              stop them providing public policy recommendations. [Gardiner C. Means,

                 One study in 1952 showed ﬁrms a range of hypothetical cost curves, and
              asked ﬁrms which ones most closely approximated their own costs. Over 90%
              of ﬁrms chose a graph with a declining average cost rather than one showing

              the conventional economic theory of rising marginal costs. These ﬁrms faced
              declining average cost, and their marginal revenues were much greater than
              marginal cost at all levels of output. Unsurprisingly, the study’s authors
              concluded if this sample was typical then it was “obvious that short-run
              marginal price theory should be revised in the light of reality.” We are still
              waiting. [Eiteman and Guthrie, “The Shape of the Average Cost Curve”, The
              American Economic Review, pp. 832–8, Vol. 42, No. 5, p. 838]
                 A more recent study of the empirical data came to the same conclusions,
              arguing that it is “overwhelming bad news … for economic theory.” While
              economists treat rising marginal cost as the rule, 89% of ﬁrms in the study
              reported marginal costs which were either constant or declined with output.
              As for price elasticity, it is not a vital operational concept for corporations. In
              other words, the “ﬁrms that sell 40 percent of GDP believe their demand is
              totally insensitive to price” while “only about one-sixth of GDP is sold under
              conditions of elastic demand.” [A.S. Blinder, E. Cabetti, D. Lebow and J. Rudd,
              Asking About Prices, p. 102 and p. 101]
                 Thus empirical research has concluded that actual price setting has nothing
              to do with clearing the market by equating market supply to market demand
              (i.e. what economic theory sees as the role of prices). Rather, prices are set to
              enable the ﬁrm to continue as a going concern and equating supply and
              demand in any arbitrary period of time is irrelevant to a ﬁrm which hopes to
              exist for the indeﬁnite future. As Lee put it, basing himself on extensive use of
              empirical research, “market prices are not market-clearing or proﬁtmaximising prices, but rather are enterprise-, and hence transactionreproducing prices.” Rather than a non-existent equilibrium or proﬁt
              maximisation at a given moment determining prices, the market price is “set
              and the market managed for the purpose of ensuring continual transactions
              for those enterprises in the market, that is for the beneﬁt of the business
              leaders and their enterprises.” A signiﬁcant proportion of goods have prices
              based on mark-up, normal cost and target rate of return pricing procedures
              and are relatively stable over time. Thus “the existence of stable,
              administered market prices implies that the markets in which they exist are
              not organised like auction markets or like the early retail markets and
              oriental bazaars” as imagined in mainstream economic ideology. [Frederic S.
              Lee, Post Keynesian Price Theory, p. 228 and p. 212]
                 Unsurprisingly, most of these researchers were highly critical the
              conventional economic theory of markets and price setting. One viewed the
              economists’ concepts of perfect competition and monopoly as virtual
              nonsense and “the product of the itching imaginations of uninformed and
              inexperienced armchair theorisers.” [Tucker, quoted by Lee, Op. Cit., p. 73f]
              Which was exactly how it was produced.
                 No other science would think it appropriate to develop theory utterly
              independently of phenomenon under analysis. No other science would wait
              decades before testing a theory against reality. No other science would then
              simply ignore the facts which utterly contradicted the theory and continue to
              teach that theory as if it were a valid generalisation of the facts. But, then,
              economics is not a science.
                 This strange perspective makes sense once it is realised how key the notion
              of diminishing costs is to economics. In fact, if the assumption of increasing

              marginal costs is abandoned then so is perfect competition and “the basis of
              which economic laws can be constructed … is shorn away,” causing the
              “wreckage of the greater part of general equilibrium theory.” This will have “a
              very destructive consequence for economic theory,” in the words of one
              leading neo-classical economist. [John Hicks, Value and Capital, pp. 83–4] As
              Steve Keen notes, this is extremely signiﬁcant:
                   “Strange as it may seem … this is a very big deal. If marginal
                   returns are constant rather than falling, then the neo-classical
                   explanation of everything collapses. Not only can economic theory
                   no longer explain how much a ﬁrm produces, it can explain nothing
## else.

                   “Take, for example, the economic theory of employment and wage
                   determination … The theory asserts that the real wage is equivalent
                   to the marginal product of labour … An employer will employ an
                   additional worker if the amount the worker adds to output — the
                   worker’s marginal product — exceeds the real wage … [This]
                   explains the economic predilection for blaming everything on wages
                   being too high — neo-classical economics can be summed up, as
                   [John Kenneth] Galbraith once remarked, in the twin propositions
                   that the poor don’t work hard enough because they’re paid too
                   much, and the rich don’t work hard enough because they’re not paid
## enough …

                   “If in fact the output to employment relationship is relatively
                   constant, then the neo-classical explanation for employment and
                   output determination collapses. With a ﬂat production function, the
                   marginal product of labour will be constant, and it will never
                   intersect the real wage. The output of the form then can’t be
                   explained by the cost of employing labour… [This means that] neoclassical economics simply cannot explain anything: neither the
                   level of employment, nor output, nor, ultimately, what determines
## the real wage …the entire ediﬁce of economics collapses.”
                   [Debunking Economics, pp. 76–7]
                 It should be noted that the empirical research simply conﬁrmed an earlier
              critique of neo-classical economics presented by Piero Sraﬀa in 1926. He
              argued that while the neo-classical model of production works in theory only
              if we accept its assumptions. If those assumptions do not apply in practice,
              then it is irrelevant. He therefore “focussed upon the economic assumptions
              that there were ‘factors of production’ which were ﬁxed in the short run, and
              that supply and demand were independent of each other. He argued that
              these two assumptions could be fulﬁlled simultaneously. In circumstances
              where it was valid to say some factor of production was ﬁxed in the short
              term, supply and demand could not independent, so that every point on the
              supply curve would be associated with a diﬀerent demand curve. On the other
              hand, in circumstances where supply and demand could justiﬁably be treated
              as independent, then it would be impossible for any factor of production to be
              ﬁxed. Hence the marginal costs of production would be constant.” He
