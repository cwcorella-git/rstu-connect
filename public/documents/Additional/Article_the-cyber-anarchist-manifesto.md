              The Anarchist Federation of Cyber Communes is another chapter in the
            struggle against oppression, one which honours and builds on the web’s
            anarchist traditions. The web is a medium through which we can spread
            anarchist ideas, as well as organize among already existing online and oﬄine
            structures, but it is also a space that we can use to implement an anarchist
            society.

            1.0 Anarchism

              Anarchism is a political theory that is skeptical of the justiﬁcation of
            authority and power. But more importantly, anarchism oﬀers a positive theory
            for human ﬂourishing, based upon the principles of freedom, equality,
            community, mutual aid, and non-coercive consensus building.
              We want to build a better world: one that brings out the best in each
            one of us.
              In the words of Errico Malatesta:
                 By anarchist spirit [we] mean that deeply human sentiment, which
                 aims at the good of all, freedom and justice for all, solidarity and
                 love among the people; which is not an exclusive characteristic only
                 of self-declared anarchists, but inspires all people who have a
## generous heart and an open mind.

            2.0 The Web

            2.1 Taking Back our Space

              The web has an Anarchist tradition. In between open-source software,
            collaborative websites, and freely available resources, our predecessors have
            created an oasis that we have maintained and improved. But this space has
            also been degraded and corrupted. We now live in an era where there are
            monopolies on all facets of this space from the hardware side to the software
            side. We are reaching a stage where every aspect of the web is
            commercialized, from our private social interactions to the information search
            engines give us. The web has also become a tool of mass state surveillance
            and fascist political indoctrination. These developments are the result of the
            capitalist, statist, and colonial logic of our society. They are not an inherent
            feature of the web.

            2.2 The Web an Organizational Tool

              We can do more than simply free the web. Even under the current system,
            the web is an amazing tool to spread information, organize eﬀectively, and
            discuss ideas. The web is a blueprint for an Anarchist society. Just as AnarchoSyndicalists see the workers union as a structure through which we can
            implement an Anarchist revolution, we see the world wide web as a structure
            capable of much the same. Concretely, we can set up the features of an
            Anarchist society online which would allow us to create an experiment on a
            much larger scale than ever attempted before. By creating an online
            Anarchist society without having to conquer any oﬄine space, we may elude
            many of the threats that other anarchist and anarchist-adjacent experiments
            have met. This organization hopes to make that vision possible.

            3.0 Federating the Web

            3.1. Existing organizations

              Our project is not the ﬁrst appearance of Anarchism on the web nor does it
            claim to be. The Anarchist sphere is already active on every social media
            platform with lively discussions of Anarchist theory, talk of past as well as
            current Anarchist or Anarchist adjacent real world events and exciting new
            ideas. We have websites for Anarchist news, dusty online libraries, places to
            participate in mutual aid, and so on. This vibrant ecosystem is the result of
            years of work from Anarchists across the world and serves as inspiration for
            this project. We do not wish to replace it, but to build on it. The goal of the
            federation is to pool these forces together, to share information, and be able
            to coordinate larger initiatives in an accessible and transparent manner.
              We like to imagine a giant solidarity network, and we hope to provide a

            platform to make it happen.
              Concretely, this means that in addition to networking between individuals
            and existing organizations, we are working to provide a platform for emerging
            organizations and initiatives. We oﬀer web-services, such as hosting websites,
            blogs, and podcasts. We invite everyone and anyone who has an idea to reach
            out to us, so we can all work together to make it happen!

            3.2. Linking oﬄine and online

              Many current online Anarchist organizations lack a real anchoring in the
            oﬄine Anarchist community while many oﬄine Anarchist organizations have a
            merely superﬁcial presence online. With the AFCC, we want to bridge the gap
            so that we can operate more eﬀectively in both spaces.

            4.0 Spreading Anarchist Principles

            4.1. Expanding beyond “Western”-centric Anarchism

              The web gives the Anarchist community the opportunity of listening to and
            amplifying the views and analyses of Anarchism beyond this movement’s
            western roots. We also acknowledge solidarity with Indigenous movements
            who share our values but (rightly so) reject western labels. There are many
            contributions from Anarchists (and Indigenous movements) from all around
            the world which are both not accessible or widely shared, and we are here to
            amplify those contributions.

            4.2. Accessibility and Reach

              A key aspect of this project is public education. In the context of our heavily
            indoctrinated society, Anarchist ideals are not immediately accessible to the
            general public. First you need to overcome all the stigma of even considering
            Anarchism beyond what the word means in the popular consciousness.
            Second you need to understand the Anarchist principles to a reasonable level.
            Thirdly and perhaps most diﬀicultly, you need to manage to eﬀectively apply
            these principles. Various projects on the web have already made this process
            more accessible and many of us would not be radicalized if it weren’t for the
            current Anarchist presence. We want to keep a strong presence and improve
            the education of baby Anarchists.
              We already have a very international movement, a characteristic that is both
            intrinsic to our ideology and uniquely suited to the web. We must make sure
            that anyone, anywhere can identify with Anarchism.

## Join us.
## Together, we will be unstoppable.
