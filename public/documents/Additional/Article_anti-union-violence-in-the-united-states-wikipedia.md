## Anti-union violence in the United States is physical force
## intended to harm union officials, union organizers, union
## members, union sympathizers, or their families. It has most
                commonly been used either during union organizing efforts, or
                during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from
## forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the
                effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers
## prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace,
## violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the
## picket line.

                Violence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part
## of a campaign that includes spying, intimidation,

                impersonation, disinformation, and sabotage.[1] Violence in
                labor disputes may be the result of unreasonable polarization,
                or miscalculation. It may be willful and provoked, or senseless
                and tragic. On some occasions, violence in labor disputes may
                be purposeful and calculated,[2] for example the hiring and
## deployment of goon squads to intimidate, threaten or even
## assault strikers.

                According to labor historians and other scholars, the US has
## had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any
                industrialized nation.[3][4][5]
                Union organizer Frank Little was pulled from his bed and lynched in
## 1917 because of his union activities.

                Historically, violence against unions has included attacks by
                detective and guard agencies, such as the Pinkertons, Baldwin
                Felts, Burns, or Thiel detective agencies; citizens groups, such
## as the Citizens' Alliance; company guards; police; national
                guard; or even the military. In particular, there are few curbs on
                what detective agencies are able to get away with.[6] In the
## book From Blackjacks To Briefcases, Robert Michael Smith
## states that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
## centuries, anti-union agencies spawned violence and wreaked
                havoc on the labor movement.[7] One investigator who

                participated in a congressional inquiry into industrial violence
## in 1916 concluded that,

                Espionage is closely related to violence. Sometimes it is the
                direct cause of violence, and, where that cannot be charged, it
                is often the indirect cause. If the secret agents of employers,
## working as members of the labor unions, do not always
                investigate acts of violence, they frequently encourage them.
                If they did not, they would not be performing the duties for
                which they are paid, for they are hired on the theory that labor
                organizations are criminal in character.[8]

## In U.S. Senate testimony in 1936 about an employer who
## wanted to contract with the Pinkerton agency, known
                personally to the author of the book The Pinkerton Story, this
                employer was characterized as a "sincerely upright and Godly
                man." Yet Pinkerton files record that the employer wanted the
## agency "to send in some thugs who could beat up the
                strikers."[9] In 1936, the Pinkerton agency changed its focus
                from strike-breaking to undercover services.[10] Pinkerton
                declined the request from this employer.[9]

## According to Morris Friedman, detective agencies were
## themselves for-profit companies, and a "bitter struggle"
## between capital and labor could be counted upon to create
## "satisfaction and immense profit" for agencies such as the
                Pinkerton company.[11] Such agencies were in the perfect
                position to fan suspicion and mistrust "into flames of blind and
                furious hatred" on the part of the companies.[11]

## Agencies sell tactics including violence

                [edit]

## Harry Wellington Laidler wrote a book in 1913 detailing how
## one of the largest union busters in the United States,
                Corporations Auxiliary Company, had a sales pitch offering the
## use of provocation and violence. The agency would routinely
## tell employers—prospective clients—of the methods used by
                their undercover operatives,[12]

## Once the union is in the field its members can keep it from
## growing if they know how, and our man knows how. Meetings
                can be set far apart. A contract can at once be entered into
## with the employer, covering a long period, and made very
                easy in its terms. However, these tactics may not be good, and
## the union spirit may be so strong that a big organization
## cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns extremely
                radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union
                embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest
                man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody
                in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up.
                [12]

## Different types of violence

                [edit]
                Striking Pennsylvania mine workers began their protest march near
                Harwood. Many would soon be killed by the Luzerne County sheriff.

## Some anti-union violence appears to be random, such as an
## incident during the 1912 textile strike in Lawrence,
                Massachusetts, in which a police officer fired into a crowd of
                strikers, killing Anna LoPizzo.[13]

## Anti-union violence may be used as a means to intimidate
                others, as in the hanging of union organizer Frank Little from a
                railroad trestle in Butte, Montana. A note was pinned to his
                body which said, "Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!".
                The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists
                in the Butte area were on the note, with the "L" for Frank Little
                circled.[14][15]

## Anti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three
                years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners
## was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards
## suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the Anaconda Road
## Massacre. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to
                flee, and one man died.[16]
                Machine gun equipped armored car built with steel from CF&I's Pueblo
                steel works, known to the striking miners as the Death Special. "The
                machine gun was turned on striking miners and used to riddle the
                Forbes tent colony."[17]

## The unprovoked attack was similar to another event, which
## had occurred twenty-three years earlier in Pennsylvania.

## During the Lattimer massacre, nineteen unarmed immigrant
## coal miners were suddenly gunned down at the Lattimer mine
                near Hazleton, Pennsylvania, on September 10, 1897.[18][19]
## The miners, mostly of Polish, Slovak, Lithuanian and German
                ethnicity, were shot and killed by a Luzerne County sheriff's
                posse. In this group as well, all of the miners had been shot in
                the back.[20][21] The shooting followed a brief tussle over the
## American flag carried by the miners. Their only crime was
                asserting their right to march in the face of demands that they
## disperse.

                In 1927, during a coal strike in Colorado, state police and mine
                guards fired pistols, rifles and a machine gun into a group of
                five hundred striking miners and their wives in what came to
                be called the Columbine Mine Massacre. In this incident as well,
## many of the miners were immigrants, and there had been a
## disagreement over the question of trespassing onto company
                property in the town of Serene, with the miners asserting it was
## public property because of the post office. There was, once
                again, a tussle over American flags carried by the strikers.

## While the Columbine mine shooting was a surprise,
## newspapers played a deadly role in conjuring the atmosphere
                of hate in which the violence occurred. Lurid editorials attacked
                the ethnicity of the strikers.[22] Newspapers began calling for
                the governor to no longer withhold the "mailed fist", to strike
                hard and strike swiftly,[23] and for "Machine Guns Manned By
                Willing Shooters" at more of the state's coal mines.[24] Within
                days of these editorials, state police and mine guards fired on
                the miners and their wives, injuring dozens and killing six.[25]

## In all of the above incidents, the perpetrators were never
## caught, or went unpunished. An exception resulted from a
                shooting of strikers at the Williams & Clark Fertilizing Company
                near the Liebig Fertilizer Works at Carteret, New Jersey, in
## 1915. One striker was killed outright, and more than twenty
## were injured in an unprovoked attack when deputies fired on
                strikers who had stopped a train to check for strikebreakers.
                The strikers found no strikebreakers and were cheering as they
                exited the train. Forty deputies approached and suddenly fired
                on them with revolvers, rifles, and shotguns. As the strikers
                ran, "the deputies ... pursued, firing again and again."[26]
## According to attending physicians, all the strikers' wounds
                were on the backs or legs, indicating the guards were pursuing
                them.[27] A local government official who witnessed the
                shooting called it entirely unprovoked.[26] Four more of the
                strikers, all critically injured, would die. Twenty-two of the
## guards were arrested and the crime was investigated by a
## Grand Jury; nine deputies were subsequently convicted of
                manslaughter.[28]

## Other anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914
                when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony
## of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be
                known as the Ludlow Massacre.[29] During that strike, the
## company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an
                armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent
## colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the "Death
## Special". At the Forbes tent colony,

                [The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent

                some six hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of
                the shots struck miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing
## him instantly. Another striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ...
                suffered nine bullet wounds to his legs... One tent was later
                found to have about 150 bullet holes...[30]

## After deaths of women and children at Ludlow,

                [T]he backlash was vicious and bloody. Over the next ten days
## striking miners poured out their rage in attacks across the
                coalfields...[31]
                The U.S. Army was called upon to put an end to the violence,
                and the strike sputtered to an end that December.[32]
                As a result of Operative Smith's "clever and intelligent" work, a
## number of union organizers received severe beatings at the
## hands of unknown masked men, presumably in the employ of
                the company.[33]
                Morris Friedman offers examples of these incidents:

## About February 13, 1904, William Farley, of Alabama, a
                member of the [UMWA] National Executive Board ... and the
                personal representative of [UMWA] President Mitchell ...
                addressed coal miners' meetings ... [on their return trip] eight
## masked men held them up with revolvers, dragged them from
## their wagon, threw them to the ground, beat them, kicked
                them, and almost knocked them into insensibility.[33]

## And,

## On Saturday, April 30, 1904, W.M. Wardjon, a national
                organizer of the United Mine Workers, while on board a train en
8 of 19 9/7/25, 11:57 AM Anti-union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## route to Pueblo, was assaulted by three men at Sargents,
                about thirty miles west of Salida. Mr. Wardjon was beaten into
                unconsciousness.[34]

## Friedman accused the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&I),
                operated by John D. Rockefeller and his lieutenant in Colorado,
                Jesse Welborn, of responsibility for the beatings during the
                1903–04 strike.[34]
                Sometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an
                auto workers strike organised by Victor Reuther and others in
                1937, "[u]nionists assembled rocks, steel hinges, and other
## objects to throw at the cops, and police organized tear gas
                attacks and mounted charges."[35]

                COLORADO NATIONAL GUARD From left to right: Captain R. J.
                Linderfelt, Lieut. T. C. Linderfelt, Lieut. K. E. Linderfelt, (who faced the
                charge of assault upon Louis Tikas, the dead strike leader), Lieut. G.S.
                Lawrence and Major Patrick Hamrock. The last three were in the
## Ludlow battle of April 20, 1914."

                A study of industrial violence in 1969 concluded, "There is no
## episode in American labor history in which violence was as
                systematically used by employers as in the Colorado labor war
                of 1903 and 1904."[36]
                About the middle of February 1904, leadership of the Colorado
## National Guard became concerned that the Mine Owners were
                failing to cover the payroll of the soldiers. General Reardon
                ordered Major Ellison to take another soldier he could trust to
                "hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator
                mine" in order to convince the mine owners to pay.[37] The
                implication of the secrecy was that the incident would then be
## blamed on the union.

                However, Major Ellison reported that the miners took a route
                out of the mine that would not make ambush possible. Reardon
## ordered Ellison to pursue an alternative plan, which was
## shooting up one of the mines. Major Ellison and Sergeant
                Gordon Walter fired sixty shots into two mine buildings.[37] The
                plan worked, and the mine owners paid up. Ellison would later
## testify (in October 1904) that General Reardon informed him
## Adjutant General Sherman Bell and Colorado Governor James
                Peabody knew about the plan.[37] Major Ellison's testimony
## about the shooting plot, and about the staged attacks on
                striking miners, was corroborated by two other soldiers.[37]

## Ludlow massacre, 1914

                [edit]

## Professor James H. Brewster, a faculty attorney with the
## University of Colorado who was investigating the strike for
## Governor Ammons, was aware that militia Lieutenant Karl
                Linderfelt was guilty of abuse and beatings of innocent citizens,
                including a small Greek boy "whose head was split open".[38]
                [39] Professor Brewster sent a telegram to Governor Ammons

## requesting Linderfelt's removal. No action was taken. In a
## subsequent face to face meeting with the governor, three
                months prior to the Ludlow Massacre, Brewster again insisted
## that Linderfelt be removed, but again, Ammons declined. In
                later testimony, Professor Brewster stated that Linderfelt was
                the reason for the massacre.[38] On the day that the Ludlow
## Massacre occurred, Lieutenant Karl Linderfelt, commander of
## one of two companies of the Colorado National Guard, had
                Louis Tikas, leader of the Ludlow tent colony of striking miners,
## at gunpoint. Tikas was unarmed, and the miners would later
## explain that he approached the militia to ask them to stop
                shooting.[40] While two militiamen held Tikas, Linderfelt broke
                a rifle butt over his head. Tikas and two other captured miners
                were later found shot dead. Tikas had been shot in the back.
                [41] Their bodies lay along the Colorado and Southern railroad
                tracks for three days in full view of passing trains. The militia
                officers refused to allow them to be moved until a local of a
                railway union demanded the bodies be taken away for burial. A
                court martial found Lieutenant Linderfelt guilty of assaulting
                Tikas with a Springfield rifle, "but attaches no criminality

                thereto. And the court does therefor acquit him."[42]

## 1916 Congressional investigation

                [edit]
                In 1916, the Commission on Industrial Relations, created by the
                U.S. Congress, issued a final report on its investigation of
                industrial unrest. On the question of violence in industrial
## disputes, the Commission stated, in part,

                Many instances of the use of physical force by the agents of
## employers have ... come before the Commission, indicating a
                relatively wide use, particularly in isolated communities.[43]

## Late 20th century anti-union violence

                [edit]
                By the early 1900s, public tolerance for violence during labor
## disputes began to decrease. Yet violence involving
## strikebreaking troops and armed guards continued into the
                1930s.[44] The level of violence that anti-union agencies
## engaged in eventually resulted in their tactics becoming
## increasingly public, for there were a very great number of
## newspaper and muckraking articles written about such
                incidents.[45] Resources that once were allocated to overt
## control over workforces began to be assigned to other
                methods of control, such as industrial espionage.[7] After the
## Great Depression in 1929, the public no longer considered
                companies unassailable.[46] Yet legislation related to employer
                strategies such as violent strike breaking would have to wait
12 of 19 9/7/25, 11:57 AM Anti-union violence in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                until after World War II.[46] Beginning in the 1950s, employers
## began to embrace new methods of managing workers and
                unions which were still effective, but much more subtle.[46]
                A 1969 study of labor conflict violence in the United States
## examined the era following the 1947 passage of the Taft–
## Hartley Act and noted that attacks on strikers by company
                guards had all but disappeared.[36] Violence still occurs in labor
                disputes, for example, when one side miscalculates. Bringing
                in outside security forces, as one example, can lead to violence
                in modern labor disputes.[47]

## The use of cameras and camcorders may affect levels of
                violence in labor disputes today.[48]

## Examples since 1940

                [edit]

             - Victor Reuther, a leader of the United Auto Workers in Detroit,
                survived an assassination attempt in 1949, with the loss of his
                right eye.[49]

## Sometimes, threats of violence cause damage to union
                members or supporters. Other times, threats against unions or
## their members may backfire. For example, Indiana Deputy
                Attorney General Jeffrey Cox was fired after suggesting that
## Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker should use live ammunition
## against pro-union protesters involved in the 2011 Wisconsin
## protests. More recently, a Deputy Prosecutor in Indiana's
## Johnson County, Carlos Lam, suggested that Governor Walker
## should mount a "false flag" operation which would make it

                appear as if the union was committing violence. After initially
## claiming that his email account was hacked, Lam admitted to
                sending the suggestion and resigned.[50][51]
                Cullen Werwie, press secretary for Governor Walker, states that
                Walker's office was unaware of Lam's email. According to CBS
## News, Werwie also commented, "Certainly we do not support
                the actions suggested in (the) email. Governor Walker has said
## time and again that the protesters have every right to have
                their voice heard, and for the most part the protests have been
                peaceful. We are hopeful that the tradition will continue."[50]
