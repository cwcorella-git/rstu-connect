            A Swarm of Butterﬂies: A Fierce
            Defense of Chaos in Direct Action
            2002
              Despite the tremendous successes we’ve had in the past few years, several
            recent anarchist mobilizations have been hijacked by a shrill minority that
            wishes to impose permits, routes, parade marshals (e.g. peace police), zones
            of actions and other such nonsense, turning our rage and creativity into a
            well-ordered media spectacle, or worse, mass arrest. The constant and
            insincere calls for “solidarity” and protecting others have turned our once
            raucous resistance into an exercise of well-organized crowd control.
              But it hasn’t always been like this...
              Just a few years ago the military’s pet think-tank RAND organization wrote:
              “Anarchists [in Seattle 1999] using extremely good modern
            communications, including live Internet feeds, were able to execute
            simultaneous actions by means of pulsing and swarming tactics coordinated
            by networked and leaderless “aﬀinity groups.” Rather it became an example
            of the challenges that hierarchical organizations face when confronting
            networked adversaries with faster reaction cycles. This loosely organized
            coalition, embracing network organization and tactics, frustrated police
            eﬀorts to gain the situational awareness needed to combat the seemingly
            chaotic Seattle disturbances.”
              RAND concludes that there is little that hierarchical organizations like the
            police can do to deal with such chaotic tactics. In addition, they sound the
            alarm that our types of groups facilitate rapid evolution of tactics and
            promote greater recruiting opportunities than traditional demonstrations.
            They are afraid and they had right to be: we were winning. Fortunately, today,
            we still can win.
              We gain nothing returning to the tactics of ten years ago: the scripted,
            bland and boring traditional leftist demonstrations of parade routes, leaders,
            speakers and marshals. What we need is creative, decentralized and, most of
            all, chaotic action.
              One tactic used in Seattle and elsewhere that utilizes chaos is “pulsing”.
            Pulsing is the ability of groups of people to come together, disperse to safety
            and reform in new groups. While this is similar to guerrilla tactic of
            “absorption,” there is an important diﬀerence.
              Che’s notion of “absorption” is simply when a “force attacks the enemy for a
            period of time and then breaks oﬀ the attack being absorbed into the

            community or environment” from where it came. Pulsing is a constant ﬂow of
            people joining, breaking up and rejoining, often in new combinations of
            groups. The most successful way this can be done is through small
            decentralized autonomous groups (e.g. aﬀinity groups) that have the decisionmaking power to decide for themselves when and with whom to interact with.
              RAND points out that pulsing makes crowd control very diﬀicult because it
            keeps “rearranging the threats” and that there is no prearranged pattern that
            police can analyze and neutralized. This is unpredictability is the cornerstone
            of chaos theory.
              A biological example beloved by chaos theoreticians is bacteria. Bacteria
            function in pulses, creating ever-new patterns of connections. Chaos thinker
            Planc wrote “Each pattern is organic and results from random forces in the
            environment the ever-changing collection and density [pulsing] of bacteria
            makes their organizations very durable and adaptable.”
              “Swarming” is another way we can inject chaos into our actions. Swarming
            is the tactic of hitting a number of targets at the same time without following
            a pre-set pattern. Decentralized swarming frustrates law enforcement’s
            ability to protect targets and disrupt our activities. They are forced into
            “reaction” as opposed to their goal of “controlling the agenda for protests”.
            Again, the only way for this to work with thousands of people is for us to
            organize in a radically decentralized manner. Decentralizing work and actions
            by the channels of aﬀinity allows the skills and passions of small groups to be
            utilized best, so that the groups select actions that match their interests and
            abilities.
              In demonstrations, hierarchical organizations are quickly overwhelmed
            when their central nervous system is confronted by the chaos caused by
            unpredictable, pulsing swarms. Anarchists can take advantage of these
            matrices of opportunity opened up by autonomous groups, giving us a huge
            advantage over slow reacting, hierarchical groups like the police.
              Both pulsing and swarming inject the crucial element of chaos into our
            demonstrations. Police are repulsed by chaos, as are all hierarchical
            organizations, and thus are slower to react. These tactics provide aﬀinity
            groups opportunities that they could have never planned for: like liberating
            unguarded dumpster next to a checkpoint that can be turned into a battering
            ram or ﬁnding an unlocked service entrance into a hotel where IMF delegates
            are staying.
              Chaos also allows small actions to be multiplied and expanded on. Even
            small initial changes can accumulate quickly creating profound and unlikely
            changes — such as a butterﬂy ﬂapping its wings in Argentina may cause a
            hurricane in New York.
              We are not robots, we are not pawns of organizers: we are a pulsing swarm
            of creative and free butterﬂies. We are ﬁghting for our lives and dancing to be
            free.
