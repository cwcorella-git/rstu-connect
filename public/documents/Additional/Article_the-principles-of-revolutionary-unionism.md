            The Principles of Revolutionary
            Unionism
            January 2020

              1. Revolutionary unionism, basing itself on the class struggle, aims to unite
            all workers in combative economic organizations, which ﬁght to free
            themselves from the double yoke of capital and the State. Its goal is the
            reorganization of social life on the basis of Libertarian Communism via the
            revolutionary action of the working class. Since only the economic
            organizations of the proletariat are capable of achieving this objective,
            revolutionary unionism addresses itself to workers in their capacity as
            producers, creators of social wealth, to take root and develop amongst them,
            in opposition to the modern workers’ parties, which it declares are incapable
            of the economic reorganization of society.
              2. Revolutionary unionism is the staunch enemy of all social and economic
            monopoly, and aims at its abolition by the establishment of economic
            communities and administrative organs run by the workers in the ﬁeld and
            factories, forming a system of free councils without subordination to any
            authority or political party, bar none. As an alternative to the politics of State
            and parties, revolutionary unionism posits the economic reorganization of
            production, replacing the rule of man over man with the administrative
            management of things. Consequently, the goal of revolutionary unionism is
            not the conquest of political power, but the abolition of all state functions in
            the life of society. Revolutionary unionism considers that along with the
            disappearance of the monopoly of property, must come the disappearance of
            the monopoly of domination; and that no form of State, however camouﬂaged,
            can ever be an instrument for human liberation, but that on the contrary, it
            will always be the creator of new monopolies and new privileges.
              3. Revolutionary unionism has a two-fold function: to carry on the day-today revolutionary struggle for the economic, social and intellectual
            advancement of the working class within the limits of present-day society, and
            to educate the masses so that they will be ready to independently manage the
            processes of production and distribution when the time comes to take
            possession of all the elements of social life. Revolutionary unionism does not
            accept the idea that the organization of a social system based exclusively on
            the producing class can be ordered by simple governmental decrees and
            maintains that it can only be obtained through the common action of all
            manual and intellectual workers, in every branch of industry, by self1 of 3 10/11/25, 1:04 PM

            management of the workers, such that every group, factory or branch of
            industry is an autonomous member of the greater economic organism and
            systematically runs the production and distribution processes according to
            the interests of the community, on an agreed-upon plan and on the basis of
            mutual accord.
              4. Revolutionary unionism is opposed to all organizational tendencies
            inspired by the centralism of State and Church, because these can only serve
            to prolong the survival of the State and authority and to systematically stiﬂe
            the spirit of initiative and the independence of thought. Centralism is and
            artiﬁcial organization that subjects the so-called lower classes to those who
            claim to be superior, and that leaves in the hands of the few the aﬀairs of the
            whole community — the individual being turned into a robot with controlled
            gestures and movements. In the centralized organization, society’s good is
            subordinated to the interests of the few, variety is replaced by uniformity and
            personal responsibility is replaced by rigid discipline. Consequently,
            revolutionary unionism bases its social vision on a broad federalist
            organization; i.e., an organization stemming from the bottom up, the uniting
            of all forces in the defense of common ideas and interests.
              5. Revolutionary unionism rejects all parliamentary activity and all
            collaboration with legislative bodies; because it knows that even the freest
            voting system cannot bring about the disappearance of the clear
            contradictions at the core of present-day society and because the
            parliamentary system has only one goal: to lend a pretense of legitimacy to
            the reign of falsehood and social injustice.
              6. Revolutionary Unionism rejects all political and national frontiers, which
            are arbitrarily created, and declares that so-called nationalism is just the
            religion of the modern state, behind which is concealed the material interests
            of the propertied classes. Revolutionary unionism recognizes only economic
            diﬀerences, whether regional or national, that produce hierarchies, privileges
            and every kind of oppressions (because of race, sex and any false or real
            diﬀerence), and in the spirit of solidarity claims the right to self-determination
            for all economic groups.
              7. For the identical reason, revolutionary unionism ﬁghts against militarism
            and war. Revolutionary unionism advocates anti-war propaganda and the
            replacement of standing armies, which are only the instruments of counterrevolution at the service of capitalism, by workers’ militias, which, during the
            revolution, will be controlled by the workers’ unions; it demands, as well, the
            boycott and embargo of all raw materials and products necessary for war,
            with the exception of a country where the workers are in the midst of social
            revolution, in which case we should help them defend the revolution. Finally,
            revolutionary unionism advocates the preventive and revolutionary general
            strike as a means of opposing war and militarism.
              8. Revolutionary unionism recognizes the need of a production that does not
            damage the environment, and that tries to minimize the use of non-renewable
            resources and uses, whenever possible, renewable alternatives. It does not
            admit ignorance as the origin of the present-day environmental crisis, but the
            thirst for earnings. Capitalist production always seeks to minimize costs in
            order to get more earnings to survive, and it is unable to protect the
            environment. To sum up, the world debt crisis has sped up the tendency to

            commercial harvest to the detriment of subsistence agriculture. This fact has
            produced the destruction of the tropical forest, starvation and disease. The
            ﬁght to save our planet and the ﬁght to destroy capitalism must be joint or
            both of them will fail.
               9. Revolutionary unionism asserts itself to be a supporter of the method of
            direct action, and aids and encourages all struggles that are not in
            contradiction to its own goals. Its methods of struggle are: strikes, boycotts,
            sabotage, etc. Direct action reaches its deepest expression in the general
            strike, which should also be, from the point of view of revolutionary unionism,
            the prelude to the social revolution.
               10. While revolutionary unionism is opposed to all organised violence
            regardless of the kind of government, it realizes that there will be extremely
            violent clashes during the decisive struggles between the capitalism of today
            and the free communism of tomorrow. Consequently, it recognizes as valid
            that violence may be used as a means of defense against the violent methods
            used by the ruling classes during the struggles that lead up to the
            revolutionary populace expropriating the lands and means of production. As
            this expropriation can only be carried out and brought to a successful
            conclusion by the direct intervention of the workers’ revolutionary economic
            organizations, defense of the revolution must also be the task of these
            economic organizations and not of a military or quasi-military body
            developing independently of them.
               11. Only in the economic and revolutionary organizations of the working
            class are there forces capable of bringing about its liberation and the
            necessary creative energy for the reorganization of society on the basis of
            libertarian communism.
