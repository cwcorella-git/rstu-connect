          “The Police Have No Obligation To Protect You. Yes, Really.”
                  By Walter Olson In cases such as DeShaney v. Winnebago County (1989) and Castle Rock v.
                    December 28, 2011 Gonzales (2005), the Supreme Court has declined to put police and other public
                           14 Comments authorities under any general duty to protect individuals from crime. The decisions
                                               have been broadly unpopular, but Mike McDaniel at PJ Media takes the Court’s
                              side on policy grounds: “This [lack of a particularized duty] might seem absolutely
                                               outrageous, but it is logical, rational, and unquestionably necessary.”

                    December 28, 2011 That was an interesting article. After reading it I kind of agree with Mike McDaniel, but, one thing puzzles
                             1:33 PM me. If the police are under no obligation to protect an individual, why do most police organizations support
                                               gun control? One of the cornerstones of the anti-gun groups arguement is that you don’t have to protect

## yourself, that is what the police are for.

                    December 28, 2011 however, try to selectively not co-operate with said police and see what happens.

                                               If it wasn’t the case, then the police (and by extension the city) could and would be sued for failing to protect

                      December 28, 2011 Doesn’t that beg the question: if the police have no obligation to protect us, then don’t we have a “super”

                      December 29, 2011 To be clear, what DeShaney and Castle Rock say is that the police have no constitutional duty to protect
                               9:36 PM you. One may be able to sue police in state court for their failure to act (depending on one’s state’s laws).
                                                     What one can’t do is sue police in federal court, claiming that they violated one’s constitutional rights .
