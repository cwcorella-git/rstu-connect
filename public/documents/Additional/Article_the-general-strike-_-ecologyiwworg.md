## As the crises unfolding from Felonious Trump’s lawless coup
## continue, and the apparent inability by what’s left of the
                American putatively constitutional government to stop it grow
## increasingly odious, desperation among the people seems to
                be festering. This includes growing calls for a “general strike”
## on various social media platforms.

## What is a general strike? Well, it’s what happens when all
                workers in a specific industry or geographical location cease

                work simultaneously, thus bringing business as usual to a halt.
## Such activity can be used with great effect to beat back
                growing oppressive conditions, brought on by the bosses or by
                governments. There is a rich history of such strikes throughout
## history.

                The idea predates the IWW, but it was the Industrial Workers of
                the World, or “Wobblies” as they’re affectionately still known,
                that was one of the revolutionary unions who made it a central
                focus of their strategy. Both William “Big Bill” Haywood and
                Ralph Chaplin devised detailed descriptions of how this might
                work in practice. Chaplin, by the way, is the individual who
## wrote the lyrics to organized labor’s most famous anthem,
                Solidarity Forever (which essentially explains the concept of
                the “general strike” through its lyrics); he also conceived of the
                IWW’s mascot: the black cat.
                Careful examination of these texts will reveal that a crucial
                ingredient of any successful general strike is organization,
                meaning that such actions do not materialize out of nothing.
                Unfortunately, this point seems lost on far too many people.
                That is why, like clockwork, anonymously wheatpasted posters
## calling for a “General Strike!” frequently appear all over
                financial districts and countercultural enclaves the last week in
## April each year, but such strikes unfold.

## With apologies to “Boromir”, from Lord of the Rings, one
## cannot simply speak a General Strike into existence. They
                must be organized. Workers, particularly those not represented
## by a union—and that amounts to more than 87% of American
                wage earners—face enormous risks for taking collective action
                at all, let alone something as forceful as a strike. That doesn’t

## mean workers not formally represented by a union cannot
                strike. In fact, they can, and what’s more, such activity is
                protected under labor law if the workers are employed in the
## private sector (in the case of the public sector, certain
## transportation workers, or farm workers, it’s a bit more
                complicated). Even if workers aren’t legally allowed to strike, if
## enough defy the laws, as would be the case in most general
## strikes, but even without formal representation, the
## aforementioned workers would still need to coordinate with
## each other, have support and mutual aid networks in place,
## and coordinate with grassroots community organizations.
                Otherwise, these workers would be sitting ducks, and likely all
## get fired.
