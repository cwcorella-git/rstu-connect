Here are some of their declarations. The Murder Mine (Seattle, WA) Dear friends of the Mine, We have decided collectively to go on rent strike. Some of us are out of work, as artists and service industry workers, and resorting to our limited amount of savings to support ourselves and our families. On top of that, we feel the importance of standing in solidarity with all people facing the heavy economic burden of this pandemic shutdown. Whether or not you have the means to pay rent this month, if we stand together we can push for the changes we need. The eviction moratorium in Seattle gives us a protective buffer, but it is not enough. We demand a rent suspension. We demand no debts. People who have the privilege to pay, think for a moment if you didn’t have that safety net. You would want your friends, neighbors, and community to be supportive of each other. This is how we do it: Rent strike now! No mortgage payments! 1 of 4 10/29/25, 11:44 PM ``` -- ## Page 2 ### Complete Page View ![Page 2 Complete](images/page_002_full.png) Strike Declarations affect low-income families, precarious workers, and other disenfranchised members of our community. Some voices are now calling for suspension of rent and mortgage payments during this period. In the first instance we would like to add our voice to that call. Beyond this however, we, as anarchists, believe that the first and essential tool of change is not government fiat and lobbying, but rather direct action taken by regular people to make the changes we want to see. As such we add to the call for such a suspension with a call for a rent and mortgage *strike* during the crisis. We think that the first step to changing the rules right now is collective refusal. We are calling on everyone--individuals, business, non-profits, and any other entity that has rent or mortgage obligations-- not only to withhold payments, but to publicly commit to doing so. While the world grinds to a halt, we refuse to continue to dutifully pay crippling amounts for basic needs. This is evil in the best of times; this crisis highlights its banality as well as its brutality. When it has become impossible for so many of us to work, there is no alternative except to stand together and say: Rent Strike Now! Mortgage Strike Now! This means: do not pay your next rent or mortgage payment. Instead, send a message that you will not be paying (check back for form letters to banks and landlords). This means repost this message and image. This means sign on to the rent/mortgage strike commitment form (link in bio). It’s particularly important for people who are financially secure and able to pay their rent or mortgage to show solidarity with 3 of 4 10/29/25, 11:44 PM ``` -- ## Page 4 ### Complete Page View ![Page 4 Complete](images/page_004_full.png)'
