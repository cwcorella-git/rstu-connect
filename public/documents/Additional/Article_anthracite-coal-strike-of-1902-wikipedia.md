                strike)[1][2] was a strike by the United Mine Workers of
                America in the anthracite coalfields of eastern Pennsylvania.
## Miners struck for higher wages, shorter workdays, and the
                recognition of their union. The strike threatened to shut down
                the winter fuel supply to major American cities. At that time,
                residences were typically heated with anthracite or "hard" coal,
## which produces higher heat value and less smoke than "soft"
## or bituminous coal.

                The strike never resumed, as the miners received a 10 percent
## wage increase and reduced workdays from ten to nine hours;
                the owners got a higher price for coal and did not recognize the
                trade union as a bargaining agent. It was the first labor dispute
## in which the U.S. federal government and President Theodore
                Roosevelt intervened as a neutral arbitrator.[3]

## The 1899 and 1900 strikes

                [edit]

## The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) had won a
## sweeping victory in the 1897 strike by the soft-coal
                (bituminous coal) miners in the Midwest, winning significant
## wage increases. It grew from 10,000 to 115,000 members. A
                number of small strikes took place in the anthracite district
## from 1899 to 1901, by which the labor union gained
## experience and unionized more workers. The 1899 strike in
## Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, demonstrated that the unions could
                win a strike directed against a subsidiary of one of the large
                railroads.[4]

## Coal miners in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, in 1900.

## It hoped to make similar gains in 1900, but found the
## operators, who had established an oligopoly through
                concentration of ownership after drastic fluctuations in the
## market for anthracite, to be far more determined opponents
## than it had anticipated. The owners refused to meet or to
## arbitrate with the union. The union struck on September 17,
                1900, with results that surprised even the union, as miners of
                all different nationalities and ethnicities walked out in support
## of the union.

## Republican Party Senator Mark Hanna from Ohio, himself an
                owner of bituminous coal mines (not involved in the strike),
                sought to resolve the strike as it occurred less than two months
## before the presidential election. He worked through the
## National Civic Federation which brought labor and capital
                representatives together. Relying on J. P. Morgan to convey his
                message to the industry that a strike would hurt the reelection
## of Republican William McKinley, Hanna convinced the owners
## to concede a wage increase and grievance procedure to the
                strikers. The industry refused, on the other hand, to formally
                recognize the UMWA as the representative of the workers. The
## union declared victory and dropped its demand for union

                recognition.[5]

## The anthracite coal strike

                [edit]
                John Mitchell, President of the UMWA, takes the bull (coal trusts) by the
## horns.

                The issues that led to the strike of 1900 were just as pressing in
                1902: the union wanted recognition and a degree of control
## over the industry. The industry, still smarting from its
## concessions in 1900, opposed any federal role. The 150,000
                miners wanted their weekly pay envelope. Tens of millions of
## city dwellers needed coal to heat their homes.

## John Mitchell, President of the UMWA, proposed mediation
                through the National Civic Federation, then a body of relatively
                progressive employers committed to collective bargaining as a
                means of resolving labor disputes. In the alternative, Mitchell
## proposed that a committee of eminent clergymen report on
## conditions in the coalfields. George Baer, President of the
## Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, one of the leading
## employers in the industry, brushed aside both proposals
                dismissively:

## Anthracite mining is a business, and not a religious,
                sentimental, or academic proposition.... I could not if I would
5 of 19 9/7/25, 12:02 PM Anthracite coal strike of 1902 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## delegate this business management to even so highly a
                respectable body as the Civic Federation, nor can I call to my
                aid . . . the eminent prelates you have named.[6]

## On May 12, 1902, the anthracite miners voting in Scranton,
                Pennsylvania, went out on strike. The maintenance employees,
## who had much steadier jobs and did not face the special
                dangers of underground work, walked out on June 2. The union
                had the support of roughly eighty percent of the workers in this
## area, or more than 100,000 strikers. Some 30,000 left the
## region, many headed for Midwestern bituminous mines.
                10,000 men returned to Europe.[7] The strike soon produced
## threats of violence between the strikers on one side and
                strikebreakers, the Pennsylvania National Guard, local police,
                and hired detective agencies on the other.[8]

## Federal intervention

## On June 8, President Theodore Roosevelt asked his
                Commissioner of Labor, Carroll D. Wright, to investigate the
## strike. Wright investigated and proposed reforms that
## acknowledged each side's position, recommending a nine-hour
                day on an experimental basis and limited collective bargaining.
                Roosevelt chose not to release the report, for fear of appearing
## to side with the union.

## The owners refused to negotiate with the union. As George
## Baer wrote when urged to make concessions to the strikers
                and their union, the "rights and interests of the laboring man
                will be protected and cared for—not by the labor agitators, but
## by the Christian men to whom God in His infinite wisdom has
                given the control of the property interests of the country."[9]
                The union used this letter to sway public opinion in favor of the
## strike.

                Roosevelt wanted to intervene, but he was told by his Attorney
## General, Philander Knox, that he had no authority to do so.
## Hanna and many others in the Republican Party were likewise
                concerned about the political implications if the strike dragged
                on into winter, when the need for anthracite was greatest. As
                Roosevelt told Hanna, "A coal famine in the winter is an ugly
## thing and I fear we shall see terrible suffering and grave
                disaster."[10]

## Roosevelt convened a conference of representatives of
## government, labor, and management on October 3, 1902. The
## union considered the mere holding of a meeting to be
                tantamount to union recognition and took a conciliatory tone.
                The owners told Roosevelt that strikers had killed over 20 men
7 of 19 9/7/25, 12:02 PM Anthracite coal strike of 1902 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## and that he should use the power of government "to protect
                the man who wants to work, and his wife and children when at
                work."[11] With proper protection, the owner said that they
## would produce enough coal to end the fuel shortage. They
                refused to enter into any negotiations with the union.[11]

## The governor sent in the National Guard, who protected the
## mines and the minority of men still working. Roosevelt
## attempted to persuade the union to end the strike with a
## promise that he would create a commission to study the
                causes of the strike and propose a solution, which Roosevelt
                promised to support with all of the authority of his office.
                Mitchell refused and his membership endorsed his decision by
                a nearly unanimous vote.[11]
                The economics of coal revolved around two factors: most of the
                cost of production was wages for miners, and if the supply fell,
                the price would shoot up. In an age before the use of oil and
                electricity, there were no good substitutes. Profits were low in
## 1902 because of an over supply; therefore the owners
## welcomed a moderately long strike. They had huge stockpiles
                which increased daily in value. It was illegal for the owners to
                conspire to shut down production, but not so if the miners went
                on strike. The owners welcomed the strike, but they adamantly
                refused to recognize the union, because they feared the union
                would control the coal industry by manipulating strikes.[12]

## Roosevelt continued to try to build support for a mediated
                solution, persuading former president Grover Cleveland to join
## the commission he was creating. He also considered
## nationalizing the mines under the leadership of John M.

                Schofield.[13] This would put the U.S. Army in control of the
                coalfields[14][15] to "run the mines as a receiver", Roosevelt
                wrote.[16]

## J.P. Morgan intervenes

                [edit]
                Theodore Roosevelt and J.P. Morgan have a meeting where they agree
## on a resolution for the strike.

## J.P. Morgan, the dominant figure in American finance, had
## played a role in resolving the 1900 strike. He was deeply
                involved in this strike as well: his interests included the
                Reading Railroad, one of the largest employers of miners. He
## had installed George Baer, who spoke for the industry
                throughout the strike, as the head of the railroad.[17]
                At the urging of Secretary of War Elihu Root, Morgan came up
## with another compromise proposal that provided for
                arbitration, while giving the industry the right to deny that it
                was bargaining with the union by directing that each employer
## and its employees communicate directly with the commission.
## The employers agreed on the condition that the five members
                be a military engineer, a mining engineer, a judge, an expert in
                the coal business, and an "eminent sociologist". The employers
9 of 19 9/7/25, 12:02 PM Anthracite coal strike of 1902 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## were willing to accept a union leader as the "eminent
## sociologist," so Roosevelt named E. E. Clark, head of the
                railway conductors' union, as the "eminent sociologist." After
## Catholic leaders exerted pressure, he added a sixth member,
## Catholic bishop John Lancaster Spalding, and Commissioner
                Wright as the seventh member.[18]

## Anthracite Coal Strike Commission

                [edit]
                The commission appointed by Roosevelt to resolve the dispute,
## photographed by William H. Rau

## The anthracite strike ended, after 163 days, on October 23,
## 1902. The commissioners began work the next day, then spent
                a week touring the coal regions. Wright used the staff of the
                Department of Labor to collect data about the cost of living in
## the coalfields.

## The commissioners held hearings in Scranton over the next
                three months, taking testimony from 558 witnesses, including
                240 for the striking miners, 153 for nonunion mineworkers, 154
                for the operators, and eleven called by the Commission itself.

                Baer made the closing arguments for the coal operators, while
## lawyer Clarence Darrow closed for the workers.

## Although the commissioners heard some evidence of terrible
## conditions, they concluded that the "moving spectacle of
## horrors" represented only a small number of cases. By and
                large, social conditions in mine communities were found to be
                good, and miners were judged as only partly justified in their
                claim that annual earnings were not sufficient "to maintain an
## American standard of living."

                Baer said in his closing arguments, "These men don't suffer.
                Why, hell, half of them don't even speak English".[19] Darrow,
## for his part, summed up the pages of testimony of
                mistreatment he had obtained in the soaring rhetoric for which
                he was famous: "We are working for democracy, for humanity,
                for the future, for the day will come too late for us to see it or
                know it or receive its benefits, but which will come, and will
## remember our struggles, our triumphs, our defeats, and the
                words which we spake."[20]
                In the end, the rhetoric of both sides made little difference to
## the commission, which split the difference between
## mineworkers and mine owners. The miners asked for 20%
## wage increases, and most were given a 10% increase. The
## miners had asked for an eight-hour day and were awarded a
## nine-hour day instead of the standard ten hours then
                prevailing. While the operators refused to recognize the United
## Mine Workers, they were required to agree to a six-man
## arbitration board, made up of equal numbers of labor and
## management representatives, with the power to settle labor

## disputes. Mitchell considered that de facto recognition and
                called it a victory.[21]

## Aftermath of the strike

                [edit]
                The two sides were supposed to listen to expert testimony and come
                to a friendly agreement. Cartoon from the Cleveland Plain Dealer
                John Mitchell wrote that eight men died during the five months,
                "three or four" of them strikers or sympathizers.[22] During the
## extensive arbitration testimony, after company owners made
                claims that the strikers had killed 21 men, Mitchell disagreed
                strongly and offered to resign his position if they could name
                the men and show proof.[23]
                The first casualty occurred July 1. An immigrant striker named
                Anthony Giuseppe was found fatally shot near a Lehigh Valley
## Coal Company colliery in Old Forge. It was thought the Coal
                and Iron Police guarding the site shot blindly through a fence.
                [24] Street fighting in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania on July 30
                between a mob of 5,000 striking miners versus police resulted
## in the beating death of Joseph Beddall, a merchant and the

12 of 19 9/7/25, 12:02 PM Anthracite coal strike of 1902 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                brother of the deputy sheriff.[25]

## Contemporary reporting describes three other deaths and
## widespread shooting injuries among strikers and Shenandoah
                police.[26] On October 9, a striker named William Durham was
                shot and killed in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, near Shenandoah.
## He'd been loitering near the half-dynamited house of a nonunion worker and disobeyed an order to halt.[27] The legality of
## that killing under martial law became a case, Commonwealth
## v. Shortall, that was taken to the Supreme Court of
## Pennsylvania.

                The behavior and private role of the Coal and Iron Police during
                the strike led to the formation of the Pennsylvania State Police,
## on May 2, 1905, as Senate Bill 278 was signed into law by
                Governor Samuel W. Pennypacker.[28] The two forces operated
## in parallel until 1931.

## Organized labor celebrated the outcome as a victory for the
## UMWA and American Federation of Labor unions generally.
## Membership in other unions soared, as moderates argued they
                could produce concrete benefits for workers much sooner than
                radical Socialists who planned to overthrow capitalism in the
                future. Mitchell proved his leadership skills and mastery of the
                problems of ethnic, skill, and regional divisions that had long
                plagued the union in the anthracite region.[29]
                By contrast, the strikes of the radical Western Federation of
                Miners in the West often turned into full-scale warfare between
## strikers and both employers and the civil and military
                authorities. This strike was successfully mediated through the
13 of 19 9/7/25, 12:02 PM Anthracite coal strike of 1902 - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

## intervention of the federal government, which strove to
## provide a "Square Deal"—which Roosevelt took as the motto
## for his administration—to both sides. The settlement was an
## important step in the Progressive Era reforms of the decade
                that followed. There were no more major coal strikes until the
                1920s.[29]
