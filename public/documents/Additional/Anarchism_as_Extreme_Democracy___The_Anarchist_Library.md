               Anarchism as Extreme
               Democracy

               As Marxism, and state-socialism in general, have increasingly
               been discredited, there has been a tendency for leftists to turn
               to another tradition, that of the democratic
               revolution.Democracy can be seen as a ground for opposition
               to the authoritarianisms of capitalist society (Morrison, 1995;
               Mouffe, 1992; Trend, 1996; Wood, 1995). One influential work
               concludes, “The task of the Left, therefore, cannot be to
               renounce liberal democratic ideology, but, on the contrary, to
               deepen and expand it in the direction of a radical and plural
               democracy.... [S]ocialism is one of the components of a project
               for radical democracy, not vice versa” (Laclau and Mouffe,
               1985, pp. 176, 178).
               “Democracy” has two contradictory meanings today: the
               justification of the existing state versus a tradition of
               revolutionary popular liberation. It is the ideological support of
               the existing “democratic” states of the West and elsewhere—
               precisely because democratic ideals are so attractive.
               Periodical elections and (relative) freedom of expression and
               association are used to justify a society where a few really rule

               over the majority. Capitalist democracy is used by competing
               factions of rulers to settle their disputes without (much)
               bloodshed. It serves to coopt rebellious popular forces.
               But democracy is also the cry of the oppressed against ruling
               elites—the idea that ordinary people should participate in, and
               control, the institutions which make up their society. This idea
               of democracy goes back to tribal councils, to classical
               Athens,to the great bourgeois revolutions of England, the U.S.,
               and France, to the U.S. abolitionists, and, today, to ideals loved
               by millions. It is rights torn from rulers by the struggle and
               blood of the people. It is the standard for judging the state—
               and for condemning it. As such, it may not yet have lost its
               revolutionary potential.
               This theoretical development is interesting to those of us who
               see socialist-anarchism as nothing but the most extreme,
               consistent, and thorough-going democracy. Writers such as
               Paul Goodman (1965) and Noam Chomsky(1994), have
               claimed their versions of anarchism as extensions of the
               democratic tradition from Jefferson to John Dewey. Benjamin
               Tucker, the nineteenth century U.S.anarchist, wrote, “The
               anarchists are simply unterrified Jeffersonian democrats”
               (1888; p. 11). The contemporary anarchist Murray Bookchin
               writes, “...A free society will either be democratic or it will not
               be achieved at all” (1995; p. 17).
               Yet the historical relation between anarchism and democracy is
               highly ambiguous. This should not be surprising, considering
               how vague and open-ended have been both terms. Like
               “socialism” or “freedom,” they have meant many different
               things to many different people.

               In What is Property?, the first work to claim the term
               “anarchist,” Pierre Joseph Proudhon explicitly counterposed it
               to “democrat”: “I hear some of my readers reply: ...‘You are a
               democrat.’ No... ‘Then what are you? ’‘I am an anarchist’”
               (quoted in Woodcock, 1962,p. 12). But years later, Proudhon
               advocated the replacement of the state by a democracy of
               voluntary producers’ associations, “a vast federation of
               associations and groups united in the common bond of the
               democratic and social republic” (quoted in Guerin, 1970; p.
               45).
               Anarchism may offer a unique perspective on democracy’s two
               meanings. Liberals and social democrats believe in democracy
               and may call themselves “democratic socialists.”But while
               highly critical of aspects of the system, ultimately they
               succumb to the mystifying aspect of democratic theory. They
               accept the existing state as undemocratic, but hope to modify
               it, to make it “even more democratic.” On the other hand,
               authoritarian revolutionaries—Stalinists,radical nationalists,
               etc.—do not fall for the democratic obfuscations of U.S.
               imperialism. But they intend to replace this state with a new
               state, one in which they are the new rulers. They reject the
               ideal of popular self-management.
               Anarchists, however, can reject the claim that existing states
               should be supported because they are democratic, while
               continuing to hold up democracy as a liberating vision. But to
               do this, anarchism and democracy must be accepted as
               compatible. To clarify this issue, I will first discuss a criticism of
               anarchism from the standpoint of democracy, and then a
               criticism of democracy from the standpoint of anarchism.

               Democratic Anti-Anarchism
               Robert Dahl’s Democracy and Its Critics (1989) is a major
               statement of the case for democracy, clearly written and
               thoughtful. Before plunging into his argument, Dahl discusses
               two fundamental “objections” to democracy, namely
               anarchism and “guardianship.” He defines anarchism, fairly
               enough, as “a society consisting only of purely voluntary
               associations, a society without the state” (p. 37). He quickly
               adds, “Because democracy might well be the most desirable
               process for governing these associations, it might also be the
               prevalent form of government in an anarchist society” (p. 37).
               This makes clear that anarchism is not opposed to democracy
               but to the “democratic state.”
               Unfortunately, he does not go on to explain what he means by
               “the state.”“I do not pro-pose to define the term ‘state’
               rigorously” (p. 359). He uses it, apparently, to mean “the major
               means of organized coercion” (p. 43, see also p. 359).
               Dahl goes on to make an argument that some coercion is
               necessary and that anarchists are wrong to absolutely oppose
               all social coercion. The goal should be to “...minimize coercion
               and maximize consent” (p. 51). Essentially I agree with his
               argument. Whatever may be the case after centuries of
               anarchist freedom, a newly-anarchist society will need some
               way to control individual psychopathic killers or violent
               organized counterrevolutionaries.However, Dahl seems to
               assume that coercion means a state. He admits that preliterate
               peoples, such as the Inuit (Eskimo), lived satisfactorily for
               centuries or millennia without states,but he does not consider
4 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               how they dealt with the social need for coercion. They had
               coercion, whether by public opinion or organized violence—
               every male, at least, was armed and organized by the tribal
               council. What they did not have was a state.
               Kropotkin defined the state: “The State idea...includes the
               existence of a power situated above society...the concentration
               in the hands of a few of many functions in the life of society.... A
               whole mechanism of legislation and of policing has to be
               developed in order to subject some classes to the domination
               of others” (1993; p. 160). Comparable ideas were expressed
               by Engels: “...[T]his power, arisen out of society but placing
               itself above it, and alienating itself more and more from it, is
               the state....[I]t consists not merely of armed men but also of
               material adjuncts, prisons, and institutions of coercion of all
               kinds...” (quoted by Lenin, 1970; pp. 290, 292).
               The argument of anarchists is not that it is possible to
               immediately abolish all coercion (although some may have
               posed it that way). It is that it is possible to abolish the
               bureaucratic, socially-alienated institution of the state. The
               “democratic state” is to be condemned, not because it is still
               coercive, but because it cannot be truly democratic. By its very
               nature,this instrument of coercion which stands above and
               against society must serve a ruling minority against an
               oppressed majority.
               Dahl does not deal with this issue directly, but it relates to a
               major point of his book. Modern society, he says, is too large
               and complex to be based on the face-to-face, direct democracy
               of the preliterate tribes or later city-states. For democracy to
               exist on a large scale, it needed the “invention” of
5 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               representation. Only representative government (by
               implication, a state) could have brought democracy to the
               modern world, he claims.
               But this has two sides. Representation made a sort-of-
               democracy possible on the large scale of modern nations,but
               that large scale made it possible to create a form of elite rule
               which could still be called democracy. Instead of
               direct,participatory democracy, we have a layer of elected
               politicians and government bureaucrats who stand between
               the people and the actual making of decisions. From time to
               time, the passive citizens elect these “representatives” to be
               political for them. Wood (1995) cites the views of leading
               figures among the U.S. Founding Fathers, “Their argument was
               not that representation is necessary in a large republic,but, on
               the contrary, that a large republic is desirable so that
               representation is unavoidable.... Representation...is intend-ed
               to act as a filter” (p. 216).
               Undoubtedly, some degree of representation or
               delegation,from lower to higher bodies, is necessary. As
               federalists,anarchists have generally agreed with this. But the
               meaning of representation, and all other aspects of
               democracy, would change drastically in a different social
               context. The anarchists’ proposed changes in society might be
               summarized in two concepts:
               First, the creation of an egalitarian society in which separate
               groups of oppressors and oppressed either do not exist any
               longer (capitalists and workers) or have redefined their
               relationships as equals (men and women, European-Americans
               and African-Americans, North Americans and Latin Americans).
6 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Where wealth is evenly distributed and no oppression exists,
               society is no longer pulled in different directions by competing
               and hostile forces. It does not need a state to hold things
               together; it is easier to maximize con-sent and minimize
               coercion.
               Second (and here most Marxists disagree), anarchists want a
               society based in direct democracy through popular assemblies
               —at the workplace, in the community, and in many voluntary
               associations. The more decisions are made locally,then the
               fewer are made centrally. The more people experience face-to-
               face democracy as a vibrant, daily way of life, the more they
               will really control any representatives sent to delegated
               assemblies. The police and army would be replaced by a militia
               —the people armed. “If the entire people were truly sovereign,
               there would no longer be either government or governed...the
               State...would be identical to society and disappear into
               industrial [and other—WP]organization” (Guerin, 1970; p. 17).
               Dahl is aware of these arguments and agrees with them to a
               point. He seeks to decrease social and political inequalities. He
               advocates greatly increasing participation and decision-
               making at the local community level. He supports a democratic
               socialism where the economy is socially owned and regulated
               but firms compete with each other. Unlike most sup-porters of
               “market socialism,” he advocates that the firms be
               democratically managed by their employees, like producer
               cooperatives or the previous Yugoslavian system. “...[I]t would
               be a mistake to underestimate the importance of authoritarian
               institutions in the daily lives of working people and the
               consequences of introducing a more democratic system in the
7 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               governing of economic enterprises” (p. 332).
               Yet he does underestimate the consequences of such
               decentralized democratization on the more centralized,
               national and international, institutions of society. He dismisses
               the idea of a drastic transformation of society raised by either
               Marxists or anarchists. “Market socialism” itself suggests that,
               even under “socialism,” the economy will not be run overall by
               democratic decision-making but by the market. While agreeing
               that our society is highly unequal, he denies that there is
               minority rule (because there are competing elites). This society
               —which he calls “polyarchy”—is imperfect, but he argues that
               it is still democratic and worthy of support. In practice, if not in
               intention, he is one of those who accept the role of democracy
               as justifying the existing patriarchal capitalist state.
               Part of the problem is that, whenever Dahl backs up theory by
               referring to practice, he always turns to existing democratic
               capitalist states. Using these as models produces a rather
               limited view of what democracy is capable of being. Anarchists,
               in contrast, focus on the historical revolutions (for example,
               Dolgoff, 1974; Kropotkin, 1986; Voline, 1974).
               The lessons which anarchists draw from these revolutions are
               summarized by Bookchin(1996): “From the largely medieval
               peasant wars of the sixteenth century Reformation to the
               modern uprisings of industrial workers and peasants,
               oppressed people have created their own popular forms of
               community association...to replace the oppressive states....
               [T]hese associations took the institutional form of local
               assemblies...or representative councils of mandated recallable
               deputies” (p. 4). These historical examples cannot “prove” the
8 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               validity of a radically democratic society, but they provide
               ample evidence of its possibility.
               Anarchist Anti-Democracy
               The relation of anarchism and democracy has been raised from
               the other side, by Errico Malatesta, the great Italian anarchist
               (active from the 1870s to the 1930s). Unlike the individualist,
               anti-organizational tendency within anarchism, Malatesta
               advocated that anarchists organize themselves and promote
               the self-organization of working people. In the1920s, he wrote
               two brief pieces on our topic, with the theme summarized in
               the title of one,“Neither Democrats nor Dictators: Anarchists”
               (Malatesta, 1995; pp. 73–76 and 76–79).
               He believed that the capitalist democratic state was preferable
               to a dictatorship, if only because anarchists could use its
               ideology against it. “...[T]he worst of democracies is always
               preferable, if only from the educational point of view, than [sic]
               the best of dictatorships....Democracy is a lie, it...is, in reality,
               oligarchy, that is, government by the few to the advantage of a
               privileged class. But we can still fight it in the name of freedom
               and equality...”(p. 77).
               As can be seen from this, much of Malatesta’s opposition to
               democracy is really directed against democratic ideology as a
               rationalization for capitalism and the state. But he mixes this
               up with a denunciation of the very concept of majority rule. “...
               [W]e are neither for a majority nor for a minority government;
               neither for democracy nor for dictatorship.... We are...for free
               agreement.... We are for anarchy” (p. 76).

               The democratic concept is “the rule of the majority, with
               respect for the rights of the minority.” Under patriarchal
               capitalism, “majority rule” has meant the rule of the dominant
               minority which shapes majority public opinion through the
               control of media and in other ways. “Minority rights” have
               often been called on against any attempt by the majority to
               take any of the wealth of the rich. But “majority rule” and
               “minority rights” have also been rallying cries against ruling
               minorities and the prejudiced mass which follows them.
               Malatesta points out that the majority is often wrong,
               compared to the most enlightened minority. If the majority
               rules, he argues, it must dictate to the minority, forcing its will
               on the minority. This is just as bad as minority rule. How can the
               majority be trusted to respect minority rights if the majority
               rules over the minority? For these reasons, Malatesta rejects
               majority rule in principle. Such views must be responded to.
               Civil libertarians have long argued that there are many areas of
               life where collective decision-making is not necessary. In these
               areas, such as sexual orientation, the majority have no right to
               dictate to the minority. Large numbers of people today would
               respect the rights of “consenting adults” to engage in minority
               sexual practices. As Thomas Jefferson argued for religious
               freedom, “...[I]t does me no injury for my neighbor to say there
               are twenty gods or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor
               breaks my leg” (Dewey, 1957; p. 111). Anarchists seek to
               vastly expand the range of voluntary association for such self-
               chosen activities,activities outside the realm of majority rule.
               However, there will still be areas which require collective
               decision-making. For example, a community may need to
10 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               decide whether to build a new road. Consensus would be best,
               but people often disagree. A majority and a minority may
               polarize about this issue. This can-not be treated as a matter of
               voluntary association (although dissidents are always free to
               pick up and go elsewhere—but other communities also must
               decide whether to build roads). Either the road is built or it is
               not. If a majority forms for road-building, then the anti-builder
               minority may be asked to participate, to give their share of the
               labor or social wealth.In any case, they will have to live in the
               community with a new road, unwanted by them.
               This is not coercion by the police but by reality. A decision had
               to be made collectively. If not determined by majority vote,
               then how? A community may decide that such decisions must
               be unanimous. But what if everyone cannot agree? Perhaps
               the minority gets to veto the proposal, since it is not
               unanimous. Then it is the minority which rules, preventing the
               majority from getting its road. Alternately, the minority agrees
               to keep quiet, so as to “not block consensus.” This denies them
               the right to be openly counted as disagreeing. I am not denying
               the right of any community or association to decide to rely on
               consensus, just arguing that majority rule is not authoritarian
               in principle.
               Malatesta asks what rights the minority has under majority
               rule. People with minority views have the right to participate in
               all decision making. They have the right to try to win a majority
               to their views. If they lose one vote, they may continue to
               participate and to seek to become the new majority. Perhaps in
               the future they will persuade enough community members
               that the new road was a mistake and to tear it down, or, at
11 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               least, not tobuild new ones. They may be in the majority on
               other issues.
               Minority rights is an essential part of majority rule. If the
               members of a community do not have the chance to hear all
               opinions, including minority ones, then they cannot be said to
               really decide the issues. The suppression of minority views in
               capitalist democracy (by force or just by lack of money or lack
               of coverage in the media) is one way the ruling minority
               creates the illusion that the majority is governing.
               At the same time, minority rights are safest when the majority
               rules, as opposed to any minority dictatorship. Majority rule
               and minority rights are not opposites but require each other.
               To democracy, Malatesta counterposes “free agreement.” But
               there is no such opposition.People may freely agree to form
               voluntary associations—whether to trade stamps or to produce
               shoes. But then how will they run the associations? Presumably
               people will not agree completely on everything. There must be
               some process other than dissolving the associations each time
               everyone fails to agree. That process is democracy. Anarchists
               are not fora democratic state but can be for a democratic
               society, for democracy as a “way of life.” Anarchism is
               democracy without the state.
               Anarchism’s Importance For Democracy
               Why is this important? We can see what happens when
               radicals try to develop democratic theory without incorporating
               anarchism. Often it is little more than “democratic socialism”
               restated, that is, reformist state socialism. For example, David
12 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Trend’s Radical Democracy (1996) is mostly articles by
               members of Democratic Socialists of America. They are
               somewhat embarrassed by the identification of their socialism
               with statism, but they still have no alternative to using the
               existing state to intervene in the economy.
               A democratic theory which is really radical would strongly deny
               that the existing patriarchal/racist capitalist state is truly
               democratic, would oppose the whole socially-alienated,
               bureaucratic-military state machine, and would propose
               instead a democratic federation of assemblies and
               associations. Anything less will gloss over the undemocratic—
               anti-democratic—nature of our society and its state.
               A significant attempt to develop a radical democratic theory
               which includes socialism has been made by Chantal Mouffe
               and those associated with her. She is quite clear that her
               “radical democracy” is not an alternative to the existing state
               but an extension of it. “What we advocate is a kind of ‘radical
               liberal democracy’—we do not present it as a rejection of the
               liberal democratic regime or the institution of a new political
               form of society” (1996; p.20). Her aim is “...extending
               democracy within the framework of a liberal-democratic
               regime” (1992; p. 3). She is critical of direct democracy or
               community as goals.
               In fact the only time she seems to directly deal with the state is
               in a discussion of those who oppose “civil society” to “the
               state” (in Laclau and Mouffe, 1985). It is not hard to show that
               “civil society”—the realm of capitalism, patriarchy, and racism
               —is not the ground for salvation from the state. But “civil
               society” is internally antagonistic, based on the tensions
13 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               between oppressed and oppressors, including the struggles of
               classes, genders, and races,among others. This pressure from
               below for freedom is the source of all social progress.
               Mouffe claims that the state also has internal antagonisms,
               therefore implying that it is wrong to reject the state as such.
               She notes, for example, that the state may pass legislation
               against gender discrimination or in defense of peasants
               against landlords in poor countries. This is true, but these are
               like raises which the management of a business may offer its
               workers. It may do this because the workers force it to or
               because it is far-sighted and provides benefits before the
               workers form a union—but whatever the reason, management
               remains capitalist and the enemy of the workers. There are
               divisions within management,as within the state, but they are
               over how best to suppress and/or coopt the oppressed.Neither
               management nor the state is the friend of workers or women or
               peasants.
               Laclau and Mouffe add that there are times when the state is
               opposed to “civil society.”“...[T]his is what happens when the
               state has been transformed into a bureaucratic excrescence
               imposed by force upon the rest of society, as in Eastern
               Europe, or in the Nicaragua of the Somozas...” (p. 180). That is,
               in countries, such as the U.S., where the majority do support
               the regime, the state is not, they claim, a bureaucratic-military
               excrescence upon society. This is an opinion held by many
               people, including that U.S. majority. It can be argued for, but I
               do not see how it can be called “radical.”
               Democracy’s Importance For Anarchism
14 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               If democratic theory needs anarchism, so anarchism needs
               democracy. There is an authoritarian trend within the history of
               anarchism. It begins with Proudhon, who was racist,anti-
               Semitic, patriarchal, and who imagined himself ruling France as
               dictator over his federation of associations (Draper, 1970).
               Bakunin, the second “father of anarchism,” kept on trying to
               organize secret societies which would manipulate mass
               organizations from behind the scenes (Guerin, 1970;
               Woodcock, 1962). Anarchist terrorists and bomb
               throwers(including the Unabomber) acted as elite heroes
               without (or against) the people.
               From then until now, anarchists have often capitulated either
               to reformism (support of the current state) or to revolutionary
               dictatorships. Proudhon ended up getting elected to the French
               parliament. Kropotkin, the third “father of anarchism,” became
               an enthusiastic supporter of the Western imperialist states in
               World War I. Goodman (1965) and Chomsky (1994) could fairly
               be called reformists. This anarchist support for reformism
               became a serious matter when the Spanish anarchists of the
               1930s, faced with a revolutionary situation, became ministers
               in the liberal capitalist government. On the other side, many
               anarchists joined with the Bolsheviks after the Russian
               Revolution. In the 1960s, the anarchist-pacifists of Liberation
               magazine became apologists for Castro and Ho Chi Minh.
               Further examples are easily found.
               The Marxist Hal Draper has argued that the basic problem with
               anarchism is its supposed rejection of democracy. “...
               [A]narchist ‘libertarianism’...is not concerned with the winning
               of democratic control-from-below, but with the destruction of
15 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               ‘authority’ over the individual ego, even the most extremely
               democratic version of authority imaginable” (1969; p. 93). He
               quotes Proudhon, “Any man who cannot do what he wants and
               anything he wants has the right to revolt, even alone, against
               the government, even if the government were everybody else”
               (same). Draper comments, “The only man who can enjoy this
               ‘freedom’ unlimited by society is a despot” (same).
               While there is an authoritarian side of the anarchist tradition, it
               would be ridiculous to deny that there is also a libertarian-
               democratic side, in both theory and practice. Whether or not
               they used the word “democracy,” socialist-anarchists have
               long advocated replacing bureaucratic institutions by self-
               governing associations, that is, by democracy (and, as I have
               argued, a strong defense of individual and minority rights does
               not necessarily contradict democracy or majority rule).
               Anarchists have organized mass democratic, labor unions,
               popular armies,and self-managed peasant collectives and
               worker cooperatives. Marxism too has both democratic and
               authoritarian sides, but the dominant tendency of its main
               wings,social democracy and Stalinism, has been authoritarian
               statism (as Draper would agree). Between Marxism and
               anarchism, it is anarchism which has the more democratic and
               freedom-loving theory and tradition.
               Also, anarchists have a different relation to their theoreticians.
               Unlike Marxism and Leninism, anarchism is not named after its
               historic figures. It has no sacred writings comparable to Capital
               or State and Revolution. It has no problem rejecting the errors
               of its founders.
               However, Draper has a major point. Anarchism, if not
16 of 19 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism as Extreme Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               inherently hostile to democracy, has had a contradictory
               relationship with it. The individualist tendencies are the worst
               in that regard, as has been recognized by socialist-anarchists.
               What is needed is for anarchists to identify anarchism as
               extreme, revolutionary democracy. The weaknesses of
               anarchism are real,but they can be corrected from within the
               anarchist tradition.
               The program of anarchism is to replace the bureaucratic-
               military state machine with a federation of popular assemblies
               and associations, as decentralized as is practically possible.
               This is democracy without the state. Any other program, such
               as staying within the limits of the existing state but making it
               “more democratic” (“democratic socialism” or “radical-liberal
               democracy”) falls for “democracy” as an ideological cover of
               the rule of a minority—of patriarchal/racist capitalism and its
               bureaucratic state.
