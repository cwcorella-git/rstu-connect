## Organising

- Educate workers about organising for transition at work

## Movement building

- Build future action for a worker led future

## ON THE 6 NOV GLOBAL DAY OF ACTION

Each of the main demonstrations will consist of blocs (sections) showing the diversity of our movements. We will mobilise big, powerful and united trade union and workers blocs on each of them

## DIGITAL MOBILISATION

To help trade unions and workers to organise and find actions to join, we have created dedicated social media channels and a website featuring an action map and resources including a model motion, organising guides and editable graphics: www.wemaketomorrow.org Trade unionists are encouraged to add mobilising meetings and workplace actions to the action map.

## NEXT STEPS

We have recently held a meeting with General Secretaries and another with 50+ regional trade union staff and leaders. Next will come a regional trade union mobilising meeting for each demonstration. Get in touch to help us organise these.

## HOW TO HELP

To put the trade union movement at the heart of the fight for climate justice means we need your help to make these mobilisations the biggest ever. The urgent need is to help organise a big regional trade union meeting for each of the main demonstrations. We aim to hold these between now and 8 October (Update: London is planned for 30 September).
