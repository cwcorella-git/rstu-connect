            Introduction
              One cannot expect a rebellion, any rebellion, against any authority, to come
            without hardship relative to one’s own already desperate condition. Many
            have died and sacriﬁced for the struggles for liberation we hold in our hearts,
            and those who bear witness also bear scars. It is equally our duty to care as it
            is to ﬁght; one cannot exist without the other, often, they are intimately

            intertwined. for us, we who live lives of antagonism against authority, it is
            expected that we will ﬁnd ourselves tied up in the consequences of violence
            inﬂicted on us by colonizers and fascists, routinely, preemptively and in
            retaliation for our actions toward a world in which all is done and shared in
            common. For us, the brutality of those consequences is very visible in short
            bursts, around which we most often strategize, but is more insidiously
            inﬂicted over the long haul on our collective emotional wellbeing. This
            particular arena is very familiar to us: it takes the shape of disenchantment,
            hopelessness, burnout, isolation. This is the particular arena in which
            strategies are sparse and the work of care is inequitably distributed. The
            purpose of this text is to act as a resource for those who see the value in
            engaging in the work of collective care, for those who want to expand their
            knowledge and practices of responding collectively to trauma. This text has
            its limits; the best resource we will ever have is each other and our
            reciprocity.
               The writers of this book conceptualize emotional resiliency as something to
            build up and work on collectively, to take inventory of, to ﬁnd respite in and
            something to call on as a set of guiding strengths and principles when
            responding to trauma. Our conceptions are informed by what we know of
            trauma, PTSD, PTSC and the characteristics of each, which is related in the
            following pages. We believe it is useful to ground our collective knowledge of
            trauma in its own particular conceptual and ideological history; integral to
            our purpose is an alternative to the widely popularized neoliberal notions of
            self-care that are as disempowering and isolating to us as they are reinforcing
            to the hegemonies of capital and state power. We aim to propagate resiliency
            as a methodology to counter the traumas weaponized by the various
            oppressive forces that divide and diminish us, thereby building our long-term
            capacity for rebellion against them.
            The Jane Addams Collective
              The Jane Addams Collective has seen diﬀerent iterations over the course of
            at least ﬁve years in New York City. Our membership has consisted of social
            workers, psychotherapists, and others rebelling against the hierarchical
            paradigms dominating discourse around mental health. Jane Addams was
            formed as a response to the need for emotional support in radical spaces, and
            has since launched a living and ongoing experiment in alternative care called
            Mutual Aid Self Therapy.
              Often, the common narrative of self-care commodiﬁes our emotional needs
            instead of satisfying them. In the medicalized ﬁeld of psychotherapy, one is
            subjected to a client-provider dynamic in which the tools and knowledge one
            might use to better oneself autonomously are made inaccessible. The
            therapist postures as if they know the cause of a person’s emotional tensions
            while monopolizing whatever knowledge they do hold, in order to establish
            their word as true and accurate and thereby instilling themselves as an
            authority in the patient’s mind.
              We ﬁnd that working among ourselves to change our undesirable emotional
            and behavioral patterns, in order to alleviate the suﬀering inﬂicted on us by

            oppressive forces, is a collective undertaking and strategic component of
            building our communities in opposition to power. We see working together to
            address our needs as an opportunity to make our community stronger, not just
            by helping each other with our own immediate or chronic problems, but by
            starting to trust each other with intimacy and vulnerability, as a way to say
            that the new society we hold in our hearts should not have shame around
            emotional honesty.
            Trauma
            Trauma & PTSD
            Deﬁnitions
               Trauma can be deﬁned as a psychologically signiﬁcant/impactful event that
            creates a rupture in a person’s sense of self, worldview, or view of the future.
            It can aﬀect a person’s sense of meaning and purpose in the world. It can be
            said that at the moment of trauma, the survivor is rendered helpless by
            overwhelming force.
               Acute trauma is often associated with a single event. Chronic trauma refers
            to traumatic events that are ongoing, long term, and recurrent. Psychological
            trauma can be described as a feeling of intense fear, helplessness, loss of
            control, and threat of annihilation. The experience of trauma is unique to each
            person and diﬀicult to measure; however, it can be helpful to name it in order
            to address and attempt to move past it.
            A Brief History
               The history of studying trauma has its roots in studies of hysteria, combat
            neuroses, and sexual violence. At the time, hysteria was used to pathologize
            women and has its roots in sexual trauma. Unbearable emotional reactions to
            traumatic events produced an altered state of consciousness, which was
            called hysteria then and would now be called dissociation. Professionals such
            as Freud stopped their studies of the origins of hysteria because continuing
            would have meant confronting certain realities about human nature, such as
            the capacity to severely abuse, and it became easier to dismiss recollections
            of abuse as hysterical fantasies. Women were stigmatized for being abused,
            and so much abuse remained hidden from public view as women were
            silenced by fear and shame, which allowed for further exploitation.
               Much of the original body of knowledge about traumatic disorders came
            from studying men who faced combat after the First World War. Therapy was
            originally called the “talking cure.” The concept of PTSD was ultimately born
            out of studying combat veterans, with the goal of ﬁxing them so they could
            return to combat. Some studies at that time judged the moral character of
            patients, viewing people as means and not ends.
               During the women’s liberation movement of the 1970s, consciousness

            raising groups began to form. Consciousness raising groups were similar to
            psychotherapy groups, but their purpose was to eﬀect social rather than
            individual change. The feminist movement redeﬁned rape as a crime of
            violence rather than a sexual act and introduced new language for
            understanding the impact of sexual assault. The ﬁrst public speak-out on rape
            took place in 1971, but rape reform legislation wasn’t implemented until the
            mid-1970s. The more responses to traumatic events were studied and
            women’s issues were given credence, the more it was found that responses to
            trauma were similar across groups. Once PTSD was legitimated following
            eﬀorts of combat veterans, it became clear that survivors of domestic and
            sexual violence experienced similar symptoms to survivors of war. PTSD was
            not added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual until 1980.
            Trauma and PTSD: Symptoms and Eﬀects
               Symptoms of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) may disrupt a person’s
            life and make it hard to continue with daily activities. Symptoms usually start
            soon after the traumatic event, but they may not happen until months or years
            later. They also may come and go over many years. Most people who go
            through a traumatic event have some symptoms at the beginning but don’t
            develop PTSD. If the symptoms last longer than 4 weeks, cause great distress,
            or interfere with work or home life, it may be PTSD.
               There are four types of PTSD symptoms:
               Intrusive reliving of the event. Memories of the traumatic event can
            come back at any time. You may feel the same emotions you did when the
            event took place. These memories may manifest in nightmares and ﬂashbacks.
               Avoidance. You may try to avoid situations or people that trigger memories
            of the traumatic event. You may even avoid talking or thinking about the
            event.
               Changes in beliefs and feelings. The way you think about yourself and
            others changes because of the trauma. This symptom has many aspects,
            including the following:

               - You may not have positive or loving feelings toward other people and
## may stay away from relationships.

               - You may forget about parts of the traumatic event or not be able to talk
## about them.

               - You may think the world is completely dangerous, and no one can be
## trusted.

              Hyperarousal. You may be jittery, or always alert and on the lookout for
            danger. You might suddenly become angry or irritable, have diﬀiculty
            sleeping, trouble concentrating, or be easily startled, for example.
              The unpredictable nature of violence can lead to hypervigilance. It as if time
            stops at the moment of trauma. Many traumatic memories lack verbal
            narrative and context; rather they are encoded in the form of vivid sensations
            and images. Initially an intrusive reliving of the traumatic event predominates

            (nightmares, ﬂashbacks), and the survivor remains in a highly agitated state,
            on the alert for new threats. Intrusive symptoms emerge most prominently in
            the ﬁrst few days or weeks following the traumatic event, abate to some
            degree within three to six months, and then attenuate slowly over time. While
            speciﬁc trauma symptoms seem to fade over time, they can be revived (even
            years after the event) by reminders of the original trauma. Traumatic events
            appear to recondition the human nervous system. The repetition of trauma
            ampliﬁes all symptoms of PTSD. Psychosomatic complaints result from
            chronic arousal of the automatic nervous system.
              Repeated trauma occurs when the survivor is a prisoner, unable to ﬂee, and
            under the control of the perpetrator (abusive families, sexual exploitation,
            prisons). Methods of psychological control are designed to instill terror and
            helplessness and to destroy the survivor’s sense of autonomy and sense of self
            in relation to others. Repeated trauma in adult life erodes the structure of the
            personality already formed, but repeated trauma in childhood forms and
            deforms the personality. The damage it causes can interfere with a child’s
            development of secure attachment relationships, cognitive abilities, aﬀect
            regulation, behavior regulation, self-concept, and biological and physical
            maturation, as well as increase the likelihood of dissociation.
              It also increases the likelihood of self-injury and suicidal behavior.
              There is a correlation between degree of experienced abuse and tendency
            to dissociate. A survivor may experience a numbing or trance-like state as a
            form of dissociation, as it may reduce their perception of pain during acute
            trauma. They are unable to control when they experience these altered states,
            which keep painful memories split from ordinary awareness. This is diﬀerent
            from a voluntary suppression of thoughts related to the traumatic event in an
            attempt to defend against overwhelming emotional states. These can serve a
            purpose in situations where the constant threat of danger is real, but once
            removed from that environment, they become maladaptive.
              These are some identiﬁably traumatic situations:

## • Vicarious or secondary trauma

## • Child abuse

## • Sexual violence

## • Domestic violence

## • Natural disasters

## • War

## • Community-related trauma, such as social pressure

## • Systemic or institutional violence and abuse

## • Generational and Intergenerational trauma

## • Medical-related trauma

## • Loss

              Traumatic events violate the autonomy of the person at the level of basic
            bodily integrity. They interfere with sense of self and often make survivors
            feel isolated from others and their communities. Traumatized people relive
            moments of trauma not only in thoughts and dreams, but in their actions.
            Reenactments may be an attempt to relive and master the overwhelming
            feelings of the traumatic event. Helplessness constitutes the essential insult of
            trauma, and restitution requires the restoration of a sense of eﬀicacy and
            power. It is said that what is produced is what a person needs to feel in order
            to repair the injury.
              Survivors are prone towards feeling guilty. Guilt may be understood as an
            attempt to draw some useful lesson from the traumatic event and to regain
            some sense of power and control. To imagine that one could have done better
            may be more tolerable than to face the reality of utter helplessness. Feelings
            of guilt are especially severe when the survivor has been a witness to the
            suﬀering or death of other people.
              Since neither the intrusive nor the numbing symptoms allow for integration
            of the traumatic event, the alternation between these two extreme states
            might be understood as an attempt to ﬁnd a satisfactory balance between the
            two. But balance is precisely what the traumatized person lacks. She ﬁnds
            herself caught between the extremes of amnesia or of reliving the trauma,
            between ﬂoods of intense, overwhelming feeling and arid states of no feeling
            at all, between irritable, impulsive action and complete inhibition of action.
            The instability produced by these periodic alterations further exacerbates the
            traumatized persons sense of unpredictability and helplessness. The dialectic
            of trauma is therefore potentially self-perpetuating.
              Traumatized individuals, particularly those who are traumatized in
            childhood and adolescence, are at increased risk for:

               - Social and behavioral problems, including, but not limited to:
                 relationship diﬀiculties, risky sexual behavior, and aggression.

               - Impaired psychological health throughout the lifespan, including, but not
                 limited to: PTSD, depression, substance use/abuse, and suicide attempts.
              Adverse childhood experiences are related to the onset of a range of
            psychological disorders as well:

               - Cognitive and academic problems, including, but not limited to: low IQ
                 and reading scores, delayed language and cognitive development, and
## poor academic performance.

               - Neuropsychological alterations involving areas of the brain that regulate
                 emotion, control of emotions, judgment, and problem solving, in addition
## to the stress response system.

               - Impaired physical health that can endure for decades, such as increased
                 risk of cancer, heart disease, liver disease, pulmonary disease,
## autoimmune disease, and obesity.

## • Higher use of mental health and medical services.

               - Increased rates of unemployment, poverty, and Medicaid usage.

## • Childhood mortality or early death.

              Additionally, adults who had four or more adverse childhood experiences
            were 7.3 times more likely to have at least one diagnosis from each of the
            following four types of disorders:

## • Mood

## • Anxiety

## • Impulse control

## • Substance abuse disorders

              Women are more likely to develop PTSD than men and are more likely to
            have chronic PTSD than men. When studying combat veterans, researchers
            found that the strongest protection against overwhelming terror was degree
            of relatedness between soldiers and comrades. Relationships and connections
            with others and to a larger sense of meaning are important in mitigating
            PTSD. It is important to normalize what survivors are experiencing in reaction
            to traumatic events so that there is an increased likelihood of rebuilding a
            sense of control and stronger, healthier relationships.
            Safety & Trauma
              If trauma results from perceiving a threat to one’s existence or the
            existence of another living being whom one cares about, then a necessary
            step in healing from trauma is securing a sense of safety from existential
            threats to oneself or others. These threats can be multifaceted and complex,
            given the complicated nature of modern life. Obstacles to safety can include
            but are not limited to: food insecurity, unsafe housing or lack of access to
            housing, lack of suﬀicient social support, emotional and/or physical abuse,
            direct physical violence, and self-destructive behavior patterns. Another term
            that may resonate better than ‘safe’ is ‘resourced’—as in how ‘well-resourced’
            one is, or how accessible needed resources are. Even though the initial
            traumatic event or situation may have only involved one kind of threat,
            threats in other areas can still re-traumatize an already traumatized person,
            because they aﬀect the person’s psychic sense of safety, the rupture of which
            was the initial cause of trauma.
              Planning for how to provide safety to oneself and others, and proving one’s
            ability to execute that plan, are important parts of trauma recovery for some
            people. As anarchists trying to heal our own or comrades’ trauma, it makes
            extra sense to create and maintain bonds of solidarity, given the importance of
            social support and material resources for one’s sense of safety. Moreover, we
            may ﬁnd the provision of safety to be challenged by factors emerging from
            our political lives—imprisonment, police violence, and other repression by the
7 of 20 10/19/25, 11:35 AM Mutual Aid, Trauma, and Resiliency https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-jane-addams-c...
            state all present real dangers that need to be reckoned with. One or more
            safety plan(s), as well as trusted comrades who can carry it/them out, may be
            helpful tools in dealing with these obstacles. While our activism and our
            antagonistic relationship with the state may present obstacles to safety, noncapitalistic connections founded on real solidarity with anarchist comrades
            and other communities can be strengths in this area. Mutual aid and
            solidarity networks can meet needs for safety by sharing, and increasing
            access to, resources.
              One implication of the relationship between safety and trauma is that,
            depending on one’s life circumstances (including the availability of social
            support, ﬁnancial security, food, housing, and self-defense), the most eﬀective
            strategy for trauma recovery may be to do no exploration of the traumatic
            memories at all. Preventing re-traumatization is a worthy goal in itself and at
            times is the best one can do given one’s circumstances. There is no shame in
            prudently waiting to explore traumatic memories until one judges that it is
            safe to do so—it is a necessary part of the healing process. In the words of
            trauma therapist Judith Herman: “This task [of establishing safety] takes
            precedence over all others, for no other therapeutic work can possibly
            succeed if safety has not been adequately secured. No other therapeutic work
            should even be attempted until a reasonable degree of safety has been
            achieved.” (Trauma and Recovery, ch. 8: “Safety”)
              For someone who is waiting to explore traumatic memories and working on
            accessing safety, the work of healing from trauma may resemble, to an
            outside observer, the work of self-care for non-traumatic mental health issues.
            The main diﬀerence at this point is the intention. Once safety is reliably
            attained, then the unearthing and reinterpreting of traumatic memories can
            proceed, with the risk of re-traumatization having been mitigated. Since
            healing from trauma is not a linear process, and the life circumstances that
            produce a sense of safety are ﬂuid and changing, revisiting the issue of safety
            on an ongoing, occasional, basis can be a helpful way to take care of oneself
            and others.
            Grounding Techniques
              Grounding techniques (also called “centering” or “healthy detachment”) can
            be very useful when we’re in distress. They work by focusing outward on the
            external world rather than inward towards the self, and they can be done at
            any time one is caught in emotional pain. Grounding techniques are very
            simple, but it’s recommended that they’re practiced frequently to be
            maximally eﬀective. Lisa. M Navajitis in Seeking Safety: a Treatment Manual
            for PTSD and Substance Abuse describes three types of grounding: mental,
            physical and soothing.
              Mental grounding includes describing your environment in detail using all
            your senses or describing an everyday activity in great detail. For imagining,
            use an image: for example, changing the TV channel to get to a better show.
            Think of a buﬀer between you and your pain.
              Physical grounding includes focusing on your breathing, noticing each
            inhale and exhale; noticing your body; touching various objects around you

            and noticing their textures, colors, materials, weight, and temperature.
              Soothing grounding includes saying a coping statement: for example, “I can
            handle this, this feeling will pass”; remembering a safe place and focusing on
            everything about that place including the colors, sounds, objects, and
            textures; picturing the people that you care about and the things you’re
            looking forward to.
              If you ﬁnd grounding doesn’t work, try to practice more often and for longer
            periods of time (20 to 30 minutes), or have others assist you if possible.
            PTSC: Post Traumatic Stressed Communities
              Traumas not only have the potentiality of causing lasting damage to
            individuals’ lives—they can also destroy political organizations, communities,
            and movements. Trauma is a normal part of resistance and communities
            should expect to experience various forms of traumas in the course of their
            work. Just as not all individuals that experience trauma develop debilitating
            chronic symptoms from the experience, not all political communities are
            damaged (in the long term) by trauma. PTSD is a term to describe the
            common negative symptoms of trauma on an individual; we are using PTSC
            similarly for communities. The negative eﬀects and life outcomes of those
            suﬀering the eﬀects of chronic trauma are well known and described; little
            attention has been given to groups. This section will help deﬁne some of the
            common negative eﬀects of chronic trauma on groups.
              Hyperarousal is one of the most common symptoms of PTSD (as described
            in an earlier section) and is also a common red ﬂag that a community might
            be suﬀering from the eﬀects of trauma. In a group setting, hyperarousal
            manifests itself in a constant search for threats. Often this takes the form of
            looking for and identifying “unsafe” individuals or groups of individuals.
            Snitch-jacketing and a search for inﬁltrators are the most common examples
            of how this plays out. Less dramatically, there is a reduction in recruitment of
            new membership as groups with PTSC became more wary of unknown
            individuals. This symptom can also create elaborate vouch symptoms that also
            reduce participation and highlight the suspect nature of one’s fellow
            participants. None of these things actually make the group feel more secure
            and thus it is why it is a symptom when it is a result of hyperarousal caused
            by trauma. Burnout is another common symptom of PTSC. Burnout is not
            always a result of PTSC, and individuals withdraw from groups for a variety of
            reasons that have nothing to do with trauma. However, a group that has not
            found a way to deal with trauma will also ﬁnd a heightened level of burnout
            among its participants. Stress is a powerful force in burnout, and unresolved
            trauma in a group can reliably infect participants with continual stress.
              Chronic trauma makes it diﬀicult to feel safe navigating the world for both
            individuals and groups; thus, this unsafe feeling leads to greater group
            isolation. Groups with PTSC often retreat from making coalitions and partners
            with other similarly aligned groups (especially if they have not suﬀered the
            same trauma). PTSC groups seek the security of limiting the world and
            retreating inside the shell of the familiar. They will often not take on new
            campaigns, projects, or coalitions. This can lead to groups feeling the need to
            go underground or work in a clandestine manner, separating themselves from
9 of 20 10/19/25, 11:35 AM Mutual Aid, Trauma, and Resiliency https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-jane-addams-c...
            allies and support. Inﬁghting is a common characteristic of chronic
            unresolved trauma in groups. The basic sense of trust and/or stability that is
            necessary for creating working alliances among diverse people is often
            compromised by trauma. When trust, understanding, and stability are
            destroyed, inﬁghting and drama are inevitable.
              Hopelessness is a symptom of PTSD and PTSC. Chronic trauma, through
            constant repetition and the removal of agency, critically diminishes hope and
            our ability to feel that our actions can positively contribute to our desired
            outcomes. It is diﬀicult enough for resistance groups to keep motivated, and
            this symptom can seriously sap the energy or even the motivation to continue
            diﬀicult political work. These are not the only symptoms of PTSC but some of
            the most common. They, like the individual symptoms of PTSD, are reinforcing
            symptoms: inﬁghting can lead to greater burnout while hyperarousal can lead
            to greater political isolation and so forth. Counter-insurgency manuals have
            known for decades that if they can create traumatized communities, they can
            be rendered ineﬀective without directly taking them on. The symptoms of
            PTSC are so damaging they can quickly unravel years of work and numerous
            successes in a very short period of time. While avoiding our enemies from
            inﬂicting trauma on our movements is often out of our hands, we can take
            steps to reduce the likelihood of PTSC from destroying our communities.
            Resiliency
            Introduction to Resiliency
              Resiliency is a psychological concept that describes a collection of traits
            that enable a person to experience trauma without it resulting in PTSD.
            Currently, psychologists are attempting to get a better picture of resiliency by
            looking at people who have experienced trauma that either resulted in PTSD
            or didn’t, and trying to retrospectively examine individual and community
            traits for each group. Though many on this resulting list of traits that may
            contribute to a uniﬁed “resiliency” would be hard to cultivate intentionally, we
            believe the value of this list is to remind us that we as individuals,
            communities, friend groups, and families already possess some or many of
            these traits. Intentionally activating them in creative and dynamic ways after
            a traumatic event could help ward oﬀ long-term eﬀects of PTSD.

            Resiliency: Weapon of the Rebel
              Whether the rebel employs paciﬁst or more active resistance tools, she can
            expect to encounter trauma either directly or indirectly. Creating traumatic
            experiences is a favorite and indispensable weapon of any power structure,
            and the more unjust the power structure the greater its reliance on trauma
            for social control. In fact, without trauma there would be little to stop power
            structures from being dismantled by rebels. Trauma is both a relatively cheap
11 of 20 10/19/25, 11:35 AM Mutual Aid, Trauma, and Resiliency https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-jane-addams-c...
            and eﬀective tool for maintaining tyrannical systems, whether they are
            familial or national. It is not the trauma per se that is eﬀective (often times it
            is not)—it is the corollaries (fear, shame and debilitating post-trauma injuries)
            of trauma that make it the go-to of tyrants everywhere, from the halls of
            governments to our dinner tables. Individuals, groups, organizations, and
            whole communities can be neutralized by the eﬀects of traumatizing events
            orchestrated by oppositional forces. This is the logic of both the terrorist and
            the police interrogator. Reading manuals of Al Qaeda, FBI, Yakuza or US Field
            Army handbooks, one is not only struck by how blatantly trauma is
            weaponized, but also by how similar its uses are between these groups.
              For example, as a tool, the wheel developed in many diﬀerent regions
            independently because it was cheap and highly eﬀective. So is the systemic
            use of trauma by tyrannical forces. Rebels who do not seek out and develop
            counter-measures to trauma will always be defenseless against these powerful
            and cheap weapons of oppression. The induction of post-traumatic disabilities
            in rebel communities is particularly insidious and debilitating to the limited
            structural capacity of most resistance movements. “A dead soldier removes
            one musket from the battle line, while a wounded soldier has the potential to
            remove two, three or four,” Napoleon said, explaining the military value of
            using debilitating (though often not fatal) grapeshot pellets in cannons.
            Injuries require the opposing force to devote resources and energy to the
            injured. The same is true of mental injuries inﬂicted on us. The maimed
            (mentally or physically) can serve as daily and immediate reminders of the
            power of our oppressors and the dangers of rebellion.
              This is all pretty bleak, but there is a way to build resiliency to render
            trauma ineﬀective or less eﬀective in stopping a resistance. Resiliency can do
            far more than dampen the eﬀects of trauma—it can actually make it
            counterproductive for our oppressors. In a sense, resiliency of one group
            protects even those individuals or groups that have not developed resiliency
            by making the weapon of trauma less eﬀective. If tyrants see that trauma is
            no longer eﬀective, they will stop using it so liberally on others. If the use of
            trauma against resilient targets is actually counterproductive and strengthens
            the rebel or oppressed forces, this seriously changes the cost beneﬁt analysis
            of the use of trauma by others. This would reduce the prevalence of the use of
            this weapon dramatically.
              To develop, utilize and share resiliency in individuals, groups, and
            communities, we must ﬁrst understand what it is/isn’t and how it works. The
            two most common deﬁnitions of resiliency: the capacity to recover quickly
            from diﬀiculties; the ability of a substance or object to spring back into shape;
            elasticity. It is obvious rebels and resistance movements should expect to have
            diﬀiculties inﬂicted upon them by their antagonists, and what should be just
            as obvious is that we should seek to rebound as quickly as possible and limit
            the contagion and ongoing eﬀects. The more resilient a movement is, the
            more attractive it will be to those outside of it that feel threatened by the
            current power structures. It will also cause some division inside the power
            structure, as it has to weigh the beneﬁts or eﬀectiveness of inﬂicting trauma
            versus the backlash (resilience). If the eﬀectiveness of trauma is
            demonstrably shown to be less eﬀective, the power structure’s own control
            over its own participants comes into play, which can seriously weaken power
12 of 20 10/19/25, 11:35 AM Mutual Aid, Trauma, and Resiliency https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-jane-addams-c...
            structures. Building mental resiliency has often been likened to self-defense,
            but it is more than just that. Well-developed resiliency in a movement/
            community can be useful for recruiting those who are feeling anxious or
            scared in their current situation (which may or may not having anything to do
            with the power structure you are ﬁghting against). For example, in Rojava,
            the Kurdish revolutionary forces in Northern Syria received a lot of recruits
            from people ﬂeeing forced marriages and domestic abuse, members of
            oppressed minority groups, etc. In addition to recruitment, resiliency can
            actually destabilize the opposing forces. Most actors in power structures
            (oﬀicers, soldiers, bureaucrats, etc.) may not actually beneﬁt from the
            oppression but side with the oppressors because of anxiety or fear of the
            outcomes of not being part of the structure. Resilient rebels and movements
            can weaken the ties of those not directly reaping the beneﬁts of the
            oppression, requiring even more resources for the enemy to recruit and retain
            their own participants.
               Resiliency is not a shield for eliminating traumatic events but a way to make
            it costly for our enemies to use trauma for diminishing returns. It does this by
            disarming the eﬀects of shame, fear, guilt, hopelessness, social disruption,
            and isolation—the most powerful lasting eﬀects of trauma for eliminating
            political action. A combination of psychological and community-based
            resiliency can eliminate these long-term eﬀects of induced trauma. Trauma
            begets more trauma—for example, one may initially need powerful artillery
            shells to induce paralyzation, confusion, and fear in an individual. However,
            should the individual lack resiliency, the same reactions can be subsequently
            reproduced with something as simple as the sound of a car backﬁre. The
            reverse is true with resiliency—each trauma requires greater eﬀort to achieve
            the same eﬀect.
               If trauma has become the currency of modern day repression, then
            resiliency is the weapon of the rebels.
            Planning for Stress: Case History
              In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chicago’s ACT UP created a working
            group they called the Committee for Sustainable Activity & Care (CSAC).
            CSAC realized that the continued stress of activism along with the trauma of
            the AIDS epidemic and the violence of the police was taking a toll on the
            organization. They noticed not only a greater degree of burnout from core
            organizers but also greater intergroup conﬂict despite numerous successes.
            CSAC was made up of mental health workers and laypeople and was charged
            with ways of reducing stress and post-traumatic dysfunction inside ACT UP
            Chicago. They only existed for a short period (less than a year) but helped
            usher in some innovative techniques to reduce the negative eﬀects of trauma
            that were used by ACT UP chapters not only in Chicago but other cities.
            Removing Shame
              ACT UP spent a lot of energy on reducing stigma and shame for those with
            AIDS, HIV and homosexuality in general. CSAC hosted a monthly “Free Talk
13 of 20 10/19/25, 11:35 AM Mutual Aid, Trauma, and Resiliency https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-jane-addams-c...
            series” where people from the community could come and talk about their
            stresses with support and without judgement. This was particularly useful for
            caregivers who provided support to those dying of AIDS. It was similarly
            designed to the 1970s feminist consciousness raising groups in that there was
            no real agenda and everyone could talk and share in a safe environment.
              ACT UP also had veterans of various actions speak frankly about their
            experiences during actions, both the good and bad feelings. This helped
            normalize the experiences of people who were afraid, stressed, or
            traumatized by police. The stories helped reduce the shame common to these
            feelings during an action. ACT UP also brought in veterans of other
            movements like the civil rights, environmental and anti-war movements to
            speak about their experiences and feelings. This normalized a wide array of
            emotional responses to stressful situations on the street during high-risk
            actions.
            Breaking Isolation
              ACT UP chapters were excellent at keeping its members connected even
            before the age of cell phones, internet, and social media. CSAC created a
            number of interventions to speciﬁcally reduce the common isolation of those
            traumatized. The ﬁrst was “Aﬀirmation Parties” that were pre-planned to
            occur within 2-3 days after a big action. It was expected that participants of
            the action and supports would attend the party, and there was much planning
            and advertising involved. No matter the success of the action, individuals
            would get up and say what it meant to them to be part of it, thus reconnecting
            the solidarity on the street with after the action in a social setting with drinks,
            music, and dance. Often tokens (ﬂowers, coins like AA, etc.) of thanks would
            be given to participants. There would be a reading of the names of those in
            their community who had died of AIDS, and then the party would start.
            Additionally, after an action, CSAC members would reach out by phone, and
            sometimes visit, activists involved in the protest. This allowed the participants
            to know there was a community that was looking out for them.
              Finally, participants that faced traumatic situations (police abuse, arrest, or
            recent death of a friend from AIDS) would be invited to speak as a “veteran”
            at the next organizing meeting. This changed their status from isolated victim
            to appreciated and connected veteran with experiences to share with the
            group. It allowed the individual to “organize” their feelings and ﬁnd value and
            lessons in them to share. This reduces the eﬀect of learned helplessness while
            creating context for the experiences.
            Connection to the Struggle
              SCAC did a lot to emphasis a strong connection to the struggle, which
            would reduce stress by contextualizing the diﬀiculties and hardships of the
            struggle. It was common for a name and photo of a person from the
            community who had died of AIDS to be given to each participant before an
            action to keep in their pocket. Often they would give that person’s name if
            they were arrested. This simple thing kept people connected to why they were
14 of 20 10/19/25, 11:35 AM Mutual Aid, Trauma, and Resiliency https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-jane-addams-c...
            on the streets in the ﬁrst place.
              ACT UP also often met up prior to an action for speeches and music as a
            sort of pep rally before going together to the action. This created a sense of
            community that helped inoculate individuals from feeling vulnerable and
            alone.
              SCAC also created a referral base of sympathetic mental health providers
            for those that wanted that and would often escort people to their ﬁrst
            meetings, waiting with them in the waiting room and being there when the
            session was done. This simple act was a powerful example of genuine support.
              ACT UP used a variety of techniques to reduce the emotional cost of stress
            and trauma that could be expected in their struggle. These techniques, while
            highly intentional, required very little in the way of resources or specialized
            skills. It created powerful ways to build a resilient radical culture that was
            able to sustain for many years despite massive obstacles. ACT UP drew upon
            the interventions of previous movements and activists just as we will need to
            develop our own responses to trauma and stress to create a truly resilient
            resistance.
            Building Resiliency
              Building resiliency isn’t a one-size-ﬁts-all process, and we are all unique
            selves, but anarchists have some advantages over the average person in
            building up our ability to withstand traumatic events. The collaborative and
            ongoing nature of building resiliency dovetails nicely with the organizing
            work many of us are already doing, but only if we take an intentional and
            active approach towards becoming resilient.
              In the long run, dealing with traumatic events will be easier if you have a
            system of support and mutual aid that can help deal with the aftershocks, but
            regardless of what kind of network of support you have, it’s vital to build
            resiliency on your own.
            Building Individual Resiliency
              Dealing with traumatic events alone is extremely diﬀicult, so whether or not
            you have people you organize with, it’s important to build resiliency. In the
            midst of a traumatic event, it can be hard to remember what to do. Before
            that moment, identify your own social and personal resources to aid in coping
            with trauma. Make a list of people you can contact in a crisis, and have a plan.
            Think about the situations you’re going into, and try to think about them
            tactically. Knowing what to expect, being prepared for it, and learning to think
            about potentially traumatic situations in a tactical way builds one’s ability to
            look at problems from the outside and take the distance necessary to deal
            with them eﬀectively.
              The potential of trauma is a part of all of our lives. This is an ongoing
            process which requires work on ourselves and on the groups we organize in.
            Before an event, and on an ongoing basis, become more aware of your own
            responses to events and your own warning signs. Being able to recognize
            changes in how your body feels before or during stressful situations makes a

            huge diﬀerence. During stressful times, it’s also good to continue checking in
            with yourself to see if there are any warning signs. Over time this knowledge
            of yourself and consistent checking in with your physical sensations also helps
            build up your ability to deal with stressful situations in general. It is easier to
            prepare for a storm you know is coming.
              When you see those warning signs ﬂaring up, it’s important to engage in
            active coping styles rather than avoidant ones. The coping skills we lean on
            most heavily in our day to day lives are the same ones we’ll fall back on in a
            crisis. When thinking about which methods you can use to cope with
            traumatic events, focus on active coping skills rather than avoidant ones. In
            the moment, getting away from a distressing situation or a distressing mental
            experience can be a relief, but for dealing with the long term implications of
            trauma, isolating yourself, using substances to numb yourself, or avoiding all
            situations that resemble the trauma you experienced will not allow you to
            fully deal with the negative experiences and their aftereﬀects. To build a
            longer lasting ability to deal with psychological distress, it is better to focus
            on active coping skills, which have a material impact on your well being, and
            that help increase your political and social engagement.
              Even if you’re on your own, your ability to deal with traumatic events will be
            better if you are actively engaged in some form of mutual aid. The continued
            pursuit of mutual aid has an eﬀect on one’s social condition and also
            inﬂuences one’s sense of self and purpose. Knowing that you have an impact
            on the world in a positive sense, building relationships with people, and doing
            something with purpose all help create the feelings of strength and safety
            which help us withstand trauma.
            Group Resiliency
              The people you organize with and the people you fuck shit up with might be
            doing some of these things already, but explicitly thinking about and
            addressing the potential psychological eﬀects of an action and the
            psychological needs of your crew are both vitally important for helping steel
            ourselves against trauma.
              Whether before a speciﬁc action, or as part of an ongoing process of
            building mutual aid and support, it’s important to have a plan for supporting
            comrades if something traumatic happens. With your comrades (and close
            friends for that matter) you should know some basic things: who would they
            call if they’re having diﬀiculty coping in the moment, what kinds of
            experiences might make some events more diﬀicult for them, and what kinds
            of things help them cope with diﬀicult emotions. Even if you never have to use
            this information, it helps build a sense of safety and support in your group.
            Having people around you who know how to help you in a moment of crisis
            doesn’t just help build your ability to deal with trauma in the future, it helps
            build the collective resiliency and social bonds between the people you
            organize or act with.
              It’s also helpful to have a plan of action and a clear view of the risks of
            whatever actions you’re undertaking. Our reactions to trauma in the long
            term are often bound to our expectations of the world and the situation. It’s
            important to know what you’re getting into: going to a march with a sign is

            diﬀerent than joining a black bloc. When you’re preparing for any action,
            knowing what kinds of things might happen and what the risks are is helpful
            for reducing the aﬀect of trauma on you. Even without the beneﬁt of building
            resiliency, that process of analysis and tactical thinking helps groups of
            people take eﬀective action, and improves our ability to succeed in some of
            our political goals.
              This planning and strategic thinking are necessary parts of organizing
            eﬀectively, and when it comes to resiliency, thinking tactically about problems
            has an eﬀect on your ability to detach and conceptualize problems. We of
            course can’t control the situations we enter, but we can certainly create more
            realistic expectations and develop skills to make ourselves more eﬀective and
            less aﬀected.
              Planning for speciﬁc events isn’t enough though. After traumatic events it’s
            necessary to respond collaboratively to these events with direct action, both
            in the form of mutual aid and resistance. When something traumatic has
            happened to people in your group, check in with them, set up some methods
            for them to get support if they need it, and if possible, take action against
            those causing the trauma. Being part of direct action and mutual aid creates a
            sense of eﬀicacy and ability that makes dealing with trauma easier. Our sense
            of self and purpose, as well as the sense that we are supported by people who
            care what happens to us, are vitally important to helping deal with trauma
            and to living up to a core part of our political project.
            Guiding Questions
              Part of countering potential trauma and building resiliency is cultivating a
            practice of emotional knowledge and preparedness. Trauma is exacerbated by
            isolation and distance. We can see this reenacted in neoliberal notions of selfcare, which situate care as a private, individual responsibility.
              What if we included emotional and psychological preparedness in action
            planning the same way we do physical and tactical preparedness? How can
            we better care for ourselves and each other? To that end, we’ve come up with
            a list of potential questions for individuals, friends, and aﬀinity groups to aid
            in facilitating discussion around countering trauma and building individual
            and community resiliency.
              The ﬁrst set of questions is focused on group planning and decision-making.
            These questions can help aﬀinity groups or friends make group agreements
            around emotional and psychological preparedness and help facilitate a shared
            understanding of community care.
              The second set of questions is focused on individual experience and needs.
            The goal of these questions is not only to increase self-knowledge, but to give
            your friends and comrades tools to support you in the case of a traumatic
            event, and to give you the tools to support them. Responses to trauma can
            vary, so what works for you might not work for someone else. It can be helpful
            to have an idea of your friends’ and comrades’ needs in advance rather than
            trying to guess in a moment of crisis. It is also sometimes diﬀicult for
            individuals to remember or voice their needs in the immediate aftermath of a
            traumatic event. Having a trusted friend or comrade equipped with that

            knowledge can go a long way in helping with immediate coping and building
            resiliency. Lastly, having open conversations around mental health and trauma
            can counter isolation and feelings of shame, both of which feed traumatization
            and get in the way of recovery and building resiliency.
              These questions are only meant as a jumping oﬀ point to help start a
            conversation. You do not need to answer any questions you do not want to
            answer or do not know how to answer, and we very much encourage you to
            add or disregard any questions as you see ﬁt. Additionally, this is not meant to
            be a singular discussion, but part of building a practice of emotional
            knowledge and preparedness. These are not easy topics to discuss, so please
            take care to stop, take a break, or resume as necessary. Let’s be gentle with
            ourselves, and each other.
            Group Questions
               1. What can each of us contribute in terms of support at an action? (e.g. I
                  can talk to someone if they’re having a panic attack; I can make sure our
## group stays hydrated; etc.)

               2. Can we create diﬀerent roles for people in action planning that take into
## account their past experiences and triggers?

               3. Do we want to have signals/safe words for triggers that we can use
                  during an action? (e.g. green=feeling ﬁne, yellow=keep an eye out for
## me, red=need to take a break/leave)

               4. Do we want to bring a mental health ﬁrst aid kit/s to an action? What

## remedies, shock blanket, etc.)

               5. Do we want to choose a date after an action to meet up for a check-in
                  about emotional wellness? Do we want to do this regardless of whether
## or not anything goes down?

               6. How can we best support each other in the case of a traumatic event?
                  What kind of activities can we plan that might be useful? (e.g. group
## dinners, support groups, etc.)

               7. In the case of a traumatic event, would we want support from other
                  comrades who weren’t present? What would we want that support to
## look like? How can we communicate this?

               8. What boundaries can we put in place in order to avoid overload/burnout
## for supporters?

               9. What mental health resources are available to us should we need them?
