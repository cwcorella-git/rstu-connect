## Overview of criminal justice system
## The problem — the illusion
                Causes for the discriminatory eﬀects of the criminal justice system
## A new way forward — a restorative approach to justice
## Conclusion

              This paper is a critique of how the state, the legal system, and the criminal
            justice system function in American society, and calls for an anarchist
            approach to how society should be organized that will remove the oppressive
            frameworks we currently live under.
              To support my arguments, I will ﬁrst provide an overview of how the
            criminal justice system works. From there I will oﬀer an analysis on why the
            criminal justice system is ﬂawed, and the racially discriminatory eﬀect it has
            had on society. I will then discuss why the disproportionate number of
            minorities found in prison and impoverished in this country is directly tied to
            the contemporary ruling interests that were preserved by the U.S.
            Constitution. Showing that the system is inherently discriminatory, I propose
            an alternative method for viewing society through anarchism. I will spend
            time debunking myths regarding anarchism and explaining why it is a viable
            ideology. In the end, I will propose a restorative justice approach to criminal
            justice that requires neither the state nor the legal system.
            Overview of criminal justice system
              In theory, the function of the legal system, and the state is to provide a
            structure that creates an environment for society that protects individual and
            collective freedom. The intention of the legal system then, is to provide an
            objective set of rules for governing conduct and maintaining order in society.
            In order to cover all potential conﬂicts, the law is divided into two forms: (1)
            civil law, which are rules and regulations that decide transactions and
            grievances between individuals; and (2) criminal law, which are rules
            concerned with actions deemed dangerous or harmful to society as a whole,
            and are prosecuted by the state.
              Relevant to this paper, the criminal justice system is the method by which
1 of 18 10/9/25, 2:02 AM An Anarchist Theory of Criminal Justice https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coy-mckinney-an-...
            society deals with individuals who violate criminal laws. It is the means for
            society to “enforce the standards of conduct necessary to protect individuals
            and the community.”[1] This system is composed of three parts: (1) police
            enforcement of the law; (2) adjudication of potential violations; and (3)
            punishment/rehabilitation for criminal acts.
              The state authorizes police oﬀicers to enforce the law and maintain order.
            This permission allows the police to arrest individuals, and use deadly force
            when the circumstances permit. Since police oﬀicers are allowed to use their
            discretion in determining when there has been a violation of the law, and
            when to use deadly force, they are trained to be capable of assessing the
            situations they ﬁnd themselves in, and acting accordingly.
              As a check on the power given to police oﬀicers, state prosecutors are
            responsible for determining whether the charges have substance, and if the
            individual’s case should go to trial. In the words of Michelle Alexander, the
            prosecutor has the most power of any other criminal justice oﬀicial, and is the
            person that “holds the key to the jailhouse door.”[2] This adds a special
            responsibility for prosecutors, according to Chief Judge, Isaac Christiancy:
              The prosecuting oﬀicer represents the public interest, which can never be
            promoted by the conviction of the innocent. His object like that of the court
            should be simply justice; and he has no right to sacriﬁce this to any pride of
            professional success. And however strong may be his belief of the prisoner’s
            guilt, he must remember that though unfair means may happen to result in
            doing justice to the prisoner in the particular case yet justice so attained is
            unjust and dangerous to the whole community.[3]
              If a prosecutor determines there is enough evidence for trial, the individual
            will be charged with committing a crime.
              At trial, the adversarial system is used. This means the prosecutor will
            present evidence, in addition to arguments, explaining why the defendant is
            guilty of the alleged crime(s), and the defendant’s attorney, who is either
            appointed by the state or chosen independently, will do the same, except
            explaining why the defendant is not guilty. All this is presented before a judge,
            and sometimes a jury, who are regarded as objective third parties, and are
            responsible for determining the guilt of the defendant.
              If an individual is convicted of a crime, they enter into the custody of the
            correctional authorities. An example of the stated role correctional authorities
            and prisons play in the criminal justice system is exempliﬁed by the Federal
            Bureau of Prisons, which “protects society by conﬁning oﬀenders in the
            controlled environments of prisons and community-based facilities that are
            safe, humane, cost-eﬀicient, and appropriately secure, and that provide work
            and other self-improvement opportunities to assist oﬀenders in becoming lawabiding citizens.”[4] Prisoners can receive medical, educational, religious, and
            career assistance to achieve the stated ediﬁcation goals. Prisoners can be
            released before fulﬁlling their required time in prison by being placed on
            parole, which means they are released back into society with certain
            restrictions on their freedom. Ultimately, the objective of the correctional
            authorities and prisons is to protect society from criminals, while also
            providing rehabilitation to them so that they leave prison better than when
            they entered.
              In its entirety, the criminal justice system is structured to deliver justice in a

            fair manner that upholds the ideals America holds for itself.
            The problem — the illusion
              Despite the stated intent of the criminal justice system, there are clear,
            systemic problems with how it functions that not only call its existence into
            question, but also the legal system that produced it as well. At the core of the
            problem is the fact that “justice” is determined by the state, and not the
            individuals involved. Worsening this is the fact that the origin of the state was
            built on discriminatory ideals. This has resulted in a criminal justice system
            that does not serve the people, but works to maintain oppressive and
            discriminatory, governmental authority.
              The victims and alleged oﬀenders have little, to no, say in the determination
            of justice throughout the criminal process. The state replaces the actual
            victim as the injured party for trial, and seeks justice based on its own
            standards. Defendants are advised to remain silent, and to allow their
            attorney to do most of the speaking for them. In describing this phenomenon,
            Alexandra Natapoﬀ, writes:

## The United States’s criminal justice system is shaped by a
                  fundamental absence: Criminal defendants rarely speak. From the
                  ﬁrst Miranda warnings through trial until sentencing, defendants
                  are constantly encouraged to be quiet and to let their lawyers do the
                  talking. And most do. Over ninety-ﬁve percent never go to trial, only
                  half of those who do testify, and some defendants do not even speak
                  at their own sentencings. As a result, in millions of criminal cases
                  often involving hours of verbal negotiations and dozens of pages of
                  transcripts, the typical defendant may say almost nothing to anyone
                  but his or her own attorney.[5] [...]
                  Defendant silence also has systemic implications for the integrity of
                  the justice process. In our democracy, individual speech has
                  historically been seen as an antidote to governmental overreaching.
                  Criminal defendant speech is perhaps the quintessential example of
                  the individual defending his or her life and liberty against the state.
                  Yet silent defendants rarely express themselves directly to the
                  government oﬀicial deciding their fate, be it judge or prosecutor,
                  and are often punished more harshly when they do. The justice
                  system assumes that conversations between counsel and clients,
                  and counsel’s own speech on behalf of clients, fulﬁll the personal
## needs of defendants as well as systemic requirements that
                  defendants be “heard.” Yet most defense counsel are overworked,
                  appointed counsel with insuﬀicient time to spend communicating
                  with their clients or fully exploring their clients’ personal stories.[6]
              Together, the practice of “representation” does not form an honest quest for
            justice, since it silences the only individuals that are truly capable of
            determining it.
              Although America’s legal system has determined that justice is most
3 of 18 10/9/25, 2:02 AM An Anarchist Theory of Criminal Justice https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coy-mckinney-an-...
            eﬀectively administered through the adversarial system, the reality of the
            process shows that this is a contrived conclusion. The adversarial system
            relies on prosecutors to “do justice,” and for defense attorneys to be “zealous
            advocates” for their clients, relying on both sides to present their strongest
            arguments, so that a third-party trier of fact can make the best decision.[7]
            This system relies on justice being equated with victory, which encourages
            both sides to be as uncooperative as possible with each other.
              In living up to their roles as zealous advocates for their clients, and
            encouraged by the adversarial system, defense attorneys can employ a
            number of tactics to win cases, that do not help the trier of fact make an
            informed decision. In his essay outlining the problems with these tactics,
            labeled “aggressive defense,” William H. Simon, provides a few troublesome
            examples:
                  Defense lawyers sometimes have opportunities to draw out and
                  delay cases, for instance, by deliberately arranging their schedules
                  to require repeated continuances. This can have the advantage of
                  exhausting prosecution witnesses and eroding their memories.
                  Defense lawyers are sometimes asked to present perjured testimony
                  by defendants. They sometimes ﬁnd they can beneﬁt their clients by
                  impeaching the testimony of prosecution witnesses they know to be
                  truthful. And they sometimes can gain advantage by arguing to the
                  jury that the evidence supports factual inferences they know to be
                  untrue. [...]
                  Lawyers occasionally ﬁnd it advantageous to disclose or threaten to
                  disclose information that they know does not contribute to informed
                  determination on the merits because such disclosure injures the
                  prosecution or witnesses.[8]
              While these tactics are permissible, each exempliﬁes how the adversarial
            system promotes the goals of the individual defendant over that of overall
            justice.
              Prosecutors are also encouraged by the adversarial system to give
            precedence to winning rather than obtaining actual justice. As a
            representative of the state, prosecutors must be conscious of how the public
            perceives their decisions. To ensure this, almost everywhere in America,
            (except Alaska, Connecticut, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia) the job
            of chief prosecutor is determined by an election.[9] To secure election, or
            reelection, prosecutors often campaign on how “tough” they are on crime,
            something that is usually demonstrated by the number of convictions a
            prosecutor has made. This equates convictions with justice, which
            consequently, creates an imbalance in the pursuit of justice, as it implies
            justice lies on the side of the prosecutor, by default, and not the defendant. In
            arguing that judges should not be elected, Justice John Paul Stevens said, “A
            campaign promise to ‘be tough on crime,’ or to ‘enforce the death penalty,’ is
            evidence of bias that should disqualify a [judicial] candidate from sitting in
            criminal cases.”[10] The same argument can be made for prosecutors as well.
            Thus, in order to show proﬁciency, prosecutors are often encouraged to
4 of 18 10/9/25, 2:02 AM An Anarchist Theory of Criminal Justice https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coy-mckinney-an-...
            convict individuals. However, the argument that convictions equal justice is a
            fallacy. If this were true, the rate of recidivism would be decreasing, yet it is
            increasing. According to a 2006 report released by the bipartisan Commission
            on Safety and Abuse in America’s Prisons, within three years of their release,
            67% of former prisoners are rearrested and 52% are re-incarcerated.[11]
              Assisting the “convictions = justice” belief are economic incentives that
            permit individuals and corporations to proﬁt from the number of prisoners a
            jail has. This is commonly referred to as the “private prison-industrial
            complex.” Between 1999 and 2010, the use of private prisons increased by
            40% at the state level, and by 784% in the federal prison system.[12] This rise
            correlates with an increase in revenues as well: Corrections Corporation of
            America and the GEO Group, the two largest private prison companies, made
            over $2.9 billion combined in 2010.[13] Explaining how these proﬁts have been
            spent, the Justice Policy Institute states, “[a]s revenues of private prison
            companies have grown over the past decade, the companies have had more
            resources with which to build political power, and they have used this power
            to promote policies that lead to higher rates of incarceration.”[14] Thus, a
            cycle exists where private prison facilities inﬂuence the criminal justice
            system through political and economic means, encouraging the ﬂawed belief
            that convictions equal justice.
              The conﬂuence of economic and political motives for obtaining more
            convictions has had tremendously negative eﬀects on society, and has helped
            usher in a period of “mass incarceration.” According to the International
            Centre for Prison Studies, the United States has the highest incarceration
            rate per 100,000 people of the national population, than any other country in
            the world.[15] A New York Times article described the situation succinctly,
            “[t]he United States has less than 5 percent of the world’s population. But it
            has almost a quarter of the world’s prisoners.”[16]
              Furthermore, this period of mass incarceration has illuminated the racist
            character of America’s legal system. According to the Bureau of Justice
            Statistics, as of December 31, 2010, state and federal correctional authorities
            had jurisdiction over 1,612,395 prisoners, while a total of 7.1 million people
            were under the supervision of adult correctional authorities.[17] Of the 1.6
            million prisoners, 588,000 identiﬁed as Black, and 345,900 identiﬁed as
            Hispanic, representing 36% and 21%, respectively, of the prison population.
            [18] This is alarming since, according to the 2010 U.S. Census, Blacks make up
            12.6% of the American population, and Hispanics constitute another 16.3% of
            the population.[19] Making the imbalance clearer, the estimated number of
            inmates held in custody in local, state, or federal prisons per 100,000 U.S.
            citizens, for Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites, respectively, is the following:
            4,607; 1,908; and 769.[20] This means Blacks are nearly 6 times as likely as
            Whites to be in prison. Paul Butler writes:

## Imagine a country in which more than half of the young male
                  citizens [referring to Blacks] are under the supervision of the
                  criminal justice system, either awaiting trial, in prison, or on
                  probation or parole. Imagine a country in which two-thirds of the
                  men can anticipate being arrested before they reach age thirty.
                  Imagine a country in which there are more young men in prison

                  than in college.[21]
              The racial disparity is also present in death penalty cases. According to the
            Equal Justice Initiative, “[m]ore than half of the over 3300 people on death
            row nationwide are people of color; nearly 42% are African American.
            Prominent researchers have demonstrated that a defendant is more likely to
            get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black.”[22] And
            according to Amnesty International, a 1990 report by the non-partisan U.S.
            General Accounting Oﬀice found, “a pattern of evidence indicating racial
            disparities in the charging, sentencing, and imposition of the death
            penalty.”[23] As a result, the eﬀect of criminal laws, their enforcement and
            prosecution, has disproportionately placed more Blacks and Hispanics in jail
            than in the nation’s history.
            Causes for the discriminatory eﬀects of the criminal
            justice system
              The disproportionate number of racial minorities involved in America’s
            criminal justice system is not by chance, but intent, as it is a consequence of
            the racist and classist interests the U.S. constitution was designed to protect.
            Starting in the mid-15th century, after the violent acquisition of land belonging
            to long-established indigenous communities, Americans and Europeans
            engaged in the cruel transportation of over 11 million Africans for over 450
            years.[24] The African slave trade helped build America into one of the most
            powerful countries in the world, but also created a patriarchal society that
            reiﬁed racial discrimination by the creation of racial identities. These racial
            identities were used by the rich, White elites to create artiﬁcial divisions
            amongst the masses to pit them against each other, and not their rulers. The
            Populist leader from Georgia, Tom Watson, in calling for racial unity, said:
                  You are kept apart that you may be separately ﬂeeced of your
                  earnings. You are made to hate each other because upon that hatred
                  is rested the keystone of the arch of ﬁnancial despotism which
                  enslaves you both. You are deceived and blinded that you may not
                  see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system which
                  beggars both.[25]
              The rich, white men that had obtained economic and political power
            throughout the colonies utilized the opportunity the Constitutional Convention
            provided to ensure their power was maintained with the formation of the new
            country. Writing about the ﬁndings of fellow historian Charles A. Beard,
            Howard Zinn writes:
                  Beard applied this general idea [that the rich must either control
## the government directly, or control the laws by which the
                  government operates] to the Constitution, by studying the economic
                  backgrounds and political ideas of the ﬁfty-ﬁve men who gathered in
                  Philadelphia in 1787 to draw up the Constitution. He found that a
                  majority of them were lawyers by profession, that most of them
6 of 18 10/9/25, 2:02 AM An Anarchist Theory of Criminal Justice https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coy-mckinney-an-...
                  were men of wealth, in land, slaves, manufacturing, or shipping,
                  that half of them had money loaned out at interest, and that 40 of
                  the 55 held government bonds, according to the records of the
## Treasury Department.

                  Thus Beard found that most of the makers of the Constitution had
                  some direct economic interest in establishing a strong federal
                  government: the manufacturing needed protective tariﬀs; the
                  moneylenders wanted to stop the use of paper money to pay oﬀ
                  debts, the land speculators wanted protection as they invaded
                  Indian lands; slaveowners needed federal security against slave
                  revolts and runaways; bondholders wanted a government able to
## raise money by nationwide taxation, to pay oﬀ those bonds.

## Four groups, Beard noted, were not represented in the
                  Constitutional Convention: slaves, indentured servants, women, men
                  without property.[26]
               Summarizing the constitution then, Zinn writes:
                  The Constitution, then, illustrates the complexity of the American
                  system: that it serves the interests of a wealthy elite, but also does
                  enough for small property owners, for middle-income mechanics
## and farmers, to build a broad base of support. The slightly
                  prosperous people who make up this base of support are buﬀers
                  against the blacks, the Indians, the very poor whites. They enable
                  the elite to keep control with a minimum of coercion, a maximum of
                  law–all made palatable by the fanfare of patriotism and unity.[27]
              Those with power and inﬂuence, who had beneﬁted from the use of slaves
            as a means of achieving economic and political power, helped ingrain slavery
            into their respective legal systems and cultures. Thus, representatives,
            especially from Southern states, had a strong interest in preserving slavery,
            and would not have agreed to join the union without a constitutional
            protection for it. This protection is exhibited by the original sections of the
            Constitution located at: Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 (recognizing the “threeﬁfths compromise”); Article 1, Section 9, Clause 1 (permitting the
            continuance of the slave trade until 1808); and Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3
            (protection for the Fugitive Slave Act).
              While legislation to abolish the slave trade became law in 1808, some state
            governments enacted Black Codes, or laws to regulate the institution of
            slavery and to place further restrictions on the liberty of Blacks. The Supreme
            Court did nothing to abolish slavery, or the racist laws, in fact, it thwarted an
            attempt by some Northern states to limit slavery, through the Missouri
            Compromise, by nationalizing the practice with its decision in Dred Scott v.
            Sanford.[28] The issue of slavery ultimately contributed to the outbreak of the
            Civil War, and the eventual passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments in
            1865, 1868, and 1870, respectively (prohibiting slavery except as punishment
            for committing a crime, guaranteeing equal protection for all citizens, and
            prohibiting the denial of the right to vote based on race, respectively).

            However, the intent in maintaining a racially divided society persisted, as
            state governments implemented “Jim Crow” laws that segregated Blacks to a
            separate, and second-class citizenship. The Supreme Court again did nothing
            to repeal these laws until its decision in Brown v. Board of Education of
            Topeka over 80 years later in 1954.[29] The Civil Rights Movement followed in
            the 1960s and 1970s and helped remove many of the overt forms of racial
            discrimination the legal system and federal government had maintained, but
            regardless of these changes, legally sanctioned racial discrimination has
            endured. Now, it operates in covert and institutionalized ways that can be
            shown through the impact of governmental policy. The government’s “War on
            Drugs” has become the most recent, post-Civil Rights Movement policy to
            continue the racial discrimination and exploitation of minorities in America.
            While the term “War on Drugs” was initially used by President Richard Nixon,
            it was under the Presidency of Ronald Reagan when it became heavily
            enforced. The purported purpose of the “war” was to reduce the illegal drug
            trade, by implementing policies that discouraged the production, distribution,
            and consumption of illegal drugs. This included imposing restrictive penalties
            on an individual’s liberties for committing drug-related crimes (i.e., losing the
            right to vote, denial of public beneﬁts), and harsher sentencing guidelines
            (i.e., “three strikes laws,” mandatory minimums).
               Although the appearance of the eﬀort appears racially neutral, its
            enforcement has had a clear racial bias. Terming the initiative the “New Jim
            Crow,” Michelle Alexander explains that, “[a]s of 2004, more African
            American men were disenfranchised (due to felon disenfranchisement laws)
            than in 1870, the year the Fifteenth Amendment was ratiﬁed …”[30]
            Illustrating the racial bias of this, Alexander continues:
                  This war has been waged almost exclusively in poor communities of
                  color, even though studies consistently show that people of all colors
                  use and sell illegal drugs at remarkably similar rates. In fact, some
                  studies indicate that white youth are signiﬁcantly more likely to
                  engage in illegal drug dealing than black youth. Any notion that
                  drug use among African Americans is more severe or dangerous is
                  belied by the data. White youth, for example, have about three times
                  the number of drug-related visits to the emergency room as their
                  African American counterparts.[31]
              Another indicator of the racial bias within the initiative can be shown
            through the diﬀerence in sentencing guidelines. In 1986, the U.S. Congress
            passed laws that created a 100:1 sentencing disparity for the possession or
            traﬀicking of crack, in comparison to the penalties for traﬀicking powder
            cocaine, which exhibits discrimination since Blacks are more likely to use
            crack than powder cocaine, a substance that is predominantly used by Whites.
            [32] Compounding this further are the revelations journalist Gary Webb
            uncovered on how the Nicaraguan rebel group, the Contras, who were known
            for drug traﬀicking, were assisted by the U.S. government in distributing
            crack cocaine in Los Angeles, California to fund weapons purchases.[33] Thus,
            the undisguised racist laws and policies that targeted Blacks after the
            formation of the Constitution have continued, just in a less overt fashion.
              The history of the plight of other minorities under oppressive laws and

            governmental policies should not go unmentioned. Latinos have been targeted
            through anti-immigrant laws, termed “Juan Crow,” that have had similar, but
            diﬀerent eﬀects on Latinos as Jim Crow did on Blacks.[34] Native Americans
            are also disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system since
            they are incarcerated at a rate 38% higher than the national per capita rate.
            [35] Muslims, especially after the September 11th events, have been subjected
            to racial proﬁling and surveillance by local and federal authorities, similar to
            how the Japanese, and Asians generally, were persecuted before and during
            World War II. Furthermore, the government’s practice of discriminating
            against groups based on racial identities is exempliﬁed by its use of data
            obtained by the U.S. Census and the policies it has created.[36]
              Encapsulating the history of America’s legal system with the impact it has
            had on society, the conclusion can be drawn that it has successfully achieved
            the objectives its creators intended: a patriarchal, plutocracy ruled by Whites.
            The gap in equality on wealth, health, education, and employment between
            Blacks and Whites has continued to expand, further demonstrating the bias
            inherent in the construction of American society.[37] Thus, a new approach to
            how we live and interact with each other is desperately needed. One where
            our interconnectedness is valued, and where society nurtures everyone’s
            existence. This requires a culture that focuses on anti-oppressive structures,
            and has the goal of collectively liberating all people. Luckily, such a vision
            exists, and it is called anarchism.
              Introduction to anarchism
              The word “anarchism,” derived from the Greek root “anarchos,” means
            “without authority,” and according to the Encyclopedia Brittanica, its central
            ideals are freedom, equality, and mutual aid.[38] Despite this, in modern
            popular society, anarchism is surrounded by stigma and taboo, and invokes
            images of social chaos, in which terrorism is the prevailing means of
            establishing law and order, making anarchism seem both impractical and
            undesirable. However, through the fog of misperception and obscurity, lies a
            sociopolitical doctrine that challenges some of our deeply held assumptions
            on what the relationship between the individual and society can be, and calls
            us to work towards creating a truly free and cooperative society.
              Behind some of the constructions of anarchism as a violent ideology are
            events that transpired between the years of 1890 and 1901. During this time
            period, individuals that identiﬁed as anarchists killed several ruling ﬁgures,
            including U.S. President William McKinley, King Umberto I of Italy, and Sadi
            Carnot, the President of France.[39] These are certainly extreme acts, but it is
            unfair, and too simple to ascribe these actions to all anarchists without an
            investigation into the circumstances surrounding each event, or consideration
            for the diversity of thought and tactics within anarchism itself. Such an
            investigation is beyond the scope of this paper, but suﬀice it to say, the use of
            violence, as a means to justify the ends anarchism seeks, is not a universally
            accepted tactic.
              Another argument used to discredit anarchism is its perceived
            impracticality and lack of application outside of “non-primitive” societies.
            Generally, “primitive” societies are distinguished from modern societies
            because of an absence of an institutionalized government-like authority. Due
            to this distinction, “primitive” societies are considered irrelevant to

            discussions surrounding present-day social issues.
              Anarchist anthropologist, David Graeber, provides an alternative lens to
            view this dichotomy through his book, Fragments of An Anarchist
            Anthropology.[40] Graeber writes that the popular American understanding of
            how human society has developed is that it has followed a linear path,
            beginning primitive and becoming more advanced and complex over time.
            Graeber explains that the anthropological record does not support this
            conclusion, using three egalitarian cultures, the Piaroa, Tiv, and Malagasy, as
            examples.[41] Graeber writes:
                  … we [anthropologists] have been trying for decades now to
                  convince the public that there’s no such thing as a ‘primitive,’ that
                  ‘simple societies’ are not really all that simple, that no one ever
                  existed in timeless isolation, that it makes no sense to speak of some
                  social systems as more or less evolved.[42]
               Author Walter Cruttenden also takes time to dispel this myth, writing:
                  The leap was made: If Darwin had evidence that physical organisms
                  adapt to ﬁt their environment (evolve), then society, even over short
                  periods, must evolve in the same linear fashion. In other words, if
                  evolution existed in physical development, it must also play a role in
                  societal and cultural development within humanity. This was very
                  appealing to the intellectuals of post-Renaissance Europe as it
                  justiﬁed a superior attitude toward less complex societies.[43]
              Everywhere in the world, it seems, archaeological digs are reshaping our
            view of the distant past. Not only are these ﬁndings revealing that
            civilizations were older than once thought, but they are showing that man was
            smarter and more progressive.[44]
              Based on this, Graber asks that we engage in a “thought experiment”:
                  What if, as a recent title put it, ‘we have never been modern’? What
                  if there never was any fundamental break, and therefore, we are not
                  living in a fundamentally diﬀerent moral, social, or political universe
                  than the Piaroa or Tiv or rural Malagasy? […]
                  Let us imagine, then, that the West, however deﬁned, was nothing
                  special, and further, that there has been no one fundamental break
## in human history. No one can deny there have been massive
                  quantitative changes: the amount of energy consumed, the speed at
                  which humans can travel, the number of books produced and read,
                  all these numbers have been rising exponentially … The West might
                  have introduced some new possibilities, but it hasn’t canceled any of
                  the old ones out.[45]
              Without a basis for disregarding the social organization of “primitive”
            societies, anarchism remains a relevant sociopolitical doctrine.
              While anarchism’s critics may concede that it is conceivable, they may still
            argue it is not the best way of structuring society. This position is exempliﬁed

            by the thoughts of French Revolution thinker, Jacques-Pierre Brissot. Brissot,
            in denouncing his political rivals, the Enragés, accused them of advocating
            anarchy, warning that without the rule of law and government, there could be
            no way of delivering justice within society.[46] This sentiment is exempliﬁed
            modernly in Paul Butler’s bold essay, “Racially Based Jury Nulliﬁcation: Black
            Power In The Criminal Justice System.”[47] In Butler’s essay, he calls for
            Blacks to exercise jury nulliﬁcation in particular circumstances as a way of
            protesting the unfair practices of the criminal justice system. Although Butler
            calls for the undermining of the legal system, he ensures that readers do not
            confuse his ideas as “encouraging anarchy” by explicitly stating so (“I am not
            encouraging anarchy.”[48] ). A logical assumption of Butler’s reasoning is that
            anarchy would be more problematic than reform.
              Anarchism’s absence from mainstream America’s discussions should not
            reﬂect poorly on the ideals it promotes. In the opinion of anarchist author,
            John Zerzan, anarchism is about, “eradicating all forms of domination. This
            includes not only such obvious forms as the nation-state, … and the
            corporation, … but also such internalized forms as patriarchy, racism, and
            homophobia.”[49] “Domination” occurs in relationships where there is an
            unequal distribution of power, allowing the dominator(s) to exert their will
            over others. Being subject to domination causes mental and physical
            oppression, both of which obstruct human growth. For this reason, hierarchy
            is viewed negatively by anarchists, and instead, horizontal structures,
            dependent upon collaboration are encouraged. According to Anarchist writer,
            David Wieck, anarchism represents:
                  … a kind of intransigent eﬀort to conceive of and to seek means to
                  realize a human liberation from every power structure, every form
                  of domination and hierarchy. Correlative with this negation is the
                  positive faith that through the breakdown of mutually supportive
                  institutions of power, possibilities can arise for noncoercive social
                  cooperation, social unity, speciﬁcally a social unity in which
                  individuality is fully realizable and in which freedom is deﬁned not
                  by rights and liberties but by the functioning of society as a network
                  of voluntary cooperation. [...]
                  We are premising a society in which people have stopped living in
                  fear of one another, in which gross violence, hatred, and contempt
                  for life have become uncommon, in which alienation of person from
                  person seldom reaches the malignant extremes to which we are
                  accustomed.[50]
              Thus, anarchism does not advocate violence or mayhem, but rather calls for
            the liberation of everyone by removing oppressive social structures and
            practices from within our communities.
              The vision anarchism has for society directly challenges a number of the
            core assumptions and principles held by mainstream America. For one,
            anarchists believe the current legal system and the authorization it provides
            for governmental and state power is both harmful and unnecessary.
              In theory, the government is supposed to be of, for, and by the people, but
            the reality of its function has only ensured the existence of a ruling class,
11 of 18 10/9/25, 2:02 AM An Anarchist Theory of Criminal Justice https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coy-mckinney-an-...
            whose power and interests are perpetually preserved by the system of
            governance. David Graeber describes the state as having a dual character,
            where it is viewed as an institutionalized form of extortion by communities
            that seek to retain some degree of autonomy, while also appearing as a
            “utopian project in the written record.”[51] Despite its idealistic aura, Peter
            Kropotkin writes that, “… Anarchists have often enough pointed out in their
            perpetual criticism of the various forms of government, that the mission of all
            governments, monarchical, constitutional, or republican, is to protect and
            maintain by force the privileges of the classes in possession …”[52] Essentially,
            the power a community naturally has to rule itself, is given to a higher
            authority, the state, to govern on the community’s behalf. This opens the
            community to the abuses of power that result from hierarchical relationships.
            Additionally, the community’s reliance on the state to govern its aﬀairs
            diminishes the community’s own power, making it, and its members,
            subservient to the state. This reliance on the state and the legal system
            creates an indirect way of resolving conﬂict. Rather than individuals settling
            disputes amongst themselves, they rely on impersonal laws to ﬁnd a solution.
            To this point, Kropotkin writes:
                  [Quoting French jurist Dalloy] “… legislation is expected to do
                  everything, and each fresh law being a fresh miscalculation, men
                  are continually led to demand from it what can proceed only from
                  themselves, from their own education and their own morality.” In
                  existing States a fresh law is looked upon as a remedy for evil.
                  Instead of themselves [the populace] altering what is bad, people
                  begin by demanding a law to alter it.[53]
              Allowing oﬀicials of the state to ﬁll positions of power and determine policy
            for the community is problematic for the following reason:
                  The notion of “policy” presumes a state or governing apparatus
                  which imposes its will on others. “Policy” is the negation of politics;
                  policy is by deﬁnition something concocted by some form of elite,
                  which presumes it knows better than others how their aﬀairs are to
                  be conducted. By participating in policy debates the very best one
                  can achieve is to limit the damage, since the very premise is
                  inimical to the idea of people managing their own aﬀairs.[54]
              As a result, communities that concede their power to the state, reduce their
            independence and freedom to determine the type of society they want to live
            in.
              The relinquishing of community power to a state government is unnecessary
            because there is no reason to believe the state can perform better than the
            community could. Anarchists believe we are capable of practicing a natural
            form of justice amongst ourselves, based on our conscience and innate ability
            to reason with one another, without trusting the process to a hierarchical
            ruling class of professionals. Kropotkin explains the manipulative justiﬁcation
            for law by saying:
                  Its origin is the desire of the ruling class to give permanence to
12 of 18 10/9/25, 2:02 AM An Anarchist Theory of Criminal Justice https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coy-mckinney-an-...

## customs imposed by themselves for their own advantage. Its
                  character is the skilful commingling of customs useful to society,
                  customs which have no need of law to insure respect, with other
                  customs useful only to rulers, injurious to the mass of the people,
                  and maintained only by the fear of punishment.[55]
               The anarchist belief equates “law” with ethics, and reasons that since we
            learn ethics from our families, friends, and other members of our community,
            our current governmental legal system is not required.
               The permanence of a state authority comes under further questioning when
            its actual existence is probed. Graeber writes:

## In fact, the world is under no obligation to live up to our
                  expectations, and insofar as “reality” refers to anything, it refers to
                  precisely that which can never be entirely encompassed by our
                  imaginative constructions. Totalities, in particular, are always
                  creatures of the imagination. Nations, societies, ideologies, closed
                  systems… none of these really exist. [...]
                  This is not an appeal for a ﬂat-out rejection of such imaginary
                  totalities … It is an appeal to always bear in mind that they are just
                  that: tools of thought.[56]
              Thus, part of the state’s existence and legitimacy is due to the mental
            recognition we assign to it. If everyone were to shift their thinking to a
            worldview in which the state was undesired, and instead, looked to live
            without its authority, the state’s power and existence would be critically
            undermined.
              The primary reason we acknowledge the authority of the state is its ability
            to use force as a means of enforcing compliance. This means anyone who
            breaks the law can have their liberty taken from them, or be killed by state
            oﬀicials. Sociologist Max Weber, describes the state as, “ a human community
            that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force
            within a given territory.”[57] On the issue of force and violence, Graeber
            writes:
                  … violence, particularly structural violence, where all the power is
                  on one side, creates ignorance. If you have the power to hit people
## over the head whenever you want, you don’t have to trouble
                  yourself too much ﬁguring out what they think is going on, and
                  therefore, generally speaking, you don’t. Hence the sure-ﬁre way to
                  simplify social arrangements, to ignore the incredibly complex play
## of perspectives, passions, insights, desires, and mutual
                  understandings that human life is really made of, is to make a rule
                  and threaten to attack anyone who breaks it. This is why violence
                  has always been the favored recourse of the stupid: it is the one
                  form of stupidity to which it is almost impossible to come up with an
                  intelligent response. It is also of course the basis of the state.[58]
               Consequently, the manner in which we allow the state to enforce

            compliance to the law is comparable to the rhetoric the American government
            uses to demonize “terrorist” groups and the countries labeled as their
            supporters. If terrorism is something we collectively admonish, our next step
            is to be honest in our introspection, and overcome the glaring contradiction
            that surrounds us.
              Despite the state’s monopoly on the use of legitimate force, it still only
            exists because we acknowledge it to. To live in a truly cooperative and free
            society, we must be willing to let go of our reliance on the external state and
            legal system, and begin to engage each other on a local basis, and take full
            responsibility for the structure of our communities and neighborhoods.
            A new way forward — a restorative approach to justice
               The current legal system’s fundamental purpose is to resolve conﬂict.
            However, the power to determine resolutions is given to individuals that do
            not have an interest in the matter, and prevent the individuals involved to
            determine their own form of justice. Additionally, obedience to this system is
            enforced under duress. Rather than using force to achieve compliance, the
            anarchist approach to resolving conﬂict is voluntary, and believes justice can
            only be determined by the involved parties through dialogue. A justice system
            based on these principles exists, and is called restorative justice.
               Restorative justice is a form of conﬂict resolution, used by diﬀerent
            indigenous groups throughout the world, to settle disputes between
            individuals. According to a restorative justice co-director of facilitation,
            Matthew Johnson, “[r]eliance on the state to achieve justice or security goes
            against the idea that people are fully equipped to deal with their own conﬂicts
            — an idea that is at the core of restorative justice principles.”[59] In contrast
            to the current criminal justice system, where the state is viewed as the
            primary victim in criminal acts, and victims, oﬀenders, and the community are
            given passive roles, restorative justice views crime as being directed against
            individual people.[60]) This means conﬂicts and disputes are settled entirely
            by members of the community. The framework restorative justice uses, allows
            it to be applied in any circumstance in which a conﬂict is deemed to exist. At
            its core, it is a form of community justice that recognizes the
            interconnectedness of communal living, and that harm and conﬂicts are
            symptoms of communal inadequacies. Therefore, if everyone’s needs are
            being met, then consequently the causes for conﬂict are prevented.
               Howard Zehr, a leading advocate and visionary for restorative justice, says
            that it has three primary pillars: harms and needs, obligations, and
            engagement.[61] In regards to harm, Zehr writes, “[w]hile our ﬁrst concern
            must be the harm experienced by victims, the focus on harm implies that we
            also need to be concerned about the harm experienced by oﬀenders and
            communities.”[62] The restorative approach tries to uncover the causes of
            conﬂicts in a manner that respects the perspectives of the people involved.
            Behind this is the belief that conﬂicts are created by misunderstandings and
            needs not being met for individuals. This method prevents individuals that
            have caused harm from being viliﬁed, which encourages others to participate,
            and also reveals any inadequacies within the individual’s community.

              The second pillar is that restorative justice “emphasizes oﬀender
            accountability and responsibility.”[63] This means, rather than sending
            oﬀenders to jail, they confront the people that have been harmed by their
            actions, and take responsibility for rectifying the situation. Oﬀenders are
            permitted to tell their side of the story, but must also listen to how and why
            their actions led to the harm. Then together, the individuals work towards an
            agreeable solution. All this ﬁts within the third pillar of engagement, which
            suggests that the primary parties aﬀected by crime be given signiﬁcant roles
            in the justice process.[64] An example of how the process works is as follows:

## We [an organization that coordinates restorative justice
                  conferences] would get a referral, call each principal actor in the
                  conﬂict, interview them carefully and empathetically…making sure
                  they are aware of the process as well as their own feelings…and get
                  their consent to participate in the process. We would then repeat
                  the process with everyone else involved and schedule a time that
                  worked for everyone and an appropriate, neutral location. If it were
                  a Victim-Oﬀender Dialogue, it would likely take place at the
                  correctional institution. The preparation process, where a trained
                  facilitator would talk to each person individually, is generally the
## most important part and will determine the success of the
                  conference. At the end of the conference, dialogue, etc., the
                  facilitator(s) would help the participants generate a consensus
                  agreement, that might include restitution, an apology, community
                  service, etc., and follow up with participants after an established
## amount of time to ensure that they were satisﬁed with the
                  agreement and that it was being followed as agreed.[65]
              Thus, the restorative justice process function of compassionately helping
            individuals learn from their mistakes.
              Restorative justice practices are gaining traction and being applied
            throughout the country in a variety of contexts, but its success and continued
            use is dependent upon a continuing shift in societal values, and the
            strengthening of communal ties.[66] In some instances, forms of restorative
            justice are being used in conjunction with the criminal justice system for
            misdemeanor crimes. Defendants are given the choice of pleading guilty and
            going through a process in which they admit guilt, and discuss what caused
            them to commit the crime, and are then required to perform community
            service. While this is a step in the right direction, the process still operates
            under the power of the state. Additionally, it creates a problematic incentive
            for defendants to plead guilty to crimes just to escape accountability.
            Accountability is important in ensuring justice through the restorative
            method, however, without the force of the state to ensure this, the question
            becomes, how can society hold people accountable for their actions? Matthew
            Johnson believes:

## … that accountability comes naturally with community and
                  interdependent relationships. We tend to not view ourselves as
## connected in Western culture; we see ourselves primarily as
                  individuals. In this context, accountability is not as important as
15 of 18 10/9/25, 2:02 AM An Anarchist Theory of Criminal Justice https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coy-mckinney-an-...
                  escaping blame or harm. However, if I value my relationship with
                  you more than my own willingness to avoid pain/consequences, I
                  will tell you that I broke your favorite possession, etc., because I
                  would want the same done for me, and we are interconnected. Also,
                  accountability comes much easier when there is no expectation of
                  punishment. If I knew you weren’t going to sue me, hit me, or shun
                  me for admitting my wrongdoing, I would have much more of an
                  incentive to tell the truth and be accountable. The current criminal
                  justice system, along with the capitalist economic system, assumes
                  that we act within our own self-interests, and this is just the way of
                  things. Therefore, we incentive behavior that maximizes selfinterest. Yet we turn around and criticize people for being selﬁsh,
                  etc. The principles of restorative justice go against this paradigm.
                  Its practitioners have a much less cynical view of humanity, but
                  nonetheless it’s quite possible that RJ (restorative justice) won’t
                  reach its full potential without a radical re-evaluation of societal
                  values.[67]
               Thus, in order for restorative justice to operate in the anarchist fashion it is
            intended to, and be successful, there needs to be an evolution in the way we
            live our lives, and the way we view one another.
            Conclusion
              In conclusion, the racist, classist, hierarchical interests represented in the
            formation of the Constitution have created a legal system, and subsequently, a
            criminal justice system, that has consistently failed to administer true justice.
            Thus, a new approach must be taken, which will require us to stop relying on
            the current criminal justice system, and its oppressive laws to solve our
            interpersonal issues. The criminal justice system will continue to work the
            way it has, as long as we continue to consent and participate in it. If we
            collectively take a stand and withdraw our consent from the system, and
            instead redirect how we deal with conﬂict to a restorative approach, the
            criminal justice system will become irrelevant. In explaining “revolutionary
            exodus,” David Graeber writes:

## The theory of exodus proposes that the most eﬀective way of
                  opposing capitalism and the liberal state is not through direct
                  confrontation but by means of what Paolo Virno has called “engaged
                  withdrawal,” mass defection by those wishing to create new forms
                  of community. One need only glance at the historical record to
                  conﬁrm that most successful forms of popular resistance have taken
                  precisely this form. They have not involved challenging power head
                  on (this usually leads to being slaughtered, or if not, turning into
## some—often even uglier—variant of the very thing one ﬁrst
                  challenged) but from one or another strategy of slipping away from
                  its grasp, from ﬂight, desertion, the founding of new communities.

               Critical for creating this new society is a belief that it is possible and that
            we have the power to do it.
               It is time to reaﬀirm what is already ours and reclaim our individual
            sovereignty. It is time for our self ownership to be reaﬀirmed and lived out in
            life. It is a metaphysical fact that we own our bodies and minds. All other
            ownerships can be challenged and are transitory at best, but self ownership is
            undeniable and permanent as long as we are living beings. Therefore it is
            ultimately, indeed must be our decision as to how we will conduct our lives
            the only law that we must accept is to do no harm to others and to recognize
            and respect the personal sovereignty of the other as they must ours.
            Recognition and respect of every person’s individual sovereignty is the only
            way in which systems of mutual cooperation can be successfully developed
            and maintained. And indeed is the only law required for peaceful coexistence
            with the greater society. But it is not a law of compulsion like most laws, but
            is rather the natural state of things such as the laws of physics.[69]
