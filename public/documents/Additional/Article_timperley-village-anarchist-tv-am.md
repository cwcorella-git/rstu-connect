Timperley Village Anarchist / TV-AM Date: Unknown Source: https://libcom.org/article/timperley-village-anarchist-tv-am Tags: Timperley Village Anarchist Militia, Manchester, Class War Federation, publications Online archive of this mid-1980s Class War adjacent newsletter produced in Greater Manchester. Timperley is a small village in the suburbs of Manchester. "The people (sic) who produce this paper do not live in Timperley Village, the name is just a bit of a wind up for the petty bourgoise bastions of respectability who do inhabit this deranged quarter."

- Editorial from issue 2

The group producing the paper called themselves Timperley Village Anarchist Militia aka TV-AM. This was a play on "TV-am", the name of the UK's first breakfast television programme, which commenced in 1983. It is possible that the newsletter was the inspiration for local personality Frank Sidebottom's various cover versions of the Sex Pistols song "Anarchy In The UK", which included the phrase "Anarchy in Timperley". There are some interesting reflections by a former member of Timperley Village Anarchist Militia from 2005 at theCounago & Spaves blog.
