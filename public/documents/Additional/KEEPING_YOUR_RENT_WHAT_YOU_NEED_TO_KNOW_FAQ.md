# KEEPING YOUR RENT WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW FAQ **Source**: ./KEEPING-YOUR-RENT-FAQ.pdf ## Content KEEPING YOUR RENT: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW (FAQ) torontokeepyourrent@gmail.com | 647-874-8793 | Facebook: Keep Your Rent Toronto Why keep my rent? You may need it. COVID-19 may be a long-term public health crisis. The number of people who have lost their jobs continues to grow. The pandemic is already making life harder for the majority of us, and we can’t afford to assume it is going away anytime soon. There is strength in numbers. Thousands of us deciding to keep our rent gives us the resources to better provide for the health and well-being of our families and communities. Social distancing helps stop the spread of COVID-19. It doesn’t stop us from taking the collective action of keeping our rent. Aren’t there no more evictions? On March 19, in response to COVID-19, the Ontario Superior Court suspended all residential evictions “until otherwise ordered by the court”. This means that until otherwise stated, the Sheriff will not participate in the forceful removal of tenants from their homes. In addition, the Toronto Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) has cancelled all hearings until at least March 27, 2020. With the eviction system at a stand still, landlords cannot bring tenants to the LTB and they cannot enforce evictions against tenants. When the eviction suspension ends, won’t everyone get evicted? No. Only the LTB can order a tenant to move out and only the Sheriff can physically remove someone from their home. Landlords can apply to the LTB to evict a tenant who has not paid rent, but only after the 14-day notice period in a properly served N4 notice. A hearing at the LTB is usually scheduled in 3-6 weeks, and in light of the current crisis, potentially much longer, in advance. At the LTB hearing the tenant can pay the rent owing and avoid eviction. However, the LTB may require the tenant to pay the landlord’s filing fee of $190. There are some exceptions to this that apply in a small minority of cases. If your landlord has taken you to the LTB before over rent, reach out to us for more information. What if I can’t afford the $190 fee? Tenants do not automatically become responsible for a landlord’s filing fees. Landlords apply for this and the tribunal then has to approve it. No-one should accept this outcome, for themselves or others. Attempts to force tenants to pay for their landlord’s legal attacks can and should be fought. During the 2017 MetCap rent strike, Parkdale Organize was able to fundraise a defense fund to help cover $190 filing fees against tenants. The force of the rent strikers’ actions defeated MetCap’s attempt to evict them and the money was never used. This is because there were hundreds of tenants involved and MetCap was unable to pursue evictions against everyone at once. If necessary, that money will be made available and it is entirely possible that more money would be fundraised. Keeping my rent could be riskier for me than for other people. Why should I take part? Keeping our rent might be riskier for some people than others. Especially if they are forced to go it alone. It’s important to acknowledge that. This makes it especially important for tenants in more secure positions to not just participate but commit to defending one another down the road, if it comes to that. For the most marginalized among us, KeepYourRent is not a choice -- it’s a necessity. Either they need that money to feed their family, or they just don’t have it to begin with. If you think you are in a position to choose, please choose to stand with others who aren’t. Marginalized people are most at risk when singled out and isolated. KeepYourRent is about acting together, so that those who are most marginalized are not left to deal with this crisis alone. What might my landlord do? 1. Legal Action Landlords may issue an N8 eviction notice alleging the tenant frequently paid rent late. Again, the Landlord has to apply to the LTB. The risk of eviction at an N8 LTB hearing is lower than at an N4 hearing for non-payment of rent. At an N8 hearing the LTB could order the tenant to pay rent on time for the next year or be evicted without a hearing. ``` -- ## Page 2 ### Complete Page View ![Page 2 Complete](images/page_002_full.png)
