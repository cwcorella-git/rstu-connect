               Movement

               Before the Spanish call-out for a global day of action on
               October 15, a few critical notes and words of encouragement
               from the Barcelona neighborhood assemblies…
               After the courageous revolts of the Arab Spring, the next
               phenomenon of popular resistance to capture the world
               media’s attention was the plaza occupation movement that
               spread across Spain starting on the 15th of May (15M).
               Subsequently, attention turned back to Greece, and now to the
               public occupations spreading across the US, inspired by the
               Wall Street protests.
               The function of the media is to explain interruptions in the
               dominant narrative, not to spread lessons useful to the social
               struggles that generate those ruptures. As such, it is no
               surprise that they respond to the strategically important
               moments before and after these mass gatherings with a news
               blackout.
               While the central plazas of the cities of Spain are no longer
               occupied, in some places the momentum of May continues

               with force. Particularly in Barcelona, a dynamic struggle
               continues to evolve, including a heterogeneous and broad
               group of people in weekly neighborhood assemblies, protests,
               hospital occupations, road blockades, fights against mortgage
               evictions and housing repossessions, and solidarity
               demonstrations against the inevitable repression.
               The neighborhood assemblies in particular form a strong
               backbone that holds up all the ongoing struggles. In about
               twenty neighborhoods throughout Barcelona, once a week,
               twenty to a hundred neighbors meet to discuss their problems,
               propose actions, and share news. Each assembly has a
               different structure, and members of each assembly gather
               periodically to share and coordinate between neighborhoods.
               Half a dozen neighborhoods had assemblies before May 15,
               and a couple assemblies even predate the September 2010
               general strike, but the participation in these assemblies
               exploded after the beginning of the plaza occupations, and
               over a dozen new neighborhoods formed assemblies of their
               own.
               These neighborhood assemblies are changing the face of the
               struggle in Barcelona, overcoming the isolation and separation
               of the various, pre-existing political ghettos, creating spaces of
               informal, intergenerational debate, gathering resources for
               propaganda and legal support, and preempting the isolation
               that is the express purpose of government repression. The
               neighborhood assemblies are directly responsible for at least
               part of the unprecedented turnout of nearly a thousand people
               taking the streets in a solidarity demonstration the same day
               that Catalan police began arresting protestors identified from

               the June Parliament blockade (see “Wave of Arrests Sweep
               Barcelona http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/10/10/
               crackdown-in-spain/). Since we’ve met our neighbors in the
               streets, we’re no longer alone, and the State can try to lock us
               up or wear us down, but they cannot isolate us.
               What’s more, the neighborhood assemblies attack capitalist
               isolation and the enclosure of public space in the very act of
               meeting. Every neighborhood assembly is also an occupation
               that takes over a plaza, park, or street corner without
               permission, eroding legality and demonstrating that the city is
               ours. On countless occasions, neighborhood assemblies have
               blocked major streets as an act of protest (against a hospital
               closing, for example), or they have decided, almost
               whimsically, to hold their meeting in a large intersection and
               simply shut down traffic. In the feeder marches to major
               protests the people of a neighborhood have met to march all
               the way to the center, blocking every street along the way,
               even though they may only consist of forty people. And
               because of the greater social legitimacy enjoyed by the
               neighborhood assembly as opposed to some political faction or
               specific organization, the police have been hesitant to create
               problems because any repression would draw more people
               down into the streets. Temporarily, the neighborhood
               assemblies have negated government sovereignty in the
               streets; if the police ask whether marchers have a permit, they
               just get laughed at.
               Interestingly, the plaza occupations that began on the 15th of
               May provided a unique opportunity for people trying to change
               the world to meet each other and increase our forces and

               understanding, but it seems that at each step, we had to pass
               an obstacle constituted by the original forms of the 15M
               movement. Similarly in the US, the starting points imposed by
               the Occupy Wall Street action serve as a sort of cocoon that
               must be broken in order to go further. A number of features
               that have aided the growth of our struggle in Barcelona may be
               useful for people in the US to reflect on in comparison with the
               occupations now happening in New York and other cities.
               History is Wisdom
               The deeper a struggle’s historical roots, the greater its
               collective knowledge. In the beginning, both the media and
               some leading activists tried to present the 15M movement as
               something new. But in reality, the vast majority of us who
               occupied Plaça Catalunya and created the movement with our
               own participation were informed by a lifetime of frustrations
               and a long history of struggles. In Barcelona, that history
               includes the struggle against the austerity measures (including
               two general strikes and a Mayday riot, among innumerable
               smaller actions), the student movement against the
               privatization of education, the squatters’ movement, anti-
               border and immigrant solidarity struggles, the anti-war and
               anti-globalization movements at the beginning of the last
               decade, the struggle against gentrification and the Olympics in
               the ’90s, the struggle in the prisons or the movement of
               military objectors in the ’80s, the workers’ autonomy and
               neighborhood movements at the end of the dictatorship and
               the transition to democracy, the clandestine struggle against
               Franco, the Civil War, and going back to the beginning of the

               century, the anarchist struggle against capitalism.
               All of these movements constitute lessons learned that can be
               passed down to aid future struggles. So often, the mistakes
               that defeat a revolutionary movement are repeated. The
               neighborhood assemblies in Barcelona serve as spaces where
               people from different generations can share their perspectives,
               where those with experience in past struggles can collectivize
               that experience and turn it into communal property. In the
               beginning, the organizers of the 15M movement presented
               their protest model as something ultra-modern, with more
               references to Twitter than to the country’s rich history of social
               movements. This model was rejected by many in Barcelona,
               especially older people or those who had already participated
               in a previous movement. People preferred to build off their own
               tradition of struggle, while taking advantage of the new
               situation and adapting certain features of the 15M model to
               their use.
               The historical memory of past instances of bureaucratization,
               co-optation by grassroots politicians, and pacification have
               already served to help the ongoing movement avoid a number
               of pitfalls. Despite attempts to centralize them, the
               neighborhood assemblies remain independent and
               decentralized, allowing for a broader, freer participation, and
               meaning that politicians who attempt to take advantage of
               these spaces are at a disadvantage because they cannot
               operate openly without being kicked out of the assemblies.
               The memory of struggles from before the global economic
               crash has allowed people to move beyond a simple kneejerk
               response to the present crisis and instead formulate a deeper

               critique of the system responsible for their woes. In practice,
               this has meant a popular shift from complaints about specific
               laws or specific features of the banking system that might
               serve as scapegoats for the crisis, to a radical critique of
               government and capitalism. While the movement is
               heterogeneous and by no means consistent, on multiple
               occasions it has popularly defined itself as anticapitalist, thus
               drawing on a strong tradition of struggle that goes back more
               than a century throughout Europe.
               The United States is also a country with inspiring histories of
               popular struggle. But it is a country with a case of social
               amnesia like no other. It seems that to a certain extent, the
               Occupy Wall Street actions exist more as a trend than anything
               else. The slight extent to which they draw on, or even make
               reference to, earlier struggles, even struggles from the past
               twenty years, is worrying. The fact that a present awareness of
               US history would shatter certain cornerstones of the new
               movement’s identity, for example this idea of the 99% that
               includes everyone but the bankers in one big, happy family, is
               not a sufficient excuse to avoid this task. The historical
               amnesia of American society must be overcome for a struggle
               to gain the perspective it needs.
               International Connections Feed Local Roots
               The local roots of the neighborhood assemblies foster a great
               many advantages that have allowed these bodies to become
               useful tools at everyone’s disposal, provided the participants
               recognize them for what they are. Especially those assemblies
               that have remained informal places of meeting, despite the

               frequent attempts by grassroots politicians to herd them into
               some formal structure or another, serve a primary function of
               allowing neighbors to meet each other and share their stories,
               thus fulfilling a fundamental emotional need for human contact
               that contrasts with everyday alienation. It is the fulfillment of
               this need that keeps many people coming back; not just the
               activists who were already meeting junkies before May 15, but
               the old folks who had long since given up on meetings, as well
               as the hospital and education workers or the young students
               who had never participated in meetings before all this.
               The assemblies of some neighborhoods, particularly the more
               yuppy ones that are full of liberals and authoritarian socialists,
               have chased away a great deal of participation by spending
               months deciding on a unitary definition of themselves, or
               otherwise using consensus or voting processes to achieve a
               forced and artificial unity. Meanwhile, the more fluid, effective
               assemblies have recognized that, as it was articulated on one
               occasion, “we’re not an organization, we’re a neighborhood;
               we don’t have unity, we have heterogeneity. The only thing we
               have in common is that we live in the same neighborhood and
               we’re trying to make things better.”
               The fact that we have brought our focus to the neighborhood
               we inhabit spares us from the abstractions and mediations of
               politics, allows us to measure our success not in meaningless
               figures like the number of people who come out to a protest
               but in very real, increasingly visible quantities, such as the
               extent to which we know each other, to which we are no longer
               strangers in our own neighborhoods, and the extent to which
               these relations of acquaintance are transforming into relations

               of material and emotional solidarity.
               The city, in fact, is an abstraction. In the particular case of
               Barcelona, most of the neighborhoods were independent
               villages that were absorbed by the life-devouring machine—
               first based in industry and now in tourism—that is Barcelona.
               Village/neighborhood identity was lost as the urban fiction
               advanced. Returning to the neighborhoods allows us to recover
               a human scale and distances us from the illusion of politics,
               which places all emphasis and power at the so-called higher
               levels of organization. If we ever regain power over our own
               lives, it will mean nearly all coordination and decision-making
               takes place at the level on which our own direct participation is
               possible: locally. This local emphasis has meant that in the
               attempts to create a coordinating body among the different
               neighborhood assemblies—a process rife with possibilities for
               bureaucratization or take-over by self-appointed
               representatives, if history is any indication—most assemblies
               have insisted on jealously preserving their own autonomy,
               putting the centralizers at a distinct disadvantage.
               Notwithstanding, the localization of this movement is aided
               immeasurably by its international contacts. Thanks to the
               participation of immigrants in these assemblies, we have
               access to the experience of neighborhood assemblies in
               Argentina in 2001, the lessons of the Chilean student
               movement or the Mapuche struggle, or the model developed
               over the last several years by the Seattle Solidarity Network, to
               name just a few examples. And because of direct relationships
               of solidarity with international struggles, when the pacifists try
               to hijack the story of the Arab Spring or the uprising in Iceland

               to try and steer the movement in Barcelona towards legalism
               and civility, people with friends and comrades in Cairo or
               Reykjavik can remind everyone that those revolts were fought
               with sticks, stones, and molotov cocktails, and that in any case
               it’s still too early to declare victory.
               It seems that in many cities in the US, the occupy movement is
               marked by a certain chauvinism that at most takes some
               inspiration from struggles in other parts of the world, without
               taking any critical lessons. The idea of “taking back America” is
               a tried and true strategy for self-defeat: creating a fictive
               community that in reality includes conflicting interests and
               conflicting desires and will inevitably be directed by its most
               powerful elements.
               Actually, one need not even look to other countries to find the
               problem with this sort of populism. George Washington and
               James Madison were among the richest inhabitants of the
               North American colonies. They used a unifying patriotism to
               whip the farmers and laborers into a frenzy, do the fighting and
               dying for them, kick out the 1% represented by the British
               overlords, and then when it was all done they wrote a
               Constitution that preserved their privilege and power,
               subsequently crushing several farmers’ rebellions that rose up
               to contest this quiet counterrevolution. Neither did they blink,
               so soon after their pretty talk about “liberty,” while continuing
               their policy of genocide against Native Americans and
               enslavement of kidnapped Africans.
               The American identity needs to be challenged as one of the
               oldest tools for getting the middle and lower sectors of US
               society to betray themselves and help push down those who

               are even lower in the hierarchy. The US could not possibly have
               created the largest wealth gap in the so-called developed
               world without the complicity of large parts of the population.
               Just below the 1%, there are plenty of people looking for a leg
               up, and they’re more than happy to pretend they’re just like
               everyone else if it lets them shake a few more apples from the
               tree.
               Another disadvantage that needs to be overcome in the US is
               the near total absence of place. Hardly anyone is from
               anywhere, and most places are built according to the needs of
               planned obsolescence, so that local identities barely have any
               common foundation from one decade to the next. The
               landscape itself is constantly dissolving. In the US, people are
               born into precarity and forced mobility. In the past, the most
               extreme cases, the tramps, developed their own nomad
               culture, and these tramps were a major force in US labor
               struggles at the beginning of the 20th century, making up a
               large part of the Industrial Workers of the World, to name an
               example. But even this has been marginalized or made to
               disappear.
               This alienation of place cannot be accepted with resignation as
               a simple feature of American society. It is the direct result of
               capitalist strategies of accumulation and State strategies of
               repression. How many times has the US government used the
               forced internal relocation of oppressed groups as an explicit
               strategy for social control? The only country I can think of that
               has done this more is China (going back, interestingly enough,
               through the Communist period all the way to the early
               dynasties).

               In order to overcome the severe disadvantages created by the
               denial of place, American rebels and revolutionaries need to
               hold on to their locale for dear life, prevent its periodic
               reconstruction or gentrification, and put down roots. The idea
               of “American” as a homogenous, uniting ideal and xenophobic
               sense of specialness needs to be eroded in favor of local
               cultures and global awareness. The progressive bumper sticker
               cliché about “thinking globally” is not enough. People also
               need to understand themselves as part of those global
               struggles, able to influence and be influenced by them.
               Take Public Space
               Barcelona is a city with a long history of popular life in public
               space. Chris Ealham, in Anarchism in the City, describes how
               workers pushed into overcrowded slum housing at the end of
               the 19th century converted the streets into their living rooms,
               creating an indispensable foundation for the informal
               neighborhood networks that gave strength to subsequent
               anticapitalist movements. This street culture survived the
               decades of fascism intact only to be sharply and effectively
               undermined by the democratic regime starting at the end of
               the ’70s. The Olympic Games of ’92 provided a major boost to
               commercial urbanization, and the civic behavior ordinances,
               passed in Catalunya after consultation with ex-NYC mayor Rudi
               Giuliani, might have been the penultimate nail in the coffin of
               street culture. Barcelona was fast closing in on the American
               model of the total privatization of public space that not only
               prohibits—but also installs new urban architecture to engineer
               out of existence—anyone who is not a consumer in motion.

               The neighborhood assemblies are starting to reverse this
               process, drawing on popular memory of the way things used to
               be, and architectural remnants such as central plazas in each
               neighborhood. The more modern neighborhoods that bear
               greater similarity with US urban spaces and have no plazas
               take advantage of well positioned parks.
               By holding their meetings outside, without permission, the
               neighborhood assemblies are eroding government and
               commercial sovereignty over public space and creating a
               visible referent for self-organization. Even though only fifty
               people might participate in a particular assembly, thousands
               see that it exists, and this changes their perception of what is
               normal and what is possible. This is no small accomplishment.
               If someone were to write the definitive history of capitalism,
               the 20th century’s enclosure of public space would merit as
               much attention as the enclosure of communal lands hundreds
               of years ago, that allowed capitalism to develop in the first
               place.
               The US, once again, is at a disadvantage in this respect.
               Whereas all European cities were originally designed for
               defense and at a certain point they had to be redesigned to put
               the would-be invader at an advantage, thus allowing armies to
               easily reoccupy cities—it wasn’t only Paris, after all, that had its
               commune—US cities were designed from the start according to
               the needs of Capital. It is no coincidence that Capital and the
               police forces of social control experience converging needs.
               Nonetheless, public space does exist in the US, however
               inconvenient its shape, and it must be taken for popular

               struggles to advance. The occupy movement is clearly
               breaking ground in this respect, although the embarrassing
               habit in several cities of asking for permission for what is
               supposed to be an occupation endangers any gains that have
               been won.
               Break Out of the Democratic Ideology
               In many other cities, leading activists in the 15M movement
               succeeded in imposing pacifist, populist, and democratic limits
               to the plaza occupations, meaning that anarchists and other
               radicals were expelled, while fascists, among others, were
               included. But in Barcelona, thanks perhaps to the Catalan spirit
               of independence, the occupation maintained an autonomous
               character from the beginning, defeating an explicit attempt by
               would-be leaders to impose a narrow program. Not
               coincidentally, the Barcelona occupation maintained a greater
               heterogeneity and a greater force than most other cities’
               occupations. And since then, the new movement has been
               largely reabsorbed into a broader, older, and more intelligent
               movement with much deeper roots: namely, the anticapitalist
               movement.
               Within the neighborhood assemblies, which are interwoven
               with workplace struggles and the fight against privatization
               and cutbacks in health and education, the confused and
               populist calls for electoral reform have given way to more
               revolutionary visions. Just a brief scene from our meeting on
               Wednesday night can give an indication of the healthy effect
               this radicalization has had on morale:
13 of 18 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Reﬂections for the US Occupy Movement | The Anarchis... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               There were perhaps seventy of us, people from our
               neighborhood and a few people from other neighborhoods who
               had come to share. This time, instead of the usual plaza, we
               were meeting in front of the nearby hospital that is being
               forced to close down or privatize. Capriciously, we had decided
               to hold the assembly in the intersection of two streets, shutting
               down traffic to cut down on the noise, win space for our
               meeting, and most of all, just because we wanted to, to
               demonstrate that the city was ours. At one point, a younger
               person spoke of the need to remember our prisoners and the
               people facing trial for fighting against an eviction or for
               harrassing politicians during the Parliament blockade, and not
               just to remember them today but to remember and support
               them a year from now, and as long as there are prisoners.
               Everybody applauded. Subsequently, a woman in her 60s
               spoke of the need to increase our forces, to fight harder, to get
               out of control, to do whatever it takes to shut this system down.
               People cheered loudly. Another speaker remarked on the need
               to support the struggle beyond any single issue, as important
               as the problem of healthcare is, because in truth we were
               struggling against capitalism. Another urged everyone to
               boycott the upcoming elections. Only one of these people, as
               far as I know, was an anarchist, but no political division was
               visible. All of us were just neighbors, and each of these
               statements won broad agreement.
               In the assemblies we look for ways to take action ourselves.
               What could be more tedious than sitting through a two hour
               meeting where we’re counselled to follow rules stacked against
               us, perhaps sign a petition or two, come out to a protest,
14 of 18 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Reﬂections for the US Occupy Movement | The Anarchis... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               provided we behave a certain way, and then leave the rest to
               the specialists? If someone had gotten up to speak of the need
               to be nonviolent or respect the laws, they probably would have
               been booed or ignored as a simpleton. If someone had spoken
               in favor of negotiating with the politicians or supporting a
               political party, they might have been kicked out.
               The fact of the matter is, the neighborhood assemblies are not
               open to everyone. They are not spaces for fascists, for
               politicians, for journalists (at least in the case of some
               neighborhoods), or for bosses. They are places for building a
               struggle against capitalism, among those of us who are angry
               and who respect the principle of solidarity. As such, they fly in
               the face of democratic fundamentals such as equal rights, free
               speech, and universal participation. As much as the ideologues
               of direct democracy try to hide the conflict between the notion
               of rights and the ideal of freedom, there’s no getting around
               this fact. The principles of democracy were drafted by elites
               interested in mediating class conflict and allowing the
               preservation of a class society. A struggle, to challenge the
               foundations of this system, must be antidemocratic.
               While the alternative media have generally taken a cue from
               the 15M movement’s self-appointed leaders and described it,
               in the words of these leaders, as a movement for “real
               democracy now,” the chants in the protests and the comments
               in the assemblies leave no doubt—at least in Barcelona, where
               this movement is strongest—people are increasingly
               abandoning the concept of democracy and moving towards a
               growing anticapitalist consensus. There is still plenty of
               democratic rhetoric in the movement, but every month it
15 of 18 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Reﬂections for the US Occupy Movement | The Anarchis... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               seems to wane, and in the most active, dynamic
               neighborhoods, the common ground is not support of
               democracy but the shared opposition to capitalism.
               Meanwhile, the cities that held on to a democratic ideology
               quickly wasted their energies. This should not be a surprise.
               Movements that hope to bring together fascists and
               immigrants, that hope to inspire people by drafting petitions to
               their leaders, that ask us to respect the laws created by those
               who rule us, that underwrite the police’s monopoly on force,
               that insist on an artificial unity maintained by interminable,
               process-heavy and easily manipulated meetings rather than
               trusting the intelligence of decentralization and people’s own
               ability for self-organization, are destined to fail.
               While we must be increasingly communicative to overcome
               social isolation, populism should be shunned like the plague.
               We do ourselves no favor by dumbing down our analysis, while
               we do make strategic errors more likely. Not only is populism
               counterproductive, it can be dangerous as well. At a peak of
               the global anticapitalist struggle in the 1920s, fascism
               appeared within the belly of the movement. Although fascism
               is identified as a rightwing phenomenon, it began with an
               anticapitalist rhetoric that blamed an obscure, elite minority for
               robbing “the nation,” and it recruited heavily from within
               workers’ movements. The bosses quickly supported the new
               fascist movement, giving it protection and resources, as an
               effective way to neutralize revolutionary struggles. The pro-
               democracy movement prevents the worst of fascism by
               promoting tolerance, but in many places it has already won the
               financing of forward-looking elites, hijacked growing struggles

               and steered them in populist, self-defeating directions, and
               marginalized more radical elements, directly assisting in their
               repression.
               From the very origins of the democratic concept, “rule by the
               people” has always been a way to increase participation in the
               project of government, and “the people” have always excluded
               classes of slaves and foreigners, whether inside or outside of
               national boundaries. The question of freedom lies not in who
               rules, but whether anyone is ruled, or whether all are self-
               organizing.
               In this respect, people in the United States have a great
               advantage over those in Barcelona. The Spanish state has
               experienced democracy for less than forty years, and the
               transition from dictatorship was a clear case of shuffling the
               cards, with fascists becoming conservatives and the Socialists
               being allowed into government as long as they didn’t try to
               change the ground rules inherited from the earlier system.
               Historically speaking, it’s an easy mistake for people here to
               make, calling for a “real” democracy as though their own were
               somehow false, or any different from any other democracy
               anywhere else on the planet.
               The United States is the oldest continuous democracy on the
               planet. People there have no excuse for misunderstanding the
               nature of democracy. In fact, among the apolitical majority,
               there may well be a greater contempt for politicians and for
               government in general than in most other countries. The
               welfare states of northern Europe, for example, have
               successfully undermined popular autonomy and created a
               population of dependents and sycophants that, even today, in
17 of 18 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Reﬂections for the US Occupy Movement | The Anarchis... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               the face of growing abuse and governmental fascism, seem
               unable to constitute popular struggles. This innate American
               antiauthoritarianism, though it tends to remain in self-
               destructive or inert forms, could transform into an important
               ingredient for popular struggles.
               In general, people in the United States face severe
               disadvantages in fighting power. The popular struggles of past
               generations were brutally crushed and critical lessons were not
               passed on. People have to start from scratch in a society
               constructed to meet the needs of money. In part because of
               this, people in the US have a unique opportunity to influence
               struggles worldwide, should they overcome the obstacles and
               turn these protests into something powerful. One thing is for
               sure: in the neighborhood assemblies in Barcelona, people
               have been whispering to each other, “Now, there’s even
               occupations starting in the US. Something really big must be
               happening!”
