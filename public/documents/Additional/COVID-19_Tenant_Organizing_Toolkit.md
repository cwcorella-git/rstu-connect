Organizing tools Are you in Chicago and using this toolkit to start talking to and organizing with your neighbors? Make sure you have signed ATU’s petition and survey to be connected with other people organizing in your neighborhood and/or who have the same landlord, and to continue receiving updates and resources from ATU. The Autonomous Tenants Union (ATU) is an all-volunteer organization committed to organizing for housing justice from below and to the left. As an independent collective based in Chicago, we strategize together to defend and enforce our right to dignified housing. We believe that housing is a human right not a commodity! We fight for an end to all evictions, and for community control of housing through the building of popular power. ``` -- ## Page 2 ### Complete Page View ![Page 2 Complete](images/page_002_full.png) II. What happens when you don’t pay rent Although some may try, it is illegal for a landlord to lock you out. The only person that can physically evict you is a sheriff, and the sheriff needs a court order! Read about what a lockout is here. A landlord following the process correctly will serve you a “5 day notice” the day after rent is due or after any grace period they allow you. If you don’t pay the full amount in 5 days, the landlord can enter an eviction lawsuit against (remember, Cook County court filings are still open so they can open an eviction case against you, but they will not be able to pursue it until the moratorium is lifted). You may feel a lot of stress when you get this notice. Just remember this is the beginning of the process. BUT, if you can negotiate an agreement before the landlord enters a lawsuit, you should make every effort to do that. This will save you the headache of having to go to court and find a lawyer. Court process ● The full Eviction Court process, from the filing to the Sheriff changing your locks, can take anywhere between 2-8 months. You can take steps to lengthen it. The landlord cannot accept rent during the full court process, or they have to start over. ● Court dates are typically scheduled at least two weeks after the filing of the lawsuit, sometimes more. The order from the Chief Judge will probably delay this timeline. ● A Sheriff will come to your door to serve you court papers (the summons to court, court date, and the lawsuit’s complaint). Don’t freak out if they come knocking forcefully, they’re just there to serve you papers, not evict you! If they can’t put the court papers in your hand, they have to reschedule another court date another 2 weeks out, and try to re-serve you. ● At your first court date, you can show up yourself and ask for a continuance to find an attorney, typically getting another week. ● After this, we highly recommend you get a lawyer (ATU and other orgs may be able to help). The court process will likely come to a conclusion much sooner if you don’t have a lawyer. If you have a lawyer, the process could go on for months more. ● You can also, on your own, file for a Jury Demand & usually get a Fee Waiver, typically getting another 3 weeks (more resources will be provided here soon). ● The court process ends in an “Order of Possession” which the landlord can take to the Sheriff to officially evict you. The Sheriff’s job is to remove you from your home and change the locks. By organizing with your neighbors and support networks to reach an agreement with the landlord, you can better ensure that you won’t get to this point in the process. ``` -- ## Page 4 ### Figures and Images (1 found) #### Figure: img-000.png ![Figure from page 4](images/page_004_content/img-000.png) -- ### Complete Page View ![Page 4 Complete](images/page_004_full.png) III. Strategy Our power is in our numbers! Whether your demands revolve around staying in your apartment, or getting more time to move, your strategy should be to negotiate a written agreement with the landlord by acting collectively (organizing) with your neighbors and support networks. You can fight to reach an agreement before the landlord files an eviction lawsuit, or during the lawsuit. Organizing will get the best results in either case. Reaching an agreement before a lawsuit Advantages ● You will not have to go to court and will not have a court case on your record or credit history. ● You will not have to deal with the pressures and stresses of the court process, finding a lawyer, etc. Risks ● Not as immediately costly to the landlord. ● All your leverage must come from organizing with your neighbors and/or with community groups if you want to obtain the best results. ● You will have to organize on a shorter timeline. Reaching an agreement during a lawsuit Advantages ● Many court cases result in some kind of settlement, especially if you have a lawyer. ● It is costly for the landlord and can drag out several months, creating an incentive to settle. ● You have the right to a jury trial, which landlords do not want. ● Many eviction cases that are for non-payment of rent result in settlements that give some time to move and/or some rent forgiven, but this is not a guarantee. Risks ● You will have a court case on your record. The only way to get it off your record is to have it “sealed,” and this must be done through a settlement and agreement between you, the landlord, and the judge. It is possible to do, but not a guarantee. A court case on your record can make it more challenging, but not impossible, to find a new apartment. ● Good lawyers that are free or low cost are difficult to come by. ATU and other orgs may be able to help refer you to lawyers, but we can’t count on there being enough lawyers, let alone enough good ones. ● If you can’t pay the rent, the landlord has the legal advantage. REMEMBER: No matter if your objective is to reach an agreement before or during court, you can’t stop organizing. Organizing starts by talking to your neighbors. ``` -- ## Page 6 ### Complete Page View ![Page 6 Complete](images/page_006_full.png) 6. Have the meeting. Remind everyone the day before and the day of the meeting. Do it both en masse and individually. You want as many tenants as possible to be involved. Meeting tips: ● Have a simple agenda. ● Have someone facilitate the meeting. Their job is to keep conversation on topic, include all participants in discussion and make sure every task has someone assigned to it. ● Have someone take notes. Their job is to write down at least the most important points, any decisions, and who commits to doing what. These help with knowing what happened as you move forward and with keeping people in the loop who missed a meeting. TANC’s “Got Your Back Pledge” AKA “Strike Pledge” “The basic idea: You plus any number of other tenants can’t or won’t pay rent. You get your fellow tenants to sign onto a “Got Your Back Pledge” letter that is then sent to the landlord. The letter notifies that landlord of the following: ● There is now an established tenants council; ● All issues relevant to COVID will take place through the tenant council, as a collective, rather than as individuals; ● Certain tenants cannot pay rent during the COVID-19 crisis; ● Tenants who cannot pay are asking for rent suspension due to COVID-19 crisis; ● If the landlord retaliates, the tenants council is prepared to defend their colleagues; ● The maximum tactic on the table is a rent strike, though other actions may be taken. Why we recommend this plan: ● It automatically gives you some legal protection against retaliation by forming a tenants council; ● It produces solidarity with those who cannot/will not pay without asking immediate action; ● It forces the landlord to go on the record about their position in this difficult time; ● It opens up new possible actions later on, and puts tenants in a better position for the long term.” Other Issues to Organize Around Even if you don’t feel confident you and your neighbors can act collectively around paying rent before April 1, there are other issues to organize around that might create the possibility for bigger commitments later. For example, you and your neighbors can form a tenant union and demand the landlord extend tenants’ leases, install doorbells to make deliveries easier, make laundry free for the remainder of the crisis, or bar them from having realtors, inspectors or leasing agents hold walkthroughs during the pandemic. Even small, coordinated actions show your landlord that you’re organized and help to build trust among your neighbors. ``` -- ## Page 8 ### Complete Page View ![Page 8 Complete](images/page_008_full.png)
