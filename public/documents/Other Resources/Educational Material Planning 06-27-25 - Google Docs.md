 Previous Meeting Notes:     Educational Material Planning 6/20/25


Housekeeping/Follow Up
- Stacey made half sheets for mutual aid info to distribute!
     - A few people took one during tabling on 6/22!
     - Could easily be quarter sheets for convenience… Might resize it
         to be smaller once we run out of this first print of ~30.
- From general meeting: Rosa will contact Sunrise Movement about
  collaborating on a zine
     - Nick from Sunrise page layout formatting
     - No strong enthusiasm about having a meeting/specific collab
- Fee transparency AB 121(?) educational handout?
     Fee Transparency AB121
     - Esp. re: payment platforms requiring fees
     - Quarter sheet size
     - Stacey will design
- Quick reference google doc that you can bookmark as a launch page
  for all our stuff:     Educational Material Quick Reference
     - Thoughts on anything that would make that more useful?


Status Updates
  Tenants Rights In Nevada

- Stacey working on the draft… collected some references and need
  more time to go through and compile the information into sections
- Rough plan: divide information into categories like Habitability, Fees
  (including rent increases), Eviction, etc.
- Zine vs. long-form

     - Could include NRS codes on the website for more info with a
         QR code
     - Could have bibliography/sources on back page
     - Half-book/stapled larger zine instead of mini 8-page
- Split into “what are your rights” vs. “what’s missing/lacking” — either
  have “what’s lacking” at the end or divided into each section
  (depending on how much information there is… I suspect there will
  be a lot of lacking protections to point out lol so leaning towards
  including this per section)
     - We don’t have the right to … representation in eviction court but
         in Connecticut we would; We don’t have the right to just-cause
         evictions, but in NY we would
- Requesting input: Should we include some kind of disclaimer?
     - Yes! Risk of lawsuit
     - This is not legal advice / this is a brief overview… consult
         statutes at https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/ or a lawyer for
         situation-specific advice ?
- Check the google drive for old info somewhere? Look in Resources …
  Media Fact Sheet

  Common Tactics Of Landlords

- Stacey added some information from tabling at Idlewild
- From last meeting: Duck will start the doc, Osprey has a few to write
  down

  What Is A Tenants Union

- Nyx researching history of tenants unions
- 10 point plan from Black Panther Party & White Panther Party; call for
  communal housing
     - Article written after 50th anniversary of Black Panther Party
        founding (Oakland North)

  Quotes

- Stacey needs to follow up with Ben on getting Duck/Osprey copies of
  the book! (sorry)
     - Rosa can share a physical copy




Other Business
- Idea:    Tactics
     - Checking information on implementation of Black Panther Party
        plan
- Idea: Zine of a “brief overview” of how to organize a tenants
  association
     - Somebody is coming by to learn how to organize their complex
        during next farmer’s market tabling… could be nice to do an
        accompanying sign (“Talk to your neighbors! Form a tenants
        association!”) + basic intro zine?
     - Draft:
           Brief Overview of How to Organize a Tenants Association
     - Rosa will send a 1-page handout as reference
- Could sell zines as a fundraiser when we have multiples
     - Also offer the information for free on the website


Priorities by July 6 tabling
- How to organize a tenants union mini zine
    - Stacey will help draft
    - Start with 20 & see how that goes
