           Abstract

           The impact of federal land ownership and management is a particularly contentious
           issue in the Western United States. Perhaps most significantly impacted is the State of
           Nevada, which is 87 percent federally owned. Over the last two decades, there has been
           some movement towards state-centered federalism. Former President Clinton was an
           advocate of “reinventing government”, which in part entailed a larger role for state and
           local governments in the policy-making and implementation process. Presidential
           Executive Order 12132, issued by Clinton in 1999, required federal agencies to develop
           “federalism summary impact statements” when creating new policies or altering existing
           rules. Our analysis is a bottom-up look at the impacts of federalism in Nevada counties.
           County officials report that they are not adequately consulted by federal land managers
           and that a lack of consultation impacts on the local planning process and represents a
           cost to local businesses and individual taxpayers. An analysis of Payments in Lieu of Taxes
           indicates that with limited—yet notable—exceptions, the federal government pays a
           larger sum to counties than would be collected if the federal lands were privatized.

           Introduction

           The impact of federal land management has been a longstanding source of concern for
           local governments and economies in the West. Such concerns have once again become a
           relevant point of discussion in the light of Executive Order (EO) 13132 (Clinton, 1999),
           which deals with the nature of federalism. The EO, issued by former President Bill Clinton
           in August 1999, outlined a number of fundamental principles of federalism. The
           following language is contained in the EO—“issues that are not national in scope or
           significance are most appropriately addressed by the level of government closest to the
           people…” (Section 1(a)) and that “(t)he people of the States are free, subject only to
           restrictions of the Constitution itself…to define the moral, political and legal character of
           their lives” (Section 2(d)).2

           In the spirit of the EO, our study focuses on how federal land management impacts on
           local governments and economies. Our work uses personal interviews with county
           officials in selected Nevada counties. The interviews provide qualitative insight into
           local-level concerns about federal land management. Additionally, we employ a basic
           empirical analysis of payment-in-lieu of taxes as well as county-level business patterns.
           The basic empirical analysis illustrates the fragility of local rural economies.

           American federalism at the dawn of the 21st century

           Federalism describes the political relationship between the national government and
           state governments. It is a relationship which is forever changing,3 yet remains a critical
           element shaping public policy. The rise of Progressive politics and the growing
           importance of social welfare and equality-related issues at …

           Public lands and politics

           Our study of federalism's impact on Nevada local governments15 is an attempt to better
           understand the federal–local relationships in light of an apparently significant change in
           …


           Method of study

           In undertaking this research, we had three major goals in mind in our analysis. First, we
           were interested in determining how county governments are impacted by federal land
           management. Governments in rural counties are largely funded by local property and
           business taxes, but receive supplemental Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT)19 …


           Findings

           Our interview questions are listed in the Appendix. The questions addressed specific
           dimensions of local–federal relationships and allowed the interviewee to expound upon
           the nature of the specific concerns facing the county in which he or she worked.
           Additionally, we asked the interviewees if they were aware of EO 13132 and its intended
           impact on local–federal relationships. We also sought to determine if the county officials
           interviewed could identify instances in which they were formally …


           Conclusion

           EO13132 potentially establishes a new direction in the federalism relationship and begs
           the question: What sorts of local impacts are evident in the ever-changing management
           policies of federal lands? The evidence presented in our paper would indicate that the
           “costs” to local communities are unevenly distributed. The “thin” nature of local
           economies necessitates a more expansive understanding of “impact”. The analysis
           presented above would indicate that there is a very low level of confidence …


           Endnote

           We used the Herfindahl—Hirshman Index (Hirschman, 1964, p. 761) as a measure of
           market share in analyzing the relative “thin” quality of county economies in Nevada.23

           The H Index provides us with a measure of market concentration [0, 10,000]. The market
           concentration guidelines used by US Department Justice (USDOJ) offer assistance in
           interpreting the statistic. In anti-trust cases, the USDOJ (2002) employs the following H

             …The BLM, conversely, was historically more devolved than the Forest Service and was a weaker
             agency with greater dependence upon local ranching interests; it grew somewhat more
             independent following enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act in 1976 (Skillen,
             2009). The authority of both agencies over their vast domains has been and continues to be
             challenged by resource users, resource-oriented interest groups, local elected officials in rural
             communities, and occasionally by the states themselves (Cowart and Fairfax, 1988; Fischman and
             Williamson, 2011; Simon and Dobra, 2003). States have historically had a relatively limited scope of
             authority on the federal estate (Babcock, 1996), even as they have increasingly been enrolled in
             other modes of federal policy implementation—particularly since passage of the suite of
             environmental policies of the 1970s that relied upon arrangements of cooperative federalism
             (Babcock, 1996; Fairfax and Cawley, 1991).…
