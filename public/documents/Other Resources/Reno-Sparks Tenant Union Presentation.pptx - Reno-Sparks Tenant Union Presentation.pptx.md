    About us
We believe…
Housing is a human right
• Regardless of income level, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, immigration
  status, and ability
• Everyone deserves a safe, stable, and comfortable home, regardless of circumstance
• We oppose any laws and policies that criminalize houselessness or target unhoused
  people for harassment

                  We fight for tenants, not for housing.

Legislation
Governor Lombardo vetoed legislation

• Offering one-year rent stabilization for seniors


• That reformed rental application fees, increased security deposit transparency, and
  required rental agreements to include a grace period for late rent payments
• That would halt evictions for up to 60 days for renters who have pending
  applications for rental assistance
• Allow local incorporated governments to pass ordinances that would limit the
  amount that landlords can demand for the leasing of a home or renewing a lease
• That would change Nevada’s summary eviction process, requiring the landlord to
  initiate the eviction process with the court

Evictions In Nevada
 Nevada has a rapid summary eviction
 process
 • In most states, the landlord must file an
   eviction lawsuit with the court
 • In Nevada, if a tenant receives a 7-day
   eviction notice, the tenant must file an
   aﬀidavit with the court
 • If they do not, the tenant is evicted


 The eviction process in Nevada places extraordinary burdens on the tenant
                          and favors the landlords
