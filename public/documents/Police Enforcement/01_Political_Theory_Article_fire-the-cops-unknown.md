``` Our Enemies in Blue: A Short

Retrospective

I have been writing about the police for most of my adult life. My interest in

the   subject    is    not    what   is    called     academic—meaning:             dispassionate,

disinterested, abstract, removed. To adopt such an attitude toward injustice

is almost the definition of cynicism, for it assumes that one cannot be

invested and also be honest. It suggests that no one who cares about

freedom or equality can possibly be trusted, though how one might trust

people who do not care about such things remains something of a mystery.

So let me say, at the outset, that I am not impartial or indifferent. I am a

partisan in this fight, and my thinking with regards to the police grows

directly out of my experience with them.




ACTIVE RESISTANCE


I don’t know how many people can look back on their lives and see a single,

defining turning point—a moment where their lives were irreversibly put on

one track instead of another; or rather, on one track rather than any other. A

moment in which only one course of action became possible, and all others

were excluded.

That moment came for me in 1996, in Chicago. The Democratic National

Convention was being held there for the first time since the disaster of 1968,

when police were shown on live television viciously beating protestors,

reporters, bystanders—anyone within a baton’s reach.

Demonstrations were inevitable and, in my thinking, largely pointless.

What was more interesting was an invitation I had received months earlier

to    attend    Active       Resistance,     an     anarchist    “counter-convention”          with

workshops,       discussion      groups,        a   radical   bus    tour,    and   seminars    on

understanding the economy, the media, and so on. I was just out of college,

volunteering     with    223     (the     anarchist    book     shop   in    Portland,   Oregon),

cooking for Food Not Bombs, and petitioning for a ballot initiative to raise

the   minimum         wage.    But   I    was   beginning       to   wonder    about     how   such

activities were supposed to add up to a movement, much less a revolution. I ```

``` didn’t realize it, but I was searching for some direction, some purpose. And

I found it at the hands of the Chicago police.

Near   the   end    of   the   conference,   some    of   the   participants       of    Active

Resistance had organized a march to go, not toward the DNC, appealing to

the delegates, but into the Wicker Park neighborhood, directly addressing

the public. The idea was to communicate both the fact that resistance to

capitalism already existed and to symbolically represent something of our

vision for a better world. Dubbed the “Festival of the Oppressed,” the march

prominently     featured     giant   puppets   and    drums.      Really,     it   was    just   an

innocent little neighborhood parade, albeit one with an anarchist message.

The police attacked. They charged with horses, moved in with clubs. They

pulled people off the streets and threw them into paddy wagons. Later that

night, they raided one of the Active Resistance meeting spaces, freely

spraying mace, hitting people with batons, and knocking them to the floor.

I was, I think, the first casualty. I had been standing in the street, waiting

for the parade to move, when a nearby cop lost control of his horse. The

horse skipped sideways a few steps, knocking me over and crushing my

foot.   The    cops   looked     on,   unmoved,      and    one    of   the    demonstration

organizers scooped me up and carried me to the relative safety of the

sidewalk.

There was a short discussion about what to do with me. I couldn’t walk,

and I needed to go to the Emergency Room. So when a van of hippies

stopped and offered me a ride, I gladly accepted. I got into the van, along

with Missy, my girlfriend at the time. The hippies, two men and a woman,

were members of the anti-nuclear Shundahai network; they were in Chicago

as part of a nationwide tour to raise awareness about the despoiling of

Shoshone land. Behind the van they towed a mock radioactive waste cask.

The van crawled along at the rear of the parade, and our hosts gave me

some ice for my foot. I was nearly delirious from pain, and I didn’t quite

realize what was happening when a traffic cop stepped in front of the van

and waved us over to the curb. As soon as we were stopped, the van was

surrounded by police. They opened the sliding door and immediately struck

me on the shins with a nightstick. They grabbed me by the shoulders and

hair, and threw me to the pavement. The others were also pulled out, and ```

``` lined up by a wall nearby. Eventually two cops grabbed me under the arms

and half-walked, half-dragged me to a paddy wagon. One of them told me,

with a serious voice, that I “scream like a girl.” And one cop, Michael

Shemash, set me down in the paddy wagon, and then proceeded to stomp

repeatedly on my injured foot.

By the time we got to the station I was blacking out from pain. After

booking, they separated me form the others, putting me in a tiny interview

room with a bench and a desk. Soon the room was filled with cops, asking

me questions. They said they needed to complete a form before I could be

transferred to a hospital, but their inquiries quickly moved away from

name/address/birthdate,         toward       questions      about     who     organized        the

conference, and whether there were any drugs in the van. I stopped talking,

and eventually the cops left me alone. I lay down on the bench and passed

out.

I spent that night shivering in a jail cell, hardly sleeping.

For the following year, I repeatedly traveled back and forth, to and from

Chicago,   meeting       with   lawyers,     sitting   in   court,    fighting    the    charges:

disorderly conduct, obstructing a peace officer, and battery. The others in

the van faced similar accusations. When we finally made it to trial, the cops’

story was a mess. They contradicted each other repeatedly, and some of

them   even   contradicted       themselves.     (One       officer   testified   that    I   was,

simultaneously, in the passenger seat by the driver and in the back of the

van by the rear door.) In the end, we were acquitted of all charges. We

learned   later   that   the   judge   had    himself    been    a    cop   during      the   1968

Democratic Convention.

Lawsuits followed. Those of us from the van incident sued over our

treatment, and in 1999 reached a settlement. Meanwhile, the organizers of

Active Resistance sued over the surveillance that was evident throughout the

conference and the raid at the end.

The cops had been under what is called a “consent decree” since the early

’80s. Based on their violations of Constitutional rights in the ’70s, they had

been sued and reached an agreement limiting their intelligence operations.

Similar measures were put in place in cities throughout the country, part of

the society-wide housecleaning after Watergate. In Chicago, the cops had ```

``` violated   that   agreement    repeatedly,      and   Richard        Gutman,   a   movement

lawyer, had made his career suing to enforce the rules—with varying

degrees of success. He took on the Active Resistance case, and, at the same

time, the City of Chicago petitioned to have the consent decree lifted

altogether. They argued that such abuses were a relic of Cold War hysteria,

so the restrictions were no longer necessary; at the same time, and with no

shame at the contradiction, they also argued that in the new context of

counter-terrorism, the restrictions were an impediment to necessary police

                                                                1
work. In early 2001, the court sided with the City.                  Soon, consent decrees

were being scrapped across the country—showing that the present period of

repression, though clearly intensified by the events of September Eleventh,

actually began a bit earlier.




AFTER CHICAGO


The incident in Chicago set the course of my life in several ways. Most

obviously, it had the effect of concentrating my attention on the cops, and on

their political function in particular. I had been looking for political work,

and the Chicago police literally kicked me into action. When I returned to

Portland, I immediately joined Portland Copwatch.

I spent a lot of the next year speaking publicly about my case and raising

the money for travel and legal costs. At the same time, with Portland

Copwatch, I learned how to navigate Portland’s civilian review process and

helped     people   file   complaints;     I    observed       and    videotaped    cops   at

demonstrations; I testified before City Council about policy changes; I

wrote for and helped edit the newsletter The People’s Police Report; I did

support work for people resisting a grand jury investigating the Earth

Liberation Front, and for anarchists in Portland and Eugene caught up in an

early phase of what would later be called the Green Scare. In 1999, several

members of Copwatch joined an affinity group to collect evidence of police

violence    at    the   WTO     protests       in   Seattle,    interviewing       witnesses,

photographing injuries, and collecting rubber bullets. The following year, I

helped draft a ballot initiative to overhaul Portland’s review board. ```

``` As I did that work I inevitably ran up against questions about what the

cops did and why. A lot of police work seemed irrational, pointless, and

even self-defeating. They used force where it wasn’t necessary, provoked

otherwise     harmless     crowds,   prioritized   low-level     offenses,   spied    on

irrelevant peace groups, treated black people as inherently suspicious, and

regularly violated the law without penalty. The level of analysis on the left

was sadly lacking, rarely looking far beyond the racist attitudes of individual

officers,    mechanistic    models    of    capitalist   control,   monolithic       (and

sometimes almost mythological) treatments of the state, and name-calling in

lieu   of   explanation.   Annoyed    and   disappointed,    I   started   reading    the

professional literature—which was hardly better, though naturally the biases

all ran the other direction. I then turned more to history and sociology, still

reading critically and, as often as not, against the grain of the discipline.

Slowly, I started publishing some of the things that I learned, beginning

                                                     2
with studies of police crowd control strategies.

So when the court threw out the Chicago consent decree, I approached

Gutman with an offer. He had told me that he had once won possession of

the entire Chicago Police red squad files, covering most of the twentieth

century. I proposed we use the files to write a book, and he agreed. That

project never got off the ground, but one of the editors we pitched it to—

Nick Mamatas at Soft Skull Press—suggested I write a more general

overview of the police instead. That idea became Our Enemies in Blue.




OUR ENEMIES IN BLUE


I started work on Our Enemies in Blue in the year 2000, and it went to print

in 2004. As I worked on the book full-time during those years, I lived

primarily on the money I won from the Chicago lawsuit. I considered a note

in the acknowledgments to thank the Chicago police for their “grant” to

support my research, but I was afraid people wouldn’t see the joke.

I started, for fairly obvious reasons, by writing the chapter on police

intelligence operations. I finished that, and put it on the shelf in August

2001; the events of the following month meant that I would have to expand

it considerably. That was my first setback. Then, about a year after starting ```

``` the book, Nick left Soft Skull. A whole series of new editors followed, each

less interested than the last. The book came out a year late, and the final

version didn’t even include many of the corrections I had made to the

galleys. A couple years later, when Soft Skull let it go out of print—right

before I went on tour for my second book, American Methods: Torture and

the Logic of Domination—I was happy to offer the title to South End, who

had done a good job with American Methods. The second edition of

Enemies came out in 2007 and, I’m glad to say, included my corrections.

Our     Enemies       in   Blue   has    always      received   a    mixed     reception.   The

Amazon.com reviews are all at one extreme or another—love it or loath it.

Publisher’s     Weekly       was    not    so    ambivalent,      beginning      its   evaluation,

                                                                  3
“Sweeping generalizations and little nuance … ”                       I have been surprised at

the   welcome         I’ve   received     when     I   have   met     radical    criminologists,

especially since other professors told me that they like the book but could

never teach it because of the title. That’s frustrating, but had I chosen a

more polite title—The Police: A Critical History, or whatever—I doubt that

the book would get the same interest from Latino teenagers, ex-Panthers, or

anti-racist skinheads, not to mention the anarchists who did so much to

shape my thinking on these issues in the first place. The title has been

criticized repeatedly as indicating bias, but that’s only true if you take it as

the book’s premise; if you understand it as a conclusion, then you have to

engage the arguments and evaluate accordingly.

The book’s main argument, which I follow and extend in this collection, is

that the primary function of the police is not law enforcement or public

safety,   but   the    preservation       of   existing   inequality.    So,    if   you   want   to

understand what the cops do, you’re better off looking, not at the law, but at

the distribution of power in our society. In other words, the cops’ actions

often make very little sense in terms of crime, but they make a lot of sense

in terms of politics.

In Our Enemies in Blue, I build that case by recounting the history of

policing in the United States, from colonial times to present. I talk about the

use of the police to maintain white supremacy, from enforcing Slave Codes,

to attacking the civil rights movement, to racial profiling. I detail the cops’

defense of capitalism and their preservation of the class system, both their ```

``` attacks against the labor movement and, more generally, the persecution of

the poor and the homeless. And I discuss the history of police spying, and

the evolution of riot control, and how the unionization process has changed

the police institution itself.

Much of that history is heretical, if not exactly novel. None of it was really

hidden, though it has largely been excluded from histories of policing. The

few real insights I was able to muster came largely as the result of reading

across the specialized fields. The slave patrols, for example, are almost

entirely absent from histories of policing, but they’re clearly present in

histories of slavery. And it’s the labor historians, not the police historians,

who document the strike-breaking and union-busting. Too often those who

study the police accept unquestioningly the institution’s presentation of

itself. To challenge that self-image, one must view the police from the

outside—not      only      from      outside   the    profession,     but   from   outside   the

academic canon, outside the discipline of criminal justice.

The major original contribution I think the book made was its argument

that community policing and militarization represent, not opposing trends,

but complementary aspects of a domestic counter­insurgency strategy. That

insight also traces back to Active Resistance. When I asked one of the more

experienced activists why the cops would care about our workshops and

lectures, he gave me a copy of a pamphlet: The New State Repression, by

                 4
Ken Lawrence.        Though Lawrence did not take up the issue of community

policing per se, he did outline the counter­insurgency approach and argued

that it was being implemented in the United States. His essay set me off

reading some of the military literature, especially the work of the British

general Frank Kitson. With this material in mind, as I looked at the changes

in crowd control and the wholesale collection of intelligence, and then

considered     the       interrelations     between      militarization      and   community

policing, the counter­insurgency framework seemed like the best way to

make sense of it.

At   the   time,   I    was   really     uncertain   about   that    argument.    I   strongly

suspected it made me a crack-pot. But, it’s where the evidence led me, and I

couldn’t back away from the conclusion. Now, a decade later, it’s become

increasingly    common          in   the   military    literature   to   discuss   community ```

policing in terms of counter­insurgency.                        I have mixed feelings about the

fact that the Rand Corporation theorists never cite my work.

Of course, there were also mistakes, mis-steps, gaps, and absences. There

is almost nothing in Enemies about Prohibition, for instance, and I was

entirely too dismissive of McCarthyism. It would have been good to discuss

in    some    detail       the    emergence        and    decline      of   the   nineteenth-century

stationhouse soup kitchen, in many places the only public services available

                       6
to the destitute.          And I really should have considered the multiple ways

border policy has shaped policing. I think I was likely too sanguine about

the Community Restorative Justice project in Northern Ireland, given its

sectarian uses and (later) Sinn Fein’s compromise with the reconstituted

Royal    Ulster    Constabulary.             Then,   there’s     the   fact    that    the   police   have

continued to change over the course of the last decade. Most of that change

has    been    predictable—and                predictably       bad:   more       surveillance,       more

militarization, increased scrutiny of Muslims and immigrants—but there

have also been a few surprises, such as the cops’ erratic support for the

                                                     7
Wisconsin public employees’ strike.

In general, though, Our Enemies in Blue is a book I remain proud of. It is

hard to measure the impact of such a thing, but I think the left’s—or at least,

the anarchist movement’s—analysis of policing has improved remarkably in

the past ten years. And as the critique grew sharper, the goals became more

radical. Abolition holds a place on the political spectrum today in a way it

                                                                                   8
really didn’t when I started doing this work in the ’90s.                              I believe that is

chiefly a knock-on effect to the growth of the prison abolition movement

during    that     same          time,       represented       most    prominently           by   Critical

Resistance.       But I like to think I’ve done my bit.




ROSE CITY COPWATCH


Naturally, that bit was not limited to writing and speaking on these issues.

In 2003, in the midst of my work on Our Enemies in Blue, several of us left

Portland Copwatch to form a new organization, Rose City Copwatch. We

specifically      wanted         to   take   the   work    in    a   more     abolitionist    and     more ```

``` movement-building direction. We succeeded on the first point, but had very

limited success on the second—especially as we remained an all-white

group for nearly our entire history.

During the ten years of Rose City Copwatch’s existence (roughly 2003–

2012),    we    did   just   about   everything   we    could   think   of   to   embarrass,

discredit, and de-legitimize the police, and to shift power from the state to

the community. We ran regular copwatch patrols, sometimes in conjunction

with other groups, such as an immigrants’ rights group and the Portland

Community        Liberation     Front   (a   people    of   color-led   group     formed    in

response to the police shooting of an unarmed black man, James Jahar

          10
Perez).        We taught people how to copwatch, and offered public trainings

explaining what one’s rights are when dealing with the police. We offered

leftist groups workshops on understanding and countering repression. We

made posters featuring the photographs of killer cops, and we joined public

campaigns to get particular cops fired. Perhaps most famously, we published

a short pamphlet, Alternatives to Police, profiling several real-world efforts

                                                                          11
to resolve conflict and fight crime without state intervention.

It’s not entirely clear what led to the demise of Rose City Copwatch, but

to some degree I think we were victims of our own success. When we

started, we were denounced by the mayor, police chief, the media, and

                                                  12
various liberals as dangerous anarchists;              by the time we folded, anarchists

were denouncing us as tepid liberals. Our politics didn’t change—which

was maybe part of the problem. We had set out to shift the parameters of

debate, and they shifted. We didn’t shift with them, though, and we became

                                         13
increasingly irrelevant as a result.




FIRE THE COPS


This volume collects several pieces that I wrote in the decade following Our

Enemies in Blue, coinciding almost exactly with the Rose City Copwatch

years. I revise and update some of my arguments from Enemies, and I do so

largely    based      on   my   experiences   with     Copwatch,    and      driven   by   the

questions and the challenges posed by my comrades. Much of the reporting, ```

``` therefore, is centered in the Pacific Northwest, and in Portland, Oregon in

particular. Local events, however, often reflect general dynamics, and I think

my observations and conclusions here have a broader application.

I have also endeavored to apply my analysis of the police to conditions as

they were unfolding: developments in police tactics and strategies, shifts in

the balance of legitimacy between policing and resistance to policing,

unexpected tensions within police departments and within the working class

in the face of austerity, and the difficult choices faced by those advocating

the abolition of policing.

Part One, “The Violence of Policing,” collects articles I wrote about

police violence and the community response—in particular at crisis points.

Part Two, “Cops and Class Conflict” considers the relationship between the

police and workers’ struggles, with special attention to the Wisconsin public

employees’ strike and the Occupy movement. Part Three, “Repression and

Counterinsurgency,” brings in recent evidence to elaborate my theory about

the relationship between militarization and community policing. The last

section, “Fighting Back,” poses strategic questions and offers practical

lessons, largely drawn from my organizing experience.

In each case I have always tried to test my ideas against reality, rather than

the other way around. I have no interest is preserving my theories, if my

theories are wrong. I keep writing about the police, in part to extend, refine,

and correct my earlier thinking; but also because society is never static.

New   questions    continuously     arise,   both   as   new    problems     and    as     new

opportunities.

                                                                                    14
This book can be read as a supplement to Our Enemies in Blue.                           Or it

can be read on its own, as a series of attempts to apply historical lessons to

circumstances     as   they   unfold.   Either   way,    I   hope,   above   all,   that   my

Will Portland Burn? (2004)

It’s a typical story: A white cop killed an unarmed black man at a traffic

stop.

In the time since the incident, details have trickled through the news in a

steady,   depressing   drizzle.   The   victim’s   name,   and   the   officer’s.   The

victim’s criminal record, previous complaints against the cop. Eyewitness

accounts. A coroner’s report. But the accumulation of detail doesn’t always

add clarity. Witnesses disagree, stories differ. It is not clear now, and may

never be made clear, whether officer Jason Sery and his partner, Sean

Macomber, pulled James Jahar Perez over, or whether they just followed

him into the parking lot of the Lucky Day Laundromat. We do not know

whether they ordered him out of the vehicle, or told him to stay put. We do

not know whether Perez attempted to comply with their commands, or

whether he resisted arrest.

But perhaps we know enough: On March 28, 2004, Portland police officer

Jason Sery shot James Jahar Perez three times in the chest, killing him

where he sat; and there was no weapon in Perez’s car.




                                        • • •

For most of a month the city held its breath. The police chief begged the

public for patience, the mayor pled for calm. Black preachers held prayerful

rallies and sermonized on the legacy of Martin Luther King. All the while,

there was one idea on everyone’s mind, though the newspapers worked their

way around the subject and kept a polite distance from the most fierce

possibilities. For weeks the media studiously avoided the word “riot.”

Detective Peter Simpson came close to breaking the taboo when he

worried: “What will people do if we go all the way through this and the

                                                   16
officers are exonerated? How will they react?”

To find the answer, I bypassed the official leadership and went to the scene

of the crime. I visited the Lucky Day Laundromat, where an extensive ```

``` memorial blossomed—a spontaneous display of sympathy, solidarity, anger,

and grief. In the days following the shooting, I walked through the St. Johns

neighborhood, visiting nearby businesses, talking to area residents in their

homes, on the sidewalks, in the parks. I talked to convenience store clerks

and read graffiti. I sought out, as The Clash put it, the neighbors and the

                     17
prophets in bars.

In George Park, a few yards from the site of the shooting, I asked a group

of teenage boys what would happen if Sery wasn’t prosecuted. They debated

the possibilities:

“There about to be a riot, bro. There about to be a riot.”

“I don’t think it’d be as big as a riot … Yesterday I seen the little rally on

the news [and it] seemed pretty peaceful. But I think, you know, probably,

man, it could get out of hand, though. But they don’t want that, they really

don’t.”

“I hear people talking that if they kill one of us, then we gonna kill two of

them.”

“People in the hood is pissed, man.”

“If nothing happens … to this policeman, if nothing happen, bro, then

everybody gonna get even madder, bro, cause this has happened [and] that’s

twice in a row they didn’t do nothin’, bro … So of course everybody gonna

start gettin’ mad, and everybody going to start throwing a riot … I swear to

God, there gonna be a riot, bro. Watch.”

The boys, all black, were sitting on a jungle gym when I approached,

some of them smoking cigarettes, hanging out in the park in the middle of

the day—a schoolday. They were, on the whole, courteous, intelligent, and

articulate. And they had almost no faith in the legal system. When I asked if

they expected Sery to be convicted, they were almost disdainful of the

question. One of them told me: “He gonna get around it and get back on the

job. Probably gonna take a while, but he gonna get back on the job. Nothin’

gonna happen to him.”

``` The sidewalk in front of the Lucky Day is full, near to overflowing. It is

crowded with flowers, stuffed animals, candles and balloons, sympathy

cards   and   hand-painted   signs.   Newspaper   clippings   are   taped   to   the

windows, and photos of Perez, smiling and holding his son. Messages,

written with marker on poster board, say things like: “J-Rock, you will

always be loved and missed” and “Injustice for one is injustice for all.” The

memorial continues to grow, shifting as the candles burn out and the flowers

wither. Then fresh bouquets are added and other candles are lit. New layers

cover the old. And the entire tragic display rests awkwardly beside the

convenience store ice machine, in front of ads for cigarettes and soft drinks,

still visible through the windows.

Grief hangs over this place like a thick fog. Stand here long enough and

you will see tears, hear angry shouting, pleas for some reason why, calls for

justice, recriminations, and efforts at forgiveness. Hope and hopelessness,

sympathy and rage, separated by a moment, a breath, the second it takes to

fire a gun.

There’s a sense of horror in how relentlessly ordinary the place is. A

laundromat beside a convenience store. There must be a hundred places just

like this in Portland. A small row of businesses, a parking lot—thousands

more in cities all around the country. It could be anywhere, and that is the

feeling that clung to me after my first visit—it could be anywhere, any time,

anyone. There is a parking space, a normal, anonymous parking space,

marked off with orange traffic cones. I wonder how long it will be before

someone parks there again.

I’ve left aside many of the details of the shooting, in favor of the most

simple description I can summon. In a very real sense, the details do not

matter. When it comes to forecasting riots, the facts themselves are less

important than what people believe the facts to be.

I’ll give you an example: The coroner’s report cites very high levels of

cocaine in Perez’s system, plus bags of “apparent drug material” found in ```

``` his   mouth      and   in     his    pants    pocket.   This    detail   is    almost   universally

disbelieved in the black community. Ultimately the distrust this indicates is

more significant than mere facts. At the same time, many of the people I

spoke     with   talked       of    Officer   Sery’s    bad   reputation,      though   they   were

generally unclear on the specifics. The Oregonian has since found some

evidence problematizing the drug tests and corroborating Sery’s reputation

                                                          18
as a hothead—but that is hardly the point.                     At the time of my interviews,

public opinion was mostly based on gossip and rumor. But people are

willing to believe in Sery’s bad reputation in a way they aren’t willing to

believe in Perez’s autopsy report. That’s because what they believe in most

of all is the reality of their own lived experiences—experiences of racial

inequality, of police harassment, of poverty. The details of the shooting may

interest jurists and bureaucrats, but the public is rightly focused on the

bigger picture. The particular case is less important than the accumulation

of similar cases. Examined from this perspective, Perez’s drug habit, his

failure   to   signal     a    turn,    and    his   criminal    record       hardly   seem    worth

mentioning.

In this context, there is only one fact that matters: White cops killed an

unarmed black person—again! “Again” may be the most important word in

that sentence. On the one hand, the story is unique, as all tragedies are.

James Jahar Perez was only who he was. He was not the icon of every black

man in America, as Officer Jason Sery is not a stand-in for every cop, good

or bad. But at the same time, the story is typical and it is dangerous because

it is typical. The shooting of James Jahar Perez came less than a year after a

remarkably similar case. On May 5, 2003, Portland Police officer Scott

McCollister shot and killed Kendra James, a 21-year-old black woman, as

she attempted to leave a traffic stop. James was not armed. Anger over the

James shooting was exacerbated after it was discovered that the officers

involved had dinner together before speaking with investigators. Police

administrators struggled to make excuses, both for the shooting and for the

botched investigation; the grand jury refused to indict. Thousands marched

in protest, people of all races.

The Kendra James shooting and resulting protests specifically helped

cement a bond between prominent members of the black community and ```

``` their Latino counterparts. The common experience of police harassment

surely helped produce this solidarity, and the Latino community compared

the James incident to an earlier outrage—the April 2001 shooting of Jose

Santos Victor Mejia Poot.

Jose Mejia, a Latino man, was boarding a public bus when he suffered an

epileptic seizure and became unresponsive. The driver flagged down a

passing squad car, and the cops removed Mejia from the bus, then beat him

in front of witnesses. He was arrested, erroneously placed in a mental ward,

and two days later escaped from his room and refused to return. When the

police    arrived,       Mejia     confronted      them    with    an    aluminum      rod        he   had

removed from a door. Officer Jeffrey Bell shot and killed José Mejía in the

hospital      corridor.     Police     Chief      Mark    Kroeker       awarded      Bell    a    medal,

prompting calls for the chief’s resignation.




                                                  • • •

All this history caught up to Chief Kroeker in August of 2003. Within the

span     of   a    few     days,   three     separate    developments        dissolved       whatever

remained       of    the    chief’s    credibility.     First,   consultants    with        the    Police

Assessment Resource Center blasted the bureau for its handling of shooting

incidents,        citing    the    failure   of    detectives     to    do   things    as    basic      as

interviewing witnesses. Then, five of the nine members of the civilian

review board resigned after their director refused to examine the Mejía case.

And    finally,     Kroeker        took   this    ill-chosen     opportunity    to    announce         the

discipline for Scott McCollister, the cop who killed Kendra James.

McCollister, Kroeker decided, would not be disciplined for the shooting

itself, but he would be suspended five and a half months for showing poor

judgment.

This decision satisfied no one. The police union wanted McCollister

exonerated, and the public at large wanted him fired. The chief was left

without support and the mayor demanded his resignation. Kroeker went on

to head the UN police mission in Liberia, and Assistant Chief Derrick ```

``` Foxworth—a soft-spoken black man raised in the local community—was

promoted to replace him.

Public attitudes about Foxworth are distinctly ambivalent. Some view him

as a good man trying to fix a bad system; others told me he’s “a puppet

[used] to oppress his own people.” In any case, he hasn’t inspired the bitter

hatred that Chief Kroeker did, and in the current crisis he seems more eager

to appease the public than snuggle up to the police union. But his leadership

has not, and is not thought to have, improved policing overall. Martín

Gonzalez, president of the Latino Network, sees no progress: “Nothing has

changed, except that it has gotten worse. In the past year the Portland Police

killed five people of color.”




                                     • • •

It is true that Jose Mejia, Kendra James, and James Perez are not the only

people to be killed by Portland police. But their cases serve as landmarks.

They’re the ones people most readily remember. These landmark cases are

remarkable in three regards. First, they come close to the abstract type:

white   cop   kills   unarmed   person   of   color.   Second,   and   perhaps   more

importantly, they each mark an escalation in public outrage over police

violence. And third, with each increase in tension the authorities have been

more forthcoming with concessions: They gave Jeffrey Bell a medal, but

they suspended Scott McCollister, and they have promised to confront Jason

Sery with a public inquest. These three factors—adherence to the model,

mounting public outrage, and official concessions—are very closely related.

But it is important that we not view the landmark cases in isolation. Even

as a set, three deaths in three years would probably not explain the level of

anger. We need to remember that during the period January 2001 to April

2004, the Portland police shot (or shot at) 22 people and killed nine of

them. Eleven of those the police shot (47.8%) were people of color—this, in

                                                           19
a city that the 2000 census registers as 77.9% white.

The fact that both Kendra James and James Perez were killed during

traffic stops may also be significant. According to the police bureau’s own ```

``` data (released in May 2001), black drivers are 2.6 times more likely to be

                                                   20
pulled over than are white drivers.                     These numbers resonate with Perez’s

own record. Since 1994, he received 19 citations. In eight of these cases

(42%) the only charges were driving without a license or with no insurance

                                                                             21
—violations that would not be evident prior to the stop.

The   cumulative           effect    of    such     discriminatory       treatment     is   not    to   be

underestimated.        In    1968,     the    National       Advisory      Commission         on    Civil

Disorders analyzed 24 riots and noted


    “a typical pattern of deeply-held grievances which were widely shared

    by many members of the Negro community … Specific events or

    incidents exemplified and reinforced the shared sense of grievance …

    With each such incident, frustration and tension grew until at some

    point   a    final      incident,      often     similar   to   the   incidents     preceding        it,

                                                                                             22
    occurred and was followed almost immediately by violence.”


A man who identified himself as Tiny told me he heard the shots that killed

James Perez, and saw the crowd gather at the scene before police had even

moved the body. I asked him about the mood that day and he responded

with one word: “Hostile.” He then told me that people continue to feel

angry, in large part because of previous shootings. He said, “They say, ‘they

just killing over and over and nothing is getting done about it’.” But Tiny

thought the tension might do some good, forcing the authorities to take a

stand against Sery: “It comes at the wrong time, when a lot of others getting

killed … They’re going to make him an example.” Blenda Ryles, Kendra

James’ cousin, had similar hopes: “I don’t think he’s going to get by like

McCollister      did     …     I     think    that    his   punishment       will   be       more    than

McCollister’s was.”

``` neighborhood, the speeches of the civil rights leaders seemed strangely

abstract and even a little out of touch. Speaker after speaker spoke of the

need for change and urged a commitment to nonviolence, but few offered

anything for people to do besides registering to vote. State Senator Avel

Gordly called for better police training, and also asked that we give “full

support to Police Chief Derrick Foxworth.” From podiums and pulpits, the

message has been one of caution, forbearance, and restraint. The clergy in

particular have steadfastly warned against “hate” and “retaliation.”

I asked Caine Lowery, a member of the NAACP chapter at Portland State

                                                                23
University, what he thought about the pleas for calm.                He told me:


    “I don’t think it’s necessary to chill people out. I think there needs to be

    a fiery response from the community to the police department, because

    every single day people are being harassed … and nobody seems to get

    fired up enough. That’s why the police continue to do what they do.

    And when they get a strong response from the community, that’s going

    to stop everything that goes on, I believe—hopefully.”

On April 22, 2004, the grand jury announced its decision not to indict

Officer Jason Sery. The next two days saw two demonstrations, each of

about 250 people. The first, organized by the Albina Ministerial Alliance,

featured repeated calls for peace and a sorrowful rendition of “We Shall

Overcome.” The second, called by the explicitly revolutionary organization

Arissa, took the struggle to the mayor’s front step and advocated the

principle of self-defense—though the march itself was entirely nonviolent.

Neither march approached the numbers of the April 4 rally, which drew

more than a thousand.

On    the   whole,    the   public      response     has     been      understated,   even

anticlimactic.   The   relative   calm   is   hard   to    interpret,   though   numerous

hypotheses   are   available.     Some    credit     the   ministers     for   emphasizing

nonviolence. Others blame the police, for creating a climate where people ```

``` are afraid to voice their opinions. And some point to the division and

relative disorganization of the existing civil rights movement. We might also

consider the fact that, while many people are very angry, hardly anyone was

surprised by the grand jury’s decision. But there seems to be greater

expectations for the police bureau’s disciplinary process—which means that

the crisis is not yet over.

Chief Foxworth has not announced whether Sery will keep his job, or

whether he will be exonerated altogether, or whether (like McCollister) he

will be suspended from duty yet eventually return to the police force.

Whatever discipline the chief sets will then likely be challenged by the

police union, even to the point of arbitration. This creates two potential flash

points in the months ahead—first when discipline is announced, and then

                                           24
when it is reduced in arbitration.              Despite the grand jury’s decision, at

present there remains a cautious sense of hope. If the riots come, it will be

because   these   hopes     have    been   frustrated    yet   again.   People   are   being

patient, but their patience is not endless.

Perhaps   the   current     tension   will    have   dissipated   by   the   time    Sery’s

                              25
discipline is announced.           Even so, the city would be wrong to count itself

as safe. One former city official told me: “The first thing that came to my

mind when I saw it come across the news that night was that—man, many

more of these, you know, there are going to be riots. You can only take so

much as a people, as a community … I give us two or three more and

people are gonna get tired.”

Unless there are real changes, the potential for unrest lingers just below

the calm surface. Beneath the thin crust of civility there lies a reservoir of

grievances, a volatile mix of anger, grief, and despair. Without profound

change, the frustration and resentment will only continue to collect there, to

bubble and to steam.

And what, then, will happen the next time?

``` Cop Killers and Killer Cops: Political

                                                        26
Considerations (2011)

LOS ANGELES: THE DEATH OF A DAY LABORER


On September 5th, 2010, three Los Angeles bicycle cops shot and killed a

Guatemalan day laborer named Manuel Jamines.

The     next     day,   a   crowd     gathered    on   the   corner    in    the   Westlake

neighborhood where Jamines was killed. They assembled a small memorial,

piled debris and set fires in the street, and hurled rocks and bottles at the

cops, reportedly injuring several. Police responded with rubber bullets and

tear gas. They arrested more than two dozen people.

Rioting continued for three nights running.

Seeking to justify the shooting, police claim that Jamines was threatening

passers-by      with     a   knife—a    story     widely   disbelieved       in   the   Latino

community and directly contradicted by two eyewitness accounts. “I did not

                                                                27
see a knife in his hands,” one witness told reporters.                 “He had nothing in

his hands,” another confirmed; “At the moment when the police were

                                28
shooting, he had nothing.”

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa promised an investigation while

simultaneously voicing his support for the police. “These guys are heroes,”

           29
he said.

Los Angeles is just the most recent site of a multi-city policing crisis

affecting the entire West Coast. In Oregon and Washington, as well as in

California, an assortment of legal proceedings, peaceful marches, riots, and

repeated attacks against police and their property all point to the contested

nature     of   police   violence    and   the   slow   normalization        of   violence   in

response.




OAKLAND: EXCEPTIONAL SYMBOLS


The West Coast policing crisis is now well into its second year. ```

``` Oakland seems to have set the tone: On New Year’s Day, 2009, transit

police shot and killed an unarmed black man, Oscar Grant, in front of

numerous witnesses. Video of the incident shows Grant lying facedown,

with his hands behind his back. One cop, Tony Pirone, can be heard calling

                                 30
him a “bitch-ass nigger”;             another cop, Johannes Mehserle, draws his gun

and shoots Grant in the back, point-blank.

Grant’s killing sparked a series of protests and small riots. Largely in

response to the rebellion, the authorities arrested Mehserle and charged him

                 31
with   murder.          More    than   a   year   later,   in    July   2010,    Mehserle   was

convicted—not of murder, but of involuntary manslaughter. The response of

the community was, again, outrage expressed in marches, barricaded streets,

broken windows, dumpster fires, and looting. Damages are estimated at

            32
$750,000.

It was just two months after Grant’s shooting, in March 2009, that a black

ex-con named Lovelle Mixon killed two Oakland cops at a traffic stop, and

then two more during the SWAT raid to bring him in. Mixon died in the

shoot-out.

These two cases immediately came to symbolize the tense relationship

between blacks and the police—a relationship often defined by violence.

Yet both cases are also exceptions to the usual pattern, though they are

exceptions   for        very   different   reasons.      Grant’s    case    is   exceptional—

practically unique—because police are so rarely punished for their violence.

Mixon’s   case     is    exceptional    because,    in     the   conflict   between   African-

Americans and police, the casualties are usually all on one side.




SEATTLE, LAKEWOOD, EVERETT: “WE WILL FIGHT!”


Further north, in Washington state, at least nine cops were shot in the four

                                                                    33
months following Halloween 2009; six of them died.                       Most notably, police

there have faced a series of planned ambush attacks.

In a way, the chain of events began on November 29, 2008, when King

County Deputy Paul Schene beat a teenaged girl in a holding cell. The

following February, the deputy was charged with assault and a videotape of ```

``` the incident was released. He was fired that September, and later tried—but

not convicted.

Almost a year later, in October 2009, Schene was mentioned by name in a

communiqué left at the site of an arson in which several unoccupied police

vehicles were firebombed. A few days later, on October 31, two cops were

shot in a drive-by attack; one died. The suspect in both cases, Christopher

Monfort, was later shot by police, paralyzing him from the waist down. He

is presently awaiting trial in King County Jail. Prosecutors are seeking the

death penalty.

The district attorney argues that Monfort was acting, in part, out of anger

over the Schene incident. Monfort himself has repeatedly referred to the

case in media interviews and in court. At one hearing, he lashed out against

the cops: “We will fight! … We’ve had enough. The people will not take it

any   longer.   We      will   not   take    it   any    longer   …   We’ll     fight   and   we’re

                                                    34
everywhere. You can’t see us coming.”

Monfort acted alone, but others clearly shared his anger. Shortly after the

Halloween ambush, in November 2009, Maurice Clemmons shot and killed

four cops in a Lakewood, Washington coffee shop. Clemmons was later

killed   by   Seattle    police.     Then,    in   April    2010,     Everett    police   arrested

Michael McConnachie for plotting a similar attack targeting local sheriff’s

deputies.




SEATTLE (II): “A TIPPING POINT”


This series of deliberate, planned attacks naturally generated quite a bit of

sympathy for the police, and concern for the hazards they face. But almost

at once, two videotaped beatings and a series of police shootings undercut

the cops’ collective credibility and renewed public anger.

The first video, from April 17, 2010, showed two Seattle cops kicking and

stomping a Latino man. Gang unit Detective Shandy Cobane can be heard

threatening, “I’m going to beat the fucking Mexican piss out of you, homey.

                 35
You feel me?”         The victim was later released without charges.

The second incident came two months later, in June. A white Seattle cop,

Ian Walsh, was filmed hitting a black teenaged girl. The incident began as ```

``` Walsh tried to cite another girl, Marilyn Ellen Levias, for jaywalking. Walsh

grabbed Levias’ arm; her friend, Angel Rosenthal, pushed him away; and

the cop punched her in the face. Levias was arrested for obstructing an

officer, and Rosenthal for assault.

James Kelly, chief executive officer of the Urban League, told reporters,

“The     provocation    by       this      17-year-old   kid   may     have       presented    a

confrontation situation, but the use of violence in the form of a full punch in

the face was just plain wrong … This is another case where we are standing

                                                               36
here, saying, ‘shame on you’ to the Seattle police.”

Then, on August 30, at the very end of summer, Seattle police shot and

killed John T. Williams, a partially deaf Native American woodcarver.

Police say Williams was whittling when Officer Ian Birk approached. He

refused to drop the pocket knife he was working with, and Birk shot him.

A witness to the event described Williams as calm: “His body stance did

not    look   threatening   at     all,”    Amber   Maurina    said.    “[He]      didn’t   look

aggressive at all. He didn’t even look up at the officer.” Then, the gunshots.

“I watched him kind of slowly, sort of gracefully and elegantly, fall to the

                                                                                   37
ground.” She concludes: “From what I saw, it did not look right.”

On September 2, hundreds of people attended a candlelight vigil for

Williams. The next day, Native leaders held a press conference in which

they demanded community representation in the review of the shooting.

According to the Seattle Times, “After the formal remarks, Alex Jackson …

drew the loudest applause when he declared, ‘This policeman should be

                             38
charged with murder’.”             Around eighty people participated in a “speak-

out” against police violence a few days later. Protests continued for months,

and in February 2011 Officer Birk resigned.

Meanwhile, the ACLU wrote an open letter to the mayor, police chief, and

city   council,   calling    for     “basic     changes—a      new     set   of    approaches,

expectations, and daily practices in the Seattle Police Department.” The

letter went on: “Too often, officers have overreacted or escalated incidents

when the subject is an individual of color, disabled, homeless or, otherwise

‘different.’ We fear that the drive for so-called ‘civility’ laws has created a

                                                                                  39
mindset that our streets need to be rid of ‘undesirable’ people.” ```

``` The next day, Tim Burgess, the head of the City Council’s public safety

committee expressed his worries over the effect of the controversy: “the

cumulation of incidents has the potential to reach a tipping point, where

large segments of our community lose confidence in the police … ”




ELSEWHERE IN WASHINGTON: A KILLING SPREE


The police brutality, and the outrage, have not been isolated to the Seattle

city limits: In the week following the death of John T. Williams, police in

the greater Seattle area killed four other people, and shot a fifth. On August

31, the day after Williams’ death, Federal Way police shot and killed David

Charles Young as he fled in a stolen truck; police claim Young was trying to

run over a cop who approached the vehicle. That same day, Pierce County

Sheriffs deputies tased a man who they say was resisting arrest; after

receiving a 50,000-volt shock, the man stopped breathing, and later died.

On September 3, Tacoma cops shot and killed a man holding a knife at a

bus stop. That night, Seattle police shot a reportedly suicidal man who

pointed an AK-47 at them; he survived. The next morning, a deputy in the

town of Gold Bar used a taser against an unarmed man who was yelling in

the street; the 25-year-old man, Adam Colliers, died.

This cluster of fatalities was immediately followed by the death of an Iraq

War vet at the hands of police in Vancouver, Washington (just north of

Portland); the cops say the victim was standing in the street with a handgun,

and refused to put it down. The week-long killing spree was, likewise,

immediately preceded by an August 26 incident in which a Spokane County

deputy killed a 74-year-old Southern Baptist preacher, Wayne Scott Creach,

on his own land. Creach had gone out armed to investigate a strange car on

his property; it turned out to be an unmarked police car. According to

police, Creach refused to put his gun down when ordered. “[My] father was

murdered,” Creach’s son, Alan, says. “I don’t believe it’s written in the

Constitution that when a deputy approaches you have to put your gun

         41
down.”

Meanwhile, in the nearby city of Everett an older drama drew to a close.

In June 2009, Officer Troy Meade shot a DUI suspect seven times as the ```

``` man attempted to drive away. The suspect died at the scene, and Meade was

charged with murder. Almost a year later, in April, a jury acquitted the cop

of all charges. They did so despite another officer’s testimony that the

shooting seemed unnecessary. And yet, in deciding a separate question, the

jury also rejected Meade’s claim that he acted in self-defense.

Meade was satisfied with the verdict. “I’m going back to work,” he

        42
said.




PORTLAND, OREGON: COPS, CLERGY, AND ANARCHISTS


On January 29, 2010, Portland Police officer Ron Frashour shot and killed

an unarmed black man, Aaron Campbell. Campbell was not a criminal

suspect, but was thought to be suicidal. Yet, as Campbell was trying to

surrender, Frashour shot him in the back.

Barely two months later, in March, a Portland cop shot and killed a

distraught homeless man, Jack Collins, as he approached carrying an X-acto

knife.

Then, in May, the Portland police killed again. Keaton Otis, a young black

man, was stopped on a pretext because Officer Ryan Foote thought he “kind

                                          43
of looks like he could be a gangster.”          Police say that when Otis was

pulled over he became belligerent and started shouting obscenities. They

tased him, and he pulled a gun. Otis fired twice, hitting Officer Christopher

Burley in the groin. The police returned fire, striking Otis 23 times and

killing him on the spot.

The death of Aaron Campbell set off a series of protests, and anger

mounted with each subsequent shooting. A coalition of black clergy, the

Albina Ministerial Alliance, took the initial lead, and the Reverend Jesse

Jackson has twice traveled to Portland to urge action. The day after his first

visit, a crowd of some two hundred people marched into City Hall to

confront the mayor. By the time Jack Collins was killed, tensions were so

high that demonstrations began that same evening, including the blocking of

streets and some minor property damage.

As the weeks went on, resistance took several forms: community forums,

leafleting,   street-corner   demonstrations,   copwatch   patrols,   and—with ```

``` surprising regularity—black bloc demonstrations in which windows were

broken, numerous people were arrested, and reportedly, several cops were

injured.    Nighttime     sabotage     has     also   occurred:    police   substations,   a

community corrections office, and the headquarters of the Portland Police

                                                                                      44
Association have all had their windows broken—the police union, twice.

In the meantime, the Police Association president was forced to step down

following two road rage incidents. The police chief was fired, ostensibly for

complaining about her budget. And the mayor took over the responsibilities

of the police commissioner. In November, Frashour was fired, but two years

later, in October 2012, a labor arbitrator ordered him reinstated—with back

pay.




POLITICAL NARRATIVES


The political uses of these stories are familiar enough.

The left mobilizes around the murders of people like Manuel Jamines,

Oscar Grant, Aaron Campbell, and John Williams, advancing a civil rights

or police accountability agenda. Conservatives, often led by police unions,

mobilize around the deaths of cops, pushing a law-and-order agenda—

budget increases, demands for more firepower, longer prison sentences, and

so on. After the Lakewood shootings, for example, Washington passed laws

raising the payments to the families of slain cops, increasing the penalty for

aiding a fugitive, and tightening restrictions on bail. But the particular

demands, while important, are often incidental.

Police shootings serve as an opportunity to discredit the cops, especially if

the    victim   resembles     a   particular   “ideal   type”—socially      disadvantaged

(black, Latino, Native American, homeless, mentally ill, or disabled) and

innocent (unresisting, unarmed, and not credibly accused of a crime).

Police funerals, in contrast, are public pageants that the cops can use to

silence    their   critics.   They   pull   politicians   into    mandatory   displays     of

support, and are dutifully portrayed by the media as memorials of heroism

and sacrifice. For instance, Sergeants Mark Dunakin, Ervin Romans, and

Daniel Sakai, and Officer John Hege—the cops Lovelle Mixon killed—were

honored as “fallen heroes” by the U.S. House of Representatives; both of ```

``` California’s Senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, and Governor

Arnold    Schwarzenegger          all    spoke       at   their   funeral;    20,000      spectators

            45
attended.

In either case, the victim is converted into a symbol.

But there are also important differences. Police shootings are relatively

common, but only rarely create public controversy. Instead, the victim is

usually forgotten, except by those who knew him personally. The cops

involved are often treated as heroes and issued commendations. But nobody

gets a medal for shooting at cops. The best a cop killer can expect is a very

long prison sentence; many die before they make it to trial. Whereas, even

when the cops clearly go too far, they rarely face meaningful discipline, and

murder charges—like those proffered in Oakland and Everett—are rare to

the   point   of   being     anomalous.        Surveying      the   entire     country,    the   San

Francisco Chronicle could find only six cases from the fifteen years before

                                                                                                 46
the Grant shooting. None of the thirteen officers involved were convicted.

Behind these dissimilarities is a greater asymmetry in the way these

stories are used. The left has generally gone out of its way to avoid seeming

                                         47
like it is condoning violence.                It does so for a number of reasons, some

moral or ideological, some strategic, some having to do with legal concerns.

But the point is that the left does not ordinarily read attacks on the police as

individual       acts   of   political      resistance,     but    as   ordinary,    if    extreme,

criminality—that is to say, it accepts the state’s interpretation of anti-cop

violence.

The police, however, do defend their right to kill. And, in particular, they

use those specific instances when they are attacked to justify their much

more general reliance on force. By this account, people who attack the

police are criminals, and the police need to defend themselves. And the

people   the      police     attack   are     also   criminals—and           therefore,    potential

attackers. Thus, the cops represent their own violence as being always

defensive.

Those who seek to justify police violence offer a picture in which heroic

officers put themselves in harm’s way, regularly facing down heavily armed

and violent criminals while rarely resorting to force themselves. You’ve ```

``` heard the speeches, read the op-eds, and seen the cop shows: You know the

story.

The facts, however, tell a different story. The truth is, the police use

violence far more often than it is used against them, and they use it at higher

levels, and with more fatal consequences.




COUNTING CASUALTIES


There are several features that make the recent stories remarkable, but

unfortunately, police violence is not one of them. The police kill people

fairly regularly, and use lower levels of violence as a matter of routine.

No one keeps very good track of the numbers, but the few existing studies

establish something of a pattern: According to a 2005 Justice Department

survey, 19% of the American public had direct contact with the police

during the previous year. Most of these contacts took the form of traffic

stops, and most were unremarkable. Only 1.6% of the people interviewed

reported the use of force or the threat of force. That means, out of every one

hundred people the police come into contact with, they will threaten or use

force against one or two of them. This rate is much higher for blacks (4.4%)

                                                 48
and Hispanics (2.3%) than for whites (1.2%).

That 1.6% adds up quickly. Almost a million people (991,930) were

subject to the use or threat of force at the hands of police sometime in 2005.

In   55%   of   these    cases—approximately    546,000    incidents—force   was

                 49
actually used.        If we got all those people together, you’d have a group as

                                                 50
large as the population of Portland (537,081).

That same year—2005—57,546 officers were assaulted in the line of duty,

representing 11.9 assaults per hundred officers. Most of these reported

“assaults” involved unarmed assailants and produced no injuries. The vast

majority of attackers (80%) used only “personal weapons such as hands,

fists, or feet”; only 3.7% used firearms. Only about a quarter of these

                                                      51
assaults (27.4%) resulted in injury to the officer.

Comparing the numbers we see that the police use violence (546,000

times in 2005) nine times as often as they face it (57,546 times that same ```

``` year).

An analysis of fatal incidents shows a similar imbalance: During the

period 2003–2005, 380 police died on duty. Only 159 of these deaths were

homicides, and 221 were the result of accidents. During that same time,

1,095 people were killed by law enforcement officers in the process of

                                                                52
arrest. That averages 365 per year, or one a day.

Of       the   people    the     police      killed,   nearly      all    were    men     (96.8%).

Disproportionately many were black (30% or 32%, depending on the count,

whereas blacks are 12.8% of the nation’s population). The median age was

      53
33.        Three-quarters (74.2%) were suspected of violent crimes (including

26.1% for crimes against the police); 8% of victims were accused of public

order offenses; 3.9%, property offenses; 2.9%, drug offenses; and 2.5%—

approximately 27 people—were not suspected of any crime at all, but were

being taken into custody for medical or mental health reasons. In 80.1% of

the cases, the victim had a weapon, but only in 16.9% did they fight with

officers; 3.6%—38 people—were killed after they had been restrained.

                      54
96.3% were shot.

In Oregon, during the years in question, no cops were murdered, but 36

people were killed by the police. In Washington: three cops, 35 arrestees. In

                                                         55
California: seventeen cops, 160 arrestees.

If we assume one killer per victim, then there are about 6.7 killer cops for

every one cop killer.

These numbers are in keeping with the long-term pattern: The Justice

Department        reports      that,   between     1976   and     1998,      “8,578      felons   were

justifiably      killed   by    police    in    the   United      States”      while     “1,820    law

                                                                                    56
enforcement officers were murdered” during the same period.

Notice, alongside the imbalance in the numbers, the bias in the language:

Law        enforcement    officers     were    murdered,      while        felons   were   justifiably

killed.




A CRISIS OF LEGITIMACY ```

``` What sets the recent cases apart is, clearly, not the fact of police violence,

but the fact that that violence is being contested. The crisis, in other words,

is not only about violence, but about authority. It is a crisis of legitimacy.

The present crisis—stretching from L.A. to almost the Canadian border—

is evidence that the police have been discredited, first in the eyes of the

public, and then in the eyes of the elites. As a result, the presumption of

legitimacy is shifting, and the special protections the police enjoy are

weakening.

One indicator of this shift is the leveling of murder charges against officers

involved in on-duty shootings. Another indicator is the slate of reforms

being offered to change police practices—in Portland, for example, the

recent strengthening of the police review board after years of delay; and in

the Bay Area, the creation of an auditor’s position to investigate complaints

against   transit   cops.   A   third   is   the   revision   of   judicial   standards   for

justifying violence. In a ruling from December 2009, the Ninth U.S. Circuit

Court of Appeals (which covers all three states under discussion) restricted

police use of tasers; more surprising, that October, the Oregon Supreme

Court ruled that a person has a right to defend himself if police use

excessive force.

Paradoxically, even events that seem to point in the opposite direction—

such as the extraordinary 62-year sentence leveled against two burglars who

shot, but only slightly injured, a Vancouver Police sergeant in 2009—

nevertheless reflect elite anxieties about the public’s unwillingness to cede

to   police   authority.    The   “Extra-long       sentence       [was]   proposed,”     The

                                                                                        57
Columbian newspaper explained, “for [the] sake of deterring imitators.”

But the most important indicator may be the existence of the crisis itself.

Under ordinary circumstances, the police kill with relative impunity. But at

present, the public’s accumulated sense of outrage represents a challenge to

the legitimacy of state violence. It is this challenge—not the violence itself

—that has produced the existing crisis, and it is the crisis that is producing

at least some (small) changes.




RADICAL IMPERATIVES ```

``` The crisis shows that public trust in and political support for the police has

been greatly eroded; the concessions are offered as a bid to win it back. The

investigations, prosecutions, committee reports, and policy changes are real

victories—mostly symbolic, a few substantive. They may, for a while, rein

the police in and put a check on some of the worst abuses. But they will not,

on their own, address the fundamental inequalities that the police act to

preserve.

To address these inequalities, the left needs to be prepared to challenge

police violence, not only in its most spectacular forms, but as it exists in the

normal operations of the institution. That is, we need to challenge, not only

a handful out of the hundreds of police shootings, but also the half-million

times every year that the cops use lower levels of violence.

That means we need to learn to see police violence politically—that is, to

recognize the politics inherent in it.

Violence is a core function of policing. And the injustices of policing both

reflect and reproduce the injustices of our society. The targets of police

attention—and    therefore      also   of   police   violence—reflect   and   reinforce

existing inequalities of both race and class. At the same time, the character

of police violence, and the ideology supporting it—the idea that violence is

a contest between male antagonists; and the casting of police as chivalrous

protectors—is itself deeply complicit in the subjugation of women, and is

historically linked to racial myths about the purity of white womanhood and

                           58
black sexual aggression.

There’s not a review board in the world that can touch these fundamental

inequalities. To do so would require more than some simple revisions to

police policy; it would require the restructuring of our entire society. To be

ultimately effective, then, the fight against police brutality needs to adopt a

police-abolitionist   perspective      rather   than    a   more   limited   reform   or

accountability framework, and it must necessarily be a part of a much

broader social movement.

Our job must be to defeat the cops politically. In the most general terms,

that means broadening, deepening, and extending the crisis. Such an effort

requires that we add to public distrust of the police and undercut public

support. We have to be radical in our approach to each side of this equation ```

``` —going to the root of both the distrust and the support. Public suspicion of

the police, already acute in many corners, can be deepened by exposing, not

just individual abuses, or even whole patterns of abuse, but the basic

function   of    the    institution     and    its    use   of    violence    to   preserve    social

inequality.     Public       support,   meanwhile,          can    be   undercut    by     providing

alternative means to resolve disputes, address interpersonal conflict, and

insure public safety. These are the functions that, however badly the cops

perform them, the public presently feels itself dependent on the police to

provide. Our strategy should be, simultaneously, to attack the core function

of policing and to remove the basis of its legitimacy, thus shifting support

away from the police and toward our social movements.

If the public loses faith in the police, and if it does not feel dependent on

them for protection, then people are less likely to cooperate with the cops

and more likely to resist.

Tactically, we have to learn to use the state’s strength against it—and to

use its weaknesses against it as well. We have to establish the political

conditions such that the cops’ tactical victories become political liabilities,

and their tactical defeats are only signs of their weakness. In other words:

we need to make sure that the cops’ violence costs them in terms of

legitimacy, while violence used against police only shows that they are

vulnerable to attack.




RE-THINKING NON-VIOLENCE


Until recently, the left’s nonviolent posturing has made it hard to recognize

attacks against the police as political resistance. The de-politicizing of anti-

police violence, in effect, cedes to the state the right to define, not only

legitimate force, but legitimate resistance as well. It allows the police to

convert    attacks      against     them       into    a    source      of   legitimacy.      And   it

accommodates           the    narrative   by    which       the    state’s   violence    is   always

defensive, and thus justified. The standard view of anti-police violence

forces the left to seek out and prioritize a few idealized “innocent victims.”

By omission, this legalistic (or moralistic) approach seems to justify the

police use of force so long as it is not, by the state’s standards, “excessive.” ```

``` From the state’s perspective, therefore, police violence is presumably

legitimate; and violence against police is presumably illegitimate. The left

has had a tendency to challenge the first premise and endorse the second.

But if we accept that police violence is political—and not merely a

technical problem—then it follows that we need to understand the violence

against police as political as well. We need a more nuanced analysis of its

causes, of the forces that propel people toward it, of its consequences (both

personally    and     socially),   and    of     its   meaning—its        expressive       content,

intentionality, and implications. In short, we need to discuss the violence

against police not simply in terms of crime, but in terms of resistance.

This is not to say that those who attack the police, or who simply defend

themselves      against   a    police    attack,       have   a   self-conscious        ideological

motivation or an explicit political agenda—though of those mentioned

earlier, Christopher Monfort certainly did.

It is also not to say that the left necessarily needs to condone, endorse,

advocate, or use violence. Violence—whether in general, or in particular

cases—must still be subject to criticism on ethical, political, strategic, and

tactical grounds. I think it’s time the left change its understanding of anti-

cop violence—not because I think we need to use violence against the

police, but because we need to stop the police from using the violence they

face as a pretext to justify the violence they employ.




FIGHTING POLITICALLY


Violence     against    the    police    obviously       challenges      the    state’s   effective

monopoly on force, though it does not on its own challenge the legitimacy

of that monopoly. The social movements opposing police violence, on the

other   hand,   need    to    challenge    the    legitimacy       of   the   state’s   monopoly,

whether or not they employ violence themselves.

Fortunately, there are some signs indicating a growing willingness to

defend, or even praise, those who use violence against the police. Most

prominently,     in   Oakland,     the    International       People’s    Democratic        Uhuru

Movement organized a vigil and march in memory of Lovelle Mixon,

comparing him to “Nat Turner and Gabriel Prosser, enslaved Africans once ```

vilified   and   today   considered    heroes.”        Less   organized,     but   no   less

meaningful, were the small crowds of people taunting cops at the scene of

                                                                                        60
the shooting, and interrupting live newscasts to shout, “Fuck the police!”

More interesting, however, is the fact that these sentiments received even a

modest hearing in the mainstream. Jackson West, writing for NBC online,

produced a thoughtful commentary titled, “Why would anyone cheer OPD

killings?” In answering, he points to the “history of antipathy” between the

local community and the police, and suggests that the conditions that led to

the creation of the Black Panther Party in 1966 largely still exist today:


    “Of the 45 officer-involved shootings from 2004 to 2008, 44 were

    African-American         or    Hispanic.    However,      African-Americans         and

    Hispanics     account    for    only   56   percent    of   the   city’s   population

    according to the 2000 census. More troubling is that in only 60 percent

    of the police shootings was a weapon found on the suspect. And in

                                                                        61
    none of those shootings were any officers reprimanded.”


There has been less vocal support for Christopher Monfort, in Seattle, but

the Urban League’s support for a young woman who did, in fact, assault a

policeman is a small step in the same direction.

Meanwhile, in Portland, the police have been so discredited that, even

while cops face criticism for shooting Keaton Otis, his counter­attack has

been reduced almost to a non-issue. The steadfastly nonviolent Albina

Ministerial Alliance, for example, put the blame squarely on the police:

“Keaton Otis did not have to die and Officer Christopher Burley did not

have to be shot,” Reverend LeRoy Haynes said at the coalition’s press

conference. “Keaton Otis, a citizen of this community, was pursued on an

erroneous assumption that he was a gang member on the basis of his racial

                        62
identity and attire.”

A pacifist group, Portland Copwatch, went even further. In a letter to the

District Attorney, the group cited court rulings limiting the cops’ use of

tasers and affirming the right to self-defense against police brutality. They

then point out that Keaton Otis “was a young African-American man

suffering from mental health issues in a city where people in either one of ```

``` those groups might reasonably fear for their lives at a police encounter.”

And thus they were logically compelled to ask: “isn’t it possible that … he

                                63
had a right to self-defense?”

``` Exclusion Zones: Policing Public

                                                                                    64
Space—with Deadly Results (2011)

The question of who belongs—and that of where one belongs—are, broadly

speaking, political. And the answers, which touch deeply both our ideas of

individual identity and the very definition of community, find their final

expression, very often, through violence—typically, the authorized violence

of the police.

Two high-profile cases in Portland illustrate the point.




THE LONESOME DEATH OF JAMES CHASSE


James Chasse was a well-known figure in downtown Portland, a writer and

musician with a history of mental illness and occasional homelessness. In

September    2006,    the   police   spotted     Chasse   loitering     in   the   recently

redeveloped “Pearl District.” As one officer put it, he was “doing something

                                       65
suspicious or acting just, um, odd.”

Officer Chris Humphreys approached; Chasse ran. The police chased him,

tackled him and beat him. Chasse suffered 26 broken bones (mostly ribs),

48 distinct bruises and abrasions, extensive trauma to the head, and a

                                            66
punctured lung. He died later that day.

                                                                   67
His family sued and received a $1.6 million settlement.               Meanwhile, two

cops were suspended for failing to ensure that the bloodied, unconscious

man   they   were   arresting   received   medical    treatment.      But    no    one   was

                                               68
disciplined for chasing and beating him.

There is no evidence that Chasse committed any crime. The worst he was

accused of was urinating in public. The offense itself builds in an element of

class-bias: It is the equivalent of trespassing under bridges or panhandling,

activities that homeless people resort to in order to survive. In practice,

enforcement of such laws comes very close to criminalizing poverty per se.

In this case, moreover, the accusation was merely an excuse for what

                                                                             69
Commander Donna Henderson later termed a “pretext stop.”                           In other ```

``` words, the police approached, and then chased, and then killed Chasse, not

for anything specific that he did, but simply because, as they saw it, he was

“suspicious”—or rather: “just, um, odd.”

James Chasse died because the cops decided that he did not belong.




“HE COULD BE A GANGSTER”


Nearly four years later, on May 12, 2010, Portland police pulled over a

young African-American man named Keaton Otis, ostensibly for changing

lanes without a signal. It’s not clear exactly what happened next, but within

minutes Officer Christopher Burley had been shot and Otis was dead after

                        70
being shot 23 times.

It was not long before the police were placing the blame on the mental

health system. Burley told the press that he wished Otis had found treatment

for his psychological troubles: “The community as a whole failed Mr. Otis,”

                                      71
he said. “He deserved resources.”

But the police did not stop Otis because of his mental distress any more

than they stopped him because of his driving. The cops involved were part

of the “Hot Spot Enforcement Action Team,” a gang squad concentrating on

                                                                 72
the area surrounding the Lloyd Center shopping mall.                  Police now admit

that they had no evidence that Otis had any history of gang activity. Aside

                                                          73
from a single traffic ticket, his record was clean.            But Officer Ryan Foote

saw a black man wearing a hooded sweatshirt, and thought “this guy …

                                                74
kind of looks like he could be a gangster.”

It is against Portland police policy to single people out solely because of

their race, but Foote’s assessment seems to pass official muster. After the

shooting, the public information officer, Detective Mary Wheat, stated:

“The officers would not have been doing their duty if they had not pulled

             75
him over.”

Again,      we   see   police   policies   unfold   in   ways    that   are   not   only

discriminatory, but deadly. ```

``` POLICING “QUALITY OF LIFE”


In Portland, the standards of public order that the police enforce are shaped

and propelled in large part by the agenda of the local chamber of commerce,

the Portland Business Alliance (PBA). In terms of both dollars spent and

the number of visits to public officials, the PBA is the most active lobbying

                      76
group in the city.

The PBA has been a vocal advocate of “quality of life” policing and was a

major proponent of the “Sit-Lie” law, which prohibited resting or reclining

                      77
on the sidewalk.           Predictably, between August 2007 and June 2008, 72.3%

of the 159 people receiving warnings or citations for violating the Sit-Lie

                           78
law were homeless.              In fact, Mike Kuykendall—then vice president of the

Portland Business Alliance and co-chair of the Mayor’s Street Access For

Everyone       (SAFE)       committee;       now     director     of   services        in    the   Police

         79
Bureau        —admits that the law was designed with the homeless in mind. In

2008, he told the Portland Mercury:


    “The behavior of many of the teenagers and young adults who spend

    their      days   on    Portland     streets    was     the   impetus       behind       the   SAFE

    ordinance,        as    many      businesses      were        impacted       by     the    negative

    impression they were giving downtown … So it makes sense this group

                                                                                80
    is receiving a majority of the warnings and citations.”


Central Precinct Commander (and now Police Chief) Mike Reese agreed:

“The folks we’re really having a problem with are these Road Warrior

          81
youth.”        (Reese      also   said   these     young    people     aren’t    really       homeless,

because they choose to live on the streets.)

After twice being ruled unconstitutional—first in 2004 by Circuit Court

Judge Marilyn Litzenberger, then in 2009 by Circuit Court Judge Stephen

Bushong—the Sit-Lie law was replaced in 2010 with a new Sidewalk

                           82
Management Plan.                The new version does not ban sitting outright, but in

selected    commercial          districts   it   requires    at   least   six   feet    of    clearance ```

``` between the seated individual and any building, essentially forcing people to

            83
the curb.

The PBA’s agenda is clearly outlined in the April–May 2010 issue of its

downtown “Business Improvement District” newsletter, BID News. There

BID chair/representative Michelle Martin explains the problem, as she sees

it:


      “We have seen a group of individuals, who some refer to as ‘Road

      Warriors’ or ‘Summer Travelers,’ begin to return to downtown Portland.

      They are approximately 18–30 years old, can be very unkempt, often

      have unlicensed or unleashed dogs, and regularly engage in illegal or

                              84
      aggressive behavior.”


She then explains several steps the PBA is taking as part of its “Clean and

Safe” program, beginning with the sidewalk law:


      “First, we have been working with Mayor Adams the past few months

      on a new Sidewalk Use Ordinance, which was passed by the Portland

      City Council on May 6 … Second, Central Precinct Commander Dave

      Famous     has   instituted   a    ‘zero   tolerance’   program      to   deal    with

      individuals committing livability offenses downtown.”




HIRED GUNS


The PBA also takes a hand in enforcement. Its “Clean and Safe” program

deploys “42 armed and unarmed security officers, many of them retired

police officers.” In addition, PBA has contracted with the Portland Police

Bureau to provide four bike cops and the Mounted Patrol Unit to police the

                                                                      85
downtown using the organization’s radio dispatch system.

The PBA spends $1.15 million annually—the largest item in its budget—

to contract with a private security firm, Portland Patrol, Inc., which in turn

                                                                 86
leases   sworn    officers   from       the   Police   Bureau.        According    to    the

company’s website, “PPI has the honor of being the only private security

agency in the country to have four full-time police officers housed out of a ```

``` private security office, working hand-in-hand with our staff to improve

                                                                                          87
community and business livability along with chronic nuisance issues.”

Under the terms of the PPI’s contract, its officers are required to “wake up

all individuals who use [the] sidewalk, and business doorways, as sleeping

                                                                             88
locations,” and to “stop offensive conduct wherever possible.”                    Making its

mission absolutely clear, PPI staff have distributed laminated cards to local

businesses, urging then to call the private guards to handle “Homeless

                                                            89
Persons,” “Panhandling,” and the “Mentally Ill.”

Though dressed like cops and often carrying guns, the PPI officers have

no public oversight and cannot make arrests. But they are authorized to

issue warnings and exclude people from city parks. Furthermore, according

to the corporation’s website, their partners in the Police Bureau “frequently

make arrests, write citations for criminal and ordinance violations, or take

other actions based on direct referrals from PPI officers … As a result, our

                                                                        90
PPB officers regularly average over 100 arrests per month!”




EXCLUSION—AND “LIVABILITY”


In addition to its war on the poor, the Business Alliance has also been

supportive   of    the   Drug   Free    Zones,    which     allowed   police      to   exclude

suspected drug dealers from certain designated areas prior to trial. PBA

spokesperson Megan Doern said the law helped create “an attractive, livable

             91
downtown.”

The zones were abandoned in 2007 when it was shown that more than half

the people issued exclusions (59%) were black. (Blacks represent only 6%

                             92
of the local population.)         With the zones defunct, the police, aided with

$50,000 in PBA funding, simply replaced them with the Neighborhood

                                                  93
Livability Crime Enforcement Program.                  The program consists of a secret

list of persistent low-level offenders to be singled out for special attention—

surveillance,     enforcement,    and    felony    prosecution,     plus,    as   a    salve   to

Portland’s   liberal     conscience,    special    access    to   services    like     housing ```

``` assistance and drug treatment. More than half (52%) of the 408 people on

                                  94
the list are African-American.

By the Bureau’s own reporting, in 2009, blacks represented 12% of all

Portland Police traffic stops—twice their percentage of the population. That

same year, if we look at all police stops—not just traffic stops—blacks

represent 21%. Additionally, they comprise 23% of arrests, and 29% of the

                                                  95
incidents in which police report using force.          Those rates have been more

or less constant for the last five years, with black drivers stopped at 2.73

                            96
times the rate of whites.

The   numbers       reflect   something   more   than   the   personal   biases      of

individual police officers. They demonstrate an institutional orientation that

treats blacks as suspects, as hazards, and as targets for violence. The death

of Keaton Otis is one result of this orientation. In September 2009, several

months before he shot Otis, Officer Cody Berne admitted in court that race

                                                  97
is “a factor I’d consider” when making a stop.

Clearly, Berne is not alone. More than a year earlier, James Pitkin, a

Willamette Week reporter, tagged along with the cops during “Operation

Cool Down,” in which police increased their presence in gang-affected

neighborhoods. Pitkin reported that the cops passed by groups of white

people without notice, but stopped, searched, and questioned black and

Latino men when they saw them.

Gang enforcement officer Russ Corno explained: “Profiling—to me, I’m

not scared of that word … If you’re profiling people based just on their race,

that is an issue. We’re profiling people based on crime.” And yet, Pitkin

                                                                                 98
wrote: “Corno is frank about who they’re targeting: young black men.”

The police chief at the time, Rosie Sizer, seemed to endorse this approach.

She told the paper that gang violence


    “is predominantly African-American males being violent against other

    African-American males. So from the sense of criminal profiling as

    opposed to racial profiling, race is in the mix … We do not want to

    target   young    African-American     men    who    are   uninvolved   in   gang

```
    activity. But it’s impossible to perfectly sort … We are never going to

                   99
    be perfect.”




ENFORCING INEQUALITY


The deaths of Otis and Chasse are not generally discussed together, but they

share several common elements that are worth noting.

Neither of these men were, in any real sense of the word, suspects. They

were   stopped   simply   because   they   belonged   to   groups   that   the   police

considered as suspicious in themselves. One was black, and the other was—

                                                 100
or rather, the police labeled him—“transient.”         Both incidents began with

trivial pretexts and ended with deadly violence.

Moreover, both involve police control of public space. In particular, they

show the cops acting to restrict disadvantaged groups from using of the

streets in commercial districts.

In all these respects, the two cases resemble each other. These similarities

show us something of the real nature of proactive and public-order policing.

They show the race and class bias implicit in terms like “quality of life” and

“livability”—at least as they are applied to law enforcement. And finally,

they reveal the violence underlying our systems of race and class privilege.

``` Police Violence and Class Conflict

(2009)

                             101
Interview by Bill Resnick


Bill   Resnick:   Kristian    Williams,   tell   us   about   Officer   Christopher

Humphreys, his record of violence, why his fellow cops and the union came

to his support, and why public officials vacillate, but ultimately tolerate and

approve of police violence. What about the Humphreys case? What does it

show us?


Kristian Williams: Chris Humphreys first came to public attention after the

James Chasse beating death of a couple years ago—I guess three years ago

now. In that case, a mentally ill man fled when police approached. One of

the officers described the reason for the contact: that he was acting oddly,

and they suspected he had been urinating in public. So, they approached and

he fled and they chased him, and at the end of the story, he was beaten to

death. I don’t know of a more polite way to put that.


Bill: And Humphreys was one of the cops who jumped on him?


Kristian: Right. Originally, Humphreys had said that Chasse had fallen and

he had sort of tripped over him. Later, he said that he had taken him down

according to policy, but what exactly happened is not clear there. But that’s

when Humphreys came to public attention.

Shortly after that, Willamette Week got hold of some Police Bureau

records that suggested that Humphreys uses force more often than any other

cop in Portland, except for one.

In one of the earlier cases, Humphreys and three other cops had grabbed a

guy out of his car and hit him with their nightsticks more than thirty times,

landing him in the hospital. It turned out to be a case of mistaken identity.

In another case, Humphreys and one other cop beat up a black college

student. The Oregonian reported on it, because it was one of a string of

cases where people who had had force used against them were brought up

on charges and acquitted. The jurors just didn’t believe the police. ```

``` Most   recently—just    past    the   anniversary     of   the   Chasse   beating—

Humphreys came to renewed attention because he was shown on a security

camera firing a less-lethal shotgun at an unarmed twelve-year-old girl.


Bill: It shot a beanbag. At least it wasn’t a bullet.


Kristian: Yeah, but calling it a beanbag doesn’t really do it justice. It’s

more like a sock full of ball bearings. It’s really more like a rubber bullet

than something that kids would play with at a birthday party. The idea is to

deliver the full force of the shotgun blast, without the penetrative wound.


Bill: Right, horrible bruising.


Kristian: In the video you can see he’s extremely close to the girl. He’s well

within the ten-foot range that they’re supposed to stay outside of.

Dan Saltzman, who’s now Police Commissioner, had ordered Humphreys

home while this most recent case was being investigated. But the police

union mobilized six hundred people in a demonstration to show support for

Humphreys, and Saltzman reversed himself.


Bill: Humphreys is still on desk leave, with pay—though I suppose he

would get pay regardless of a suspension or desk leave.


Kristian: Right. The question here is, does he get a vacation or does he stay

on desk duty? And bizarrely, he wants desk duty.


Bill: Now, who knows why?


Kristian: I think largely it’s the symbolism, about not having to give up his

badge and gun. Otherwise, it’s as though he’s been removed from the force,

even if he gets to come back later.


Bill: What’s interesting is the unanimous support that he got. Six hundred

police went to a rally in his favor, with signs everywhere: “We are all Chris

Humphreys.” I mean, that’s sort of shocking—although it’s only shocking

when you don’t see the pattern. Because, in fact, police almost always

support one another strongly. ```

``` Not all of the cops are violent—and yet, all of them support their most

violent individuals. How do we understand that?


Kristian: Well, policing is inherently violent. It’s built into the activity.

Now, different officers employ it at different rates and at different levels.

Some use it extremely rarely. Some use it very often. Most, actually, use it

rarely. And so, they often point to this fact when they’re accused of being

violent, how rarely individually they use force. But, collectively, they use

force with great frequency. The lower levels of force are routine.


Bill: Right.


Kristian: And the police tend to, in some ways, identify with that aspect of

their operations. I think they often feel as though they are unfairly blamed

for the violence that they employ. So, defensively, they tend to defend all of

the use of force, sort of as a category.

The “I am Chris Humphreys” slogan is particularly telling, in that here,

you would think that this would be one of those cops that other cops would

be   trying    to   distance     themselves       from.   Instead,   they’re   collectively

identifying with him.


Bill: Part of it, though, is the role of the police in a very unequal and

hierarchical society, with lots and lots of people with enormous grievances

and anger. The police recognize that they’re not popular with lots of people.

I mean, they feel themselves under attack and always vulnerable in a society

with vast numbers of guns.


Kristian: It’s interesting that they do have that sense of being sort of

persecuted, but when you look at the actual numbers—according to the

police themselves, they use force far more frequently than it’s used against

them. And they use it at higher levels.

Yet they have this sort of defensive self-image, that they’re using force in

response to always being in danger. And the sense that they’re in danger

somehow       justifies   the   violence   they    use,   even   though,   looking   at   the

numbers, most of the violence they use would have to be characterized as

offensive. ```

``` Bill: That’s for sure. But they are outnumbered. Right?


Kristian: Oh, certainly.


Bill: On the streets, they’re really outnumbered. And what they say is, “If I

can’t tell somebody just to obey my command—even if it’s a little wrong,

even if I’ve got the wrong person—if somebody really talks back to me,

especially   in    public,   where   other   people    can   hear   it,   challenging   my

authority is like challenging my capacity to walk the streets.” I think that’s

what these guys think.

And I’m not sure they’re so wrong. If a cop shows weakness, then when

crowds form around a traffic accident or whatever it might be, then the cops

are afraid of being assaulted. So, it seems to me, they think they have to

insist on being in authority, and so they have to brutalize people who don’t

respect their authority.


Kristian: Everything in their training and their institutional culture pushes

them in that direction. It’s not necessarily that individual officers come to

the job with this authority complex. The job instills in them the sense that

it’s their responsibility to always be in control of every situation, and of

everyone they come in contact with.


Bill: Talking back to a cop, depending on who you are—if you’re a white

person, looking bourgeois and middle class, you can sort of argue with the

cops a little. But, if you look tough, you know, and show any sign of

disobedience, they’ll jump on it, particularly if there’s more than one. Then

they’re going to really begin getting violent.


Kristian: There are different kinds of threat that they’re responding to in

those two situations. On the one hand, they realize that if they cause trouble

for a relatively privileged person, that person can probably cause them some

amount    of      trouble.   You   know,     they’re   going   to    have    better   legal

representation. They may be connected politically. The newspaper may take

it seriously if they show up in a reporter’s office looking like they’ve been

beaten up. Relatively powerless people have less recourse. In that second

situation, the cops are not only under pressure to assert their authority and ```

``` maintain their control, but they are also operating under relatively weak

constraints      because     the   people    they’re    dealing     with   cannot,     in    their

assessment, cause them a lot of problems after the fact. The deck is stacked

in favor of people who are powerless experiencing harassment, the use of

force, arrests, all of it.


Bill: So, there are systemic forces within policing that lead to fairly high

levels of violence.


Kristian: The whole institution is the result of the inequality of the society.

Part of the work that I do in Our Enemies in Blue is trace out the evolution

of the police from the period before we had the modern institution of

policing.   I    show   how    the    municipal    police   force    as    we   know    it   now

developed out of an earlier institution called the slave patrols, which was

explicitly there to control the slave population, and later the entire black

population in the South.

As cities became industrialized, as the police became modernized, they

adapted this system in northern cities as well, to control the working class

as a whole. So, the police, as we have them now, are a direct expression of

the inequality of the society.


Bill: Police have to be this disciplinary institution on basically an unruly

working class and especially unruly poor people, who have their own values

and who are angry about being suppressed. It seems to me that’s part of the

entire picture of industrial societies and capitalism.


Kristian:       Yeah,   that   goes   all   the   way   back   to   the    beginning    of    the

nineteenth century. There was this contest over the character of urban

society and the standards of order that were going to be upheld, versus the

level of freedom that was going to be tolerated. And a lot of that was sort of

a coded conflict, not just between classes, but also between ethnic groups.

The respectable native-born Protestant elites had certain standards of

decorum, whereas the immigrant rabble, which was largely Catholic—the

Irish being the most famous example—had different standards. And the elite

used this new tool that they had, the police force, to impose their standards

on the working population. So things like drinking in public and the whole ```

``` range of public order crimes—gambling and all the other things that we

would now call vice—all that stuff suddenly became matters for official

attention, where before they would have mostly just been tolerated or

informally disapproved of.

We see that continue all the way up to the present, with things like

“quality of life” policing and zero tolerance campaigns. The battle for

public order continues, and it’s not politically neutral. It’s very much about

who gets to determine what kind of city we have and what the standards of

decorum and what the manners and morals of the working class are going to

be.


Bill: But in all of those standards of decorum, there’s a sort of a hidden

agenda. It’s one thing to tolerate drunken white kids on college campuses;

but when it’s young black kids, it’s sort of an expression of a primitive

collective struggle—not headed towards any kind of articulated political

ends, but a threat to those in power. It seems to me that those class

boundaries and ethnic boundaries are still being policed.


Kristian: You said it’s a sort of hidden agenda, but I don’t think it’s hidden

at all. I think it’s perfectly obvious, if you look at it. A lot of the standards of

order they enforce simply have the effect of criminalizing poverty. Things

like the recently discredited Sit-Lie ordinance—which made it illegal to sit

on the sidewalk or lie on the sidewalk—well, that is essentially just making

it illegal to be homeless.

The standards of order aren’t neutral, in terms of their class composition

or    their   racial   implications.   That’s   not   incidental.   That’s   what   those

standards are about. So, yes, that struggle over public space is absolutely

alive.

Time to Kick the Cops Out of the

Labor Movement (2009)

On November 24, 2009, more than six hundred supporters of the Portland

Police Association gathered in defense of one embattled officer, Christopher

Humphreys.    Humphreys      had   been      suspended,   with   pay,   pending

investigation of an incident in which he had fired a less-lethal shotgun at an

unarmed twelve-year-old girl. At the time of the incident, he was already

facing discipline for his role in the beating death of a mentally ill man

named James Chasse.

The cops marched, not in uniform, but in t-shirts and carrying signs

                                       103
reading “I Am Chris Humphreys.”              Such a display should dispel any

illusions about what the police want or what the PPA stands for.

Humphreys’ notable career has been marked by continuous violence. In

addition to these high-profile cases, in 2005 he struck an unresisting suspect

                                                                           104
more than thirty times; it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity.         A

year later, he was implicated in the beating of a black college student

                                 105
(whom a jury later acquitted).         Based on police records, it is estimated

                                                                        106
that only one cop in the city uses force more often than Humphreys.

Cops often complain that it is unfair to judge the entire Police Bureau by

its most dysfunctional officers. But when push comes to shove, and shoving

comes to beating, and beating comes to shooting—the Police Association

always lines up to defend the most brutal practices and the most bigoted

cops.

The last time the PPA mobilized a rally in support of suspended officers it

was because racist cops were harassing black business owners by repeatedly

                                             107
leaving dead possums on their doorsteps.

The interests the Police Association defends are the interests the police

defend. Cops are the hired guns of capitalism and the protectors of white ```

``` supremacy; they stand for a system of power that exploits workers, excludes

the poor, and leaves people of color at the bottom of the social pyramid.

Police “unions” do not, and cannot, represent the interests of the working

class, because police are not workers like other workers. They are part of

the apparatus by which worker organizing is suppressed. Here at the tenth

anniversary of the WTO protests, we should also remember the long and

inglorious history of police attacks on the labor movement—red squad

infiltration, raids on union halls, assaults on picket lines.

The labor movement owes the police nothing—not solidarity, not support,

not our silence. The only thing workers owe cops is a good hard kick in the

ass.

“Cops for Labor”? (2011)

In   February   2011,    Madison,        Wisconsin   became   the   front   line   of   the

American class war.

Governor Scott Walker announced a bill to strip public employees of most

of their union rights. Thousands of workers occupied the Capitol building in

response. Tens of thousands participated in protests outside.

The civilly disobedient unions found themselves with a surprising ally—

the police.

Off-duty cops joined the protests, some wearing “Cops for Labor” and

“Deputies for Democracy” t-shirts. When the governor threatened to close

the Capitol and forcibly end the sit-in, cops showed up with sleeping bags

and stayed the night.

Of course it couldn’t last.

Within a few days the police did clear the protestors out of the Capitol—

first by enforcing rules prohibiting blankets and chairs, then by preventing

new protestors from joining the action, and finally, by escorting out the

remaining stalwarts. A few weeks later, the cops were less gentle, ejecting

protestors who tried to re-occupy the Capitol and prevent the legislature’s

vote. Despite the much-lauded peacefulness of the protests, the cops made

59 arrests at the Madison rallies, and cleared away barricades the protestors

had erected around the Capitol building.

And that is exactly what we should have expected.

In   the   midst   of   the   sit-in,   Wisconsin   Law   Enforcement      Association

executive board president Tracy Fuller confessed that his members would

“absolutely” use force if so ordered. Fuller told reporter Stephen C. Webster

that the notion of resisting orders “hasn’t even come up.” He said: “I’m not

able to even fathom that any of those police officers would not carry out

whatever orders were given … ” Fuller went on: “I guess that’s the one

ironic thing about this … I could be down there confronting my wife with

the protest sign that I made … That’s my job.”

Fuller is not the first officer to experience this ambivalence. The police,

whose job consists in large part of controlling the working class and ```

``` protecting the interests of the rich, are themselves nevertheless often of

working-class extraction and endure many of the frustrations of wage labor.

As individuals, their sympathy for striking workers might be expected; but

as a body—as the police—their role in repressing the labor movement has

been a defining element of the institution’s development.




BACKING UP LABOR


In times of open class conflict the cops have not generally been on the side

of the strikers. That was true in Chicago in 1886, and in Lawrence in 1912,

in San Francisco and Minneapolis in 1934, Detroit in 1995, Charleston in

2000—and        in   dozens   of   other   massacres    and    thousands    of   picket-line

skirmishes.

Nevertheless, there have been exceptions—historic moments when the

police sided with the workers.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, local cops repeatedly

proved unreliable in the face of labor unrest—placing personal or class

loyalty above the demands of the job. That was especially true in small

towns where the cops had social and familial ties with the strikers. For

example, in June 1874, the mayor and sheriff of Braidwood, Illinois refused

to   deputize    Pinkerton    guards.      Instead   they    deputized    striking   miners,

disarmed the Pinkertons, and arrested strikebreakers.

The most famous case, thanks to the John Sayles movie, is that of

Matewan, West Virginia, where Police Chief Sid Hatfield was himself a

former miner. During the 1920 strike, Hatfield enforced the law in ways that

favored the workers, and ultimately engaged in a shoot-out with Baldwin-

Felts Agency goons working for the mine owners. He was acquitted of

murder charges, but later assassinated by detective company gunmen.

Even in cities, where the police were more removed from the larger

community, cops did sometimes refuse to move against strikers.

During    a    1902    streetcar   strike,   the    mayor   of   the   Providence   suburb

Pawtucket openly sided with the striking workers, and the police did almost

nothing to impede their activities. That same year, in New Orleans, the

police didn’t just stand aside, but actually attacked the scabs, arresting them ```

``` on weapons charges and (as one newspaper put it) “slamming them about

unmercifully.”

Police     in    Richmond,       Virginia        faced    criticism     for   their    sympathetic

handling of a 1903 streetcar strike, and the sheriff of nearby Henrico was

even tried for neglect of duty. According to the Virginia Passenger and

Power   Company           (which   made        the    complaint),    Sheriff       Simon      Solomon

provided no protection for the streetcars, refused the militia’s assistance, and

arrested scabs “who had bravely fought in defense of their lives” against

striking workers. He was acquitted.

In 1907, after scabs shot into a crowd of strikers, the San Francisco chief

of police declared “if any strikebreakers start shooting … they will be shot

in return by the police.” Thirteen scabs were later arrested for their part in

the incident.

In 1913, nearly thirty Indianapolis cops refused to ride streetcars during a

strike; citing Mayor Samuel Shank’s public support for the strike, they

managed to avoid discipline. During the 1919 Steel Strike, Cleveland Mayor

Harry Davis ordered police to treat scabs as suspicious persons. Likewise,

during the 1934 Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company strike,

Mayor Daniel Hoan ordered the arrest of 150 strikebreakers.

Historian       James    Richardson        discerns      a    pattern    in   the    way    the    cops

handled strikes:


    “the police tended to follow the lines of power. … If the authorities

    favored        the   workers   or     were     at   least   neutral,    the    police    remained

    neutral. If on the other hand, political leaders and newspapers viewed

    the strikers as un-American radicals or a threat to the town’s prosperity

    ... then the police acted as agents of employers in their strikebreaking

    activities.”




BREAKING RANKS


However,      there      have   also    been   times       when   the     police      took   their   own

initiative    in    supporting         strikers,     disobeying     orders        and    even    facing

discipline. ```

``` In 1877, police in Paterson, New Jersey, refused to participate in anti-

strike activities. In Buffalo, sympathetic cops were suspended during the

1892 switchman’s strike. Chicago police declined to interfere with the

destruction    of    property   during   the   Pullman       Strike    of   1894,   and    even

contributed to the workers’ relief committee; an entire unit was suspended

in response. In Cleveland, 1896, cops were suspended and fined when they

disregarded orders to move against striking workers.

In Columbus, 1910, 32 patrolmen and 23 special officers—about a quarter

of the police force—were suspended when they refused orders to protect

scabs. In 1916, five NYPD patrolmen were fired for refusing to guard trains

during a transit strike. And in 1929, five New Orleans cops resigned rather

than help break a streetcar strike there.

In 1974, Baltimore police, in violation of state law, went on strike in

solidarity    with    the   city’s   AFSCME      workers.      Looting      broke   out,    the

governor sent in the State Police, and the strike was defeated. The police

union was fined $25,000 and its president fined another $10,000.

More recently, during the 1997 UPS strike, Terry Martin, president of the

Houston Police Patrolmen’s Union, issued a memo urging “zero tolerance”

for strikebreaking. He advised officers, “do everything possible to get that

UPS ‘scab’ truck off the road.”

In Portland, where I live, I once saw a police sergeant refuse to clear a

crowd of supporters of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) out of

the lobby of a hotel in the midst of a labor dispute. He told the owner, “We

enforce the criminal law, not labor law.” In that case, the owner went over

his head and an hour later the riot squad showed up, led by a lieutenant.




DISCIPLINE AND COERCION


Of course, those cases are notable precisely because they are exceptions.

More    typically     police    have    responded       to   strikes    with   surveillance,

harassment, arrests, and violence.

In    his   book    Policing   a    Class   Society,   Sidney    Harring      cites   several

mechanisms that serve to maintain the obedience of the police during

strikes. These include racism and ethnic divisions, disdain for unskilled or ```

``` low-wage workers, organizational norms and discipline, the law-and-order

ideology,    the   criminalization        of   strike   activity,   and   incentives     such    as

overtime pay or bonuses. Most of these work by using the personal biases

and    institutional   culture      of   the   police    to   undercut    their   sympathy      for

disobedient workers—especially when those workers are immigrants or

people of color. Furthermore, those officers who participate in strike duty

may receive added financial rewards, while those who avoid strike duty may

lose the respect of their peers or face punishment. This combination of

coercion, compensation, and ideological justification have mostly worked to

keep the cops following their orders and breaking strikes.

But the minority of cases—those in which these controls didn’t hold—

deeply worried the authorities. Individual refusals or small mutinies could

be    handled    by   the   usual    methods      of    discipline.   But   where      the   state’s

coercive apparatus showed signs of systemic failure, the authorities have

been quick to make new arrangements.

The move away from the militia system is a case in point. During the

Great Railroad Strike of 1877, while some militia units simply massacred

strikers, others lent various levels of support to the workers’ cause. In

several Pennsylvania towns—Harrisburg, Morristown, and Altoona—the

militia surrendered to the union. Militiamen openly fraternized with striking

workers     in   Newark,     Ohio        and   Hornellsville,    New      York.   In    Lebanon,

Pennsylvania, the militia mutinied. And in Reading, one militia company

intervened against another to protect the strikers: “If you fire at the mob,

we’ll fire at you.”

It was the experience of this strike that led to the re-organization of the

traditional militia system into the modern, more militarized National Guard

—arguably, a change of Constitutional magnitude.

Similarly, it was the unreliability of small-town cops in cracking down on

labor that led private companies in Pennsylvania to form the Coal and Iron

Police, beginning in 1865. This was a private force, controlled by the

railroads and mining companies, but deputized by the state in exchange for a

fee of one dollar per officer. In 1905, following the Great Anthracite Strike,

this private army was first supplemented and eventually replaced by the first

modern state police force, the Pennsylvania State Constabulary. ```

``` The      State   Constabulary       was   designed       as   a   strikebreaking    force    and

organized along military lines. The men were recruited from throughout the

state to diminish local loyalties; they were housed in barracks to prevent the

formation of community bonds. And they were rigorously trained, strictly

disciplined,      and    drilled    in   military    tactics.      The   Pennsylvania        State

Federation of Labor called them “Cossacks.”




INSTITUTIONALIZED CONFLICT AND VERTICAL SOLIDARITY


We’ve seen far fewer instances of police/labor alliances since the 1930s.

Ironically, however, this decline in solidarity has less to do with militarized

repression than with the institutionalization of the labor movement on the

one hand, and the creation of police unions on the other.

On the first point, it’s important to remember that before the National

Labor Relations Act, unions were widely treated as criminal conspiracies,

strikes as a form of extortion. Class war under such circumstances was

something more than a metaphor.

When unions were legalized, the focus of struggle moved off the streets

and into the courts—to the benefit of the bosses, in the long run. As Howard

Zinn observed, “Unions were not wanted by employers, but they were more

controllable—more stabilizing for the system than the wildcat strikes, the

factory occupations of the rank-and-file.” By 1946 GM’s main demand in

contract talks was “union responsibility for uninterrupted production.”

In the new period of institutionalized unionism there was less actual

conflict, so the cops were less frequently presented with the question,

“Which side are you on?”

Meanwhile, in the 1940s, police started to form their own unions. City

leaders first responded by firing union supporters, but soon offered a path of

least resistance that led away from the main body of the labor movement

and   toward      police-only      organizations.     For      example,      in   1942,    police

commanders            approved     the   creation    of    the     Detroit    Police      Officers

Association in order to undercut a union drive sponsored by the American

Federation of Labor. Likewise, in New York, facing union-friendly court

rulings    and    a    Teamsters    organizing      campaign,       administrators     opted    to ```

``` negotiate     with     the   existing   (and    more   pliable)     Patrolmen’s         Benevolent

Association.

This strategy diminished the possibility of solidarity between the cops and

other public employees, and allowed local governments to treat police

always as a special case. Cops are generally barred from striking, but they

receive more generous pay, health, and retirement benefits. Furthermore,

unions use the bargaining process to insulate the police from meaningful

oversight and accountability. Contract negotiations become, as sociologist

Margaret Levi puts it, an exercise in “collusive bargaining”—taking the

outward appearance of conflict, while actually operating in terms of a

union/management consensus.

The result is a kind of vertical solidarity. The police unions and police

management negotiate a unifying agenda; the unions then function both

internally,   as   a    mechanism       for   preserving     the   loyalty     of   the      low-level

officers, and externally, as the political arm of the police institution overall.

The   police    union        becomes,    at    once,   the    lobbying        body,     the    media

representatives, the fundraising mechanism, the electoral machine, and—

when they participate in demonstrations—the shock troops of the law-and-

order agenda.

Moreover, the police union can earn its keep by defending the indefensible

—allowing commanders and civil authorities to distance themselves from

controversies involving racial profiling or the use of force. Elected officials

need only point to the union contract and insist that it is beyond their power

to discipline the officers involved.

The   power      of   the   police    union   lies   largely     in   its   ability   to    insulate

individual officers, and thus the department as a whole, from political

pressure, civilian oversight, and public accountability. One consequence, as

sociologist Rodney Stark noted forty years ago, was “the emergence of the

police as a self-conscious, organized, and militant political constituency,

bidding for far-reaching political power in their own right.”

In broad terms, the police agenda has been right-wing—suspicious of

social change, intolerant of disorder, hostile to individual or civil rights,

punitive in its response to crime, and quick to justify the use of force. But as ```

LIMITS AND THREATS


The instances in which the police align with labor are remarkable precisely

because    they   are   exceptions.   And   as   exceptions,   they   are   short-lived,

disconnected, isolated occurrences. Yet they point to a possible limit to the

willingness of police officers, individually or as a group, to protect the

interests of capitalists by repressing the legitimate demands of labor.

The interesting thing about Wisconsin is not that the police eventually fell

back into their usual role, but that they briefly threatened to depart from it.

Ultimately, however, this fact may say less about the cops or their unions

than about the severity of the change that Walker and the Republicans are

seeking to impose—a change that does not only weaken, but draws into

question the very existence of public sector unions.

The threat to unions today is so severe that it has disrupted the normal

institutional framework that manages and contains class conflict. The main

purpose of that framework is to minimize social and economic disruption,

and it has always protected the interests of the bosses better than those of

the workers.

Governor Walker may believe that by weakening the unions he can destroy

the labor movement. What he risks, however, is freeing the movement from

its institutional confines. The shifting position of the police is just one

symptom of this destabilizing effect. It is because the new law limits the

legal rights of unions that the ensuing crisis has opened space for increased

militancy.

What cannot be negotiated under the law will inevitably be settled by

other means.

Cops and the 99% (2012)

The first weeks of the Occupy movement were punctuated by two incidents

of police violence which, thanks to video, received widespread public

attention.

On September 24, 2011, in New York City, Deputy Inspector Anthony

Bologna      gratuitously    pepper   sprayed      nonviolent   Occupy        Wall   Street

protestors whom police had trapped in a “kettle”—plastic net barriers used

                     110
to contain crowds.          A month later and a continent away, on October 25 in

Oakland, California, cops fired tear gas at Occupy protestors, hitting Iraq

War veteran Scott Olsen in the face and severely injuring him. They then

                                                         111
attacked the medics who rushed to Olsen’s aid.

These are only the most famous in a long series of similar incidents. In

November, AlterNet ran a perverse sort of “top ten” list, collecting images

of unprovoked police attacks against Occupy, not only in New York and

Oakland (the most visible centers of Occupy activity), but also Portland,

Seattle, Davis, and Denver. They show cops using fists, clubs, tear gas,

pepper spray, and concussion grenades against people who are peacefully

seated, people who have gone limp, people who are simply walking away,

and, as mentioned above, against people who have been trapped in police

“kettles”    and   medics    trying   to   treat   the   injured.   They     show    police

indiscriminately attacking crowds, using violence against very young people

and against very old people—including 84-year-old retired school teacher

                                                                             112
(and self-described “all-around troublemaker”) Dorli Rainey.                       Keep in

mind that the list only represents the most circulated images, and that it was

compiled in mid-November of that year, just two months into the movement.

The police attacks are interesting, in part because the Occupy movement

has been overwhelmingly peaceful, and in part because elements within it

                                                                    113
have pushed a slogan that “Police are part of the 99%.”                   Yet, in city after

city, the cops responded to the peaceful encampments with violence.

And that is, of course, exactly what we should have expected. ```

``` To understand why, we need to look beyond slogans about the 99% and

examine the role of the police in our society, which requires in turn some

understanding of the way our society is organized.




PERCENTAGES AND CLASSES


The 99% trope makes for clever propaganda, but analytically it is nearly

useless.

For one thing, 99% is merely a kind of metaphor to identify the aims of

the Occupy movement—whatever they are—with the interests of the vast

majority. It is just another way of saying “the people” or “the masses.”

In fact, the 1% we’ve been hearing so much about lately only controls

34.6% of the country’s wealth. I say “only” because the top 10% control

                                     114
73.1%. The top 20% control 85%.

But the numbers are largely beside the point. To understand social and

economic inequality we need to think not only in terms of percentages, but

in terms of classes.

Whether 1% or 10%, the point is that at the top of our economic pyramid

there is a group of people whose only function is to accumulate vast

quantities   of   wealth—that’s   called   profit.   They   then   use   that   profit   to

determine how resources will be allocated. As one might expect, some of

that money goes toward making more money. That productive wealth is

called capital; the people who control it are called capitalists; and this

system, taken as a whole, is called capitalism.

Now the capitalists, as we’ve seen, are the minority. The rest of us—the

overwhelming majority, whether or not it is exactly 99%—have to rent

ourselves out to the capitalists. This rent—our wages—is usually at a set

rate and, since the aim of the capitalists is to make money, it is almost

always far less than the wealth that we actually produce.

If the capitalists are good at what they do, then we workers make a little,

and they take the rest. If they’re bad at it, then they start to lose money, and

since the whole idea is to make money, they close up shop and we lose our

jobs. Or—as has been happening lately—the government just gives the

                                                                           115
capitalists money and maybe (but only maybe) we keep our jobs. ```

``` Now, if this all sounds like an enormous scam—well, you’ve got the right

idea.




COPS AND CAPITALISM


So what does that have to do with the cops?

The role of the police, at its most basic, is to keep this system of extortion

in place, and in particular, to keep it in place by using surveillance and

violence to control those portions of the population most likely to cause it

trouble. In other words, to control workers and poor people and—since the

U.S. is stratified by race as well as class—people of color in particular.

This function goes back to the very origin of policing. The modern

institution of the police force, as I argue in Our Enemies in Blue, evolved

from an earlier type of organization called the slave patrols. These slave

patrols    were    militia-based       groups    charged   with   keeping       slaves    on   the

plantations and, just as importantly, preventing revolts. Over the course of

decades, the slave patrols gradually became professionalized and acquired

additional responsibilities, transitioning just after the American Revolution

                                                                          116
into a body easily recognizable as a modern police force.

This dual social function—preserving racial and class inequality—is a

much better indicator of what the police are going to do than are either the

law or concerns about public safety. That function has remained remarkably

stable over the two centuries since the institution emerged, even as laws

have changed. For example, in terms of day-to-day policing, police enforced

pass laws to prevent slaves from traveling, enforced legal segregation in the

days of Jim Crow, and now—in an era of legal equality—they still engage in

racial profiling, which has the effect of limiting the mobility of people of

                                                                    117
color     and    restricting   their    access    to   resources.          Similarly,     in   the

nineteenth century, the cops enforced vagrancy laws, and today—without

having to change their behavior in the least—they enforce laws against

sleeping on the sidewalk, trespassing under bridges, and panhandling.

It is no surprise, then, that collective action intended to address these

social inequalities is met with police repression. The cops, historically, have

been    the     enemies   of   both     the   labor    movement      and    the   civil    rights ```

``` movement. They’ve attacked picket lines, broken up demonstrations, raided

offices,   tapped    phones,        opened   mail,      sent    informants   and    agents

provocateurs into organizations, jailed organizers, and assassinated leaders.

That’s the job. That’s what they do. Why should we expect any different?




POLICE WORK AND POLICE UNIONS


Well, the truth is that some people did expect different—or at least they

hoped for something better. That was the impulse behind the slogan about

police being “part of the 99%.”

An uncharitable person might note that this mistake points to the vacuity

of the “99%” idea. However, one does also have to admit that, by some

measures, the police may qualify as working class: they tend to come from

working-class families, they work for wages, have low social status, and are

organized in unions. All of that—plus, perhaps, the short-lived support

                                                                                         118
some cops showed for labor demonstrations in Wisconsin early in 2011

—may have led some in Occupy to expect that the cops would be on our

side.

What these rather optimistic observers failed to recognize, apparently, is

the fact that the cops’ job, in large part, is to monitor and control the

working population. As I argued in Our Enemies in Blue, that leaves them

                                                         119
in something of an ambivalent class position.                   Patrol officers may stand

at the bottom of their institutional hierarchy, but their profession, taken as a

whole, has to be considered part of the managerial apparatus of capitalism.

Wherever their personal sympathies may lie, their institutional role makes

them the representatives and guardians of the interests of the capitalists.

And     curiously,   the   police    union   is   one   of     the   mechanisms   that   has

developed to ensure they remain reliable in that role.

Just as police work is not like other work, police unions are not like other

unions. Following World War II, as cops began to show an interest in

collective bargaining and other municipal employees gained the right to

organize, police commanders very cannily opened an avenue that would

simultaneously allow for negotiation and avoid the dangers of police joining ```

``` a    broader        labor    alliance.    Police        administrators    started    allowing,

encouraging, or in some cases creating police-only unions.

    From the perspective of the local authorities, these police unions had

several    advantages:       They    institutionalized       negotiations,   which        allowed

conflict within the police department to be resolved through legalistic,

routinized means. Further, separate unions meant that the police could be

always treated as a special case during budget planning and contract talks,

granting them pay, benefits, and pensions far better than those of other

government workers. Police unions organized the cops as cops rather than

as workers, encouraging an identification with the police institution as a

whole and cementing a kind of vertical solidarity. And for all these reasons,

police unions allowed local governments to keep the police in reserve, away

from the main body of the labor movement, and ready to act against striking

workers.

    The implication is that, while some cops may offer signs of support—

from a word of encouragement to a refusal to fire their tear gas—these

actions should be appreciated for what they are: individual expressions of

sympathy,      or    small   acts   of   resistance.     Their   source   will   likely   be   the

conscience of the officer, and the police union will usually not be the

vehicle through which it finds expression. We should encourage this sort of

dissent within the ranks, and, should the need arise, support whistle-blowers

                                                   120
or cops who refuse to perform riot duty.                   But we should not kid ourselves

about the ultimate significance of such acts, or their potential to blossom

into mutiny. Most of these gestures are exactly that—gestures. They may

mean something, but they don’t necessarily do very much to change the

situation. On the other hand, an abundance of sympathy for the police may

have    real   consequences,        not    only    in    terms   of   discouraging        militant

resistance, but also in alienating people of color and anyone else who has

good reason to mistrust people who try to align with the cops.

    My rather cynical take on the issue is this: To the degree that the cops

identify with the workers, good. To the degree that the workers identify with

the cops, bad. ```

``` CROWD CONTROL:

ESCALATED FORCE AND NEGOTIATED MANAGEMENT


I said earlier that we should have expected the police assault, but that’s not

to say that I did expect it. What I expected instead was that the first, mostly

symbolic, fairly non-confrontational Occupations would be ignored—or

face, at worst, pre-negotiated, symbolic arrests—and therefore fade away

owing     to   a    combination           of   winter    weather,      strategic   directionlessness,

                                                                       121
general boredom, and a growing sense of futility.

Instead the cops decided to pour gasoline on what was initially a very

small flame. Detective Bologna single-handedly pushed Occupy Wall Street

                            122
into the headlines,                 and suddenly Occupy was transformed from an

ignorable constellation of tent cities into a political force that politicians had

                           123
to   grapple       with.          Police       violence,    in   other    words,   made     Occupy   a

political problem.

That surprised me. Partly it surprised me because it seemed shortsighted,

but mostly it surprised me because I thought the police had learned this

lesson.

During       the    civil      rights    and     Vietnam       War     period,   police   generally

responded to demonstrations with extremes of violence—not just arrests

and billy clubs, but fire hoses, police dogs, and sometimes live ammunition.

The violence did not surprise civil rights activists; it was, in fact, part of the

plan. Their strategy relied on revealing the brutality of the Jim Crow South,

shocking the conscience of the nation—meaning, really, white northerners

—and embarrassing the U.S. internationally. The more the cops responded

with violence, the more people sympathized with the demonstrators and the

                                                   124
more influence the movement won.

In the decades that followed, the cops largely gave up their “Escalated

Force” model for handling unrest and developed, instead, a strategy of

“Negotiated          Management.”               That       orientation,      which    predominated

throughout the ’80s and ’90s, took a more flexible approach to political

demonstrations. Rather than prohibit them, the cops sought to regulate them

through    permit          requirements         and    agreements        with   responsible   protest

leaders. The cops would allow demonstrations, and even accommodate ```

``` certain forms of civil disobedience; but in exchange, protesters were limited

—or, more often, they limited themselves—to types of action that were

                            125
minimally disruptive.

The peaceful protest/peaceful police ideal of the contemporary liberal

fantasy looks back to this tradition of symbolic actions, symbolic arrests.

The point to remember, however, is that the cops didn’t adopt this approach

out of concern for civil liberties. Their strategy changed, but their aims

remained the same. They moved from hard tactics to soft ones because the

soft   tactics     seemed     like   a   better    way   of    controlling,   and    therefore

neutralizing, social movements.

In some places, the cops seem to have adroitly adopted this approach to

                      126
handling Occupy.             Not long ago, I found myself at lunch with a man who

described himself as a “fixer” for the mayor of a mid-sized western city. He

told me that, so long as the Occupy movement’s actions remain symbolic, as

in his city they had, they aren’t really that much of an issue. The protestors

may symbolically break laws, and the cops may symbolically arrest them.

No one gets hurt, nothing gets broken, and no one loses any money. The

cops—with their polite, peaceful, symbolic arrests—are important to this

strategy, but they are much less important than the protest organizers, with

their polite, peaceful, symbolic tactics. As the Fixer confided in me, he was,

as “liaison to the Occupy movement,” in direct contact with “some of the

older people—guys in their fifties and sixties,” and felt that they could be

                                                                                   127
relied   on   to   control    the    younger      and   more   militant   types.         It   was

interesting for me to see how well the authorities understood the situation—

much better than the protestors: The Fixer, the mayor, and probably the

police recognized that, without a confrontation, the protests were largely

meaningless, while protest leaders naively believed that by avoiding a

confrontation they were actually winning. In fact, the protestors made police

repression unnecessary by making themselves irrelevant. The protest could

be tolerated precisely because it presented no challenge.




TOWARD STRATEGIC INCAPACITATION ```

``` Historically, Negotiated Management worked because both sides developed

a shared set of expectations that nothing too serious would happen at

demonstrations—and for the most part, nothing did.

But as the civil rights movement had out-smarted Escalated Force, it fell

to the anti-globalization movement to outsmart Negotiated Management.

On November 30, 1999, tens of thousands of protestors converged in Seattle

and, using direct action tactics largely developed over years of struggle in

the environmental movement, blockaded the streets of downtown Seattle

and disrupted the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization. The

                                                                                        128
police,   unprepared    for   the   “new    paradigm   of     disruptive    protest,”

reverted to simple force.

Over the next several years, police around the country embarked on a

period of clumsy experimentation. From the outside, their actions often

seemed    strangely   contradictory.   For   instance:   at    the   2000   Democratic

National Convention in Los Angeles, police launched an unprovoked attack

against a crowd listening to music in one of the permitted demonstration

areas; a few days later, when dozens of protestors enacted a sit-in at the

Ramparts station, an LAPD commander accepted a list of their demands,

                                                                           129
and shook their hands while politely placing them under arrest.

Slowly, the police fumbled their way toward a new strategy, which John

                                                                                 130
Noakes and Patrick Gillham describe as “Strategic Incapacitation.”                     This

new approach incorporates some of the features of Negotiated Management,

selectively   applied   to    cooperative    protestors—but,         instead   of   being

established   through   negotiation,   the    conditions      for   demonstrations      are

unilaterally dictated by the police. At the same time, the cops also employ

many of the coercive tactics associated with Escalated Force. These, too, are

applied selectively, targeting groups the cops consider potentially disruptive

—by definition, anyone who doesn’t cooperate with their process or abide

by their rules. But Strategic Incapacitation is not just a blend of the two

older forms. It also includes: extensive surveillance; the management of

space to restrict movement and contain public assemblies; the sharing of

information between police departments (and other agencies); and, focused ```

``` campaigns to shape public perception of the protests through the news

         131
media.

Within this framework, the attacks on the Occupy encampments make

some sense. Though the camps were, by any sober evaluation, purely

symbolic and no real threat to anyone, they had positioned themselves

outside the police-regulated channels of managed protest. In a sense, they

represented a rejection of the cops’ right to dictate the conditions under

which free speech occurs, and at the same time, they embodied the public’s

right to control urban space. In other words, the police had switched the

game, and the Occupy movement switched it again. Therefore the Occupiers

were, in the eyes of the cops, disruptive “bad” protestors. Notice that this

assessment has nothing whatsoever to do with the question of violence or

nonviolence, or even really with basic legality (since the Constitutional

guarantees of the right to peacefully assemble ought, in theory, to trump

local ordinances against sleeping in parks).

What happened next should have been perfectly predictable: The cops

attacked. They attacked violently, in coordinated raids. The used tear gas,

billy clubs, pepper spray, horses. They confiscated tents and made arrests.

They attacked in the press, with horror stories about crime and disease and

armed     insurgents   hiding    in   the   encampments.    They    followed   with

campaigns      of   persistent   harassment    against   people    they   considered

                                                                  132
troublemakers, and tried to co-opt more moderate leaders.

The Occupy movement responded, at least initially, by escalating its

tactics. In some places—Portland and Oakland are two that I know of—

people physically confronted the police to defend the camps. It was a losing

battle, but an important one. Later, the camps gone, the Occupiers moved on

to launch simultaneous blockades of the major West Coast ports. They said,

in effect, You wanna see disruption? We’ll show you some disruption!




CONCLUSIONS


This discussion has several implications for social movements, including

but not limited to Occupy. One is that social movements pose a threat

largely through their potential for disruption. The cops’ job is to neutralize ```

``` that threat—through managerial means if possible, through direct coercion

if necessary. Questions about violence or sabotage or black blocs are in that

sense secondary to the question of disruption or non-confrontation.

It’s important to realize that the police change their tactics, and they

largely do so in response to changes in the movements they’re confronting.

The cops adapt to meet new challenges, which means that social movements

have to innovate in order to regain the advantage. We can’t just do the same

thing over and over again. We have to change the game if we want to win it.

Occupy Wall Street found and exploited—by accident, I suspect—a flaw

in the Strategic Incapacitation approach, and revealed that it had many of

the same problems as Escalated Force. The movement’s use of nonviolent

civil disobedience triggered a police response that was discrediting to the

state and won sympathy for the demonstrators. It also, not incidentally, set

the stage for more disruptive and more militant action later on.

The larger point to remember is that the violence used against the Occupy

movement is in no way exceptional. It is simply part of the normal operation

of the police force. It is not just a matter of the excesses of ill-disciplined or

over-zealous officers. It is a core function of the institution.

The violence police use against activists is only an extension of the

violence   they     use   routinely.   Aside   from   the   question   of   scale,   there’s

nothing unusual about it, and it is not particularly worse than normal

policing. Usually, the cops work in ones or twos, spread out over a large

geographic area. Occasionally, they work in large groups concentrated in a

              133
small area.         But the work is the same: the cops are using surveillance and

violence to manage troublesome populations and hence to preserve the

system of white supremacy and capitalism.

For all of these reasons, it is clear that any movement that looks to

challenge the existing social order—to challenge the fact of gross inequality

—will inevitably face repression at the hands of the police. From this, then,

I conclude that any movement interested in pushing our society in the

direction of greater equality needs, as an inherent part of its work, to

position itself in opposition to the police.

It is not enough to complain when the police attack our demos, if we are

not also objecting when the police attack entire neighborhoods. Not only is ```

``` it unprincipled to treat protest groups as a special case, it is also short-

sighted. Ordinary policing—the kind that happens in neighborhood streets,

away from crowds and television cameras—is also political. It is political in

the sense that it targets already powerless people. And it is political in the

sense that it helps to keep them powerless—it limits their movement, it

monitors their associations, it leads them disproportionately into court and

then prison, and thus it disrupts their lives, limits their future prospects, and

destabilizes their communities. As I hope I’ve made clear, none of that is

accidental. It is, in fact, an inherent aspect of our system of extreme

inequality.

Therefore,   the   struggle   for   equality   and   opposition   to   policing   are

mutually inextricable. Just as any effort to address inequality has to be

prepared to confront the question of police violence—and for precisely the

same reason—any answer to police brutality will have to address the more

fundamental problems of inequality.

Counterinsurgency and Community

Policing (2011)

INTRODUCTION: EXPECT REPRESSION


Oppositional political movements inevitably face—and therefore ought to

expect—repression at the hands of the state. But while quick to condemn

the most obvious and violent manifestations of this repression, especially

when directed against peaceful groups, the institutionalized left has been

                                                                      135
slow to grasp the strategy underlying the state’s approach.

We tend to see repression as the state’s response to crisis, rather than

seeing it also as a means to preserving normalcy. Hence, it has been very

difficult to recognize it in quiet times, and when it does appear it seems like

an exception, an excess, a panicked over-reaction.

But repression does not always come dressed up in riot gear, or breaking

into offices in the middle of the night. It also comes in the form of the

friendly “neighborhood liaison” officer, the advisory boards to local police

departments, and the social scientist hired on as a consultant. Repression is,

first and foremost, a matter of politics: It is the means the state uses to

protect itself from political challenges, the methods it employs to preserve

its authority and continue its rule. This process does not solely rely on force,

but also mobilizes ideology, material incentives, and, in short, all of the

tools and techniques of statecraft. We have to understand repression as

involving both coercion and concessions, employing violence and building

support, weeding opposition and seeding legitimacy. That is the basis of the

counter­insurgency approach.

This essay outlines the counter­insurgency model (“COIN” in the military

jargon), with an emphasis on its domestic application, especially in the

criminal   justice   context.   The   evidence      shows   that,    despite   the    term’s

association   with   colonialism      and   Latin   American        “dirty   wars,”   many

contemporary     counter­insurgency         practices   were   developed       by     police ```

``` agencies inside the United States and continue to be used against the

domestic population.

The     argument        proceeds         through   five    stages.       Part    one   describes    the

counter­insurgency approach as it is presented in military documents and the

professional literature, especially the current U.S. Army Counterinsurgency

Field    Manual        (FM       3-24)     and    recent    studies       produced       by   the   Rand

                   136
Corporation.             The second part illustrates the transfer of COIN theory,

strategy, technique, and personnel from the military to the police, and vice

versa. The third shows specifically how anti-gang efforts in American cities

are shaping and being shaped by military COIN operations abroad. Part four

examines       the     state’s      use    of   non-governmental            or    nonprofit    agencies,

alongside military and police action, to channel and control opposition. And

finally, the conclusion considers some implications for social movements, in

particular those of the left, in their efforts to overcome repression and

achieve political change.

In this context, the title—”The Other Side of the COIN”—has three

distinct meanings, which correspond to the main themes of my argument.

First,   it   refers     to   the    strategic    pairing        of    direct    coercion     and   subtle

legitimacy-building activities. Second, it points to the joint development of

military operations overseas and police control domestically. And third, it

reminds us that when the authorities turn to counter­insurgency it is because

they fear that insurgency is brewing. Wars—especially revolutionary wars—

have two sides.

The state understands that there is a war underway. It is time that the left

learns to see it.




PART ONE:

REPRESSION, COUNTERINSURGENCY, AND

THE STATE

One      of   my     objectives       in   this   paper     is    to    broaden     and     deepen    our

understanding of repression. I hope to show how repression functions in the ```

``` course of the normal operations of the liberal state, and to demonstrate its

effects in contexts that are not usually thought of as repressive, or even

necessarily as political. At the same time, however, I am not seeking to

redefine “repression,” but simply to apply the standard definitions with

greater consistency; so I am employing the term in its usual political sense,

referring to the “process by which those in power try to keep themselves in

power      by     consciously     attempting      to   destroy    or   render    harmless

                                                                   137
organizations and ideologies that threaten their power.”

     “Counterinsurgency,” is not simply synonymous with “repression,” but

has a narrow, technical meaning, which of course relies on the definition of

“insurgency.” U.S. Army Field Manual 3-24, Counterinsurgency, explains:


       “[An] insurgency [is] an organized movement aimed at the overthrow of

       a constituted government through the use of subversion and armed

       conflict …


       Stated another way, an insurgency is an organized, protracted politico-

       military struggle designed to weaken the control and legitimacy of an

       established government, occupying power, or other political authority

       while increasing insurgent control.”


The definition of counter­insurgency logically follows: “Counter­insurgency

is    military,   paramilitary,   political,   economic,    psychological,      and   civic

                                                                 138
actions taken by a government to defeat insurgency.”




ENDS AND MEANS: LEGITIMACY AND STATECRAFT


“Counterinsurgency,” then, refers to both a type of war and a style of

warfare.    The     term   describes   a   kind   of   military   operation     outside   of

conventional army-vs.-army war-fighting, and is sometimes called “low-

intensity” or “asymmetrical” combat. But counter­insurgency also describes

a particular perspective on how such operations ought to be managed. This

style of warfare is characterized by an emphasis on intelligence, security

and peace-keeping operations, population control, propaganda, and efforts

to gain the trust of the people. ```

``` This last point is the crucial one. As FM 3-24 declares: “Legitimacy is the

                   139
main objective.”

                                                               140
The primary aim of counter­insurgency is political.                 That’s why, in the

context of the American occupation of Iraq, we heard career officers arguing

that “victory in combat is only a penultimate step in the larger task of

                           141
‘winning the peace’.”            And it’s the need for legitimacy that they’re

referring to when they say that “Military action is necessary … but it is not

                                                       142
sufficient. There needs to be a political aspect.”

The political ends rely in large part on political means. As David Gompert

and John Gordon write in one Rand report:


    “In COIN, the outcomes are decided mainly in the human dimension,

    by the contested population, and the capabilities of opposing armed

    forces are only one factor in determining those outcomes. The people

    will decide whether the state or the insurgents offer a better future, and

                                                                          143
    to a large extent which of the two will be given the chance.”


Their   report   is   titled,   appropriately,   War   by    Other   Means.     War,   as

Clausewitz observed, is politics by other means. And politics, as Foucault

                                         144
reasoned, is war by other means.               But in counter­insurgency, the means

are not so “other.” In COIN, war-fighting is characterized by the same

elements as state-building—establishing legitimacy, controlling territory,

                                  145
and monopolizing violence.

Consequently, the “newness” of counter­insurgency is in some respects

debatable.   Clearly     there    is   nothing   new   about   repression.    And      the

combination of force and legitimacy is a lot of what makes a state a state.

But, as one participant in a 1962 Rand symposium on counter­insurgency

recalled, at that time there was already a distinctive COIN perspective

emerging—and it was a minority view:


    “Probably all of us had worked out theories of counter­insurgency

    procedures at one time or another, which we thought were unique and

    original. But when we came to air them, all our ideas were essentially

```
    the same. We had another thing in common. Although we had no

    difficulty in making our views understood to each other, we had mostly

                                                                                          146
    been unable to get our respective armies to hoist in the message.”


Clearly, then, something was new.

What sets COIN apart from other theories of repression , I believe, is the

self-conscious acknowledgement that the state needs legitimacy to stabilize

its rule, and that under conditions of insurgency its legitimacy is slipping. In

other words, from the perspective of counter­insurgency, resistance is not

simply a matter of the population (or portions of it) refusing to cooperate

with the state’s agenda; resistance comes as a consequence of the state

failing to meet the needs of the population.

                                                                                          147
It is possible, therefore, to see COIN as representing a “liberal”                              or

                           148
even “radical” politics.          Yet such apologetics miss the larger point. As a

matter of realpolitik the authorities have to respond in some manner to

popular demands; however, COIN allows them to do so in a way that at least

preserves, and in the best case amplifies, their overall control. The purpose

of counter­insurgency is to prevent any real shift in power.

Counterinsurgency        is    all   about      preserving   (or    reclaiming)    the   state’s

authority. Violence and territory are inherent to the project, but it is really

legitimacy—“the         consent       of   the    governed,”     “societal    support”—that

                                                   149
separates the winners from the losers.                    As Gompert and Gordon put it:

“The key in COIN is not to monopolize force but to monopolize legitimate

          150
force.”

The strictly military aspects of the counter­insurgency campaign are, of

course, necessary; but so are the softer, subtler efforts to bolster public

support for the government. Both types of activities have to be understood

as elements of political power.




THEORIES OF REPRESSION


Because they see insurgency as primarily a crisis of legitimacy, the Rand

researchers     argue   that,   conceptually,       the   “War      on   Terror”   has    been   a ```

``` mistake: first, because it identified “terror” as the problem; and second,

because it proposed “war” as the solution.


    “The idea of GWOT [the Global War on Terror] … has fixed official

    U.S. attention on terrorists, with insufficient regard for the hostility that

    exists among vastly larger numbers of Muslims … The indelible image

    of jihadists scheming alone in remote mountain caves is less the reality

    of Islamic insurgency than is far larger numbers of jihadists moving

    freely    among       Muslim   populations       …    [T]error   inspired     by   Islamic

    extremism is part of a larger pattern of Muslim ‘resistance’ that has

    significant popular appeal … [Therefore,] terrorism cannot be defeated

    unless    the    insurgencies      in   which   it   is   embedded    are    successfully

    countered.”


Thus,   the   solution     requires,   not   just   military    might,   but    “intelligence,

political action, civil assistance, and other nonmilitary means that might

curb Islamic militancy more effectively and at less cost and risk” than

                    151
simple combat.            The proposed solution, in other words, follows logically

from the analysis of the problem. Counterinsurgency, therefore, cannot be

understood as a rigid formula to be implemented by rote; it must be

sensitive to the details of the particular insurgency it is facing. And as

important, counter­insurgency operations have to adapt and develop as the

insurgency does.




STAGES OF INSURGENCY


In its adoption of COIN theory, it seems that the U.S. is slowly re-learning

the lessons of the British colonial wars.

In 1971 British brigadier Frank Kitson looked back on his efforts at

holding the empire together in places like Kenya, Cypress, and Northern

    particular to disrupt his efforts at establishing his political organization.

    In practice this is difficult to achieve because for a long time the

    government may be unaware that a significant threat exists, and in any

    case in a so-called free country it is regarded as the opposite of freedom

                                                   152
    to restrain the spread of a political idea.”


Concerns with liberty aside, Kitson recommended that the government act

to restrict the spread of ideas, prevent radicals from achieving influence, and

disrupt their efforts to establish oppositional organizations.

War by Other Means offers a similar analysis. According to Gompert and

Gordon, revolutions (and thus counter-revolutions) go through three stages:

                                                                               153
a proto-insurgency, a small-scale insurgency, and major insurgency.                  At

first, in the “proto-insurgency stage” the movement is


    “small, narrowly based, vulnerable, and incapable of widespread or

    large-scale violence. Proto-insurgents may be barely noticeable, not

    seen as having the potential to inspire insurgency, or dismissed as

    criminals     or   inconsequential   crack-pots.     Therefore,   during   proto-

    insurgency, the most important aspect of COIN is to understand the

    group, its goals, its ability to tap popular grievances, and its potential.

    In   turn,   shaping   the   proto-insurgency’s    environment,   especially     by

    improving governance in the eyes of the population, may deny it wider

    support … ”


In the second stage, as “a small-scale insurgency” the movement begins

“attracting followers beyond its original cadre,” and it may “commit more

daring and destructive acts against the state, not (yet) with a view toward

replacing it, but to demonstrate its capabilities, be taken seriously by the

population, and recruit.” For the government, therefore, “shaping political

and economic conditions to head off popular support for the insurgency is

imperative.” Direct military intervention is not recommended: “As long as

the insurgency is still small, action against it can and should remain a police

and intelligence responsibility.”

If the movement survives, it may develop into a “major insurgency.”

While it is still “essential” that the state gain information on the movement ```

``` and intervene to shape social conditions, at this stage, “forceful action

                                                                                      154
against the insurgents by regular military units may be unavoidable.”




THE SOCIAL SCIENCE OF REPRESSION


Rand advocates early, preemptive action short of direct military force. The

problem is that at the first stage subversion is not obvious and the state may

not know that a threat exists. Worse, the real threat must be understood as

extending beyond the insurgents themselves—the militants, radicals, and

subversives—to include the grievances they seek to address and the social

conditions that produce those grievances.

To meet the challenges of counter­insurgency, the security forces have had

to shift their understanding of intelligence. Since the cause of the conflict is

not just a subversive conspiracy, but necessarily connects to the broader

features of society, the state’s agents cannot simply ferret out the active

conspirators, but need to aim at a broad understanding of the social system.

The U.S. Army Field Manual on Counterinsurgency, FM 3-24, incorporates

this   perspective      arguing    that   strategists   “require   insight   into     cultures,

perceptions, values, beliefs, interests and decision-making processes of

                               155
individuals and groups.”

This    sort   of    intelligence    work    is   concerned   with   questions      that   are

                             156
primarily sociological.            And so, a great deal of FM 3-24 is dedicated to

explicating basic social-science terms like “group,” “coercive force,” and

“social capital.” In fact, the entirety of Appendix B is devoted to explaining

“Social Network Analysis and Other Analytic Tools.” It offers this picture of

how such analysis is practiced:


       “[A] social network is not just a description of who is in the insurgent

       organization; it is a picture of the population, how it is put together and

       how members interact with one another …


       To draw an accurate picture of a network, units need to identify ties

       among     its   members.       Strong   bonds    formed     over   time   by    family,

       friendship, or organizational association characterize these ties. Units

      gather information on these ties by analyzing historical documents and

                                                                                                 157
      records, interviewing individuals, and studying photos and books.”


The security forces can no longer focus narrowly on the hunt for subversives

or terrorists, but must also collect information on the population as a whole.




INTELLIGENCE AND COERCION


As one Rand report explains, counter­insurgency requires that the security

forces collect both “information on specific individuals” and “information

in which the actions or opinions of thousands, perhaps even millions, of

people are highlighted.”

“Why collect such information?” the researchers ask.

The answer they provide is quite revealing. Properly analyzed, the data

can be used in five types of activity: (1) police and military operations “such

as sweeps, roadblocks, or arrests”; (2) assessments of progress in the

counter­insurgency campaign (“How many people have been hurt or killed in

the   war;      what    kind   of   crimes     are     being   committed;       who        is   getting

employment and where; and who is staying put or leaving the country?”);

(3) “the provision of public services, whether security and safety services

(e.g., an efficient 911 system) or social services (e.g., health care, education,

and   public      assistance)”;     (4)     identifying      insurgents      (“distinguish       those

willing    to    help   from   those      eager   to    hurt”);   and,    (5)   the   coercion       of

individuals for purposes of winning cooperation and recruiting informants:

“information about individuals may be necessary to persuade each one to

help the government rather than helping the insurgents.”

This last point shows something of the recursive relationship between

intelligence      and    coercion.     In    an   insurgency,      both      sides    rely      on   the

cooperation of the populace; therefore they compete for it, in part through

coercive     means:      “Those     uncommitted         to   either   side    should       weigh     the

possibility that the act of informing or even interacting with one side may

bring down the wrath of the other side.” Whoever is best able to make good

on this threat will, according to the theory, receive the best information:

                                                                                     158
“The balance of coercion dictates the balance of intelligence.” ```

``` HUNTING THE ELF


John Allison, an anthropologist briefly enrolled in the U.S. Army’s “Human

Terrain System” program, received a stark education in the political uses of

such intelligence. Allison resigned in protest amidst war game exercises

involving military action in “Lakeland,” an imaginary secessionist state to

the northeast of Kansas City. In this training scenario, Human Terrain

Teams are sent in to Lakeland in response to unrest—specifically, anti-coal

actions by the Sierra Club and more radical groups, including the Earth

Liberation Front. The Human Terrain Team students were assigned the

following tasks:


    “1. ‘Find out more details on the criminal activity.’


    2.   Find     out   the   best    conduits   to   pass   ‘information’   (PsyOps     and

    InfoOps) to the local population …


    [3. P]roduce a ‘Research Plan’ to understand the situation at the IATAN

    power plant – people’s concerns, desires, etc., and identify those who

    were ‘problem-solvers’ and those who were ‘problem-causers,’ and the

    rest of the population whom would be the target of the information

    operations to move their Center of Gravity toward that set of viewpoints

    and    values       which   was      the   ‘desired   end-state’   of    the   military’s

                  159
    strategy.”


Meanwhile, in the real world, law enforcement agencies were engaging in a

decade-long       campaign      broadly    targeting   the   environmental     and   animal

rights movements. Much of the police action has seemed ham-fisted and

ridiculous, as when the FBI sent agents to photograph two people handing

                                         160
out leaflets about vegetarianism.

But the peak of the campaign was marked by “Operation Backfire,” a set

of coordinated arrests launched in December 2005. The Backfire defendants

were accused of a series of Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation

Front    arsons   from    the   late    1990s—activities      the   FBI   characterized   as

                              161
“domestic terrorism.”                Ultimately sixteen people were sent to prison, ```

``` serving sentences ranging from three to thirteen years; one other—William

                                                         162
Rodgers—killed himself soon after his arrest.

The investigation into the ELF started to gain traction in 2001 when a

woman in Eugene, Oregon called the police to report her truck stolen. She

named her roommate, Jacob Ferguson, as the likely thief, and the police,

noticing that the theft coincided with an arson at an SUV dealership,

deduced that Ferguson might have started the fire. Both the roommate and

the cops were mistaken, but the error proved lucky for law enforcement.

Twice Ferguson was called before a grand jury and, in 2004, when the cops

finally threatened him with prosecution, he offered them information on

more than a dozen Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front

actions, naming the people involved. Ultimately, he would provide details

on 22 separate acts of sabotage. Ferguson then spent months traveling the

country   and     wearing   a   wire   to    collect   evidence    for   prosecutions.   He

recorded 88 hours of audio, representing forty conversations. After each

new arrest, the police pressed the suspects for information on others. A few

of those arrested fought the charges, or plead guilty without implicating

anyone    else;   most,   however,     gave    evidence    against   their   comrades     in

                                       163
exchange for lighter sentencing.

Backfire succeeded largely thanks to a single lucky break, followed by a

systematic effort to turn activists into informants. But to be able to take

advantage of their good fortunes, the cops needed a substantial amount of

more   general    background      information      about   the    community     they   were

investigating. That effort started at least as early as 1999. The anarchist

journal Rolling Thunder describes the approach:


    “What we know of the early Backfire investigation points to a strategy

    of generalized monitoring and infiltration. While investigators used

    increasingly focused tools and strategies as the investigation gained

    steam—for example, sending ‘co-operating witnesses’ wearing body

    wires to talk to specific targets—they started out by sifting through a

    whole demographic of counter-cultural types … Police accumulated

    tremendous amounts of background information even while failing to

    penetrate     the   circles   in   which    direct    action   was    organized.     The

     approximately 30,000 pages of discovery in the Oregon cases contain a

     vast amount of gossip and background information on quite a few from

                                      164
     the Eugene community.”


It’s likely that the documents released in preparation for trial are only one

small portion of the information actually collected: Circumstantial evidence

suggests that at least some of the Backfire defendants were subject to

                                                                                          165
warrantless wiretaps managed by the National Security Agency.




PART TWO:

MILITARY/POLICING EXCHANGES

In August 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron called William

Bratton to ask his advice concerning the riots sweeping the UK following a

police shooting.

That is a curious and revealing fact, especially as Bratton’s reputation—as

Police Chief in New York, then in Los Angeles—was not built on his

handling of riots or his response to controversial police shootings. He is

known,    instead,    for   declaring       war     on    panhandlers         and     gangs.      Given

Bratton’s     heavy-handed        “zero       tolerance”      approach              and     tough-guy

reputation,   his    advice     was    also   notable:      “Community              policing      is   the

philosophy that saved America in the 1990s,” he told the BBC. “It’s about

                                                                              166
partnership, the police working with the community … ”




THE COMMUNITY POLICING PARADIGM


In   my   book   Our    Enemies       in    Blue,    the   chapter       titled     “Your       Friendly

Neighborhood Police State” is devoted to the argument that the two major

developments in American policing since the 1960s—militarization and

community      policing—are       actually        two    aspects    of    a       domestic      counter­‐

insurgency    program.      I   summed        up    the    idea    with       a    simple    equation:

                                                                                     167
“Community Policing + Militarization = Counterinsurgency.” ```

### Extracted Text

``` In the last few years, the counter­insurgency literature has made this point

explicit.   For      example,      War     by    Other      Means       lists,     among        the    law

enforcement “capabilities … considered to be high priority” in COIN:

“well-trained and well-led community police and quick-response, light-

                                                         168
combat-capable         (constabulary)        police.”           Similarly,         a    Joint       Special

Operations University report, Policing and Law Enforcement in COIN: The

Thick Blue Line, purports:


      “The predominant ways of utilizing police and law enforcement within

      a COIN strategy … consist of the adoption of the community-policing

      approach supported by offensive-policing actions such as paramilitary

      operations, counterguerrilla patrolling, pseudo operations [in which

                                                                         169
      state forces pose as insurgent groups], and raids.”


The     advantages     the     state    receives   from       each     aspect      are      fairly   clear:

Militarization increases available force, but as important, it also provides

increased   discipline       and   command         and      control.   It    re-orders        the    police

agency to allow for better coordination and teamwork, while also opening

space for local initiative and officer discretion.

Community policing, meanwhile, helps to legitimize police efforts by

presenting cops as problem-solvers. It forms police-driven partnerships that

put   additional     resources     at    their   disposal      and     win    the      cooperation       of

community leaders. And, by increasing daily, friendly contacts with people

in the neighborhood, community policing provides a direct supply of low-

                        170
level   intelligence.           These     are    not   incidental      features        of    community

policing; these aspects speak to the real purpose.

In fact, Rand goes so far as to present community policing as its paradigm

for counter­insurgency:


      “[P]acification is best thought of as a massively enhanced version of the

      ‘community        policing’       technique      that    emerged        in       the    1970s     …

      Community policing is centered on a broad concept of problem solving

      by law enforcement officers working in an area that is well-defined and

      limited   in    scale,   with     sensitivity    to    geographic,         ethnic,      and     other

      boundaries. Patrol officers form a bond of trust with local residents,

      who get to know them as more than a uniform. The police work with

      local groups, businesses, churches, and the like to address the concerns

      and problems of the neighborhood. Pacification is simply an expansion

      of   this    concept         to    include     greater      development        and    security

                     171
      assistance.”


The    military’s       use   of   police       theory—in       particular   the    adoption     of   a

“community policing” perspective—shows a cyclical exchange between the

various parts of the national security apparatus.




THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE: IMPORTS AND EXPORTS


Domestically, the unrest of the 1960s left the police in a difficult position.

The cops’ response to the social movements of the day—the Civil Rights

and anti-war movements especially—had cost them dearly in terms of

public credibility, elite support, and officer morale. Frequent and overt

recourse to violence, combined with covert (often illegal) surveillance,

infiltration, and disruption, had not only failed to squelch the popular

movements, it had also diminished trust in law enforcement.

The police needed to re-invent themselves, and the first place they looked

for models was the military. The birth of the paramilitary unit—the SWAT

                                172
team—was one result.                    A new, more restrained, crowd control strategy

                  173
was another.            Military training, tactics, equipment, and weaponry, made

their way into domestic police departments—as did veterans returning from

Vietnam,      and,       more       subtly,      military       approaches     to    organization,

deployment, and command and control. Police strategists specifically began

                                                                             174
studying counter­insurgency and counter-guerilla warfare.

At    the   same       time,      and    seemingly      incongruously,       police    were     also

beginning     to    experiment           with   a   “softer,”    more   friendly     type   of    law

enforcement—foot patrols, neighborhood meetings, police-sponsored youth

activities, and attention to quality-of-life issues quite apart from crime. A

few radical criminologists saw this for what it was—a domestic “hearts and

minds” campaign. As The Iron Fist and the Velvet Glove pointed out: ```

```
      “Like the similar techniques developed in the sixties to maintain the

      overseas empire (on which many of the new police techniques were

      patterned),         these        new   police         strategies      represent      an   attempt      to

      streamline          and     mystify    the    repressive          power     of   the   state,   not    to

      minimize it or change its direction. The forms of repression may

                                                                            175
      change, but their functions remain the same.”


Both militarization and community policing arose at the same time, and in

response to the same social pressures. And, whereas the military largely

neglected COIN in the period following defeat in Vietnam, the police kept

practicing,         and      developing,          its       techniques.         Decades      later,   facing

insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military turned to police for

         176
ideas.

The lines of influence move in both directions.




STATISTICAL CONTROL


Among the police innovations that COIN theorists recommend for military

use    are:        the    Neighborhood            Watch,          embedded        video,     computerized

                                                                  177
intelligence files, and statistical analysis.                           The last pair are particularly

interesting.

In Byting Back, Martin Libicki explains the utility of statistical analysis

programs,          pointing       to   New     York’s        Compstat        (computerized        statistics)

                                       178
system     as      an    example.            By    compiling            crime    reports,    analyzing      the

emerging statistics, and presenting the information on precinct-level maps,

Compstat enabled police administrators to identify high-crime areas, deploy

their officers strategically, and measure the progress of their efforts.

Though its effect on actual crime is debatable, Compstat certainly served

as the organizational keystone for the NYPD’s city-wide crackdown during

                                 179
the   Giuliani          years.         Since   that         time,   other    departments        around      the

                                                            180
country have adopted similar systems.

The Los Angeles Police Department’s system was proposed by Shannon

Paulson,       a    police       sergeant    and        a   Navy     intelligence      reservist;     it   was ```

``` implemented under Chief William Bratton, who had previously introduced

Compstat     in    New     York.   In   L.A.,   street    cops   carry   a   checklist     of   65

“suspicious       activities”—behaviors         such   as   taking   measurements,         using

binoculars, drawing diagrams, making notes, or expressing extremist views.

Officers are required to file reports whenever they see such things, even if

no crime has been committed. The “Suspicious Activity Reports” are then

routed through the nearest fusion center, the Joint Regional Intelligence

Center, where they are compiled, analyzed, and shared with other agencies

—including local and national law enforcement agencies, the military, and

private    corporations.        The    Los   Angeles      police,    along    with   the    U.S.

Directorate of National Intelligence, are hoping to replicate this system in

62 other cities around the country, beginning with Boston, Chicago, and

          181
Miami.




MAPPING MUSLIMS


COIN changes, not only the type of information the authorities are seeking,

but also the means they use to collect it. A Rand report on information

warfare in counter­insurgency emphasizes:


    “Even during a security operation, the information needed for counter­‐

    insurgency       is    as   much    or   more      about     context,    population,        and

    perceptions as it is about the hostile force … [O]nly a small fraction of

    the information needed would likely be secret information gathered by

                                                 182
    secret means from secret sources.”


The report suggests a few specific mechanisms for collecting broad-based

information: tracking cell phone use, conducting a national registry-census,

installing   vehicle-     and    weapon-mounted          video    cameras,    and    analyzing

internet   sites   (in    particular,   creating   a     “national   Wiki    (where   citizens

                                      183
describe their community).”

The U.S. government’s mapping of the American Muslim population

should be viewed in this light. In 2002 and 2003, the Department of

Homeland Security requested—and received—statistical data, sorted by zip ```

                  184
2000    census.         And     in   February   2003,   FBI    director     Robert   Mueller

ordered all 56 Bureau field offices to create “demographic” profiles of their

areas of operation, specifically including the number of mosques. One

Justice Department official explained that the demographics would be used

“to   set   performance        goals   and   objectives”     for   anti-terror   efforts   and

                               185
electronic surveillance.

Civil liberties groups compared the program to the first steps in the

                                                                     186
internment of Japanese Americans during World War II                       —

a notion that seems less than hyperbolic if we recall that, during this same

period, seven hundred Middle Eastern immigrants were arrested as they

complied     with   new       registration   rules.   More   than   1,200    were    detained

without explanation or trial following the September Eleventh attacks, and

                                                                      187
thousands more were “interviewed” under FBI orders.                         Meanwhile, the

FBI has sent infiltrators into mosques throughout the country to root out—

                                               188
or sometimes, to set up—terror cells.

Years later, in 2007, the LAPD began planning its own mapping program,

dressed in the rhetoric of community policing. As the L.A. Times reported,

the “Los Angeles Police Department’s counter-terrorism bureau proposed

using U.S. census data and other demographic information to pinpoint

various Muslim communities and then reach out to them through social

                        189
service agencies.”

Deputy Police Chief Michael P. Downing, head of the counterterrorism

unit, explained:


      “While this project will lay out geographic locations of many different

      Muslim populations around Los Angeles, we also intend to take a

      deeper look at their history, demographics, language, culture, ethnic

      breakdown, socioeconomic status and social interactions … It is also

      our hope to identify communities, within the larger Muslim community

      which may be susceptible to violent ideologically based extremism and

      then      use    a    full    spectrum      approach         guided      by    intelligence-led

                   190
      strategy.”


After widespread public outcry, the LAPD publicly repudiated the plan.

Based on the Los Angeles controversy, the New York Police Department

decided to keep its surveillance secret. Developed with CIA assistance—

advice, training, and embedded staff—the NYPD’s program was modeled

on    Israeli   intelligence        operations    in    the     West   Bank.     The      department’s

Demographic Unit uses census data to identify Muslim neighborhoods and

sends undercover officers to monitor the conversations at hookah bars,

cafes, and restaurants, as well as the literature at book stores. At the same

time,    the    Terrorism         Interdiction   Unit       recruits   informants        to   report   on

neighborhood activities and monitor the sermons delivered at the mosques.

When young men of Middle Eastern descent are arrested—regardless of the

nature    of    the   charge—they          are   commonly         interrogated       by    intelligence

officers as part of the department’s “debriefing program.” Muslim prisoners

are   promised        better       conditions    if    they     provide   information.         And     the

department       has       used    minor   licensing        problems      or   traffic   violations     to

pressure Pakistani taxi drivers to become informants.

Using the information they gleaned, police analysts produced a report

assessing every mosque in the city for its possible terrorist ties. One NYPD

official justified the program using a term that originated with the House

Un-American Activities Committee (in a report on the Black Panthers) and

that has since been carried forward into the counter­insurgency literature:

                                                                               191
The point, he said, is to “map the city’s human terrain.”




ZERO TOLERANCE IN THE WAR ON TERROR


None of the NYPD’s spy games should have been particularly surprising. It

was, with some variation, more or less in line with what some top police

theorists were publicly recommending.

In 2006, the criminologist George L. Kelling and L.A. Police Chief

William        Bratton      wrote     an   article     titled   “Policing      Terrorism”       for    the

                                                      192

``` the     “Broken      Windows”            theory      underlying        police    zero        tolerance

               193
campaigns;           Bratton was one of the theory’s most famous adherents. In

their article, they explain that the cops’ “everyday presence” in a designated

area—the basis of community policing—means that patrol officers are well-

placed to “notice even subtle changes in the neighborhoods they patrol.”

And: “They are in a better position to know responsible leaders in the

Islamic and Arabic communities and can reach out to them for information

                                                      194
and for help in developing informants.”                      At the same time, cops can ask

“Business owners … [as well as] doormen, private security guards, and

transit workers”—ultimately, the “general public”—to “remain vigilant, to

report any suspicious activity to police, and to ‘ask the next question’”—

that is, to stay “alert to preventive and investigatory possibilities” (or, less

                         195
politely, to snoop).

Once collected, the information provided by these various sources can be

entered into a computerized system for analysis, and “to share data …

                                                                 196
across jurisdictions and levels of government.”                        It’s for these reasons that

fusion centers and Joint Terrorism Task Forces are important. The fusion

centers “pool information from multiple jurisdictions,” making it possible to

share    information          “horizontally,”       while     the    JTTFs      help    it   to     flow

                                                            197
“vertically,” between the locals and the feds.

At    the   same    time,     Kelling      and    Bratton      advocate    “creating       a    hostile

environment for terrorists” by focusing on “illegal border crossings, forged

documents, and other relatively minor precursor crimes,” by increasing

police   visibility      to    “create   a   sense    of    omnipresence,”        and    by       “using

cameras,      random          screenings,     and    sophisticated        sensors”      to       pull   in

information.        (They       point    admiringly         to    London’s      40,000           security

              198
cameras.)           By    taking    this     “Broken       Windows”       approach      to   counter-

terrorism, the police can leverage minor infractions, vague suspicions, and

                                                                    199
even just routine contact into useful intelligence.

But this approach may require a shift in police priorities: “Prosecution of

the case is less important than gathering intelligence and putting it into a ```

potential terrorists and for the collection of intelligence.”




“DISRUPTION MODE”


Of course, the better the intelligence, the more effective the use of force can

be. And the purpose of identifying the insurgent network is to disrupt it.

Consider     the    police    efforts   to   frustrate   protests    against   the   2008

Republican National Convention: A year in advance of the demonstrations,

police informants began attending protest planning meetings around the

country, while local cops and the FBI kept anti-RNC organizers under

intense surveillance—following them, photographing them, going through

                   201
their   garbage.         Among     the    organizations     targeted   were   Code     Pink,

Students for a Democratic Society, the Campus Anti-War Network, and

most famously, “The RNC Welcoming Committee” (which later produced

                                202
“the RNC 8” defendants).

Simultaneously, the Minnesota Joint Analysis Center invested more than a

thousand hours coordinating with other fusion centers around the country to

collect,   analyze,      and   disseminate     information    on   suspected     anti-RNC

activists. The Joint Analysis Center drew its information from a staggering

array of sources, using law enforcement and Defense Department databases,

as well as DMV records, court documents, and information provided by

                         203
private businesses.

In the days before the convention, police used this information to mount

raids of activists’ homes and meeting places, seizing banners, political

                                                      204
literature, video equipment, and computers.                 By the Convention’s close,

more than eight hundred people had been arrested, many rounded up en

        205
masse.        The majority—584—were released without charges, or had their

                                                                              206
cases dismissed. Only ten arrests resulted in felony convictions.

But the conviction rate may be beside the point. One commander stated

frankly that the police weren’t building prosecutable cases, but were instead

                                   207
acting in “disruption mode.” ```

PART THREE: GANG WARS

The    domestic       application     of    COIN     is   not     limited    to    the    widespread

surveillance     of    Muslims      and     anarchists.      The     model        is    meant     to    be

generalizable.     As       New    Jersey’s      Homeland         Security    Director          Charles

McKenna       so   frankly     explained:        “Jihad,     Crips,      extreme        animal-rights

                                                                                   208
activists, it’s all the same: people trying damage the system.”

With so many potential targets, it’s interesting that the area where COIN

has exercised the most influence in U.S. policing is in anti-gang campaigns.




FROM CALIFORNIA TO AFGHANISTAN


In the summer of 2010, seventy marines from Camp Pendleton spent a week

accompanying          Los    Angeles       police    in   preparation       for        deployment       to

Afghanistan.       The      marines     wanted       to   learn    the     basics       of     anti-gang

investigations,       standards    of   police      professionalism,        and        techniques      for

                                                 209
building rapport with the community.

A New York Times profile of Marine Captain Scott Cuomo gives some

idea of what he learned in L.A., and how he applied it in Afghanistan:


      “The same Marines patrolled in the same villages each day, getting to

      recognize the residents. They awarded the elders construction projects

      and over hours of tea drinking showed them photographs they had taken

      of   virtually   every      grown     male    in    their   battle    space.       ‘Is   this    guy

      Taliban?’ the Marines asked repeatedly, then poured what they learned

                                           210
      into a computer database.”


After a couple months, their efforts paid off. A villager identified a suspect,

and the marines raided his house, arresting him and seizing weapons and

opium. They placed the man, Juma Khan, in “a holding pen the size of a

large dog cage” and interrogated him for two days. The marines then tried ```

``` him, and found him guilty of working with the Taliban. But under an

agreement with local elders, once Khan swore allegiance to the new Afghan

government, he was released as a free man—or not quite.

In exchange for his freedom, and a job cleaning a nearby canal, Khan will

be supervised by a group of elders, who in turn report to the American

military. And he will himself become an informer, meeting regularly with

the   marines     and   answering   their    questions   about   his   neighbors   and

           211
friends.




FROM AFGHANISTAN TO CALIFORNIA


Again, we see the lines of influence moving in both directions: Marines

train with cops to prepare themselves for the work of managing a military

occupation; and at the same time, military lessons are battle-tested overseas

and cycled back into the homeland.

Since February 2009, combat veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have

been serving as advisors to police in Salinas, California, with the stated aim

of applying counter­insurgency tools to local anti-gang efforts. Along with

their expertise, the military advisors also arrive with software, including a

computer     program     that   maps   the   connections   between     gang   activity,

individual suspects, and their social circles, family ties, and neighborhood

                 212
connections.

As Salinas Chief of Police Louis Fetherolf proudly notes:


      “Our work with staff from the U.S. Navy’s Naval Post­graduate School

      (NPS) [is] a first-of-its-kind collaboration … Faculty at NPS are experts

      in examining violent groups around the world, including terrorists,

      insurgents and revolutionaries. By examining these violent groups they

      have developed a counter­insurgency model, which relies largely on

      social network analysis to determine how best to disrupt their violent

      actions and, more importantly, address the reasons for their violent

      behavior in the first place. NPS and SPD are working together to

      determine the applicability of the counter­insurgency model to violent

                                                     213
      domestic groups such as our street gangs.”

``` In Salinas, the police-military partnership is occurring simultaneously with

                                                                                               214
a renewal and expansion of the SPD’s community policing philosophy.

The new community focus (encouraged by the Naval advisors) includes

Spanish language training, a “Gifts for Guns” trade-in event, an anonymous

tip hotline, senior-citizen volunteer programs, a larger role for the Police

Community Advisory Council, and programs that provide “more youth in

the community alternatives to gang lifestyles and in the process develop a

                                                                      215
growing pool of home-grown, future police officers.”

Salinas police have also initiated partnerships with other local, state, and

federal    law    enforcement        agencies,         including   the   Marshals,   the   ATF

(Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms), the FBI, and Immigration and Customs

                 216
Enforcement.           The most spectacular product of these partnerships, so far,

was a set of coordinated raids on April 22, 2010, codenamed “Operation

Knockout.”

The raids—coming after months of investigation by Salinas Police, the

Monterey County Drug Task Force, the ATF, and the FBI—mobilized more

than two hundred law enforcement agents and resulted in one hundred

arrests, as well as the confiscation of forty pounds of cocaine, fourteen

                                                       217
pounds of marijuana, and a dozen guns.

Operation Knockout was intended, not only to disrupt the targeted gangs,

but to serve as a warning to others. Deputy Police Chief Kelly McMillin

said: “We’re going to follow quickly with call-ins of specific groups that we

know are very active … We are going to tell them that what happened on

                                                          218
the 22nd could very well happen to them.”

The      SPD’s      agenda    for   the     future    remains     ambitious,   illustrating    an

emerging, multi-faceted intelligence-sharing network. It includes plans to

expand the city’s video surveillance and gunfire-triangulation system, to

adopt     Compstat,     to    connect      to    the   regional    law-enforcement    database

COPLINK, and to create “a centralized information center (Fusion Center)

in   Salinas   for   the   purpose      of      gathering    and   sharing   information   from

                                             219
Federal, State and local sources.” ```

``` Leonard        A.     Ferrari,   provost      of   the   Naval   Postgraduate      School,     is

enthusiastic about Salinas’ potential. “The $1 trillion invested so far in Iraq

and Afghanistan could pay a dividend in American streets,” he told the

Washington Post. The Salinas approach, he suggested, could become “a

                       220
national model.”




CEASEFIRE, COMPSTAT, COIN


In fact, the Salinas collaboration, “Operation Ceasefire,” is already part of

national model, following a strategy developed in Boston under the same

name.

In 1996, Boston’s Ceasefire began with a focus on illegal handguns, but

soon    broadened       its   attention   to   include    the    gangs   that   used   them.   In

response to ongoing gang conflict, the Boston Police Department convened

a working group consisting of law enforcement officers, social workers,

                                                           221
academics, and members of the black clergy.

Researchers working with police created a list of 155 murders, mapping

the    crimes    geographically          and    demographically.         They    examined      the

criminal records of both the victims and (where known) the assailants.

Using this information, they created a map of various gangs, their territory,

                          222
and conflict points.

Prioritizing the likely trouble-spots, police officers then sat down with

gang members and gave them a clear choice: If there was gang violence in

their area, both the cops and the district attorney were going to hit with

everything they had:


      “They could disrupt street drug activity, focus police attention on low-

      level   street    crimes    such    as   trespassing      and   public    drinking,   serve

      outstanding warrants, cultivate confidential informants for medium- and

      long-term investigations of gang activities, deliver strict probation and

      parole enforcement, seize drug proceeds and other assets, ensure stiffer

      plea bargains and sterner prosecutorial attention, request stronger bail

      terms (and enforce them), and even focus potentially severe Federal

    investigative and prosecutorial attention on, for example, gang-related

                       223
    drug activity.”


On the other hand, if the gang members wanted to clean up their act, the

police would help them do so. Because of their coalition work, the cops

                                                                                             224
came with offers of job training, drug counseling, and other services.                             In

this respect, Operation Ceasefire grew directly from the Boston Police

Department’s pre-existing community policing programs.

Over time, ceasefire developed four levels of intervention:


    “Level One was a warning, through forums or other means, to a

    particular group or groups to stop the violence.


    Level    Two      was     near-term       street     enforcement[:]    …        heavy    police

    presence,        drug     market       disruption,    warrant     service,      misdemeanor

    enforcement, and similar actions …


    Level Three was a large, interagency, heavily coordinated operation …

    that was readily apparent to the target group …


    Level Four … was for those groups that were both violent and deemed

    essentially unsalvageable: undercover, gangwide investigations making

    heavy      use    of    Federal    sanctions       and   designed     …    to    permanently

                                    225
    dismantle the group.”


The strategy worked through direct deterrence, denying the benefits of

violence and raising the costs. As importantly, “Those costs were borne by

                                                  226
the whole gang, not just the shooter.”                   So the cops could begin applying

meaningful pressure before identifying a suspect, and the gang had an

incentive to keep their members under control and maintain the peace.

The   key     elements        of    Operation     Ceasefire—social        network        analysis,

community partnerships, inter-agency cooperation, and a direct approach to

deterrence—were            quickly    replicated   and       taken   further   in    other   cities,

intersecting    with       trends   like   zero-tolerance      policing   and       the   Compstat

program. A report from the Justice Department’s Office of Community ```

``` Oriented      Policing     Service,         Street   Gangs     and      Interventions:       Innovative

Problem Solving with Network Analysis, provides a case study illustrating

the result:

In the mid-1990s Newark’s police were being remolded according to the

pattern set by Giuliani’s New York. The director of the Newark Police

Department, Joe Santiago, introduced a Compstat system and, in 1996,

proposed a partnership with Rutgers University professor George Kelling—

famous as one of the authors of the “Broken Windows” theory underlying

                                                 227
police      zero-tolerance      campaigns.              This    partnership       coalesced         as    the

                                                                    228
Greater Newark Safer Cities Initiative (GNSCI).

Slowly, Santiago built a working group including cops, scholars, social

workers, the clergy, and even public defense attorneys. It began by focusing

on a small number of repeat offenders, using the same deterrence model

developed in Ceasefire. Then, in 2003, GNSCI turned its attention to gangs,

leading it to look beyond the city limits. The North Jersey Gang Task Force

was born.

Coordinating          with    law    enforcement        agencies        statewide,        the   Rutgers

researchers began to collect a wide array of data on gang membership,

recent crimes, recruitment practices, family ties, and so on—as well as

“information on the criminal histories of all identified gang members.”

Once the data was assembled, the researchers, following Boston’s example,

used   it    to   map    gang    territory      and    perform      a    social   network         analysis,

illustrating rivalries and alliances, and identifying likely sites for conflict.

They then took the analysis to the individual level charting the connections

between       gang      members        and      others    who       associate      with      them.        By

diagramming        these       relationships,        researchers        were   able    to    distinguish

                                                                                   229
between core members and those only marginally involved.

Such      information        was    crucial    for   making       both    tactical    and       strategic

decisions. Police could approach individual members differently, based on

their role in the gang and their level of commitment. They could also

identify the pressure points and know where to strike for maximum effect.


    “Network         analysis        also    allows    one     to   identify      people     who         hold

    structurally important positions within the gang networks. Cut points,

       people who are the only connection among people or groups of people,

       may be ideal selections for spreading a deterrence message or for

                                                                            230
       affecting the structure and organization of the street gangs.”


Unlike Boston, where the focus was strictly on stopping gang violence, in

New Jersey the aim was to disrupt the gangs themselves.




CARROTS AND STICKS, HEARTS AND MINDS


Operation Ceasefire and its progeny work chiefly through a “cost/benefit”

approach to counter­insurgency: The government provides an admixture of

incentives and deterrents to shape the choices of the rebels, their supporters,

and the population as a whole. Simply put, the state creates a strategy to

raise    the   costs    associated   with   continued    resistance   and    to   reward

cooperation. If the government can bring more force to bear and offer better

rewards than the insurgents, rational self-interest should (in theory) lead

                                                           231
people to side with the state rather than the rebels.            Ceasefire applied this

same thinking to urban gangs.

At the same time, in developing Ceasefire, the police made sure to align

other sources of legitimacy—social services, community organizations, the

clergy—with its efforts, thus simultaneously increasing its leverage and

heading off potential resistance. For example, in Boston, the Ceasefire

coalition included black ministers who had been vocal critics of the police.

These men of the cloth began advising the cops in their anti-gang work, and

                                                                       232
eventually “sheltered the police from broad public criticism.”

The other major approach to COIN—the older and more famous “hearts

and minds” strategy—operates by a somewhat different logic, focusing on

“the    problems       of   modernization   and   the   insurgent   need    for   popular

support.” As Rand explains, the aim was to rebuild public confidence in the

government by instituting reforms, reducing corruption, and improving the

                                     233
population’s standard of living.

We can see the “hearts and minds” approach employed in a separate

domestic experiment—the federally-funded “Weed and Seed” program. ```

``` WEED AND SEED: CLEAR-HOLD-BUILD


Weed and Seed was conceived in 1991, and gained prominence a year later

as part of the federal response to widespread rioting after the acquittal of

four Los Angeles cops who had been videotaped beating black motorist

Rodney King. Since that time, it has been implemented in over three

hundred neighborhoods nationwide.

The Department of Justice describes the project:


    “The Weed and Seed strategy is based on a two­-pronged approach:


    1. Law enforcement agencies and criminal justice officials cooperate

    with local residents to ‘weed out’ criminal activity in the designated

    area.


    2.   Social   service   providers        and    economic      revitalization    efforts      are

    introduced to ‘seed’ the area, ensuring long-term positive change and a

                                                    234
    higher quality of life for residents.”


In terms of strategy, Weed and Seed closely resembles the military’s “Clear-

Hold-Build.”      As   FM      3-24   elaborates:     “Create      a    secure   physical        and

psychological     environment.        Establish      firm   government       control        of   the

                                                              235
populace and area. Gain the populace’s support.”

Clearing      and   holding    refer   to    the   removal       and   exclusion      of   hostile

elements.     Building,   on    the   other   hand,       means   both,   literally,    repairing

infrastructure and, more metaphorically, gaining trust and winning support.

However, even building includes an element of force:


    “Progress in building support for the HN [Host Nation] government

    requires protecting the local populace … To protect the populace, HN

    security forces continuously conduct patrols and use measured force

    against insurgent targets of opportunity … Actions to eliminate the

    remaining covert insurgent political infrastructure must be continued …

        236
    ”

``` The domestic analogy is pretty straightforward. One police chief described

the role of paramilitary units in his community policing strategy:


     “[The] only people that are going to be able to deal with these problems

     are highly trained tactical teams with proper equipment to go into a

     neighborhood          and    clear     the   neighborhood           and   hold    it;   allowing

     community           policing    officers      to    come       in   and   start    turning     the

                                     237
     neighborhood around.”


In   such      campaigns,      the   relationship       between       community        policing    and

militarization is especially clear. They’re not competing or contradictory

approaches. They work together, simultaneously or in series. One does the

weeding; the other, the seeding.

The implications are not lost on those subject to this sort of campaign.

“They’re gunning for us,” Omari Salisbury, a Seattle teenager, said when he

                                                                                        238
heard about Weed and Seed. “They’re gunning for Black youth.”




GANG POLITICS


Gang suppression has to be viewed, not only in terms of crime, but also in

terms of politics.

This is true in two respects. First, police are not only (or even mainly)

fighting crime, enforcing the law, or preventing violence—they are also

disrupting and disorganizing an incipient political force, striking against it

before    it   can     become    a   real   nexus       of   resistance.   A   growing       body    of

literature now specifically argues that gang violence should be treated as a

                           239
type of insurgency.              And, by applying the techniques and analysis of

counter­insurgency to counter-gang campaigns, the state tacitly admits that

there    is    a   political   dimension     to    what      is   ordinarily   presented      as   pure

criminality. Insurgency and counter­insurgency are, together, a struggle over

legitimacy. By applying the COIN framework domestically, the government

concedes that its legitimacy is being challenged and that the challengers

(however           localized   and   weak)        are    rivals,    or   potential     rivals,     with

independent claims to legitimacy and distinct spheres of influence. ```

```
    Second, the gangs are sometimes self-consciously engaged in political

action. As John Sullivan, an L.A. County Sheriffs Deputy, writes in one

Rand report:


      “[S]ome [gangs] have begun to adopt varying degrees of political

      activity.      At    the    low    end,   this    activity     may        include     dominating

      neighborhood life and creating virtual ‘lawless zones,’ application of

      street    taxes,     or    taxes   on   other    criminal      actors.      Gangs     with    more

      sophisticated political attributes typically co-opt police and government

      officials to limit interference with their activities. At the high end, some

      gangs     have      active    political   agendas,        using     the   political   process    to

                                                                          240
      further their ends and destabilize governments.”


Among the examples Sullivan cites are the Gangster Disciples, a gang with

30,000 members in 35 states. In addition to employing themselves in the

drug trade, “GD members infiltrate police and private security agencies,

sponsor        political        candidates,     register        voters,     and     sponsor        protest

               241
marches.”             Other        gangs      have    been      active     in     resistance      against

gentrification,       loan       sharks,      slum     lords,     price     gouging,        and    police

             242
brutality.

    Historically, the Black Panther Party recognized the political potential of

gangs. In Philadelphia, in the late ’60s, the Panthers organized a series of

gang    conferences         and    tried   to   use    negotiations        to   quell    neighborhood

violence. The Panthers also directed some of their public education and

recruitment efforts toward gang members. Some gangsters did enlist to help

in the Panthers’ free breakfast program, and a few went on to become full

                      243
Party members.              Most strikingly, the Los Angeles chapter was formed by

a    former     gang       leader,    Alprentice       “Bunchy”           Carter    of    the     Slauson

                244
Renegades.




ANTI-GANG POLITICS


Facing these challenges, police anti-gang campaigns typically combine a

variety of elements analogous to those in counter­insurgency: the creation of ```

---

### Extracted Text

``` databases    listing   suspected    gang     members;    the   mapping     of   the   social

environment, illustrating connections between gang members, associates,

families, etc.; the development of community contacts, especially with local

leaders. These intelligence efforts are then paired with a campaign of

persistent low-level harassment—stops, searches, petty citations, and the

like. Each instance of harassment offers police the opportunity to collect

additional information on the gang network while at the same time creating

an inhospitable environment for those associated with gang activity.

For example, the main group responsible for such work in Salinas is the

Monterey County Gang Task Force, called “The Black Snake” by youths in

the community. The Task Force has seventeen members, drawn from local

police and sheriffs departments, the California Highway Patrol, and the state

Department of Corrections. Wearing distinctive black uniforms and driving

                                                                                245
black cars, Task Force members conduct mass-arrest “round-ups,”                       make

random traffic stops, and regularly search the homes of gang members on

                         246
parole or probation.           The sheer volume of such activity is astonishing: In

its first five years, the Task Force was responsible for 21,000 vehicle or

pedestrian stops, 5,000 parole and probation “compliance” searches, and

                 247
2,800 arrests.

Such anti-gang efforts are always implicitly political, especially as they

become permanent features of life in poor black and Latino communities.

Though      ostensibly    aimed     at    preventing    gang   violence,   counter-gang

campaigns inevitably lead police to monitor the community as a whole. A

Fresno cop explains the intended scope of his department’s gang files: “If

you’re twenty-one, male, living in one of these neighborhoods, been in

Fresno for ten years and you’re not in our computer—then there’s definitely

              248
a problem.”

Disproportionate        attention,      especially    when    paired   with    lower—or

“zero”—tolerance for disorder, then contributes to higher rates of arrest and

                 249
incarceration.

Sometimes officials extend enforcement by securing gang injunctions,

special court orders prohibiting activities that would otherwise be legal—

barring alleged gang members from appearing together in public, restricting ```

                                                                                 250
the clothing they can wear, and subjecting them to a nighttime curfew.

At a broader level, the police will often engage in efforts disruptive of

ordinary social life in gang-affected areas, such as cordoning, saturating, or

sweeping select locations (e.g., parks, streets, or bars) or targeted events

                                    251
(ballgames, parties, car shows).

In the most advanced campaigns, police sometimes take the further step of

strategically causing gang conflict. Following the 1992 Los Angeles riots,

for example, police did what they could to wreck a city-wide truce between

the Bloods and the Crips. The cops attacked negotiating meetings and inter-

gang social events, and engaged in some underhanded tactics to create

friction: covering one gang’s graffiti with another’s, or arresting a Blood

only to release him deep in Crip territory. This occurred, not only in a

context of widespread anger and recent unrest, but also at a point in which

                                                                     252
the gangs themselves were becoming increasingly politicized.

Mike Davis described the government’s response to the riots in military

terms: “In Los Angeles I think we are beginning to see a repressive context

that is literally comparable to Belfast or the West Bank, where policing has

been transformed into full-scale counter­insurgency … against an entire

                                    253
social stratum or ethnic group.”




PART FOUR:

PRESERVING ORDER, PREVENTING CHANGE

I began this paper by outlining, in some detail, the basic principles of

counter­insurgency theory, the intelligence needs that accompany it, and its

direct   application   in   both   (foreign)   military   and   (domestic)   policing

contexts. I’ve explained the basics of Social Network Analysis, and the

process by which its insights into both insurgent organizations and the

surrounding population are translated into direct coercion and bids to win

popular support. I have suggested that if the left wants to understand the

repression it faces, it should study the ways the U.S. government responds ```

``` to forces as varied as the Taliban, the Gangster Disciples, and the RNC 8.

And    I   have    stated,   emphatically,     that   it   is   the   political    dimension    of

insurgency and counter­insurgency that really counts.

And yet, thus far, I have focused chiefly on the “hard” side of repression—

the   direct    coercion,     the   forceful    disruptions,      the    criminalization       and

incarceration, the violence. Now we need to look at the “soft” side—the

strategic use of concessions, the promise of representation and access, the

co-optation        of   leadership,      and,     comprising            all   of     these,    the

                                      254
institutionalization of dissent.             These elements represent, at this point,

the state’s most typical response to opposition from the left. And, by these

means, the state does not only achieve control and exercise power over the

organizations of the left, but through them.




STAGES AND STRATEGIES


In its earlier stages, repression may be hard to recognize for exactly the

same reasons that a proto-insurgency is—because everything seems normal.

We should remember, however, that the authorities aren’t just preparing for

unrest, they’re actively preempting opposition. They do that by broadly

monitoring the community, building alliances, channeling political efforts

into projects they can control, and disrupting networks and social ties that

might otherwise form the basis for resistance.

Of course, as COIN moves into its later stages it will become increasingly

military in character. Both the overt use of force and covert surveillance,

infiltration,     and   disruption    will   increase.      Emergency         powers     may    be

granted, civil liberties suspended, and the life of the overall population

                             255
increasingly restricted.

But as the crisis progresses to higher levels, the work of lower stages

continues. Smart revolutionaries don’t stop organizing as they escalate their

tactics; they use their actions to help build their organizations. Likewise, the

security forces do not cease their efforts at intelligence gathering or alliance

building, but use those efforts in support of their more bellicose activities.

Of course, the aim of any counter­insurgency campaign is a return to

                                                                              256
normal—that is, to the lowest level of manageable conflict.                         In effect, this ```

## Page 127

### Extracted Text

``` is a return to the proto-insurgency stage: Opposition is either channeled into

safe,   institutional    forms,      or   suppressed   through   normal      police    and

                         257
intelligence activity.

The British strategist Frank Kitson summarizes the overall process:


    “In practical terms the most promising line of approach [in COIN] lies

    in separating the mass of those engaged in the [revolutionary] campaign

    from the leadership by the judicious promise of concessions, at the

    same time imposing a period of calm by the use of government forces

    …


    Having once succeeded in providing a breathing space by these means,

    it is most important to do three further things quickly. The first is to

    implement the promised concessions … The second is to discover and

    neutralize the genuine subversive element. The third is to associate as

    many prominent members of the population, especially those who have

    been engaged in non-violent action, with the government. This last

                                                                 258
    technique is known in America as co-optation … ”


Rand Corporation researcher Daniel Byman argues similarly:


    “The ideal allies for a government implementing control are, in fact,

    nonviolent members of the community the would-be insurgents seek to

    mobilize … If regimes can infiltrate—or, better yet, cooperate with—

    mainstream groups they are often able to gain information on radical

                                                                          259
    activities and turn potential militants away from violence.”


Broadly speaking, counter­insurgency offers two approaches to dealing with

opposition, and they must be used selectively. Some adversaries, especially

moderates, may be co-opted, bought off, and appeased. Others, the more

recalcitrant portion, must be forcefully disorganized, disrupted, deterred, or

destroyed. The balance of concessions and coercion will be apportioned

accordingly. Some adversaries win new posts—offices in a “reformed”

administration,    or    jobs   in    “responsible”    nonprofits,   labor   unions,    or

progressive think tanks. They gain access, inclusion, or representation in ```

``` exchange    for   working     within    the   existing   institutional   framework.       The

others will face harsher outcomes—including, for example, imprisonment,

exile, or assassination. Whatever the approach in a particular case, the

important thing is that the opposition is neutralized—rendered harmless,

made controllable, and exploited as either the object or the tool of state

power.




“FORCE MULTIPLIERS”: THE MILITARY-NGO COMPLEX


Counterinsurgency theory places a heavy emphasis on shaping the social

environment in which the population lives and resistance develops. One way

governments exercise this influence is with their money. As FM 3-24

explains:


    “Some of the Best Weapons for Counterinsurgents Do Not Shoot …

    Counterinsurgents        often     achieve   the     most   meaningful      success    in

    garnering public support and legitimacy for the HN government with

    activities that do not involve killing insurgents … [L]asting victory

    comes from a vibrant economy, political participation, and restored

    hope. Particularly after security has been achieved, dollars and ballots

    will have more important effects than bombs and bullets … ‘money is

                      260
    ammunition’.”


Foreign aid has thus often been criticized as an instrument of imperialism,

even when the funds are distributed indirectly through nongovernmental or

                                                                                    261
nongovernmental humanitarian organizations (NGOs or NGHOs).

As the U.S. began its war against Afghanistan in October 2001, Colin

Powell—the        former    general,   the    founding    chairman       of   the   nonprofit

America’s Promise Alliance, and, at the time, the Secretary of State—

managed to embarrass NGO leaders with his praise for their work. Speaking

at the National Foreign Policy Conference for Leaders of Nongovernmental

Organizations, he said: “[J]ust as surely as our diplomats and military,

American NGOs are out there serving and sacrificing on the front lines of ```

``` freedom … [NGOs] are such a force multiplier for us, such an important

                                  262
part of our combat team.”

Later, guidelines negotiated by representatives of the military and the

major humanitarian groups discouraged any repetition of Powell’s gaffe,

specifying that “U.S. Armed Forces should not describe NGHOs as ‘force

                                                       263
multipliers’ or ‘partners’ of the military.”                 FM 3-24 managed to retain

Powell’s     meaning      while    avoiding     the   offensive    language:      “Many      such

agencies resist being overtly involved with military forces,” it cautions; but

then: “some kind of liaison [is] needed … to ensure that, as much as

                                                                                             264
possible, objectives are shared and actions and messages synchronized.”

The Rand study Networks and Netwars outlines “a range of possibilities”

for the military’s use of international nonprofits:


      “from encouraging the early involvement of appropriate NGO networks

      in helping to detect and head off a looming crisis, to working closely

      with them in the aftermath of conflicts to improve the effectiveness of

      U.S. forces still deployed, to reduce the residual hazards they face, and

                                                      265
      to strengthen the often fragile peace.”


One result of this perspective is that aid money, and thus NGO attention,

increasingly follows the state’s priorities—and its military’s priorities in

              266
particular.         For instance, in 2010 the U.S. awarded $114 million to aid

groups working in Yemen, with the stated goal of “improving the livelihood

of citizens in targeted communities and improving governance capabilities.”

267
      This supposedly humanitarian assistance came alongside $1.2 billion in

military     aid,   clandestine    military     and   intelligence   activity,    and   a    CIA

assessment that the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen represented the largest

                                                       268
threat to the United States’ global security.                General David Petraeus was

frank   in   referring    the   U.S.     involvement    in   the   country   as   “Preventive

                                          269
Counterinsurgency Operations.”

Meanwhile,        the   Defense      Department     now    controls   20%       of   the   U.S.

                                                                                             270

``` “[D]evelopment priorities follow the battle space,” David Rieff writes in

THE MARSHAL PLAN


The domestic counterpart to the nongovernmental “force multiplier” is the

community policing “partnership.” We’ve seen nonprofit funding tied to the

criminal justice agenda in the Weed and Seed program; the use of social

services and black churches to create “the ‘network of capacity’ necessary

                                                                                                  272
to legitimize, fund, equip, and carry out” Boston’s Operation Ceasefire;

the collaboration of social workers, the clergy, and public defense attorneys

for similar ends in Newark; police-sponsored youth and elders programs in

Salinas;     and,   in   Los   Angeles,    the   government’s       use     of      social     service

agencies to gain access to Muslim communities suspected of breeding

terrorists.

But   sometimes        police-led    partnerships       go    further,   using          progressive

nonprofits to channel and control political opposition, moving it in safe,

institutional, and reformist directions, rather than toward more radical or

militant action. For example, consider the efforts of liberal nonprofits to

contain community anger after transit police shot and killed an unarmed

black man in Oakland, California:

Oscar Grant was killed on January 1, 2009. A week later, on January 7, a

                                                                  273
protest against the police turned into a small riot.                     Organizers with the

Coalition Against Police Executions (CAPE)—a group largely composed of

local progressive nonprofits and black churches—denounced the violence.

One CAPE leader said that he wept watching the riots on television, feeling

                                                                                    274
that years of hard work were being “destroyed by anarchists.”

But—likely        because     of   the   revolt—the       cop    in    the     case,      Johannes

Mehserle, was arrested and charged with murder. Before the riots there had

been    no    statement    of    concern     from     the      mayor’s     office,        no   Justice

Department investigation, and no arrests. In fact, the transit agency—for

whom Mehserle worked—had not even interviewed him about the incident. ```

``` “The rebellion was really about the fact that nothing was being done,”

George Ciccariello-Maher explains. “If there’s one lesson to take from this,

it’s that the only reason Mehserle was arrested is because people tore up the

                                                                        275
city. It was the riot—and the threat of future riots.”

     In     an     effort    to     re-assert   its    leadership,     CAPE        organized      another

demonstration for January 14. Speakers included Mayor Ron Dellums, the

rapper Too $hort, and representatives of various nonprofits—all of whom

urged        the    crowd      to    remain     peaceful.    Furthermore,        CAPE’s       designated

marshals,          operating        under   the    supervision    of   a    private    security    guard,

surrounded the demonstration while unidentified informants mingled in the

                                                  276
crowd to look for troublemakers.

     Despite the tight control, things did not go as planned. When the speeches

were over, much of the crowd refused to leave. Organizers announced that

police would intervene if the group would not disperse; but rather than wait,

CAPE’s own marshals formed a line and began pushing people off the

streets.         The     crowd—now          very      angry—started        breaking     windows.      The

security team, after consulting with police, withdrew from the area and left

it to the cops to handle the crowd. The police fired tear gas and made

              277
arrests.

     Future demonstrations, beginning on January 30, were likewise handled

                                                       278
with threats, arrests, and violence.                         At the same time, and in keeping

with the COIN model, local, state, and federal agencies all undertook

extensive intelligence operations targeting protest organizers—monitoring

websites,           videotaping        crowds,        sending   plainclothes       officers    into   the

                                                                           279
demonstrations, and infiltrating planning meetings.

     “If we learned on January seventh that our power was in the streets,”

Ciccariello-Maher concludes, “what we learned on the fourteenth is that the

state was going to counter-attack … The state didn’t counterattack by force

at        first;   the      state    counter-attacked        through       these      institutions,   the

                    280
nonprofits.”




NO JUSTICE, URBAN PEACE ```

``` A year later, the process repeated itself. As Johannes Mehserle’s trial

approached, Nicole Lee, director of the nonprofit “Urban Peace Movement,”

circulated an email focused, not on winning justice, but on preventing

violence should justice be denied. Titled “Bracing for Mehserle Verdict:

Community Engagement Plan,” the June 23, 2010, memo offered two sets

of instructions:


     “1)     Organizations,       CBO’s    [Community-Based     Organizations],         and

     Public Agencies should be thinking of ways to create organized events

     or avenues for young people and community members to express their

     frustrations with the system in constructive and peaceful ways.                     If

     people have no outlets then it may be easier for folks to be pulled

     toward more destructive impulses.


     2) We need to begin ‘inoculating’ our bases and the community at-

     large so that when the verdict comes down, people are prepared for it,

     and so that the ‘outside agitators’ who were active during the initial

                                                                               281
     Oscar Grant protests are not able to incite the crowd so easily.”


The memo listed several talking points, which served the state’s interests so

                                                                               282
well that the City of Oakland ran an edited version on its webpage.

Around the same time, another organization, ironically named “Youth

Uprising,”        sponsored   a   public   service   announcement      centered    on   the

slogan, “Violence is Not Justice.” The video includes local rappers, civil

rights attorneys, school administrators, representatives from nonprofits, a

police captain, and the District Attorney of San Francisco—all urging a

                                       283
peaceful response to the verdict.

Religious leaders also got into the act, using the pulpit to ask people to

                                                                284
remain safely at home when the verdict was announced.

The       pacifying   efforts,    though    broadly   distributed,    were      centrally

coordinated. Shortly before the trial, the mayor and police held a meeting

with several Bay Area nonprofits. The topic, of course, was the prevention

            285
of riots. ```

``` In       practice,    avoiding      unrest     became      the   primary        focus     of     the

institutionalized left; CAPE’s stated goal, the prevention of police brutality,

receded into the background. If anything, by condemning the rioters and

cooperating with the cops, liberal leaders helped to legitimize the police

counterattack and made further brutality more, not less, likely.

In the end, Officer Mehserle was convicted, but of a lesser charge—

manslaughter, rather than murder. And, when the verdict was announced,

                        286
rioting did ensue.             Hundreds of people, mostly young people of color,

braved not only the clubs and the tear gas of the police, but also the

                                                                    287
condemnation of their purported community leaders.




ADVANCE THE STRUGGLE


In their published analysis of the Oscar Grant crisis, the revolutionary group

Advance the Struggle argued that, by trying to defuse popular anger, “Bay

                                                                                 288
Area nonprofits effectively acted as an extension of the state.”

Had the rage over Grant’s murder not been channeled into ritualized

protest, had the leaders not been more concerned with controlling the

community response than in confronting injustice, had the organizing not

been, in a word, institutionalized—it is hard to know what might have been

possible.

Advance the Struggle contrasted the trajectory of events in Oakland with

those of Greece, just a few weeks before the Grant killing:


      “There, the police murder of a 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos

      triggered reactions which, very quickly, evolved from protests to riots to

      a   general     strike   in   which     2.5    million   workers       were   on   strike    in

      December 2008. Within days the killer cop and police accomplices

      were arrested, but even this concession didn’t trick the movement into

      subsiding. The police murder set off the uprising, but the participants

      connected the murder with the issues of unemployment, neo-liberal

      economic        measures,     political       corruption,   and    a    failing    education

      system.

     Aren’t we facing similar problems in Oakland … ?”


Of course there are differences between Oakland and Athens—differences

of   geography,    history,    and   political   culture.    The   type     of   insurrection

unleashed in Greece may not, at present, be possible in California. But that

is not an objection to the radical analysis; it is, instead, the premise. The

political environment in Oakland has been shaped in such a way so as to

sharply limit the possibilities of struggle. And the institutionalization of

conflict in professionalized nonprofits is an important part of that restrictive

context. There is no guarantee that things would have gone further had the

nonprofits not intervened, or that greater conflict would have won greater

gains. But their intervention certainly helped to contain the rebellion, and

closed off untold possibilities for further action. That is, quite clearly, what

it was intended to do.




CONCLUSION:

RESISTING REPRESSION

I began this essay by suggesting that a great deal of political repression goes

unrecognized,     and   that   the   left   needs   to    revise   its    understanding   of

repression if it is to resist it effectively. This need has developed alongside

—in some respects it is a reflection of—similar changes in the thinking of

our adversaries.

With the emergence of the counter­insurgency model, the state has ceased

to   view   subversives   in    isolation   from    the     society      surrounding   them.

Increasingly, it has directed its attention—its intelligence gathering, its

coercive force, and its alliance building—toward the population as a whole.

Repression, in other words, is not something that happens solely, or even

mainly, to activists. And it is not something that occurs only in times of

crisis, or in response to a direct threat.

Also, it is not something that necessarily happens in secret. It is worth

pausing here to note that, while both sides may use clandestine or illegal

methods, there is nothing inherently conspiratorial in either insurgency or ```

``` counter­insurgency.       One     of    the   breakthroughs         in   the   counter­insurgency

approach      was   its   shift   away        from    J.   Edgar     Hoover–style       conspiracy

            290
theories;         our understanding of counter­insurgency, likewise, cannot be

rooted in conspiracy thinking. Insurgency and counter­insurgency are not the

result   of   invisible     actors      and    secret      plots;   they   are   the   predictable

consequence of broad and observable social forces, especially those related

to inequality. The secret or conspiratorial aspects are operational decisions

made pursuant to a broader strategy, not the strategy itself. One of the

remarkable things about COIN is how much it occurs in public view—in

fact, how much it relies on the public’s cooperation.

Repression       comprises      all    those   methods—routine               and   extraordinary,

coercive and collaborative—used to regulate the conflict inherent in a

stratified society. Our task is to decipher the politics implicit in these efforts,

to discern the ways that they preserve state power, neutralize resistance, and

maintain social inequality.

Our further task is to respond. As repression is primarily a political

process, any adequate response must take—at least in part—a political

form. It will not be enough, as is usual, to put the case before a jury, or

adopt    strict   secrecy   in    the   name     of     some    cloak-and-dagger        notion   of

“security culture.” Such things must be done at times, but both these

responses, though in very different ways, treat repression chiefly as a legal,

and thus technical, problem. They are also entirely defensive. While such

devices may protect the individual or small group with greater or lesser

efficacy, they do not generally touch—or even attempt to touch—the overall

system of repression, to say nothing of the social iniquities that system

maintains.

Whatever defensive measures may be necessary, an effective response to

repression must also involve an offensive component—an attack against the

apparatus of repression, which will (if successful) leave the state weaker and

the social movement stronger. This outcome, of course, should be the aim

from the start.

``` It is, in a sense, misleading to speak solely in terms of responding to

repression. Repression exists already. It intervenes preemptively. It forms

part of the context in which we act. Oppositional movements cannot avoid

repression; the challenge, instead, must be to overcome it.

We      cannot       afford   to    underestimate       our     adversaries,        but    it   is    just    as

mistaken to think them omnipotent. There’s a debate within military circles

as to how often counter­insurgency works, and some argue that it cannot

work—but nobody suggests that it always works. Sometimes governments

        291
fall.

The difficulties inherent to counter­insurgency are numerous: It’s labor-

intensive        and    resource-intensive,            requires    vast     amounts          of    localized

intelligence, demands both overwhelming force and careful negotiation, and

calls for painstaking analysis, strategy, and planning. That’s a pretty tall

order even for the most competent organizations. And there are also features

                                                                                                              292
of our adversaries’ institutions and ideologies that add to their troubles.

Furthermore, so long as our society remains so starkly unequal, so long as

it continues along a suicidal course toward environmental catastrophe, and

so long as people lack the control over the conditions of their immediate

lives—there will be cause for unrest. Even working together in perfect

coordination, the cops, military, and intelligence agencies combined cannot

change that fundamental fact without also changing the entire structure of ```

that they are meant to defend.




INSURGENT THINKING


When facing counter­insurgency, we need to learn to think like insurgents.

We have to recognize, and even embrace, political and strategic complexity.

Every   insurgency       is   different,   and   a   single   insurgency    may   take   very

different forms from one year to the next, or one street to the next. There are

no set paths or ready formulas, which is not the same thing as saying there

are no strategies. But our strategies have to correspond with the reality we

face, not with an idealized version of some past revolution or some future

utopia. And we cannot elevate our own favorite tactics—whether pacifist or

insurrectionist—into articles of faith.

The antidote to repression is, simply put, more resistance. But this cannot

just   be   a   matter   of   escalating    militancy.    Crucially,   it   has   to   involve

broadening the movement’s base of support. We have to remember that an

insurgency is not just a series of tactical exchanges with the state. It is,

instead, a contest for the allegiance of the population. For the rebels, no less

than for the authorities, “Legitimacy is the main objective.”




ENDNOTES



134 This essay began as a lecture presented at the “Econvergence,” First

Unitarian Church, Portland, Oregon; October 3, 2009. It was later printed in

Interface: A Journal for and about Social Movements, Interfacejournal.net,

May 2011. Then, it served as the basis for my chapter of the same title in

Life During Wartime: Resisting Counterinsurgency, eds. Kristian Williams,

Will Munger, and Lara Messersmith-Glavin (Oakland: AK Press, 2013).

Parts were also used in my introduction to that same collection,

“Introduction: Insurgency, Counterinsurgency, and Whatever Comes Next.”

The version printed here follows the structure of that in Interface, but

incorporates some of the additional material from Life During Wartime, and

was updated in March 2014. ```

``` 135 When I speak of “the left,” I am speaking broadly of all those forces,

from lukewarm liberals to insurrectionary anarchists, seeking to push

society in the direction of greater equality.


136 It’s important to recognize the limits of the official documents. The

practice of COIN often diverges from the doctrine, and sometimes diverges

very sharply. Imperfect adherence to the counter­insurgency model may

indicate institutional inertia, internal disagreements, inter- or intra-agency

rivalry, limits of capacity and competence, a lack of political will, or any

number of other real-world operational or organizational factors. But it may

also point to the ideological constraints shaping the guiding documents.

Admonishments to operate within the law and to demonstrate a respect for

human rights, for example, are compulsory in official publications and

should be met with skepticism.

The strategy of counter­insurgency has its critics, highlighting its clash

with the existing military culture. Military traditionalists see the world, so to

speak, through a gun scope—clearly, but narrowly. They want wars, not

“nation-building.” And they worry that COIN will make the army soft and

its soldiers will forget how to fight. See, for instance: Gian P. Gentile,

Hugh Gusterson, “Militarizing Knowledge” in The Counter-

Counterinsurgency Manual: Or, Notes on Demilitarizing American Society,

ed. Network of Concerned Anthropologists Steering Committee (Chicago:

Prickly Paradigm Press, 2009), 51.

The military prefers anthropologists as its in-house advisors, perhaps for

historical reasons. But owing to that same deeply problematic history, it has

had difficulty finding enough anthropologists to fill its positions.

For a good overview covering the history of militarized anthropology, see

Montgomery McFate, “Anthropology and Counterinsurgency: The Strange

Story of their Curious Relationship,” Military Review, March–April 2005.

(McFate is a military apologist, and her analysis is almost wholly

reactionary. But I believe it is possible to use all of her evidence, and even

some of her arguments, to reach exactly the opposite conclusions.)

For an insider’s view on the military’s training program for the Human

Terrain Teams, with a critical assessment of the program’s potential and an

accounting of its failure to draw actual anthropologists, see: David H. Price,

Weaponizing Anthropology: Social Science in Service of the Militarized

State (Petrolia: Counterpunch, 2011), Chapter 9: “Human Terrain Dissenter:

Inside Human Terrain Team Training’s Heart of Darkness.” In that article,

John Allison details the make-up of his HTS class: “Though they want to

have an anthropologist be the HTT Social Scientist, they are happy to get

anyone with what could be remotely considered an ‘advanced’ degree in a

social science. So, although we have five anthropologists, we also have

several historians, an economist, an industrial psychologist, etc; and only ```

``` The Green Scare, the State’s

Priorities, and Day-to-Day Repression

              295
(2009)

When discussing political repression, the tendency is always to focus on the

infiltration, raids, arrests, and jailings—and, in the case of the Green Scare,

the exaggerated sentencing in particular.

That makes sense, as these are the most startlingly aspects of repressive

campaigns. But it also runs the risk of overlooking the larger fabric of

repression in the society—the normal surveillance; the collection, storage,

and analysis of intelligence; the libeling of opposition groups; the use of

entrapment;    and    more    subtly,   the      disruption    of   social   bonds   among

populations   that    pose   the   threat   of   resistance.    The   routine   aspects   of

repression—that is, in effect, the day-to-day work of policing—and the

institutions responsible for it tend to fade into the background.




HISTORICAL PATTERNS


The pattern of abuse characterizing the Green Scare is familiar from our

nation’s history.

Following the Haymarket bombing of 1886, the police launched a series

of raids, made wholesale arrests, planted infiltrators and provocateurs, and

politically used the bombing itself to isolate the anarchists from the rest of

the labor movement—the ultimate result being, of course, the fraudulent

conviction and execution of four anarchist organizers.

During World War I, pacifists and socialists of all kinds were jailed for

interference with the war effort. In the same period, “criminal syndicalism”

laws were passed specifically to target the IWW. And in 1919, Attorney

General A. Mitchell Palmer organized a coordinated series of raids to round

up and deport thousands of immigrants suspected of radical sympathies—

most famously, Emma Goldman.

In   the    1960s    and     ’70s     the      FBI   counterintelligence       program,

COINTELPRO, used a variety of dirty tricks to, as their directive put it, ```

the    black   liberation    movement,       especially      the    Black     Panther     Party.

COINTELPRO tactics included the use of infiltrators and forged documents

to create schisms in the movement, cause logistical confusion, propagate

faction fights, instill paranoia, break up marriages, get activists fired from

their day jobs, and falsely label leaders as government spies. COINTELPRO

also    produced      a   series   of    raids,   arrests,       malicious    prosecutions,        and

assassinations.




QUIET TIMES


We should remember these most dramatic examples because they remind us

of the lengths the government is willing to go. But we should also look past

them,    to    the   seemingly     quiet    periods.        We    can’t   afford   to    forget    that

repression is a permanent feature of state action.

Government          campaigns      directed       against       organized     groups      with     an

identifiable agenda are a relatively small piece of the state’s overall strategy

of repression.

As counter­insurgency theory makes clear, the state’s real aim is not to

respond to unrest when it occurs, but to prevent oppositional movements

from developing in the first place. That requires the continual monitoring of

suspect    populations,      the   co-optation         of   community        resources     for    state

purposes,      and    the   preemptive       disruption       of    any     potential    source     of

independent action or resistance.

In the domestic sphere, the police are key to this strategy—not only the

most    obviously     repressive        aspects   of    policing,    like    crowd      control    and

spying, but also the purely routine elements of patrol and arrest, and even

(or, perhaps, especially) the friendly-seeming “community policing” efforts.




POLICING AND POLITICS


At its most basic, the primary function of the criminal justice system isn’t

really dealing with crime, or ensuring public safety, or even enforcing the

law. All of these are secondary. ```

---

## Page 158

### Complete Page View
![Page 158 Complete](images/page_158_full.png)

### Extracted Text

``` The chief function is the preservation of the existing distribution of power

—keeping the rich and powerful, rich and powerful; and keeping the poor

and powerless, poor and powerless.

The modern American police, for example, evolved from the earlier slave

patrols, organizations whose explicit job was to control the slaves. Over

time their duties expanded in two directions—control of the entire black

population (including free blacks) and governing poor whites as well.

Likewise, the penitentiary began in its European version as an institution

for reforming the habits of the idle poor. It took on its distinctly American

characteristics after the Civil War, as a means of re-confining the newly

freed black population.

This     legacy   continues   today   with     routine     police   practices    like   racial

profiling and quality-of-life campaigns against panhandling and sleeping in

parks. These efforts have no impact on real crime. But they serve to remind

the poor and people of color of their subordinate status, and to keep them

under the continual monitoring and control of the criminal justice system.

In   this   sense,   the   whole   operation    of   the   criminal    justice   system     is

political. It is one way that the state handles its troublesome populations—

and one way that it protects the interests of the powerful.




A POLITICAL AGENDA


It’s only when viewed in terms of politics—not crime or public safety—that

we can make sense of the priority the government has placed on Green

Scare prosecutions.

Though ELF-style sabotage has not killed anyone, and is designed not to

harm anyone, the FBI insists “eco-terrorists and animal rights extremists are

one of the most serious domestic terrorist threats in the U.S. today.” As

evidence, they cite “the sheer volume of their crimes (over 2000 since 1979)

[and] the huge economic impact (losses of more than $110 million since

          297
1979).”

But by way of contrast, consider: In 2007 alone, the FBI recorded 7,624

hate crime incidents (representing 9,006 criminal offenses). These included

40 arsons, 2,915 acts of vandalism, 2,565 acts of criminal intimidation, ```

``` 1,116 simple assaults, 2,565 aggravated assaults, 2 rapes, and 9 homicides.

About half (43%) of these incidents—3,275—were motivated by anti-black

                                                                 298
prejudice, far more than any other bias category recorded.             Yet this

campaign of terror warrants little official notice.

That’s because it’s not justice, the law, or human life that sets the state’s

priorities. It’s the interests of the powerful.

After all, what does it mean to have power if not that the institutions of

society—and its coercive apparatus especially—typically operate in your

favor and respond to your agenda?




END REPRESSION


If we want to end state repression, therefore, it is not enough to support the

members of our movement who fall victim to it. It is not enough to launch

legal and political challenges to draconian laws, or to defend existing civil

liberties. We must do all that, but we must also find a way to address the

underlying systems of power that repression is meant to preserve.

To end state repression, we must change the very nature of our society. To

end state repression, we must end the state.

``` Police Accountability and Police

Abolition: Dilemmas, Paradoxes,

                                          299
Strategies (2011)

Over the past fifteen years, I have consistently written about policing from

an abolitionist perspective, but the great majority of my actual political

work   would     fit   more   or   less   comfortably   in   the   police   accountability

framework. I begin with this point because I believe it is quite a common

situation, not only for police abolitionists, but for revolutionaries of all

various kinds.

There is a common—and, I think, mistaken—technique for wishing away

our discomfort about the distance between our hopes and our actions. It is to

assume that every reform is a step on the road to abolition; that they are all

“moving in the right direction” and ought, therefore, to be supported.

The problem is that not every reform really is a step in the right direction.

The history of criminal justice reform is a sobering study in the law of one

step forward, two steps back. It was reformers, remember, who created the

modern prison system. It was reformers who argued that the police should

prevent crime, and reformers who helped establish their autonomy from

partisan politics. Community policing—which has only increased the police

involvement in social affairs, and has not reduced levels of police violence

—has been sold to the public under the banner of reform. Reformers have

even added to the police arsenal—giving the cops tasers and less-lethal

weapons in an effort to reduce shootings, for an example.

Thanks to the work of reformers, the cops today are better trained, better

paid, more well armed, and better organized than at any other point in

history. And shouldn’t this, after all, be what we expected? Isn’t the point of

reform to improve the institution, that is, to aid its work? As Foucault

argued, reform is “part of [the] very functioning” of the criminal justice

                                                             300
system: “it constitutes, as it were, its programme.”

With all that on the ledger sheet, one might be tempted to just refuse to

participate in any reform or accountability efforts whatsoever—that is, to ```

``` refuse to have anything at all to do with any project that does not have

abolition as, not only its final aim, but as its immediate aim.

But this, too, would be a mistake. Obviously, we do not at present have the

power to simply disband the police force. So if abolition is our goal—and

not merely a moral precept that we organize our daydreams around—then

that leaves us with the hard work of building an oppositional political

movement    that   is   capable   of   eliminating   the   existing   criminal   justice

system. That movement, of course, will have to engage in other action while

it is building its strength; to a very large extent, it will build itself up by

engaging in other action.

A resolute insistence on “nothing short of abolition” would in effect make

us irrelevant to political processes as they unfold. We can, and should, make

forceful arguments for abolition. But if the only thing we can say is that

there should be no police, then we become, in a sense, neutral as to any and

all immediate questions concerning the powers or practices of police as they

presently exist. It’s pretty damn embarrassing to have no relevant opinion as

to whether the police should carry tasers, or on the issue of racial profiling,

or on the question of whether killer cops should be fired.

But of course no one really is neutral in quite the way that I’m suggesting.

The point is that to be strictly consistent in an absolute “no reforms” stance

would require us to act as though the smaller immediate controversies were

of no importance to our larger cause. In reality, the situation is quite

different. If we are ever going to be able to build an effective police

abolitionist movement, we have to be seen to be addressing these immediate

concerns and doing so in a way that connects to a broader social vision.

The difference between the police accountability perspective and the

abolitionist perspective is not a question of reforms or no reforms. The

difference is, in fact, much deeper. The two views suggest fundamentally

different visions of society, and correspondingly, different logics of political

action. Accountability and abolition are not merely different goals, but

different strategic orientations.

The “police accountability” framework suggests, necessarily, that policing

can be improved simply by bringing it under the control of the community,

or if not the community, than at least its elected representatives. This ```

``` approach suggests, of course, that the institution will survive, albeit in a

more friendly, more lawful form. The view of policing implied in this

perspective is that it is legitimate and necessary, and that the problems it

presents        are   the    effect     of   individual        misconduct         or   organizational

dysfunction.

The abolitionist critique, on the other hand, is that the problems of

policing—the          racism,     the   class    bias,    the    violence—speak          to   the    real

character and the deepest purpose of the institution. The answer, then, is not

to create better, smarter, more sensitive, skilled, and law-abiding cops; the

answer     is    to   get   rid   of   the   institution   altogether       and    put   in   its   place

something that genuinely does meet our needs for public safety and dispute

resolution. As it happens, that requires a totally different kind of society,

one without the inequalities that the cops preserve, and the hope is that by

going after the cops we bring that new society closer to existence.

Now these are very different ways of looking at our society and of

thinking    about      the    police.    But    they     are    not   so   divergent     as   to    make

cooperation impossible: For while abolitionists want to eliminate the police,

so long as they exist we also want to limit the abuses they can inflict.

The challenge is to pursue only those reforms that lead us closer to the

goal of a world without police. That means avoiding reforms that help

police institutions to repair themselves, that extend their lives or increase

their power, that bolster public confidence in the criminal justice system, or

that expand the cops’ reach into or influence over community life.

Unfortunately it is impossible to create two stable lists of good or bad

campaigns. The decisions here turn on questions of strategy, which means

they are bound to change as conditions do. What is daring and radical today

may seem tame and conservative in a year; and what would represent an

unconscionable concession in one part of the country might actually be a

signal victory in another.

So I’m not going to propose a concrete agenda. But I can offer some

criteria that will help us set our priorities. Worthwhile campaigns should do

at least some of the following: Discredit the police in the public view.

Isolate the cops politically; divide them from potential sources of support.

Suppress officer morale; impede recruiting; and promote whistle-blowing. ```

``` Reduce the resources available to the criminal justice system. Frustrate the

police in the pursuit of their own agenda; publicly demonstrate that the law-

and-order agenda can be defeated. Present the case for abolition. Situate our

demands as part of a larger movement for freedom and equality. Undercut

the cops’ sense of impunity. Exacerbate rather than mitigate the crises in our

opponents’ organizations. Give the community a sense of its own agency.

Draw in increasing numbers of participants, and show a greater depth of

commitment and an increase in activity over time. And in general, shift

power away from the police and toward the community.

In short, we need to pursue reforms that make further changes more, not

less, possible. And we need to do so in ways that expand rather than restrict

the opportunities for further struggle. If we succeed in all that—while also

avoiding the dangers of co-optation and surviving the repression we will

inevitably face—then we can win reforms that do genuinely build toward a

world without police.

We can work for accountability and abolition simultaneously, but we can

only do so with an abolitionist strategy.

Making Copwatch Matter (2011)

Why do we copwatch?

Let’s begin by acknowledging that we had better have some reason for

doing this rather unusual thing. I mean, as far as most people are concerned,

the idea of deliberately going out and looking for the cops, knowing that

they are not going to be pleased to see you, actually sounds rather insane.

In my experience, copwatching is typified by two types of events. One is

some   sort   of   political   demonstration,   in   which   the   police   attack   large

numbers of people; the nature of copwatching requires that we be more or

less near the center of that attack, and there is a very good chance of being

arrested or injured. Moreover, it requires that we not run away, even when

every instinct of self-preservation would urge us to do so.

The other type of situation is the routine traffic stop, where copwatching

means standing patiently for long stretches of time, usually in the dark and

(where I live, in Portland) in the rain, watching what is normally an

uneventful interaction, and then proceeding, uncertainly, to the next, equally

uneventful interaction.

Why do we do it?

It can’t just be for fun. But what is it that separates copwatching from

bird-watching, star-gazing, or train-spotting? Is it something more than an

eccentric hobby?

Well, the obvious answer is that the police need watching. Birds and stars

and probably even trains behave quite decently whether or not outside

observers pay any attention to them. Not so the police. The police, as part of

their trade, bully and intimidate people; they hurt them and humiliate them;

they violate their rights in a thousand ways, large and small. They most

commonly do these things when no one is looking, and the theory suggests

that they do so in part because no one is looking.

I don’t know of any sound empirical study on the effect civilian observers

have on police behavior. But anecdotally, from my own experience, I have

heard enough people say that the tone of the interaction changed when

Copwatch arrived that I believe there must be something to it. ```

``` So this is one kind of answer: When we copwatch we’re actually looking

for something that we don’t want to see. We observe the cops in order to

discourage misconduct.

And of course, when misconduct does happen, we document it for the

sake of holding the police accountable. That may mean helping the victims

to file complaints or pursue lawsuits. Or it may mean a media campaign, or

some effort to publicly shame the cops involved.

Copwatching does, at least, help document what happened from a third-

party   perspective.    Whatever      approach   we   may      take    to   addressing       the

grievances in a particular case, the effort will naturally benefit from a firm

evidentiary foundation. It opens the way for further action.

But isn’t there also something more? Aren’t these tactics of ours supposed

to connect, in some way, to our idea of a better world? Aren’t we after

something beyond more polite traffic stops? How does copwatching move

us closer to a world without racism, without poverty, without state violence?

There is a sort of symbolic politics at play. The police represent the

coercive power of the state. And policing, as it is normally done, suggests a

certain idealized relationship between the state and the populace, in which

power flows only in one direction. The police stop us, question us, hurt us,

jail us. The state, in other words, is the actor and the population is the object

on which it acts.

Copwatching, in its very small way, changes this dynamic. The collective

act of observation shifts the power, at least in the moment. The police are

suddenly confronted with a limit to their impunity, or, at the very least, with

the notion that people care about how they do their jobs, that we care about

the people the police target. It tilts the balance, slightly or seriously, away

from the cops and toward the community.

And,    in   these    days    of   cell-phone   cameras    and       Youtube       video,    as

observation    becomes        increasingly   generalized,      the    hope     is   that     this

observation   becomes     a    permanent     constraint   on   police       action.   If   their

behavior changes when they know people are watching, and if people are

always watching, then maybe the simple fact of observation will help

change their behavior overall. Perhaps, the disciplinary gaze can be turned

back on the agents of the state. ```

``` I said the hope. I said maybe. Perhaps.

The truth is that there is very little evidence of that sort of thing actually

occurring. After all, security cameras do very little to discourage other

kinds of crime—the kinds that may actually result in punishment. Why

should we expect pervasive video surveillance to deter police misconduct—

that is, to prevent crimes that, even when discovered, rarely result in

punishment?

Video technology has become increasingly common in the last thirty

years, and especially in the last ten. But police violence has not seen a

noticeable decline during the same period.

The    documentation          is    only    as    effective    as   the   mechanisms          of

accountability.   If   there    is   no     effective   means     for   holding    the    police

accountable—no         meaningful      discipline,      no   civilian   review    process,     no

chance of prosecution—then the evidence just doesn’t matter.

And also, if the legal and policy framework allows for wanton brutality, it

makes no difference what enforcement mechanisms exist, or don’t. All three

elements must be in place—the rules, the enforcement, and the evidence.

Copwatching, on its own—that is, mere observation, removed from further

action—only provides the last of these elements, the evidence.

Which suggests that copwatching cannot be understood in purely legalistic

terms. It has to engage with the larger political context.

In January 2009, when Oakland transit cops forced an unarmed black man

to the floor of a train platform, restrained him, and shot him in the back—

the entire incident was caught on video. The murder of Oscar Grant was not

recorded   by   trained,   experienced,           organized    copwatch     teams,       but   by

bystanders with cell phones, who then hid the evidence from police at the

scene and posted it to the internet in the hours following.

The response of the authorities was quite telling: They did nothing.

The response of the community was quite different. A few days after the

shooting, there was a protest, which became a riot.

Almost at once, the mayor issued a statement of concern. The Justice

Department started a civil rights investigation. And Johannes Mehserle, the

cop who shot Oscar Grant, was arrested and charged with murder.

Copwatching was not enough. It took riots. ```

``` Which is to say: The law is not enough; we need politics.

Or: Reason is not enough; it takes force.

Force, here, does not always mean violence. But it does mean imposing

the will of one group of people on another group; in particular, imposing

the will of the community on the police. Under the logic of democracy, of

course, it should go without saying that the community ought to control the

police; by the logic of policing, on the other hand, the police must control

the community. Democracy is unthinkable.

Force does not always mean violence, but it does imply some form of

attack.

Specifically, attacking the things our adversaries need, or want, or care

about, until it is more costly for the authorities to allow things to continue as

they are than it would be to give us what we want.

Typically these attacks do not target personnel and property, but instead

disrupt the usual sense of order and undermine the legitimacy of the people

in charge. In practical terms, that usually means interfering with commerce

and eroding public support for the government.

It is with the latter—the attack on legitimacy—that copwatching becomes

politically useful.

All governments rule by force; and yet all governments depend, to a very

large degree, on the consent—or rather, the acquiescence—of the governed.

The problem for the state is that the use of force always contains the danger

of converting that consent into suspicion and resentment and resistance.

Violence can be discrediting.

Copwatching, by showing how much the state relies on force, and the kind

of force it uses, and the purposes to which it is employed, exploits this

weakness. It takes the state’s own greatest advantage—its monopoly on

violence—and turns it into its largest liability. Our best trick is to use the

state’s own strength against it.

It is true, as I said, that copwatching was not enough to bring Johannes

Mehserle to account for shooting Oscar Grant. It took riots. But the riots did

not just occur because of the shooting. Police shoot unarmed black men

with some regularity, and riots occur only infrequently. The incident itself

was just the spark to ignite the accumulated anger of the community. And ```

``` copwatching—direct             observation     and       documentation       by      the   community

itself—helped to distinguish this incident from so many others like it.

The video was not merely evidence, it was not merely proof. It was a

means of communicating the horror of what happened. It was a means of

spreading     the   pain,      the   anger.   If   the    shooting     was     the   spark       and   the

accumulated grievances of the community were the powder keg, the video

was the fuse that connected the one to the other.

I spoke earlier of imposing the community’s will on the police, but of

course,   even      in   the   face   of     widespread      unrest,    that    does       not    happen

automatically. The community’s will is not a thing that comes ready-made,

just waiting to be enacted. It is, instead, always in the process of formation,

and decay, and recomposition.

And this brings us back around to the other half of politics. For politics is

not only about fighting our enemies; it is also about developing our own

capacities, forming alliances, building support, pushing an agenda, and

creating that broad, tentative sense of direction that I referred to earlier as

the will of the community.

Copwatching cannot, on its own, take us very far at all. It relies on, and

requires, a broader range of political action, involving large numbers of

people and capable of forcing concessions from the authorities.

In my experience, with several organizations doing various kinds of

copwatch-style work, this sort of public engagement has generally been the

weakest element, rarely reaching beyond patrols, trainings, and propaganda

of one kind or another.

We have commonly done a good job of communicating our perspective to

the public. At various times we’ve managed to discredit police leaders, to

articulate nascent grievances, to put forward critiques and level demands

that   have    changed         both    the    discourse      in   the    newspapers              and   the

conversations one hears on the bus or in the bars.

But we have generally not done a good job providing ways for people to

participate if they don’t want to go on patrol—and as I pointed out at the

beginning of this talk, most people don’t want to go on patrol.

And even where we have projects for people besides, or between, patrols;

it is usually unclear how this other work relates to the patrols. In other ```

``` words, even when Copwatch groups contribute in some way to broader

campaigns,        it   is   often   unclear   how     this   other    work   relates   to   the

copwatching—which forces us to ask, not only “How does this tactic

connect to our goals?,” but also: “How do our organizations relate to this

tactic?”

It is a mistake, I think, to define our organizations according to our tactics,

though     this    may      to   some   extent   be   implied    by    adopting   the   word

“copwatch” as part of an organization’s name. There is a certain analytic

sense to thinking that Copwatch groups watch the cops: It’s what we do. It’s

what gives our organizations their distinctive character.

We have to remember, though, that tactics are just tactics. They’re tools,

they’re weapons, they’re maneuvers. They are means to some end, and they

have to be evaluated accordingly. There’s nothing magical about them, and

we shouldn’t let our tactics devolve into rituals, or games, or pantomime.

Our tactics, our practices, our activities need to be evaluated, in large part,

according to whether and how well they help us to move closer to our goals.

This implies, of course, that we have goals, and that we know what they are.

So: What are our goals?

Some of us want to abolish the police. We want to dismantle the entire

system of cops and courts and prisons and lethal injections.

Some of us have more modest aims—some set of reforms, some sense of

accountability. Those folks want to strengthen the civilian review board, or

to end racial profiling, or to take tasers out of the cops’ hands, or to make

sure that killer cops are fired.

That is not really, or always, a dichotomy. Many of us fall in both camps,

wanting reforms now, to limit the worst abuses, while we work toward a

world where cops just don’t exist.

In any case, it’s worth noticing that our motivations point to conditions

beyond the institution of policing. We want to live in a world free from

racism, with more equality, and less violence, and so on. We want freedom,

justice, peace—a world where our lives are our own, and a future fit for

human beings to live in it.

That’s a tall order. It’s a long war, and there is no guarantee that we will

win it. ```

``` What we need to be able to see, though, is how our actions today help to

move us toward that better world.

To understand that, we need to understand the role of the police in our

present society.

I’ve written about this question at length, so I’m not going to get too

deeply into it this morning. But my main conclusion in Our Enemies in Blue

is that the overall tendency in policing is to behave in ways that preserve the

existing distribution of power, that protect the hierarchy, that maintain social

inequality. On the whole, the police act to protect the power white people

exercise over people of color, the power of men over women, the power of

the native-born over the immigrant, the power of the rich over the poor.

Notice that this is true at every level, from the individual officer exercising

his discretion, to the commander forming strategies for deployment, to the

chief setting policy, to the legislature establishing the laws that the cops

enforce.

And it’s true historically, at the level of the institution slowly evolving over

the past couple hundred years. We can see it in the period of the slave

patrols, we can see it in the period of political machines. We can see it in

times of crisis, like the 1930s and the 1960s. And we can see it in our

present period of militarization and community policing.

Policing is an inherently conservative, inherently repressive institution.

The interests the cops protect are not our interests. The agenda they pursue

—often, without consciously realizing it—is the diametrical opposite of our

agenda.

And so—I argued earlier that any police reform, police accountability, or

police abolition effort has to be part of a larger movement for equality if it

wants to succeed. But the reverse is equally true, and for many of the same

reasons: Any movement for equality, if it hopes to succeed, has to take

action to restrain the police.

As the movement develops, when it becomes a threat to the established

order, a confrontation with the police becomes inevitable. The more the

police are constrained—by limited resources, by public opinion, by law—

the better the chances of the movement surviving. ```

``` Copwatching can have a dual role. We can help to organize against the

police, to justify and demand and maybe even implement real constraints on

their action. And we can also help in creating those broader movements

necessary for our success.

Copwatching can make a contribution, not only in discrediting the police,

but also in de-legitimizing the systems of power they represent. You can

learn a lot about a society by looking at the way violence is organized

within it, and in particular the types of violence it authorizes, and against

whom. And so—evidence of racial profiling, the systematic targeting of the

homeless, the criminalization of transgender and gender nonconforming

people—these tell us, not just something about policing, they also tell us

about racism, capitalism, and male supremacy.

The    use   of    violence   to   defend   inequality   is   doubly   discrediting.   It

discredits the violence and the institutions using it; and it can also discredit

the inequality itself. It shows how much systems of inequality rely on

brutality, and so it de-naturalizes them; it shows that stratification is not a

fair,   inevitable    outcome    based    on    inherent   differences    in   individual

character, but rather that it is a result of deliberate human action, often ugly,

bloody, brutal action.

Violence is something that people do to other people; and if systems of

inequality rely on violence, then that shows that inequality is also something

imposed, something created. Something that some people do to others.

That was one of the paradoxes of the 1960s, much to the frustration of our

rulers: The more they tried to repress the social movements of the day—the

American civil rights movement in particular—the more popular those

movements became, and in part they became increasingly popular because

of the repression.

The attacks on peaceful protestors—the police dogs, the fire hoses, the

baton charges, the occasional shooting, much of it broadcast on network TV

—only increased the public’s sympathy for the demonstrators and added to

the pressure on the government. That violence, especially Police Chief Bull

Connor’s actions in Birmingham, shocked the conscience of the nation and

embarrassed the government internationally. ```

``` But what black people understood is that the scale of the violence might

be unusual, but the violence itself was nothing new. It’s how the South was

governed. It’s how white supremacy preserves itself, everywhere that it

exists.

That violence, or the threat of it, is always present, to a greater or lesser

degree. But the legitimacy of our social system relies on it being, for the

most part, invisible, deniable, unreported. Unaccountable. And when it is

reported, when it becomes visible to the public at large, it has to be

misrepresented as an anomaly, an exception, an excess, another case of a

few bad apples.

Our job, or part of it, is finding ways to counter that minimizing narrative.

And that means, as we watch the cops, as we document their misconduct—

we have to use it to point, beyond this or that incident, beyond these few

officers, or the policies they’re following, or the laws they’re enforcing. We

have to point to the institution itself, and its role in our society, and the

nature of that society, such that it needs that sort of violence.

We can do that, but we can only do it if we refuse to back away from the

most radical implications of our work. We can only do it if we situate both

our   work   and   our   organizations    within   broad,   mass-based     social

movements, movements pressing for equality on multiple fronts.

It is in this context that we can see the real value of copwatching. But it is

also in this context that we can see the enormity of the task before us.

Our mission is not just to change police behavior, or even to change the

police institution. Our mission is to change the world.

``` Our Demands Should be an Attack

We are marching today, with grief and anger, because the police shot and

killed Alan Blueford.

But not just Alan Blueford. We are marching because the police killed

Mack Woodfox, Jose Buenrostro-Gonzalez, Anita Gay, Oscar Grant—and

so many others.

In a country where police kill, on average, 365 people per year—one a day

—and where almost a third of those people are black, when the cops shoot a

                                                              303
young black man it cannot be treated as an accident.                It cannot be

understood as a mistake. It is not even a crime in the ordinary sense.

When the cops kill people of color that is simply the normal operation of

a racist institution in a grossly unequal society. That’s the job that the police

are put there to do.

That role goes all the way back to the origin of the institution. The

modern U.S. police are the descendants of an older body called the slave

patrols. Those patrols were militia organizations responsible for keeping

slaves on the plantation and, more importantly, responding to or preventing

slave revolts. As the country industrialized and urbanized, the slave patrols

evolved and took on the characteristics of what we now recognize as a

modern police force. And, tellingly, their mission expanded—not only the

control of slaves, but free blacks and poor whites as well.

In the two centuries since, the form of inequality has changed—from

slavery, to segregation, to legal equality masking social inequality—but the

role of the police has remained remarkably constant. The police developed

to control poor people and people of color, and they are still on that job

today.

That suggests to me, very strongly, that the racism and violence of the

police are not incidental, but are inherent features of the institution. And

that means, among other things, that we cannot reform our way out of our

police problem. ```

``` The twentieth century was the century of reform. We saw progressive

campaigns    against    municipal    corruption,   mid-century     efforts    to

professionalize the police force, then the introduction of military discipline,

the emergence of community policing, diversity training, and the creation of

advisory boards. And as a result, the police today are better paid, better

trained, better organized, better armed than at any other point in history—

and they continue to act as racist thugs. That core function of preserving

inequality remains very much the same.

Our efforts, then, should not be directed toward fixing this institution—but

toward destroying it. As we make our demands and plan our campaigns, this

ultimate goal must always be kept in mind. We should pursue changes that

de-legitimize, demoralize, discredit, and disempower the police and which,

correspondingly, energize, embolden, and empower the community. When

we demand justice, let us be clear that it is not the justice of the courts and

the government, but the justice that abolishes courts and government that is

required.

Our very demands should be a form of attack.

``` Acknowledgments

Given the passage of time, it is pointless to try to recall everyone who

assisted me in writing the articles collected in this volume. In addition to

the librarians who aided in research, the editors who cleaned up my copy,

and others who moved things along as a part of their daily jobs, thanks are

also owed to numerous of my friends who reviewed early drafts. They gave

freely of their time, shared their ideas, and often posed important questions,

all of which benefited both my writing and my thinking. I hope that I have

thanked them all in person, because here I will have to get by with a general

recognition of the debt I owe.

Most of all, I want to thank the past members of Rose City Copwatch, a

group whose importance to my work and my life is likely obvious from the

chapters assembled here. The decade in which I was a member of Copwatch

was one of profound personal, political, and intellectual growth, and much

of that came as a result of my participation in the organization.

Rose City Copwatch’s political culture was one of practical radicalism—

seeking both to articulate a fundamental challenge to the structure of our

society and to have a real effect on events as they unfolded. Its intellectual

culture was one of continuous questioning and investigation, challenging

our own ideas and searching out new and better solutions to the problems

we faced. That even our disagreements always unfolded in a spirit of

openness and mutual respect strikes me now as exceptional, but it was very

much   taken   for    granted   at   the   time.   Many   of   the   lessons   from   my

experiences    with    Copwatch      have    been   incorporated     into   my   overall

thinking, and thus my writing, and in a few cases—the “‘Cops for Labor’?”

essay comes first to mind—I was writing in direct response to questions that

originated within the group. Copwatch supported, encouraged, and made

use of my writing and its associated skills, but never tried to make me a

figurehead or treat me as the resident theorist. We theorized, strategized,

inquired, and argued together, and I know my ideas benefited from my

exposure to the questions, insights, and challenges of others in the group.

Along the way, I gained several close friendships, often unexpectedly.

Some of those friends I have lost touch with, or seldom see; others remain a ```

Clenched Fists Empty Pockets

Six working-class activists from Sweden discuss their experiences with

class and middle-class hegemony in a variety of left-wing scenes and

organizations. In doing so they flesh out the complexities and limits of what

in Sweden is referred to as a “class journey.” Dealing with more than

economic realities, the authors grapple with the full gamut of cultural and

social class hierarchies that are embedded in the society and the left.


The Communist Necessity, by J. Moufawad-Paul

A polemical interrogation of the practice of “social movementism” that has

enjoyed a normative status at the centres of capitalism. Aware of his past

affinity with social movementism, and some apprehension of the problem of

communist orthodoxy, the author argues that the recognition of

communism’s necessity “requires a new return to the revolutionary

communist theories and experiences won from history.”


Confronting Fascism: Discussion Documents for a Militant Movement,

by Don Hamerquist, J. Sakai, Xtn of ARA Chicago, Mark Salotte

Breaking with established Left practice, this book attempts to deal with the

questions of fascism and anti-fascism in a serious and non-dogmatic

manner. Attention is paid to to the class appeal of fascism, its continuities

and breaks with the “regular” far-right and also even with the Left, the ways

in which the fascist movement is flexible and the ways in which it isn’t. Left

failures, both in opposing fascism head-on, and also in providing a viable

alternative to right-wing revolt, are also dealt with at length.

Jailbreak Out of History: the Re-Biography of Harriet Tubman and

“The Evil of Female Loaferism”, by Butch Lee

Examining how the anticolonial struggles of New Afrikan/Black women

were central to the unfolding of 19th century amerika, both during and

“after” slavery. The book’s title essay, “The Re-Biography of Harriet

Tubman”, recounts the life and politics of Harriet Tubman, who waged and

eventually lead the war against the capitalist slave system. “The Evil of

Female Loaferism” details New Afrikan women’s attempts to withdraw

from and evade capitalist colonialism, an unofficial but massive labor strike

which threw the capitalists North and South into a panic. The ruling class

response consisted of the “Black Codes”, Jim Crow, re-enslavement through

prison labor, mass violence, and ... the establishment of a neo-colonial

Black patriarchy, whose task was to make New Afrikan women subordinate

to New Afrikan men just as New Afrika was supposed to be subordinate to

white amerika.


Kuwasi Balagoon: A Soldier’s Story, by Kuasi Balagoon with

contributions by Sandiata Acoli, David Gilbert, J. Sakai, and Meg Starr

Kuwasi Balagoon was a defendant in the Panther 21 case in the late sixties,

and a member of the Black Liberation Army. Captured and convicted of

various crimes against the State, he spent much of the 1970s in prison,

escaping twice. After each escape, he went underground and resumed BLA

activity. He was captured in December 1981, charged with participating in

an armoured truck expropriation in West Nyack, New York, on October 21

of that year, an action in which two police officers and a money courier were

killed. Convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, he died of

pneumocystis carninii pneumonia, an AIDS-related illness, on December

13, 1986. ```

``` The Military Strategy Of Women and Children, by Butch Lee

How, in a man’s world, women can make revolutionary change? Here,

Butch Lee lays out the need for an autonomous and independent women’s

revolutionary movement, a revolutionary women’s culture that involves not

only separating oneself from patriarchal imperialism, but also in

confronting, opposing, and waging war against it by all means necessary. Of

particular interest is Lee’s critique of reformist “feminism”, and her

examination of how genocide, colonialism and patriarchy are intertwined,

not only historically but also in the present.


Our Commitment Is to Our Communities: Mass Incarceration,

Political Prisoners, and Building a Movement for Community-Based

Justice, by David Gilbert

Interviewed by Bob Feldman, political prisoner David Gilbert discusses the

ongoing catastrophe that is mass incarceration, connecting it to the

continued imprisonment of political prisoners and the challenges that face

our movements today.


Settlers: Mythology of the White Proletariat from Mayflower to

Modern, by J. Sakai

Settlers exposes the fact that America’s white citizenry have never

supported themselves but have always resorted to exploitation and theft,

culminating in acts of genocide to maintain their culture and way of life. As

recounted in painful detail by Sakai, the United States has been built on the

theft of Indigenous lands and of Afrikan labor, on the robbery of the

northern third of Mexico, the colonization of Puerto Rico, and the

expropriation of the Asian working class, with each of these crimes being

accompanied by violence. This new edition includes “Cash & Genocide:

The True Story of Japanese-American Reparations” and an interview with

author J. Sakai by Ernesto Aguilar.

The Urban Guerilla Concept, by The Red Army Faction

Introduction by Andre Moncourt and J. Smith

With an introduction by Andre Moncourt and J. Smith. The first major

ideological text from West Germany’s most famous urban guerillas. This

document merits attention from anyone who wants to understand the

motivation and ideology behind the beginning of a long and violent

confrontation between the Red Army Faction and the German state. Apart

from setting out the justification for armed struggle this text touches on: the

strength of the capitalist system in West Germany; the weaknesses of the

revolutionary Left; the significance of the German student movement; the

meaning and importance of internationalism; the necessity for taking a

revolutionary initiative; the importance of class analysis and political

praxis; the failure of parliamentary democracy and how this had the

inevitable consequence of political violence; the factionalism of the German

Left; and the organization and logistics of setting up an illegal armed

struggle.


The Worker Elite: Notes on the “Labor Aristocracy”, by Bromma

Revolutionaries often say that the working class holds the key to

overthrowing capitalism. But “working class” is a very broad category—so

broad that it can be used to justify a whole range of political agendas. The

Worker Elite: Notes on the “Labor Aristocracy” breaks it all down,

criticizing opportunists who minimize the role of privilege within the

working class, while also challenging simplistic Third Worldist analyses.
