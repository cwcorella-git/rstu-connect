A Guide to Compassionate Communication for Mutual Aid & Everyday Life
Communication isn’t just about words, it’s about connection. Whether you're organizing a
community garden, navigating housemate chores, or showing up for a friend, speaking and
listening with care makes the magic happen. Inspired by Marshall Rosenberg’s Nonviolent
Communication (NVC), here’s a simple, heart-centered framework to help keep conversations
clear, respectful, and rooted in solidarity.



🛠 The 4-Part Toolset

   1. OBSERVATION (What’s real?)
      Say what you see or hear without judgment or exaggeration.
      💬 “When I saw the dishes still in the sink this morning…”
      (Not: “You never clean up after yourself!”)

   2. FEELINGS (What’s alive in you?)
      Share your inner weather, not your inner lawyer.
      💬 “…I felt overwhelmed and kinda frazzled…”
       Feelings ≠ thoughts. Say “I feel…” + an emotion, not “I feel like you’re rude.”

   3. NEEDS (What’s the core need?)
      Beneath every feeling is a basic human need—respect, rest, support, choice.
      💬 “…because I really need cooperation and shared effort around here.”

   4. REQUESTS (What would help?)
      Ask for something concrete, doable, and kind.
      💬 “Would you be up for taking turns doing the dishes this week?”

🤝 Listening Like a Comrade

💡 When someone talks to you, try reflecting what they said before responding.
“Sounds like you were feeling stressed and needed more backup, did I get that right?”
It builds trust and helps folks feel seen.

✨ Keep It Mutual, Keep It Real

   ●   Curiosity > Criticism: Assume folks are doing their best with the tools they’ve got.
       Feelings aren’t threats: They're just signals. Let them guide understanding, not blame.
       Say it before you spray it: Express needs early, not after you explode.
   ●   Solidarity means showing up: With your words and your willingness to grow.


Compassionate communication is a skill, not a superpower. We’re learning together. Make
space for awkward moments, belly laughs, and do-overs. Let’s talk, and listen, like the world
we’re trying to build depends on it. 💖🌍✊
