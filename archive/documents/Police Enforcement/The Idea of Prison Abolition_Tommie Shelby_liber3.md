In *Dark Ghettos* (2016), I argued that black metropolitan neighborhoods with high levels of concentrated disadvantage should, on grounds of justice, be abolished. Ending ghettoization would, I said, require a radical transformation of the basic structure of U. S. society, and I insisted that such efforts at fundamental change should include the ghetto poor as essential and equal partners. This book asks whether prisons, which incarcerate an extraordinary number of ghetto denizens, should also be abolished.

The Idea of Prison Abolition began as the Carl G. Hempel Lectures, which I delivered at Princeton University in 2018. I am immensely grateful for the Princeton Philosophy Department's invitation and for its warm hospitality. I received invaluable critical feedback on the project during my campus visit, and I thoroughly enjoyed, and learned from, the many conversations, formal and informal, that my lectures provoked. I was able to devote myself to writing these lectures, with time away from my regular academic responsibilities, because of a generous fellowship from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation.

An earlier version of Chapter 1 appeared as "Army of the Wronged: Autobiography, Political Prisoners, and Black

Radicalism," in *Cannons and Codes: Law, Literature, and America's Wars*, ed. Alison La Croix, Jonathan Masur, Martha Nussbaum, and Laura Weinrib (Oxford University Press, 2021). Chapter 4 is a revised version of "What's Wrong with the Prison Industrial Complex? Profit, Privatization, and the Circumstances of Injustice," in *A Political Economy of Justice*, ed. Danielle Allen, Yochai Benkler, Leah Downey, Rebecca Henderson, and Josh Simons (University of Chicago Press, 2022).

As with my previous monographs, this book combines my interests in philosophy and black studies. My devotion to these two academic fields has been nurtured and strengthened by colleagues and students in the Department of African and African American Studies and the Department of Philosophy at Harvard University. I owe a special thanks to the students in my "Punishment and Imprisonment" seminar. It was enormously helpful to think through these ideas with you. The students and faculty in my colleague Lucas Stanczyk's "State Violence" seminar also provided useful critical feedback on several chapters. And I'm grateful to the participants in my colleague Brandon Terry's "Philosophy, Social Thought, and Criticism" workshop for their critical engagement with material from the manuscript.

Elizabeth Hinton, Christopher Lewis, Lucas Stanczyk, Brandon Terry, and Adaner Usmani read drafts of the manuscript and offered many useful suggestions and constructive criticisms. Many other colleagues, students, and friends offered helpful feedback on chapter drafts or provided other advice and valuable assistance, including Danielle Allen, Richard Arneson, Lawrie Balfour, David Brink, Bruno Carvalho, Paul Clarke, Ruth Coffey, Derrick Darby, Janine de Novais, Candice Delmas, Justin Driver, Lidal Dror, Tweedy Flanigan, Thomas Frampton, Lori

Gruen, Deborah Hellman, David Jenkins, Corey Katz, Erin Kelly, Randall Kennedy, David Knight, Issa Kohler-Hausmann, Christopher Kutz, Rose Lenehan, Mohan Matthen, Tracey Meares, Christia Mercer, Darrel Moellendorf, Osagie Obasogie, Deborah Poritz, Gurpreet Rattan, Judith Resnik, Luke Roelofs, Wendy Salkin, Robert Sampson, Tim Scanlon, Seana Shiffrin, Kaia Stern, Iakovos Vasiliou, Jeremy Waldron, James Whitman, and Leo Zaibert.

Over the last few years, I have presented ideas and arguments from the book project as lectures, conference talks, and workshop papers at several universities, including Brandeis University, CUNY Graduate Center, Harvard University, Humboldt University of Berlin, Goethe University, Leiden University, London School of Economics, Loyola University in Chicago, New York University, Oxford University, Saint Louis University, Stanford University, Tufts University, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, University College London, University of Copenhagen, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Pittsburgh, University of Toronto, University of Virginia, University of Warwick, University of Wisconsin, and Yale University. I'm grateful for the invitations to present my work in progress and for the feedback and suggestions from participants at those events.

The book has been improved because of the thoughtful and sometimes sharply critical comments from three anonymous reviewers for Princeton University Press. I did not follow their advice in every instance, but I benefited greatly from giving every suggestion serious consideration. Matt Rohal, my extraordinary editor, went far beyond the call of duty. He not only provided extensive feedback on every chapter but pushed me to make the book better using a perfect balance of constructive criticism, patience, and encouragement. I also thank Rob Tempio, Publisher at Princeton University Press, for his professionalism and guidance throughout the process. Jodi Beder is a meticulous, thoughtful, and efficient copy editor. Ellen Foos kept the production trains running on time. I thank David Luljak for composing the index and Kierstan Kaushal-Carter for assisting with proofreading. Bréond Durr was an invaluable and resourceful research assistant, and I look forward to seeing him soon make his mark rethinking juvenile imprisonment.

I also want to thank Angela Davis, whom I have long admired, for her extraordinary writings and steadfast commitment to fighting for the freedom of the oppressed. It was reflecting on her life and work that stirred me to think through the role of prisons in modern society.

Although my wife Jessie knows the depths of my debts to her, I want to thank her here, once again, for her steady loving support, patient ear, and wise editorial hand. I'm deeply grateful to my kids Ella and Christopher for their good will and tolerance as I wrote another "boring" book instead of spending more time with them. I dedicate this book to the memory of my grandmother Mattie Brock, who saved her adolescent grandson from falling into the abyss when he had lost his way.

## THE IDEA OF PRISON ABOLITION

#### **Introduction: Reform or Abolition?**

he nited tates has a higher imprisonment rate than any country on the planet, ith more than tenty- ve percent o the orld's prisoners. Walnut treet rison, the rst in the nation, opened in hiladelphia in , initially as a conventional jail and then expanded in into a state penitentiary, here convicted prisoners ere reuired to perorm hard laor in solitude. ut orms o incarceration, used or a variety o purposes, have existed in other places or centuries. While many historical examples are oviously horriying and inhumane, today's prisons, in the nited tates and elsehere, continue to raise serious uestions o justice and human rights.

t is a hopeul sign o moral pro gress that many elieve prison systems, around the gloe ut especially in the nited tates, are in urgent need o undamental change. e pro lem o mass incarceration has received road and deep nes coverage. umerous pulic stories, oth reported and rst- person accounts, detail the generally dreadul lives o prisoners. er sis tent and sometimes militant activism is directed at reorming prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers. What is more, the elie that major reorms are needed in our prisons, and in our criminal law systems more broadly, cuts across the political spectrum, with many conservatives joining the call.<sup>3</sup>

More recently, a growing number of voices call for more than reform. They demand that we stop using prisons altogether. This political and philosophical outlook—known as "prison abolition" or sometimes "penal abolition"—rejects the very idea that incarceration can be a justified penalty for committing a crime. Prison abolition is radical, counterintuitive, and strikes some as absurd. But perhaps the abolitionists are correct—that prisons simply cannot be reformed, that even the most ideal prison would be indefensible. Prisons do tremendous and lasting harm, and this damage extends beyond prisoners to their families and communities. If a society relies on prisons, as all modern societies do, this use demands compelling defense. And so I welcome the call to scrutinize this long-standing practice.

Those convinced that prison reform is feasible and required by justice have long argued against defenders of the status quo and against those who benefit from the current broken system. Yet, with rising interest in and advocacy for prison abolition, it has now become essential for advocates of prison reform to put their views on trial against a significant and potentially superior alternative. Indeed, some abolitionists insist that reform efforts are not just ineffective but legitimize an inherently dehumanizing and unjust practice. In effect, they charge prison reformers, including those who might be well meaning, serious, and earnest, with complicity in maintaining an oppressive social practice. Some abolitionists also argue that prison reform is a liberal-capitalist project that lacks the radical imagination needed to bring about a truly humane, democratic, and ree society. ese charges arrant thoughtul philosophical aention.

#### hilosophy, unishment, and risons t the heart o the vocation o philosophy is an inclination to consider radical ideas, to entertain the heretical thought, to not dismiss the "cray" proposal. We should e open, even disposed, to uestioning common sense and current arrangements, even hen doing so is highly unpop u lar and poses some personal ris. Once e have thoroughly considered the radical thesis, e may nd that e cannot accept it, that there are not compelling enough reasons to endorse it. We may nonetheless come aay ith a deeper appreciation o the relevant pro lems and pos si le solutions, and ith a stronger grasp o hat maers most.

or centuries, philosophers— lato, uinas, Kant, entham, and many more— have rien extensively aout punishment and its justication. ey have proposed and criticied theories ased on retriution, deterrence, consent, oreiture, airness, reconciliation, rehailitation, moral education, and other things. ese philosophical theories typically astract aay rom the concrete and grim realities o imprisonment, including the related uestions o politi cal economy and pulic nance. t is generally taen or granted that i penalties or criminal rongdoing are legitimate, then a prison sentence is among the penalties that can e legitimately imposed. ese theories also usually assume that the society ithin hich imprisonment occurs is a just one (or nearly) and that the governing authority is ully legitimate. ut hat is yet to e shon—i it can e—is that imprisonment is a deensile practice in our on unjust society and orld, or that it ould e justiied under eer social conditions that e can realistically ring aout.

hi los o phers, legal scholars, and others have addressed the death penalty, and many are adamantly opposed to it, even hen the oense is especially heinous.e uestion o hether prisons should e aolished can e thought o in similar terms. Even i punishment as a practice is permissile, not all penalties are legitimate crime- control mea sures, notithstanding that some crimes are serious. or example, eould accept torture and maiming as legitimate orms o punishment, even i they did help to prevent crime. We should also as hether incarceration can e a legitimate penalty or a criminal oense.

We might ormulate the issue y distinguishing to uestions. irst, can the practice o imprisonment e justied despite existing structural injustices (or example, institutional racism and economic injustice), or should the use o prisons e discontinued, holly or in part, until these structural injustices have een corrected econd, could the practice o imprisonment ever e justied in a just social order, or ould a ully just society oviate the need or prisons and thereore mae their use illegitimate and repugnant ese are the uestions ill address.

is oo taes up aolitionist ideas as philosophy. e re ections oered, sometimes critical, are my ay o thining through hether to adopt aolition as my on philosophical and po liti cal stance. explore these thoughts ith the hope they might help others decide hether to e reormers or aolitionists. My reections have not led me to ecome an aolitionist, at least not in the most radical sense o that designation. ut have learned much rom thining aout aolitionist ideas, and have changed my mind, at times undamentally, aout the practice o imprisonment under current conditions and in our pos si le utures. is critical encounter ith the idea o prison aolition is thereore as much aout explaining hat thin aolitionists get right as it is aout shoing here elieve they go rong. t is not my aim, then, to oer "the case against aolition" ut rather to see hat can e gained, philosophically and practically, rom taing aolitionist ideas seriously.

#### ngela avis and lac ritical eory lthough all aolitionists share hostility toard prisons, aolitionist theory and practice is remaraly varied. ough roadly lefist in orientation, the radical anti- prison movement is not unied y an agreed- upon set o asic princi ples. ere are lac radical, Marxist, pacist, eminist, post- structuralist, and anarchist strands o aolitionist thought, activism, and organiing. do not survey or engage the ull evolving constellation o ideas and arguments that sel- descried prison aolitionists have put orard. ocus on the ide- ranging and hugely in uential philosophical contriutions o ngela Y. avis.

avis is the preeminent scholar- activist in the aolitionist movement, a prolic riter and deender o radical ideas, and a distinguished phi los o pher. he is a ey leader in the movement, and her or is a touchstone among aolitionists. n numerous oos, essays, speeches, lms, and intervies, avis has deended a orld ithout prisons as a morally reuired and realistic goal. Her anti- prison theoriing taes its shape ithin a distinctive and ell-developed philosophical rameor. nd in the context o such theoriing, she ass vital philosophical uestions, such as: "Ho do e imagine a eer orld and raise the uestions that permit us to see eyond the given"ining aout, and resisting, the practice o imprisonment has occupied avis or more than fy years. s she says, "a protracted engagement ith the prison system has literally dened my lie."

ot all o avis's ritings on prisons ocus on aolition. he critically engages prisons rom a range o perspectives and or a variety o purposes. or instance, in her early intellectual and po liti cal development, she ocused mainly on reeing po liti cal prisoners and exposing the ays that incarceration can e used as a mode o po liti cal repression (see hapter ). ut in time she came to argue that prisons are osolete. is stance suggests that although prisons may have had some legitimate uses in the past, they are currently unnecessary, either ecause these legitimate unctions can no e served in eer and less costly ays or ecause there is no longer a need to have these unctions served. avis has also deended prison aolition as a necessary component o eective re sis tance to neolieralism and as a ey demand in a demo cratic socialist movement. tae a road vie o hat rom her enormous corpus is relevant ut concentrate on those ritings that might plausily e thought to support the thesis that prisons, even the "est" ones, should not exist— hether no, in the near uture, or in a distant yet easile utopia.

or avis, tal o "aolition" rather than "reorm" is not merely provocative rhe toric or the strategic hyperole characteristic o some radical consciousness- raising discourse. avis argues that a reorm rameor gives prisons unarranted legitimacy and that hat is needed is to convince people that states are not justified in using prisons and that justice demands that we work together to eliminate them. This position is made clear in a recent coauthored book on abolition feminism, where Davis and her collaborators write:

What differentiates this explicitly abolitionist approach from prevailing ideas and scenarios addressing prison repression—both then and now—is the tenacious critique of prison reform and of criminal justice reform more broadly, as well as the recognition that the ideological impulse to contain all efforts to address the social damage wrought by prisons within the parameters of "reform" serves to further authorize incarceration as the legitimate and immutable foundation of justice.<sup>13</sup>

Moreover, Davis's language of "abolition" should not be interpreted as the propaganda of an elite vanguard of revolutionaries, nor as an expression of oracular wisdom from a charismatic leader who expects deference. Her organizing efforts are democratic, not demagogic. She seeks to work with others as equals, not to use them as unwitting instruments to the fulfillment of esoteric ideals. And in her writings, interviews, and public speaking, she proclaims her radical objectives openly and without apology.

Yet Davis does sometimes say things like the following:

When we are told that we simply need better police and better prisons, we counter with what we really need. We need to reimagine security, which will involve the abolition of policing and imprisonment *as we know them*. We will say demilitarize the police, disarm the police, abolish the institution of the police *as we know it*, and aolish imprisonment as the *dominant* mode o punishment [emphasis added].

is ind o phrasing ("as e no it" and "as the dominant mode") could e interpreted as ualiying the call or prison and police aolition in ays that might mae the distinction eteen aolition and reorm seem unimportant or to e merely a veral dispute. fer all, many reormers also ant to see policing and imprisonment radically changed. ese uali ying phrases suggest that e might still rely on police, provided they ere not armed ith military- grade eapons, or that e might use prisons, provided they ere not the *primary*orm o crime control. erhaps that is all some advocates mean y "aolition," a radical and evocative phrase that conjures up images o the aolitionist movement against chael slavery ut that, hen stripped o rhetorical ourish, means no more than a call or undamental change in la-enorcement practice. Yet that is not hat avis has in mind. ccordingly, ill explore prison aolition, not only in its more moderate versions, ut primarily in its oldest and most radical orm: a rejection o prison re orm, even undamental reorm, as the ultimate goal; and a practical vision o a society and orld that does not need or use prisons at all.

avis's critiue o prisons is situated ithin a roader critiue o racism, sexism, imperialism, and capitalism. he dras extensively on the traditions o Marxism, critical theory, eminism, and lac radicalism. too have een deeply inuenced y these traditions o thought, and my discussion o aolition ill largely operate ithin their par ameters.

Much con temporary lac radical thought, including lac eminist theory, has een shaped y currents in Marxism, particularly y strains in critical theory. s a radical approach to studying and critiuing modern Western civiliation, critical theory as orged in the s and early s at the ranurt ased nstitute or ocial esearch (nstitute ür oialorschung), hich as ounded in and has long een regarded as the principal institutional site o the "ranurt chool" tradition o critical theory. Herert Marcuse, an early and prominent ranurt chool theoretician, taught ngela avis as an undergraduate (at randeis niversity), served as her dissertation advisor (at an iego), and inuenced her thought sustantially. With Marcuse's encouragement, avis studied Kant, Hegel, and Marx at the nstitute in ranurt (then housed at Goethe niversity) rom to , here she aended lectures and participated in seminars conducted y eodorW. dorno, Jürgen Haermas, and other leading critical theorists. n suseuent years, and through a variety o oos and essays, avis developed her on approach to critical theory, hich dras not only on ranurt chool ideas ut also on the roader ro- modern intellectual tradition and radical eminist theory.

lac critical theorists, including avis, rely primarily on historical analy sis, social theory, cultural criticism, autoiographical narratives, personal experience, and experimental art to critiue existing social arrangements and to communicate their transormative vision. rue to their ranurt chool roots, they generally avoid and are ofen suspicious o mainstream "positivist" empirical social science o the sort one generally encounters in .. departments o po liti cal science, sociology, and economics. lac critical theory is decidedly and consciously interdisciplinary, methodologically unconventional, and transgressive ith re spect to estalished academic norms.

lac critical theorists, lie all critical theorists, are undamentally concerned ith lierating human eings rom oppression. ough they value intellectual activity, *eedom* is their ultimate goal, and they elieve radical structural transormation is needed to secure ull lieration. ejecting any sharp distinction eteen scholarship and po liti cal advocacy, their studies are not designed to e value- ree, disinterested inuiry ut orthrightly crafed to expose injustices, to deend the interests o the oppressed, and to highlight easile paths to a eer orld. ut they also, lie earlier Marxists, tend not to engage in systematic moral theory or normative po liti cal philosophy o the sort typical in mainstream "analytic" philosophy departments.

nlie the canonical gures o the ranurt chool, lac critical theorists are deeply inuenced y lac thiners hom they deem part o hat edric oinson amously called "the lac radical tradition." nuential thiners in this tradition include W. E.. u ois, . L.. James, laudia Jones, rant anon, Walter odney, and ngela avis hersel. his is a strand o the ider lac po liti cal tradition that dras insights not only rom Marxism, ut also rom revolutionary lac ationalism, ro- ariean radicalism, and an- rican socialism. lac radicals are sharply critical o class stratication and cap i tal ist laor exploitation ut eually concerned ith systemic racism and colonial sujugation. ey do not pin their hopes or lieration on the leadership o the hite oring class ut rather insist that those sujugated y hite supremacy and Euro- merican imperialism, including those relegated to slums, ghettos, and Bantustans around the world, are vital to any realistic hope for a truly free and democratic future.

### Afro-Analytical Marxism and the Black Radical Tradition

The critical inquiry this book takes up is, in some ways, incongruous with the philosophical and political orientation of Davis and other black critical theorists. Some of what I have written—and the way I have written it—may strike many as perplexingly (and perhaps perversely) at cross purposes with those I am engaging. To reduce this dissonance (and at the risk of appearing pedantic), let me be explicit about how my approach to thinking about prison abolition differs from recent trends in black critical theory and abolitionist writings.

I consider myself part of the black radical tradition, not the least because my thinking has been profoundly shaped by the writings of Du Bois, the canonical black radical thinker. <sup>17</sup> But unlike some black critical theorists, I do not regard the black radical tradition as diametrically opposed to all forms of liberalism. I believe that core ideas drawn from liberal-egalitarian thought in particular merit steadfast defense—a bedrock commitment to an equal and extensive set of basic liberties for all, prioritizing the well-being of the worst off, tolerance for different conceptions of human flourishing, and limiting economic inequality to protect both democratic practices and meaningful opportunities to secure valued positions in social life. Liberalism and capitalism, in my view, need not stand or fall together, and "liberal socialism" is not a contradiction in terms. Here

I follow John Rawls in thinking that sound principles of justice are incompatible with welfare-state capitalism and are consistent only with either a property-owning democracy (essentially, egalitarian social democracy) or liberal market socialism. I also agree with Rawls that while basic individual liberties are of the utmost importance and have moral priority over fostering socioeconomic equality, the right to own means of production and to make market transactions for private gain are not basic liberties. These economic freedoms are justified only if they are to everyone's advantage and best promote the interests of the least well off in society.<sup>18</sup>

While I believe a philosophical approach that combines elements of liberal egalitarianism, Marxism, and black radicalism is exactly the approach that Du Bois took in works like *Black Reconstruction in America* (1935) and *Dusk of Dawn* (1940), my discussion of prison abolition will not rely primarily on liberal ideas or frameworks. Davis is a sharp critic of liberalism, and I prefer to take up her arguments largely on terms we both can accept.

Although I too have been influenced by Marxism and critical theory, in terms of method I am closer to G. A. Cohen's analytical Marxism and Habermas's critical theory than are many black radicals, including Davis. I believe it can be valuable, even indispensable, to make use of the tools of analytical philosophy and mainstream social science when critiquing existing social conditions and defending a vision of a just world.

I also believe that it is not enough to possess strong ethical convictions and moral courage, as vital as these are. Black critical theorists must also develop systematic moral arguments, not only against the status quo, but also for the radical social vision they favor. These arguments need not amount to a fully developed theory o justice. ut they should have the capacity to persuade people ho are open- minded ut perhaps not yet convinced to accept lac critical theorists' asic moral principles and not yet disposed to choose a radical solution to mutually acnoledged social pro lems.

nlie many lac critical theorists and avis hersel, philosophie at some remove rom po liti cal activism and social movements. try to learn and accept criticism rom any credi le source o potential noledge and isdom, including rom activists and movement leaders. is oo is not, hoever, a commentary on the activities o the aolitionist movement. t is a oo aout ideas. or do rite in the role o a scholaractivist in an existing po liti cal strug gle. ndeed, it ould not e entirely unair to descrie me as part o the academic industrial complex that many lac radicals ostensily oppose.

Hoever, those ho insist on a tighter connection eteen theory and practice (or eteen vision and praxis, to use the movement's idiom) may still nd value in thining these challenging uestions through ith me. hope to pre sent arguments they have yet to entertain or ully consider, arguments that may mae a dierence to their condence in aolition or their septicism toard it. o oo is or everyone. *e Idea of Prison Abolition* is primarily or those still considering hether to insist that the practice o imprisonment can and should e improved or commit to ghting or aolition. t is a oo premised on the notion that philosophical reection can help us decide hether to join, champion, aandon, or oppose a cause. hilosophy has proven its value hen it comes to thining through the vari ous dimensions o causes lie animal rights, environmental justice, socialism, reproductive rights, reparations or slavery, multiculturalism, and ending gloal poverty. e cause o prison aolition is just as suitale a suject or philosophical engagement.

here is an additional value to this ind o critical interchange across philosophical and po liti cal traditions apart rom ho it ears on prison aolition. avor pluralism hen it comes to philosophical method. thin di er ent approaches phenomenology, critical theory, conceptual analy sis, pragmatism, genealogy, reective euilirium, and so on— ofen yield complementary insights. nd this oo is an aempt at philosophical engagement across the continental- analytic divide— "ro- analytical Marxism," as call it.

t is also valuale, though unortunately too rare, to have open deate among those oring in di er ent politi cal traditions o ro- modern po liti cal thought. n recent years, one can't help ut notice a general reluctance among lac progressives and radicals to openly disagree ith each other in print. o e sure, lac conservatives and lac "neolierals" are relentlessly aaced, moced, and dismissed. nd those ho try to "reduce" race to class are sometimes openly challenged. ut deate ithin the roader lac lef is generally more muted, indirect, and in reuent; and hen it does occur, it is ofen eighted don ith ad hominem aacs or ueled y personal rivalry.

Yet e ill mae more pro gress in our thining y directly testing our ideas ith those ho are not already inclined to accept them ut ho might e open to reconsidering their vies. t is also good demo cratic practice, a ay to maintain a healthy sense o our on alliility and to pregure the ind o social relations e hope to ring aout. ndeed, lac critical theory is already an amalgam o sometimes contending traditions, an approach orged through constructive deate and the exchange o ideas dran rom di erent philosophical rameors. nd am convinced, and hope to persuade readers, that lac critical theory, hile virant and essential, needs to change in some ays i it is to realie its ull transormative potential.

Lastly, there is, e must admit, a general reticence to openly disagree ith our heroes. ngela avis is an iconic, revered, and courageous gure on the lef and in the lac po liti cal tradition. Her or is thus seldom sujected to close critical scrutiny y those ho are inspired y or admire her. ut criticism, hen honest and constructive, is not an insult. Hagiography is not the only ay to honor our most cherished reedom ghters. On the contrary, it is out o re spect or avis's ritings that eel it necessary to engage ith her ideas. oo ofen, avis is treated as a mere symol o lac radicalism and militancy, lie a raised st or an ro, as she hersel laments. s one o our most original and inuential phi los o phers, she deserves the same ind o critical ut respectul engagement that distinguished male or hite phi los o phers regularly receive.

#### eorm or olition or reasons ill explain, prison aolition philosophy is utopian in ays that are oth good and ad. Yet its utopianism is not my primary reason or not ully accepting prison aolition. or do my disagreements ith this philosophy depend on rejecting socialism, much less deending capitalism. ather, continue to elieve that incarceration has legitimate and socially necessary uses, including as punishment, and so prisons are not inherently unjust. Moreover, thin that the use o incarceration, under the right circumstances and in conjunction with other less harmful practices, can be worth its attendant risks and costs. I also believe that abolitionists' most compelling criticisms are properly directed, not at incarceration as such, but at background structural injustices in society, correctable failures of due process and prison administration, inhumane prison conditions, and inadequate public efforts to enable former prisoners to rejoin society on equal terms.

In saying that incarceration has legitimate uses, I am *not* defending U. S. federal, state, or municipal prison systems. These facilities are often grossly unjust and inhumane. They also contain many who have been confined for far too long, and many who should never have been imprisoned at all. Indeed, elsewhere I have questioned the legitimacy of the American criminal justice system. Though I am not convinced that prisons are obsolete or approaching obsolescence, I strongly oppose U. S. mass incarceration, with its unprecedented and unrivaled rates of imprisonment and its highly punitive policies and unforgiving retributive ethos. Still, there is a meaningful and important difference between, on the one hand, demanding such things as more humane prison conditions, less harsh prison sentences, and fewer prisoners and, on the other, insisting that there should be no prisons.

Some critics of prison reform write as if reformers seek merely to improve the criminal justice system but are not interested in or, in any case, are not committed to changing the basic structure of society. <sup>24</sup> Some abolitionists also charge reformers with viewing criminal law and law enforcement as the sole tools of crime control and harm prevention. I would not associate myself with either conception of reform. Not only must systemic injustice in the broader society be meaningfully addressed, but prison reorm ill not e successul ithout such redress. nd crime can, and should, e controlled and prevented through a variety o means. risons are just one tool and est used, i at all, as a last resort.

oth reormers and aolitionists see social change, sometimes the same changes (or example, greater protections or the lives, ell- eing, and health o prisoners). ndeed, some aolitionists are committed to hat are sometimes called "non- reormist reorms"— that is, reorms that improve the lives and saety o prisoners ut that ill not strengthen, urther legitimie, or expand prison systems.e reormer, though, thins the needed changes are consistent ith preserving ey eatures o the practice o imprisonment. e aolitionist, y contrast, elieves the reuisite changes reuire doing aay ith the practice o imprisonment completely or so transorming the practice that it ould no longer e accurate to call it "imprisonment."

#### CHAPTER 1

## Army of the Wronged: Political Prisoners and Black Radicalism

They daily stagger out of prison doors embittered, vengeful, hopeless, ruined. And of this army of the wronged, the proportion of Negroes is frightful. We protect and defend sensational cases where Negroes are involved. But the greater mass of arrested or accused Black folk have no defense. There is desperate need . . . to oppose this national racket of railroading to jails and chain gangs the poor, friendless and Black."

-W. E. B. DU BOIS, AS QUOTED IN IF THEY COME IN
## THE MORNING: VOICES OF RESISTANCE (1971)

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a vigorous yet besieged black radical movement emerged in the United States. This was the volatile era of Black Power, and several black radicals (many affiliated with the Black Panther Party) explicitly regarded themselves as eectively at ar ith the .. government. ese ere lef- ing revolutionaries convinced that the merican social order completely laced legitimacy and .. la thereore had no authority over them. ey also thought that their declaration o ar as reciprocated, that state ocials— rom the .. military to the to local la enorcement— ere consciously using the tactics and machinery o ar to repress this internal uprising and socialist insurgency, including hunting, capturing, incapacitating, torturing, and illing lac radicals. e prison is ut one ele ment, though a critical one, o the ar machine.

ngela avis's initial engagement ith anti- prison theory and activism gros out o this historical context o revolutionary strug gle against repressive and violent government action. us, her early radical opposition to the practice o imprisonment as mainly strategic or tactical. t as not primarily concerned ith aolishing the prison as such. Her principal aim as to ree oppressed communities, such as the inhaitants o uran gheos, rom economic exploitation and po liti cal sujugation. e idea o a po liti cal prisoner as central to this outloo, as some po litical prisoners ere vieed as a vanguard in this strug gle or emancipation. o understand the evolution o avis's aolitionist stance, loo to the circumstances o her initial po liti cal ormation, to her early eorts to ree po liti cal prisoners (including hersel), and to the ays that prisons are sometimes used or po liti cal repression and counterinsurgency.

ere is much agree ith in avis's early anti- prison standpoint, here understood as a po liti cal strategy and an analy sis o the auses o state poer. am also persuaded that the gure o the po liti cal prisoner can e a constructive lens or vieing lac oppression more generally, particularly the injustices aced y gheo deniens. o explore these ideas in more depth, highlighting hat is most relevant or thining aout today's anti- prison theory and practice, let's examine some classic autoiographical ritings in the tradition o lac radicalism rom this period. George Jacson, Huey . eton, ssata haur, and avis hersel each spent signicant time in jail or prison. While incarcerated they rote aout their lives, their captivity, and their radical po liti cal vision. ey regarded themselves as po liti cal prisoners and, eectively, as prisoners oar, captured y the enemy and hoping to escape to rejoin the ght. ough each ought or their on personal reedom rom incarceration and or the reedom o other po liti cal prisoners, their stated aim as ultimately the reedom o all oppressed peoples through revolutionary strug gle.

#### lavery, olonialism, and the ight to evolt he enslavement o ricans and their descendants in the mer i cas are a literary, moral, and po liti cal touchstone or these our lac radicals. Each regards militant slave re sis tance and the radical aolitionist movement as models or their on po liti cal engagement and as inspiration in their strug gle or reedom. t is tempting, then, to regard their autoiographical, prison- related ritings as neo- slave narratives. fer all, they rely on amiliar slave- narrative conventions. or instance, they provide detailed and vivid descriptions o the horrically inhumane conditions o their captivity and the cruelty o their captors. eir rst- person narration includes harroing aempts to evade capture, ith suspenseul escapes acilitated y guile and uncommon ravery. n emotional identication ith the protagonist is created through lyrical and evocative repre sen tations o the ear, sadness, and paranoia o the ugitive. ere are scenes depicting painul shacling, pulic humiliation, rutal eatings, heartreaing separation rom loved ones, and torturous physical isolation. e sympathetic reader o these ritings is moved y displays o solidarity and sel- respect among the oppressed; inspired y the sacrice and commitment o allies; and disappointed y the inevitale etrayal and coardly su mission o those ell positioned to advance the cause.

Yet, am hesitant to interpret these ors solely through the lens o that venerale tradition o lac leers. e most inuential slave narratives, such as those o rederic ouglass and Harriet Jacos, exposed and dramatied the evils o slavery ith a vie toard moral suasion. ey ere sel- conscious appeals to the sympathy, conscience, or hristian morals o poer ul hites, ith the hope that they might ithdra their support or the slave regime and join the nonviolent aolitionist movement. e autoiographical ritings o the lac radical po litical prisoners discuss are not est understood as aempts at moral suasion or peaceul protest. nd they are aimed at raising the po liti cal consciousness o the oppressed, not at appealing to the poer ul or redress. ey are their on genre o literary noniction, hich could e called "revolutionary politicalprisoner narratives" or "radical prisoner narratives," and ill treat them as such, highlighting hat is most distinctive and compelling aout this mode o riting.

evertheless, slavery and slave revolts are reuently invoed in these ritings. e aolitionist heroes here are not ouglass or Jacos ut at urner and Harriet uman, and sometimes John ron. e reerences to enslavement and slave re sis tance play our principal roles. irst, the ongoing mistreatment o lac people, in lac communities and in prison, is said to e the continuation o slavery, a ne orm o slavery, or striingly lie amiliar practices o enslavement. econd, the deance o the po liti cal prisoner or ugitive rom the la is regarded as having the same moral and po liti cal grounds as the deance o the ugitive slave. ird, the condition o enslavement—in par ticu lar, the relation eteen the slaveholder and the enslaved—is taen to justiy extralegal, even violent, re sis tance, as sel- deense and to secure emancipation. nd nally, slave reellions are treated as a model or revolutionary collective action, oth inside and outside prison alls.

n addition to slavery, colonial sujugation is reuently invoed in these radical prison narratives, and or the same reasons. lac merican oppression is ofen portrayed as ain to colonial domination, ith lacs in the nited tates descried as a suject people ith a right to sel- determination that has long een, and continues to e, rongully denied. Lie in merican gheos, a highly vis i le symol o lac degradation, is ofen descried as the "internal coloniation" o the dispossessed. e violent and despotic relation eteen the colonier and the colonied (lie the relation eteen master and slave) is taen as a justication or deance o la and or or ga nied reellion. nd revolutionary national lieration movements in rica, sia, and Latin mer i ca are models or po liti cal engagement to in lac merican in de pen dence, through violent strug gle i necessary. Here, to earlier texts in the roader lac radical tradition are hugely inluential— rant anon's *The Wretched of the Earth* () and *e Autobiography of Malcolm* 

*X* ()— and are est read alongside these lac radical prison narratives to grasp their ull import, and to see holac nationalist and revolutionary socialist ideas are comined. Let me rea don the to narrative paerns (slavery analogies and colonial parallels) to mae explicit the under lying structure o moral argument they contain.

lavery, in oth the repulican and lieral traditions, is regarded as intolerale tyranny, aject unreedom, and a state o ar against the enslaved. here are to related rongs despotism and involuntary servitude— hich are ofen comined in practice. is miserale condition, says the lac radical, has een the ate o generations o lac people in mer i ca and elsehere: involuntary servitude under despotic rule. o add insult to injury, this tyrannical and exploitative practice as justied on the grounds that lac people are an inerior race and are incapale o rational autonomy, and thereore are oed no eer treatment than permanent paternalistic sujugation. or nearly our centuries, the principal agents and eneciaries o this retched regime have een intent on maintaining hite supremacy at the expense o peoples o rican descent. us, the long- standing plight o lac people in the nited tates and in the mer i cas more roadly has een involuntary servitude under despotic hite rule.

n *Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson* (), George Jacson rites to his ather, " no you have never een ree. no that e lacs over here have ever een ree. e orms o slavery merely *changed* at the signing o the Emancipation roclamation rom chael slavery to economic slavery." n a leer to his mother, Jacson continues on this theme y insisting that lac people continue to e "slaves" and inheritors o a "neoslave existence."t the same time, he speas o lac mericans as eing in a "colonial situation," as mem ers o a "lac colony," and as orcily socialied and educated ithin an " enemy culture."

Jacson explic itly rejected Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent re sis tance on the grounds that lac people's oppressors have no ello eeling or sense o justice toard their suordinates, are maniestly hypocritical in their stated commitment to "lierty" and "euality," and ill not yield ithout the use o orce. o urther estalish the legitimacy o this point o vie, he dras aention to the act that eighteenth- century hite colonial selers in orth mer i ca reused to sumit to the ar itrary ill o the En glish monarchy, pulicly declared their in de pen dence, and, hen threatened ith violent reprisals, ought a ar to secure their reedom and po liti cal autonomy. lac mericans, though suject to much orse orms o tyranny and servitude, are consistently denied sel- determination, and are roadly condemned or even retaliated against hen they ght ac or reuse to sumit.

n *Revolutionary Suicide* (), Huey eton highlights the similarities eteen enslavement and imprisonment. He descries prison laor as uncompensated involuntary servitude. He notes the lac o reedom o movement, the asolute poer o prison authorities, the constant surveillance, and the general atmosphere o ear and suspicion. He tells us, "i inmates develop meaningul and revolutionary riendships among themselves, these ties are roen y institutional transer, just as the slavemaster roe up amilies." He also laments the act that lac children are not taught that their ancestors participated in slave reellions.

We see a similar paern in ssata haur's radical prison narrative. haur as convicted o murdering a e Jersey state trooper ut later escaped rom prison and ed to ua, here she reportedly remains, having een granted po liti cal asylum. n *Assata: An Autobiography* (), she explains that she came to reject her "slave name" o "Jonne eorah hesimard" in avor o "ssata," hich means "she ho strug gles." he too invoes slavery and slave revolts, including a nod to her hero Harriet uman, ho also renamed hersel. ut more ofen haur uses an anti- colonial rameor to characterie her revolutionary activity: "[e lac anther] arty supported revolutionary strug gles and governments all over the orld and insisted the u.s. get out o rica, out o sia, out o Latin mer i ca, and out o the gheo too."n line ith this raming, she considers hersel a memer o the "lac Lieration rmy," hose purpose is to deliver national lieration or a colonially suordinated people "y any means necessary." e moral ground or this stance is not only opposition to racism and capitalism ut also a elie that lac sel- determination is a "asic right."

ese imprisoned radicals insist on the right to revolution in response to unyielding tyranny and exploitation. ometimes the apt comparison is to the merican evolutionary War, particularly hen the colonial sujugation analogy is eing invoed. t other times, the relevant comparison is to the .. ivil War, hich as aged, in part, over slavery. n oth cases, the rhetorical point o the comparison is to highlight the act that the lac lieration strug gle, even hen revolutionary in its aims, is not morally out o step ith merican po liti cal culture ut is in act a logical extension o it, though, crucially, in an antiracist and anti- imperialist register.

#### La Enorcement as a Weapon o War n her oreord to haur's *Assata*, ngela avis explains: "When ichard ixon raised the slogan o 'la and order' in the s, it as used in part to discredit the lac lieration movement and to justiy the deployment o the police, courts, and prisons against ey gures in this and other radical movements o that era." close reading o these lac radical narratives reveals a shared outloo on the nature and unction o la en orcement in the nited tates. La- enorcement agencies hat avis calls the "police- court- prison apparatus"— are vieed as or ga nied vio lence that unctions to repress or thart political reellion. We are not taling aout mere ordinary ailures o due pro cess, say, ecause o incompetence or ias. ese are coordinated eorts to maintain a system o domination and exploitation in response to militant dissent and active opposition.

e police are the rst line o deense and the pulic ace o state vio lence against reellious oppressed populations. n an inuential anthology o prison ritings, *If ey Come in the Morning: Voices of Resistance* (), edited yngelaavis, avis says: "rom irmingham to Harlem to Was, lac gheos are occupied, patrolled, and ofen aaced y massive deployments o police. e police, domestic caretaers o vio lence, are the oppressor's emissaries, charged ith the tas o containing us ithin the ound aries o our oppression." When the police are vis i le in lac communities, they are generally perceived to e present, not to protect and serve the community, ut rather, as haur remars, to unction as "nothing ut a oreign, occupying army, eating, torturing, and murdering people at him and ithout restraint." e lac anthers initially garnered the re spect and trust o those in lac communities ecause they monitored the police during trac stops to deter la- enorcement ocers rom engaging in illegal searches, harassment, and unarranted vio lence. ey ould not only carry legal rearms ut criminal la oos, hich they ould read rom aloud to mae onlooers and the police themselves aare o ho constitutional rights to due pro cess ere eing violated.

eton rings the point home vividly y narrating the police encounter that led to him eing shot and then imprisoned or almost three years. n the early morning hours, he and a riend, Gene Mc Kinney, ere driving around in search o some "righ teous soul ood" afer a night o partying and socialiing ith amily and riends. eton noticed the red light o a police car ehind them and pulled over. When the ocer got to their car in do, he immediately made it clear that he ne ho eton as. hortly thereafer, another police car arrived. eton as ordered to get out o the car, and hen he did, he too his la oo ith him, as as his practice. He as physically searched in a ay that eton elt as degrading, and aferards he protested that the ocer had no grounds to arrest him and proceeded to read rom the relevant part o his la oo. e ocer responded, "You can tae that oo and shove it up your ass, nigger," and then struc eton ith a "solid straight- arm," nocing him to the ground. s eton rose, the ocer pulled out his gun and shot eton in the stomach. eton heard a e more shots and then laced out. He later learned that an ocer, John rey, as illed during the encounter and that he as charged ith rey's murder. (eton as ound guilty o voluntary manslaughter in , ut the conviction as overturned on appeal in .)

lthough police are the most eared and despised, lac radicals do not trust the courts either. rosecutors see convictions on aricated or imsy evidence and use the threat o long sentences to extract unair plea argains. Judges deny ail or set it at unreachale heights. ey also run trials in ays that avor the state's case; and they impose excessive penalties upon conviction. Juries, hen properly composed o peers, can sometimes e sympathetic. ut more ofen they are overhelmingly (i not exclusively) hite, strongly iased against lac deendants, or manipulated y clever and unscrupulous prosecutors. t as the reasonale ear that a lac radical could not get a air trial in the nited tates that led ngela avis to ee hen charged ith murder, idnapping, and conspiracy.

elying exclusively on avis's account, as presented in *Angela Davis: An Autobiography* (), the asic acground to her amous case is this. George Jacson as one o three "oledad rothers" eing held in oledad orrectional a cil i ty in aliornia on the charge that they illed a prison guard. avis as a memer o the oledad rothers eense ommiee, a group o activists ighting to ree the oledad rothers on grounds that they ere po liti cal prisoners and innocent o the charges against them. Jonathan Jacson and George Jacson ere rothers and, due to her or to ree po liti cal prisoners, avis ecame close riends and comrades ith them. n hat avis calls a "court house revolt," Jonathan (at seventeen) entered the Marin ounty ourt house during an ongoing trial, armed ith a carine. He, together ith three other an Quentin prisoners pre sent in the courtroom, too several court ocials and jurors hostage. Jonathan as shot to death y prison guards as they aempted to leave the scene. judge as also illed and a prosecutor ounded in this encounter. lthough avis as not pre sent, her . automatic handgun as used during the courthouse revolt. ourt ocials contended that Jonathan had taen this drastic action as part o a plan to argain or the reedom o his rother George and that avis, ecause o her passionate love or George, had conspired in the eort.

When avis learned that the state sought her arrest, she immediately ent into hiding, ut de cided not to leave the country. elying on disguises, assisted y trusted riends and comrades, and moving around under the cover o night, she ed rom Los ngeles, to Las Vegas, to hicago, to etroit, to e Yor ity, and to Miami to evade capture. uring this time as a ugitive, the put her on its "Most Wanted" list. he as ultimately discovered and arrested in a motel in e Yor. he as then temporarily incarcerated at the Women's House o etention in e Yor, here avis and eina ptheer egan oring together to produce the anthology that ould ecome *If ey Come in the Morning*, hich as explic itly conceived as "an organ iing eapon." avis as later extradited, ith the help o the .. military, to aliornia to stand trial.

ough avis ould eventually e granted ail, she did not ee again. is is somehat surprising. Just prior to her release on ond, George Jacson had een illed y an Quentin prison guards under suspicious circumstances. avis elieved that Jacson had een murdered ecause o his po liti cal elies and ecause o his radicaliing inuence on other prisoners. "George as," as she says, "a symol o the ill o all o us ehind ars, and o that strength hich oppressed people alays seem to e ale to pull together." With his death at the hands o state ocials, avis had to orry that she could e next. Moreover, she had no real aith in the airness o the judicial system, and no lac jurors participated in deciding her guilt or innocence (the one lac person in the jury pool as preemptively challenged y the prosecution). t is true that, during her connement, the aliornia upreme ourt aolished the death penalty, and so she as no longer charged ith a capital crime (hich, as it happens, is the reason she ecame eligile or ail). ut lie Jacson, she too could e illed in prison or isolated or years in solitary connement. (aliornia voters reinstated the death penalty in .)

e reasons that avis thought she could in in court and the reasons or hy she too the ris o ghting her case are revealing. e courtroom is itsel a aleground on hich radicals and the state age ar against one another. Yes, sometimes rute orce is used, as in the tragic case o Jonathan Jacson or the police shooting o Huey eton. ut ofen the la itsel can e deployed tactically— or repression, or or lieration. n the preace to *If ey Come in the Morning*, avis and ptheer say: "e courtroom victories thus ar are the result o uncompromising and relentless re sis tance: one hich succeeded in altering the po liti cal consciousness o the jurors in par tic u lar, and the communities in general; one hich po liti cally, or gan i ation ally and legally at every point and opportunity, sought to counter the calculated assault o the government."

e ey to success in court as to help jurors see the merit o the larger po liti cal cause and to expose pulicly ho the state as using any means at its disposal, legal or illegal, to repress the movement y incapacitating its most vital and eective leaders. avis explic itly sought layers ho ould see her case as "po liti cal" and ould understand that "the courtroom ale ould e interoven ith a ale conducted y a mass movement." he and her layers intentionally avoided moving avis's case to ederal court and instead successully petitioned to have her case moved to aliornia state court. e main reason as that, in ederal court, the judge uestions and pics the jurors, ut in state court the deense ould participate in voir dire, alloing them to eed out racist and anti- communist jurors and to impanel mostly oring- class people. avis also successully petitioned to e co- counsel in her case, and she delivered the opening statement, in hich she explained to the jury "ho [her] activities around the deense o the oledad rothers ere part o a history o involvement in the movement to deend and ree po liti cal prisoners such as Huey eton, the e Yor anther , oy eale and Erica Huggins, the Los ngeles anther and the seven other rothers rom oledad rison also charged ith illing a guard." avis as ultimately acuied on all counts o the indictment.

High- prole court cases that sought to ree po liti cal prisoners ere also good or the movement itsel. ere ere huge rallies, around the gloe, calling or the release o Huey eton and ngela avis. hese assemlies ere opportunities to ring more people into the movement, to engage in po liti cal education, to enhance pulic aareness o the maleasance and malice o the "police- court- prison apparatus," and to raise money or ail and layers or po liti cal prisoners. When a case as on, the victory galvanied the movement y providing evidence that the re sis tance o ordinary people could mae a dierence. or those incarcerated lac radicals, this open pulic agitation could also lif their spirits, giving them much needed hope. emaring on the day o her initial capture, and acing the death penalty, avis says, "Yet, at that moment, as eeling eer than had elt in a long time. e strug gle ould e di cult, ut there as already a hint o victory. n the heavy silence o the jail, discovered that i concentrated hard enough, could hear echoes o slogans eing chanted on the other side o the alls. ' ree ngela avis.' ' ree ll o liti cal risoners.' "

#### o liti cal risoners and risoners o War o hat, then, maes a person a "po liti cal prisoner" George Jacson, universally regarded as a po liti cal prisoner among lac radicals, analyed to di er ent types o mindset. ere is the ordinary "criminal mentality," hich Jacson exhiited as a child hen, ithout po liti cal intent, he engaged in many unlaul acts, including roery and hijacing, ecause he simply couldn't accommodate himsel to social rules that he regarded as oppressive: "ll my lie 've done exactly hat anted to do just hen anted, no more, perhaps less sometimes, ut never any more, hich explains hy had to e jailed." n prison at eigh teen years old, and ith a lie sentence, he read the classics o Marxist theory and guerrilla arare, hich he says "redeemed" him, and he ecame riends ith and learned rom other prison radicals. ehind ars, Jacson underent a po liti cal transormation, rom someone ith a "criminal mentality" to someone ith a "revolutionary mentality." He too it as his mission to educate ello prisoners and to or ga nie them into an "implacale army o lieration." n response, prison authorities ored to isolate him and to limit his inuence on other prisoners.

n an essay composed hile she as eing held at Marin ounty Jail (included in *If ey Come in the Morning*), avis argues that a po liti cal prisoner is an incarcerated person ho has roen a la that directly or indirectly oppresses a group, and reas that la, not or selsh reasons, ut in order to ensure the ell- eing or lieration o the oppressed group. e ordinary criminal, though perhaps oppressed, reas the la solely or personal gain. e po liti cal prisoner taes unlaul actions, at least in part, to relieve the unjust urdens o the oppressed or to change society or the eer. e po liti cal prisoner's unlaul actions must, in one ay or another, convey a protest against the existing social order, and this open re sis tance must e part o the reason they are, or remain, imprisoned.

second ind o po liti cal prisoner, on avis's vie, maes use o laul means to or ga nie and move people to resist oppression. e po liti cal actor in this case has roen an "unritten la" that prohiits challenging the status uo. alse charges are then rought against them to justiy their incarceration. undamentally, then, it is the eort to or ga nie and moilie the masses or their lieration— hether legally or illegally, and hether inside or outside prison— that gives rise to state repression. s the movement gros, "the judicial system and its extension, the penal system, conseuently ecome ey eapons in the state's ght to preserve the existing conditions o class domination, thereore racism, poverty and ar." "rime" is merely the pretext or their captivity, a ay to discredit the po liti cal prisoner. us, on this account, Martin Luther King Jr. and George Jacson, despite their disagreements over the morality and eectiveness o po liti cal vio lence, ere oth po liti cal prisoners.

n eton's "rison, Where s y Victory" (his contriution to *If ey Come in the Morning*), he distinguishes eteen to types o prisoners. e rst type, hich he calls "illegitimate cap i tal ist," does not deny the legitimacy o the society's las ut sees to acuire money and poer through illegal means. e second type contends that the society is deeply unjust and its las illegitimate. is ind o prisoner reuses to exploit and degrade others or private gain ut eels no oligation to comply ith the la. n act, this type o prisoner reuses to cooperate ith the oppressive system except insoar as such cooperation ould help hasten the system's demise. is second type o prisoner, eton maintains, is a po liti cal prisoner, hether they have acuired this radical outloo prior to or during their connement.

n *Revolutionary Suicide*, eton acnoledges that, lie Jacson, he as once an ordinary criminal or, in his parlance, an "illegitimate cap i tal ist." Once he ecame a lac radical and started the lacanther arty (ith oy eale), he ored to politicie street hustlers ho operated in the under ground economy o illegal activity—in eect, to convert them rom illegitimate cap i tal ists to anti- capitalists— and some came to contriute eapons and money to the party and volunteered in the party's community ser vice programs. ough eton's earlier periods in jail ere not the occasion or his po liti cal transormation, his previous stints in prison, along ith his experience organ iing " rothers on the loc," did prepare him or his long connement as a po liti cal prisoner, during hich he sought to instill "the spirit o revolution" among the prison population.

ndeed, eton did not dra a sharp separation, either theoretically or practically, eteen lie in the gheo and lie in prison. Exploitation, connement, segregation, vio lence, and surveillance typiy oth socio- spatial sites, and the ar against the reellious e taes place on oth terrains. e gheo uprising in Was and the prison uprising at ica (oth sometimes called "riots") are in. s are police in lac communities and guards in prisons.

is position is echoed y haur, ho laments to a ello prisoner at Middlesex ounty Jail that "the only dierence eteen here [prison] and the streets is that one is maximum security and the other is minimum security. e police patrol our communities just lie the guards patrol here. don't have the aintest idea ho it eels to e ree." ut out o these same oppressed communities come "lac revolutionaries," ho are created in part y harsh gheo conditions, ut also in prisons "lie aica, san uentin, edord hills, leavenorth, and sing sing." haur insists that prisons are used as eapons in a "genocidal ar against lac and ird World people." is is hy a lac Lieration rmy is necessary, or oth sel deense and emancipation.

Expanding the conception o "prison" to include the gheo, as these radical prison narratives suggest, opens up a theoretical possiility that ears on ho e should thin aout the relationship eteen la (including its enorcement and deance) and ar. gheos are, in the relevant re spects, also prisons, then this might e reason to expand the concept o "po liti cal prisoner" to include gheo deniens ho regard the sociopoliti cal order as oppressive and conseuently reuse to cooperate ith its las and norms. ey have either engaged in unlaul re sis tance (or example, participating in the under ground economy) or violated the "unrien la" that prohiits even laul re sis tance. is ind o po liti cal prisoner is a denien o the gheo ho, ecause o unjust economic disadvantage or racial discrimination, lacs the reedom to move rom a gheo to a neighorhood here they could enjoy all the advantages o eual citienship, including reedom rom impoverishment, racism, and police harassment. ot only ould the policecourt- prison apparatus then e properly understood as a eapon o ar, ut those relegated to prison *as an institutional site of punitive incarceration* (or example, an Quentin) ould e prisoners o ar. ey ould e comatants ho have een captured during an ongoing civil conict.

One pos si le pro lem ith this po liti cal analy sis is that lac deniens o the gheo during the lac oer era ere not con ned to the gheo ecause they openly strug gled against the status uo. Yes, there ere those, lie haur, ho out o solidarity reused to leave lac communities: " ant to help ree the gheo, not run aay rom it, leaving my people ehind." Yet the vast majority ere stuc in these deeply disadvantaged and segregated communities ecause they ere *black*, not ecause they had a "revolutionary mentality"; and they could not exit these neighorhoods even i they accommodated themselves to the injustices o the system and didn't ght ac. us, in one crucial re spect, gheo deniens are not lie the po liti cal prisoners depicted in these lac radical narratives.

Hoever, some residents o gheos, then and no, are de ant in the relevant re spects, and this re sis tance is sometimes the cause o their gheo connement. ose ho reuse to participate in the licit economy on the grounds that to do so ould e degrading or exploitative ofen have great diculty raising su cient unds to move to eer neighorhoods, particularly i they astain rom preying on other disadvantaged memers o their community (or example, not roing them or selling them harmul narcotics). eir unillingness to accept hatever jos are availale is "punished" ith an impoverished and segregated existence. ome o these reellious residents ill have criminal or arrest rec ords, maing it challenging or them to nd jos or decent housing. am thereore inclined to endorse an additional sucategory o po liti cal prisoners to include them. is ould ring ne meaning to the slogan " ree ll o liti cal risoners," as it ould reuire aolishing the gheo as a socio- spatial site o oppression.

#### lac adicalism and the trug gle to "olish" risons s ill discuss in the chapters to come, avis develops her aolitionist philosophy over time to include the claims that prisons are inherently dehumaniing and exploitative and that they ould e unnecessary in a just society and peaceul orld. ut her early opposition to prisons is ased on her contention, shared y many lac radical thiners, that prisons represent ormidale ostacles to mass moiliation to trans orm society. he argues that prisons are instruments oar and po liti cal repression. hough prisons are sometimes used to punish "ordinary criminals," they are ofen used to maintain an unjust status uo and to put don any signicant po liti cal resis tance. is is a critical point that avis and other lac radicals hope to communicate through their prison- related ritings, and this critical analy sis should e seriously considered, and can e consistently emraced, even y those ho are convinced that prisons can also serve legitimate unctions. rison reormers and aolitionists can learn rom it.

us, ill close this chapter y considering ho these radical prison narratives conceive o prisons as a tactical terrain on hich po liti cal prisoners and their allies ght it out against a repressive po liti cal regime. Just as there are tactical advantages to e gained over the police and the courts, it is pos si le— through organ iing, po liti cal education, and prisoner solidarity—to consideraly eaen the poer o prisons as a eapon against the oppressed. ere is, in eect, a ay or the "army o the ronged" to partially *disarm* their adversaries, as a means o sel- deense. is ind oar maneuver could e understood as a component o a long- range plan to ultimately do aay ith prisons altogether. ut it can also e an ele ment o a prison reorm agenda.

e principal strategy here is to mae the use o prisons or po liti cal repression sel-deeating. ere's an inside game and an outside game. With re spect to the internal lie o prisons, the lac radical movement sets out to demonstrate that repression through incarceration ill not deter their militant politi cal activity. or is it an eective means o incapacitating incarcerated po liti cal reels. art o the reason prisons ail to deter gheo deniens rom lareaing is that they are already living in a "minimum security prison," and so may eel they have lile to lose y eing deant. s Jacson says, "lacmen orn in the .. and ortunate enough to live past the age o eigh teen are conditioned to accept the inevitaility o prison. or most o us, it simply looms as the next phase in a seuence o humiliations." ut the principal means o shoing that prisons on't deter re sis tance is y continuing and even expanding po liti cal agitation, organ iation, and education inside prisons. ough captured and caged, the dissident ill not sumit or lay don arms, even i this means a longer prison stay and greater suering hile incarcerated. o liti cal prisoners insist that they are not in need o "rehailitation," as there is nothing rong ith them. t is a roen social system that needs to e xed, or perhaps replaced.

s already discussed, po liti cal prisoners see to turn ordinary criminals into po liti cal prisoners. fer their consciousness has een raised, radicalied prisoners may e urged to disoey prison rules or prison guards' commands. hey may, or instance, reuse to sumit to strip searches, ashion maeshit eapons, or go on hunger stries. nother tactic is to rerain rom routine prison laor, such as preparing ood, cleaning, and doing laundry. risoner stries are all the more meaningul, rom a po liti cal point o vie, hen they include reusing to provide goods and ser vices or the enet o private rms or others outside the prison. is conscious ithdraal o laor not only disrupts the order o prisons ut also expresses a roader po litical message aout laor exploitation in society. haur advances this position hen she tells the story o a prison guard conronting her ith "a ig ushel o stringeans":

" Here, e ant you to snap these stringeans." "Ho much are you gonna pay me" i ased. "We don't pay no inmate nothin', ut i you snap these eans e'll let your door stay open hile you snap them." " don't or or nothing. ain't gonna e no slave or noody."

eton as similarly deant hile in prison, vieing his re sis tance as a ay o instilling or strengthening a spirit o revolution among his ello prisoners: " loo orard to the time hen all inmates ill oer greater re sis tance y reusing to or as did. uch a simple move ould ring the machinery o the penal system to a halt." n eect, this ind o in- prison re sis tance turns the socio- spatial conditions o the prison into a radicaliing orce, an incuator o militants; and ecause the vast majority o prisoners are at some point released, this revolutionary spirit spreads to the streets. e ormerly incarcerated ring hat they've learned in prison to amily, riends, and associates, urther developing the social movement.

When there is suicient shared po liti cal consciousness, sense o purpose, and solidarity among prisoners in a par tic u lar a cil i ty, a prison uprising may e or ga nied ith a vie, not just to improving prison conditions, ut to advancing a po liti cal cause. or instance, the prisoner reellion at ica orrectional a cil i ty in e Yor egan to ees afer the illing o George Jacson at an Quentin. n avis's reections on the meaning o the ica "revolt," she argues that it aaened and enlivened the po liti cal passions o the people, or it exposed the murderous intent o state actors. he also says that "the revolt as particularly ediying in that it urst orth as i to demonstrate that the rutal illing o George Jacson ell dismally short o its repressive aim."

With re spect to the outside game, the aim o imprisoned lac radicals is to encourage and strengthen solidarity eteen the dispossessed ho aren't incarcerated and those ho are loced up, particularly po liti cal prisoners. is is achieved, in part, y destigmatiing criminal oending, imprisonment, and elony convictions. eing susceptile or driven to crime and therey vulnerale to eing incarcerated is a component o lac people's sujugation, not merely a result o ad character or poor upringing as racist ideology ould lead some to elieve. ut ostering such solidarity is also accomplished y ma ing a compelling case that po liti cal prisoners do not deserve to e in prison and thus that "retriution" is not arranted. e state ants the pulic to elieve that these ould-e revolutionaries are common criminals to e eared and loathed. is attempt to delegitimie their po liti cal strug gle must e countered or else the state ill e ree to destroy them ith impunity.

oor and oring- class lac people ho have een involuntarily segregated in ghettos have had many negative, and sometimes violent, experiences ith la enorcement, and they no that many ho end up in prison ere deeply disadvantaged eore their convictions and oten committed their crimes ecause o limited opportunities and out o economic desperation. hey are not inclined to see the police- courtprison apparatus as riendly to the interests o the oppressed. s avis argues, ecause o the experience o lac people in gheos, "an almost instinctive anity inds the mass o lac people to the po liti cal prisoners."

What ordinary lac ol typically lac, though, is a theoretical rameor that helps them understand their situation. ey also lac a easile strategy or deeating their oppressors or or lifing the eight o their oppression. is the po liti cal prisoner tries to provide through revolutionary theory and practice. ut, in addition, po liti cal prisoners sho, through their open agitation and illingness to ris eing "punished," that they are actively oring to transorm the social order and are prepared to sacrice all to achieve this end. ey represent a threat to the system, hich is hy they must e silenced and made an example o. Their obvious "skin in the game" makes it easier for oppressed people to trust and side with them. Because these political prisoners are viewed as providing vital leadership and are regarded as heroic figures, black people are invested in and willing to contribute to the struggle to free them.

Predictably, prison officials will attempt to neutralize the most influential political prisoners by relocating them to solitary confinement (the prison within the prison). The point of this action, black radicals argue, is to sharply curtail their influence on other prisoners. By making it challenging to communicate with other prisoners, prison officials impede political prisoners' ability to coordinate collective action and to provide political education. Sometimes the use of solitary confinement for political prisoners will backfire, causing other prisoners to protest and spurring unrest in the facility. If this response is intense and enduring, it may be sufficient to get the political prisoner released back into the general prison population. But even if not, it may spread or deepen the spirit of resistance among prisoners, perhaps giving birth to new leaders among them. Solitary confinement can also hurt a radical movement's cause outside prison walls. This is where publishing books like *Soledad Brother* and *If* They Come in the Morning becomes crucial. Political prisoners in isolation are then able to get their revolutionary vision to the people, who may rally to their defense.

Given their primary intended audience—oppressed people of color—the fact that radical prison narratives are first-person accounts of experiences with law enforcement is not incidental. These testimonials often resonate more powerfully than a theoretical treatise or political pamphlet would. To serve their purposes, they reuire, i not a charismatic person at their center, at least an au then tic and credile voice. e sel- sacrice and resolve in ghting or the oppressed must e readily apparent. e autoiographical acground ofen helps to estalish this. t also enales the riter to e a lieale protagonist in a dramatic story ith heroes and villains, tragedies and triumphs. s a result, it is harder to paint the po liti cal prisoner as a monster, someone to e illed or permanently incapacitated. Moreover, the moral lessons that such ors see to impart are ofen more eectively communicated to a road audience through moral exemplars than through astract princi ples. n all these re spects and others, lac radical narratives are similar in orm to traditional slave narratives.

Yet, the dierences are orth emphasiing. lthough oth genres are po liti cal autoiographies, slave narratives are exercises in moral persuasion, hile lac radical narratives aim at omenting revolution. e primary audience is also di er ent. lave narratives ere aimed at poer ul hites, hile lac radical narratives are targeted at the oppressed. ey oth advance a po liti cal ethics— nonviolent re sis tance versus an ethic o revolt. e ugitive slave and the po liti cal prisoner oth rea the la to advance the cause o reedom.

## The Uses and Abuses of Incarceration: Punishment, Dehumanization, and Slavery

Black radical anti-prison theory has deep roots, initially arising out of concerted efforts to free political prisoners, resist political repression, and defend against the increasingly warlike machinery of law enforcement. Today's critiques of prisons have grown more complex, encompassing a wider range of objections to the practice. Consider Angela Davis. Since her incarceration at Marin County Jail and her ultimate acquittal, the philosopher and scholar-activist's opposition to prisons has been less about open revolutionary conflict with the state, and more focused on a critique of the practice of imprisonment and the social conditions that (appear to) make this practice necessary. This book, in essence, grew out of my examination of these and other abolitionist criticisms.

Let's begin with two of Davis's most influential objections to the prison system. These objections make clear why the term

## 45

"abolition"—given its nod to celebrated attempts to end the dehumanizing practice of slavery—is regarded as the appropriate language to demand an end to the use of prisons. Davis maintains that imprisonment is a dehumanizing practice, a form of treatment that no human being, regardless of their behavior or attitudes, should be subjected to. She also argues that prisons, in the United States at least, are linked to the practice of slavery in ways that make imprisonment deeply objectionable, and particularly intolerable for African Americans. There is merit and insight in each of these objections. So let's consider their strengths and weaknesses and whether they provide sufficient grounds to reject a prison-reform framework or to end the practice of imprisonment. But before turning to that examination, we need greater clarity about our principal subject—prison.

#### What Is a Prison?

In 1946, Malcolm X was imprisoned at the Charlestown State Prison in Massachusetts. Describing his experience there in his famous autobiography, he noted how his official prison number came to displace his name and truncated his identity, and that this was a common and degrading experience for prisoners adapting to institutional life. He also said that the bars of his cell made an indelible mark on his mind, making him feel like he was in a cage, and that cell bars were an impediment to any kind of rehabilitation. Prisoners readily purchased illegal drugs and other contraband from unscrupulous guards, and they were forced to make license plates for the state as part of their work assignments. Malcolm remarked: "The cells didn't have running ater. e prison had een uilt in —in apoleon's day and as even styled afer the astille. n the dirty, cramped cell, could lie on my cot and touch oth alls. e toilet as a covered pail; don't care ho strong you are, you can't stand having to smell a hole cell ro o deecation." ( fer the in amous "herry Hill" prison riot, the a cil i ty as permanently closed in .)

n , afer a rie stint at oncord rison, Malcolm (ith the help o his sister Ella ollins) as transerred to orol rison, hich as non or its ocus on rehailitation. ompared to harleston or oncord, Malcolm regarded orol as "a heaven": "t had ushing toilets; there ere no ars, only alls— and ithin the alls, you had ar more reedom." He also noted that each prisoner had their on room, had access to a large lirary, and as permied visitors every day; and that proessors rom Harvard and other area colleges participated in the prison's educational programs.

When aced ith descriptions o prisons lie harleston or having een imprisoned in such repulsive places, many aolitionists have no dout een inspired to dismantle the prison system. ut hile reormers too are inspired y such descriptions and experiences, they are moved to improve the practice rather than end it. ecause prison conditions vary and some prisons are eer than others, to decide hether to e a re ormer or an aolitionist, it is necessary to nohat a "prison" is and not just hat some prisons are lie. We need to identiy hich eatures o prisons are necessary characteristics (the elements that mae a prison a prison), and hich eatures are merely contingent and thus can e discarded or altered ithout dismantling the prison system entirely. on't pretend that there is some ideologically neutral conception o a prison. or do aim to provide a conception o the "ideal" prison. ut hope to oer a conception that reormers and aolitionists can accept, so that the disagreement turns, not on contentious or uestion- egging denitions, ut on hether the amiliar practice o imprisonment is one that, on moral or po liti cal grounds, should e aandoned.

o incarcerate is to suject a person to institutional connement. mprisonment, and thus "prison," is a type o incarceration. ncarceration, roadly conceived, has at least ve ele ments. t entails *involuntary connement*— restriction to a limited space ith no right to leave ithout permission rom authorities. is socio- spatial site o coninement is an *enclosed space* ith a physically secure perimeter— alls, ences, locs, and guards to prevent escape and unauthoried entry. ncarceration is not just a uilding ith people loced inside. t is a *hierarchical institutional practice* dened y a set o rules, roles, and goals. ese rules and roles vary ith the overall justicatory aims o the institution (and sometimes ith the covert purposes o its ocials). ersons conned to carceral spaces are *isolated om the general public*— separated rom others in the outside orld (and sometimes rom one another) and ith highly restricted (i any) rights to visitation and to communicate ith those outside (and sometimes ithin) the a cil i ty.

mportantly, these conned persons are in the *custody* o carceral authorities. ustody is a orm o guardianship, hich includes providing shelter, asic necessities, physical care, and protection rom harm (including sel- harm). the incarcerated person is a non danger to others or to themselves, then they must sometimes e deprived o items that could inict grave odily harm. roviding adeuate care and protection ill sometimes reuire surveillance, searches, the enorcement o rules o order, or periods o connement in a cell.

ncarceration, so understood, can e used or a variety o purposes. ome o these purposes are legitimate: or instance, incarceration can e used to uarantine those ith highly in ectious and deadly diseases or to hold enemy comatants in times o ar. ome uses o incarceration are clearly illegitimate: to eep a population availale or exploitation, to repress po liti cal dissent, to torture people, or to use them or medical experiments.

Even ithin the context o crime control, incarceration can have several purposes. or example, there is pretrial detention. uch detention raises several issues or the reormversus- aolition uestion. ut ill leave these aside until later (hapter ). or no, my ocus ill e incarceration hen its oicial purpose is *punishment*— a penalty or committing a crime. ndeed, avis uses the phrase "punitive incarceration" to dierentiate it rom incarceration as detention hile the prisoner aaits trial or a hearing. n this oo, leave aside the complex issue o carceral detention or unlaul immigration or order crossing and its relationship to aolition. is issue depends on resolving the challenging uestion o hether national orders should e enorced, controlled, or even exist, hich am not prepared to address here.

n incarceration a cil i ty hose primary purpose is pretrial detention is a *jail*. We can call an incarceration a cil i ty hose primary purpose is prisoner rehailitation a *penitentiary*. n incarceration a cil i ty that aims to treat and house those ho suer rom serious psychological disorders is a *psychiatric* hospital. An incarceration facility that functions to impose punishment is a *prison*. These aims—detention, rehabilitation, treatment, and punishment—can be, and often are, combined within the same facility. Davis and other abolitionists oppose jails, penitentiaries, and prisons. So, for simplicity, I will refer to all three practices as "imprisonment" or simply "prison."

According to Davis, in the pre-modern era, before the emergence of capitalism and the nation-state, punishment was almost entirely *corporal*, from beatings to execution. <sup>8</sup> It is only with the rise of the bourgeois state that we get the general practice of punishment through incarceration: "Before the acceptance of the sanctity of individual rights, imprisonment could not have been understood as punishment. If the individual was not perceived as possessing inalienable rights and liberties, then the alienation of those rights and liberties by removal from society to a space tyrannically governed by the state would not have made sense." I am not convinced that this historical claim is entirely accurate. <sup>10</sup> Regardless, if the debate between reformers and abolitionists is to be a meaningful one, this way of thinking about punishment and its relation to incarceration has limitations.

I suggest that punishment, whatever form it takes, be understood as unwelcome and unpleasant treatment. Such "hard treatment," as it is sometimes called, includes deprivation (whether of liberty, money, property, privileges, human contact, or life itself) as well as involuntary labor, public censure, humiliation, and so on. This definition is neutral between a range of justifications of punishment, including retribution and crime prevention. The hard-treatment conception of punishment is both narrower and broader than Davis's conception of punishment. t is narroer in that imprisonment as penalty need not imply that prisoners have oreited all their rights thus permiing tyrannical treatment. imprisonment entails that prisoners are rightless sujects under despotic rule, then prisons, at least in the nited tates, have already een aolished, as prisoners have many recognied rights— though not nearly all to hich they are entitled.

e conception o punishment am suggesting is roader in that the orms o penalty need not e conceived as the deprivation o rights. ontrary to hat avis suggests, a conception o individuals as rights- earers is not necessary or incarceration as punishment to mae sense. eing held in a prison and su ject to its rules ould e regarded y almost anyone as deeply unpleasant and something to e avoided and so can serve as a deterrent or as retriution regardless o hether there is pu lic recognition o individual rights. rison also separates prisoners (i only temporarily) rom their community and so unctions similarly to anishment, hich certainly existed in premodern eras. o ill operate ith this roader conception o punishment— unelcome and unpleasant treatment as penalty or a criminal oence.

ord aout *incapacitation* through incarceration. t is, un ortunately, sometimes necessary to rely on incarceration to incapacitate highly dangerous individuals. ere is a conceptual and a moral dierence eteen incarcerating persons to prevent them rom harming others (y restricting their movement to a highly limited and enclosed space) and incarcerating persons to penalie them or harmul actions they have already taen. Yet hen carceral incapacitation is imposed in response to a criminal oense, it is practically indistinguishale rom punishment. e same can e said hen carceral incapacitation o a criminal oender is comined ith rehailitation or psychiatric treatment. ese are all ays o using incarceration to respond to crime, here the hard treatment is triggered y and taes place only afer a criminal oense. e same cannot e said o carceral incapacitation hen it is used or the uarantine o those ith deadly communicale diseases, or the involuntary commitment o mentally ill patients ho have not perpetrated crimes, or or the connement o enemy comatants in ar time. ese incarcerated persons are regarded as dangerous enough to justiy conning them, ut their connement is not punishment or even ain to punishment.

t is not pos si le to sele the reorm- versus- aolition uestion ithout some engagement ith the deate over the justication o punishment as such. What, i anything, justies penaliing someone or reaing the la on't pursue this uestion in depth, as there is a vast philosophical lit er a ture on the suject, ith intricacies that don't ear directly on our uestion. ut a e remars are in order.

avis does not regard *retribution* as a sound justication or punishment. at is, she does not thin that the pulic has a right to see revenge or to retaliate against those ho rea the la. he does not elieve that those ho do rong, even serious rong, "deserve" to suer; nor does she accept that a criminal oender's misery has intrinsic value or could e in itsel justice. he denies that people should suer in proportion to the su ering they have rongully caused. e idea that ad people deserve prison is, she maintains, an ideological or sectarian notion. s such, it is unsuitale as a pulic justication or coercion or confinement in a democratic society. Retributivism is a complex doctrine, with many variants. It also has undeniable intuitive appeal to many and is consonant with widely held religious views. Nevertheless, I am largely in agreement with Davis in not accepting retributive justifications of punishment, though I will not defend this stance in the present book. Nothing I say here about "punishment" or "penalties" should be construed as endorsing retributive ideas.

Yet, while these objections pose obstacles for retributive defenses of punishment, they do not stand in the way of punishment when it is used as a method for preventing or reducing crime. Penalizing crime through incarceration is plausibly and widely viewed as an effective and fair way to prevent and control criminal wrongdoing—as a means for a society to provide a reasonable level of security for our persons, liberties, and rightful possessions. Retribution or retaliation need not be part of incarceration's aim. Unless abolitionists equate all punishment with retribution, they are best understood as claiming (among other things) that the need to prevent and control crime is an inadequate justification for the use of prisons.

I regard imprisonment as justified only if milder penalties are insufficient to control crime adequately. As with self-defense and just war measures, we should cause no more suffering than is necessary to protect people from harmful wrongdoing. Prisons should also not be used unless there are good reasons to believe they help to prevent crime (an issue I will address in Chapter 5). Prisons would indeed be obsolete—and immoral—if they are unnecessary or incapable of reducing crime.

I also agree with Davis that incarceration should not be the primary method for preventing crime. Imposing a prison sentence should not e the rst anser nor the deault response to criminal rongdoing. Less harmul alternatives should e considered and prioritied, relying on prisons as a last resort. Moreover, much crime is a symptom o under lying structural injustices that demand redress, and thus some crime could e prevented y creating more just social conditions. also agree ith avis thereore that many socie ties— and especially the nited tates— grossly *overuse* punitive incarceration. Even under more just circumstances than prevail in the nited tates, ould avor using nes and property conscation, community ser vice and other or assignments, restitution and reparation, electronic monitoring, home connement, supervised proation, and the loss o certain privileges (or example, suspension o driver's license) or most criminal oenses. ncarceration is a drastic crime-control mea sure, est reserved or the most serious oenses and or those oenders ho, even afer suering less severe penalties, continue to sho disregard or others' asic rights.

y "the most serious crimes," mean oenses that do great and irreparale harm or crimes that cause deep and lasting trauma, such as hom i cide, rape, and aggravated assault. Major hite- collar or corporate crime can sometimes cause im mense harms that can't e repaired. Misdemeanors, though sometimes punished ith short prison sentences, are not serious crimes. ot all elonies— legally prohiited actions punishale y more than a year o incarceration— count as "the most serious" on my account either. or instance, many property crimes (auto thef, urglary, and larceny) and some types o raud (creditcard raud, passing ad checs, and orgery) are considered elonies in the nited tates ut generally do not cause great and irreparale harm or lasting trauma. similar thing could e said aout some drug oenses and the illegal possession o rearms. erhaps under some circumstances, imprisonment can e justialy used to penalie these less serious oenses. ut i e nd that imprisonment is legitimately used to prevent the most serious crimes, then that ould go a long ay toard shoing that prison reorm remains an appropriate goal.

e ould deny that actions that are rong and cause harm should sometimes e penalied to reduce the incidence o such actions. nexcusale harmul rongdoing should have "conse uences," here these conseuences involve some unelcome and unpleasant treatment. Otherise, many ho commit such acts are liely to repeat them; and others, noticing that these acts have een undertaen ithout negative conseuence, ill e encouraged to engage in similar acts themselves. onsider speeding and other recless driving, hich leads to thousands o deaths and serious injuries each year in the nited tates. olitionists need not reject *all* punishments as unjustied. orld here no action incurs a penalty is not the demand. ey simply deny that incarceration is among the permissile punishments or rongdoing.

o hy prison fer all, there are less harmul penalties availale. thin the rst thing to say is that imprisonment is liely the harshest penalty a society can impose that also plausily satises human rights reuirements. ome penalties, though still used in a e places, are too harsh and inhumane, or example, maiming and death. o one should e sujected to these, even or serious rongdoing. Other penalties are too mild to deter serious crimes. ne or community ser vice is unliely to e severe enough to discourage murder or rape.

nother reason prison could sometimes e the right ind o penalty is that there is on occasion a need to protect the vulnerale rom imminent harm. mprisonment is a ay o temporarily incapacitating a dangerous individual. Other penalties prevent crime primarily y ay o deterrence, a threat hich some ill inevitaly ail to heed. Home connement comes closest to incapacitation. ut here, the perimeter o the residence is not secure, so the oender could leave the home (even i electronically monitored) and anyone could enter. uch connement provides only limited protection or those outside or inside the home. t is true, imprisonment cannot completely prevent a prisoner rom harming others (or instance, ello prisoners, prison sta, or visitors), and occasionally prisoners escape. ut the personnel, physical structure, and rules o a prison can provide greater security rom imminent aac than any viale and nonlethal alternative.

uring the period o institutional connement, a prisoner might learn to etter control their antisocial impulses or to change the haits o mind that led them to harm others. e isolation and structure o prison can e an opportunity or serious reection, a chance to reconsider ho one should live and relate to others, hich the prisoner may not have done other ise or even realied they needed to do. suitaly staed and or ga nied, prison can e a space or rehailitation, hich is itsel a ay to prevent and control crime, as most prisoners are, in time, released ac into the pulic.

Given these considerations— that is, the possi le eectiveness o carceral deterrence, incapacitation, and rehailitation—it is easy to see ho a people, concerned to protect the asic rights o its memers, might adopt the practice o imprisonment ithout eing motivated y malice, vengeance, cruelty, or greed. risons hold out the promise that harmul rongdoing can e controlled ith minimal violence and that prisoners, afer rehailitation, can eventually rejoin the community on eual terms. nlie ith the deadly harm and destruction traded eteen nations at ar, a people ould naturally e reluctant to resort to lethal orce hen dealing ith the unjust aggression o its on memers, provided a suitale alternative as availale.

ome naturally loo upon prisons in horror. o contemplate eing loced inside a prison cell or an enclosed a cil i ty is the stu o nightmares. t is not at all surprising many have come to thin that only a diaolical mind could have dreamed up such an institution. Yet, ithout denying the terriying prospect that a prison sentence represents, elieve it is understandale hy a people might use prisons to reduce crime in its midst, particularly once the penalties o exile, torture, maiming, and death have een repudiated as immoral. mprisonment may nonetheless e an ojectionale punitive practice or the reasons aolitionists cite. Let's turn no to those ojections.

#### ehumaniation, gency, and reventative orce e imprisonment o humans is ofen liened to the caging and torturing o animals. risons are thought to impose prolonged discomort and daily torment. ome aolitionists elieve that y virtue o eing incarcerated, prisoners are mared as less than ully human or are treated in ays that no human should e. ey maintain, in other ords, that imprisonment is incompatile ith asic human dignity. is position is di er ent rom claiming that dehumaniing and inhumane practices exist in many prisons, particularly merican prisons, a claim that many reormers ould strongly endorse. ot all these trouling practices are essential to punitive incarceration— or example, routine and invasive strip searches; using prisoner numers (instead o given names) hen directly addressing incarcerated persons; reuiring humiliating and stigmatiing prisoner uniorms; or discussing prisoners as i they ere suhuman or animals in need o taming. Ending these and similar practices ould not constitute aolishing prisons, only reorming them.

avis sometimes cites dehumaniing and inhumane aspects to existing prison practices that reormers are, and have long een, at pains to change. Many o these changes are clearly easile, ecause they have already een instituted in some prison systems around the orld (or instance, in prisons in oray, the etherlands, and Germany) and in some .. states. ese changes include increasing the standard sie o prison cells; limiting cells to one occupant to enale greater privacy; eliminating a cil i ty overcroding; providing proper ventilation, heating, and cooling; ensuring regular access to natu ral light and resh air; reuiring thorough screening and extensive training or prison sta; increasing sta levels to avoid reliance on gangs and routiniation to ensure order; providing high uality and essential medical care (physical and mental); maintaining sanitation and a healthy physical environment to prevent illness, the spread o disease, and pest inestation; prohiiting the shacling o prisoners hile they are in laor or giving irth; alloing persons ho have recently given irth to e housed ith their neorns to enale proper onding; acilitating reuent interaction and communication eteen prisoners; permitting regular phone calls to and visits rom amily and riends; ensuring adeuate nutrition and opportunities or exercise and recreation; providing supplies or personal hygiene; acilitating religious oservance and honoring religious reedom; maintaining a ell- stoced and ide- ranging lirary; and protecting prisoners rom prisoner and guard vio lence, including sexual assault. numer o these conditions are not met in supermaximum- security acilities, hich is hy many reormers oppose them on human rights grounds. ere is also road opposition to extended periods in solitary connement, hich is argualy a orm o torture and sometimes causes irreparale psychological harm.

Human eings are lie other animals in many ays. We share several elare interests ith them. Yet, unlie other animals, e do not act merely rom instinct, impulse, or hait. We have the capacity to consciously reect on pos si le courses o action and to successully resist the temptation to act on urges, even poer ul ones. We are also capale o delierately treating others either justly or unjustly, ith indness or cruelty. ot mere pos si le recipients o just and humane treatment, e have the capacity to accord others the re spect and treatment they are oed. o creature should e made to suer needlessly or regarded as lacing all value. ut as creatures capale o rationality and agency, o reasoned delieration and conscious choice, human eings are to e treated in a ay that honors our status as rational agents, as *persons* and not merely as animals. mprisonment, even i humane, might thereore e deemed inherently dehumaniing insoar as it ails to re spect prisoners' status as persons.

o respond to aolitionist concerns, reormers must explain ho imprisonment, despite the deprivation and suering it inevitaly imposes on prisoners, is compatile ith re spect or persons as ree and rational.ey should also mae clear that they have a realistic and nonideological conception o human agency such that it is air to sometimes impose prison as a penalty or serious crimes. nd reormers need to sho that the interests protected y using imprisonment are suiciently eighty to justiy such a severe crime-control mea sure.

Human eings should not e treated as i they ere mere ojects to e manipulated or this or that purpose, even hen the purpose is a orthy one (or example, pulic saety). o regard someone as an agent— and so to accord them the dignity they are due as a human eing—is to vie them as capale o rational delieration and choice. o re spect this agency, e should appeal to others through reasons. n the practical realm, there are *moral* and *prudential* reasons. We oer moral reasons to others hen e dra their aention to a valid moral consideration (say, that murder needlessly ends a lie o inherent and irreplaceale value), hich some may nevertheless discount or ignore. We oer prudential reasons hen e mae others aare o ho a course o action could diminish their on ell- eing or cause them harm. threat, say, a arning o a pending legal sanction, provides a prudential reason, hich the targeted person can choose hether to heed. riminal las, hen just, provide oth inds o reasons— a morally grounded prohiition and a sanction or noncompliance.

The requirement to refrain from using physical violence (except in self-defense, in defense of others from imminent attack, or in a just war) is a moral duty that almost any adult (and many children) can be expected to know they have and to comply with. Parents, teachers, and religious leaders instruct youth to conduct themselves nonviolently and to avoid needlessly harming others. The law codifies this duty when it prohibits murder, rape, robbery, and assault. With some crimes, such as a violent act that required planning, and which thus the perpetrator had time to reconsider carrying it out, we confront an especially grave wrong that warrants an appropriate, even coercive, response. It is such manifest unwillingness to respect others' right to be free from physical aggression that sometimes justifies our resorting to credible threats (negative incentives) to prevent wrongful harms.

Those greatly burdened by social injustices (and, at times, their more privileged allies) will sometimes justifiably break the law and evade law enforcement. They may do so for reasons of pressing economic need, self-defense against illegitimate state violence, or political resistance. The psychological and social pressures of oppression can make it difficult to remain within legal bounds while also maintaining one's dignity; or these pressures may compel or tempt one to break the law for completely understandable or even excusable reasons (for example, because of reasonable anger or the need for catharsis). Some of what is generally considered "crime" may be activities that no state should prohibit or punish (for instance, some drug use or sex work).

Matters are different with the kinds of serious wrongs I have in mind. The moral considerations against murder and rape, for example, provide sufficient and overriding reasons to refrain rom these egregious rongs, hich cause great and irreparale harm and severe trauma. e act that a person is oppressed can neither override these reasons nor render them inapplicale. e need to protect the vulnerale, including many ho are themselves oppressed, is hat justies penaliing these grave rongs through incarceration.

ere is o course a eighty moral proscription against su jecting others to physical orce and connement. ut this proscription is conditional. t depends on a person not acting in an unjustly aggressive ay toard others. ose ho rong others in ays that typically cause great harm cannot reasonaly oject to the unpleasant and coercive treatment their on rongul conduct has called orth, provided such treatment is necessary to prevent harm to others.

is use o hard treatment, a orm o preventative orce, is neither dehumaniing nor unair, at least not hen prisons are humane and courts operate justly. orearned y the pulic legal proscription and euipped ith the capacity or rational and ree action, oenders had an adeuate opportunity to avoid this unelcome and unpleasant treatment. ey could have re rained rom serious rongdoing ut chose not to. hey, through their on illul actions, have created a situation here others are morally permied to tae strong mea sures against them to avoid grave harm to themselves. t is this pro lem o rongul aggression, an unortunate real ity o human social relations, that generates the necessity or a proportional response to thart the threat o harm.

What am identiying are the moral permissions and constraints on geing others to do things they already have overriding reasons to do ut at times reuse to. When people reuse to listen to moral reasons, e are sometimes permied to use coercive means to alter their e hav ior, particularly hen e or others ould other ise e gravely harmed. ut their reusal to listen does not mean that the state no longer has a responsiility to re spect their rights or that they have someho surrendered their right to just and humane treatment. n protecting the vulnerale rom the unjust aggression o others, the state should honor as many o the aggressor's ordinary rights as is compatile ith securing people against harmul rongdoing.

o, some persons are not so much unilling as *incapable* o recogniing and responding appropriately to moral or prudential reasons. is could e due to youth, cognitive or emotional disorders, developmental impairment, or mental illness. e rational agency o these persons is so underdeveloped, diminished, or compromised that it ould e rong and pointless to hold them accountale or their rongul acts. ese persons reuire treatment, care, and support ut not punitive action. they must e temporarily conned and isolated to prevent harm to others or sel- harm, this should e in a mental-health a cil i ty, not a prison.

uch involuntary coninement to a psychiatric hospital, though not punishment, is *incarceration*— the institutionalied practice o orcily conning people ithin an enclosed space, segregating them rom the general pulic, claiming custodial guardianship over them, and sujecting them to institutional rules o order. e same is true o the involuntary uarantine o those ith extremely deadly communicale diseases and the connement o captured enemy comatants in a ar. nd so i these modes o incarceration are, at least sometimes, morally permissile (and thin they are), incarceration *as such* cannot be inherently dehumanizing, at least not if all dehumanization is immoral treatment and a violation of human rights.<sup>20</sup> The problem would have to be with certain uses, purposes, or functions of incarceration.

Abolitionists could object that this account of agency exaggerates humans' capacity for moral and rational action or that it fails to appreciate how the agency of the oppressed has been compromised by the structural violence of unjust institutions. They might add that prisons are filled with unjustly disadvantaged people who have themselves been victims of serious wrongs (for example, sexual assault or child abuse), sometimes the same wrongs they have committed, and that this victimization and trauma can explain their moral failures and trouble with the law. Treatment, not punishment, it could be argued, is the appropriate response to their harmful conduct.

Davis says, however, that she is not against holding individuals, even deeply disadvantaged persons, accountable for their harmful acts. <sup>21</sup> Skepticism about the agency of those who themselves have been victims is not, in any case, something Davis could consistently endorse, as she calls for social movements centered on achieving justice; and this call presupposes that human beings, including those who are oppressed, are ordinarily capable of recognizing and acting on considerations of justice. A purely rehabilitative or therapeutic approach to crime fits uneasily with a conception of the oppressed as agents of radical social change whose defiance of law is sometimes a conscious act of political resistance. Prisoners, on Davis's account, do typically possess and exercise agency in the sense described here (see Chapter 1). Indeed, a stable and just social order ould e impossile i there ere no easile circumstances under hich individuals could, y and large, e expected to comply ith hat justice demands despite sometimes eing tempted or inclined to do other ise.

ome aolitionists claim that the state dehumanies those ithin its territorial jurisdiction hen it uses vio lence (or the threat o vio lence) against these persons, even hen it does so to prevent rongul vio lence. Yet it is hard to consistently maintain that ordinary citiens are permied to engage in de ensive harm to protect themselves or others rom rongul aggression ut insist that state ocials are never permied to use orce to reduce the incidence o murder or rape. ndeed, many radical aolitionists elieve that revolutionary vio lence is sometimes justied, hether in the strug gle against capitalism and ascism or in national lieration movements against colonialism. mong aolitionists ho might disapprove o violent social revolution, many still celerate slave revolts and deend the right o armed sel- deense against illegitimate state violence. resumaly, such actions, though violent, are not dehumaniing.

here is also the commitment o aolition eminists and organ iations lie urvived & unished to deend criminalied survivors o gender and sexual vio lence. onsider the amous case o Joanne ("Joan") Lile. On ugust , , Lile as eing held at eauort ounty Jail in orth arolina on charges o reaing and entering hen larence lligood, a jail ocer, entered her cell ith an ice pic hoping to compel Lile into sex. Lile managed to stalligood ith the ice pic (some eleven times) and escaped rom the jail. lligood died rom his ounds. fer a highly pulicied eelong la- enorcement hunt, Lile surrendered and as charged ith rst- degree murder. Little claimed she had acted in sel- deense against attempted rape. Many noted lac leaders and artists strongly supported her, and a " ree Joan Lile" movement emerged, ith hundreds o supporters rallying outside the court house during her trial. n act, in a June article or *Ms. Magazine*, ngela avis deended Little's actions as a courageous act o sel deense and re sis tance to sexual assault in prison. fer hearing testimony rom Lile and rom other lac omen survivors o lligood's sexual assaults, a jury acuied Lile o the murder charges. dout that many aolitionists ould claim that Lile's violent actions in sel- deense dehumanied lligood.

e only ay to coherently arm that revolutionary vio lence, slave reellion, or vio lence in sel- deense is sometimes permied ut that state vio lence is alays illegitimate is to deend anarchism—to argue that no state has the authority to use physical coercion or intentional harm to enorce las ecause a state, no maer ho airly or enevolently it operated, could never have a rightul claim on others' oedience to its las. narchists deny that state- legal authority (and sometimes any hierarchical social organ iation) is ever legitimate, and accordingly many oppose *all* state sanctions or lareaing, not just incarceration. ere are anarchists ho are also prison aolitionists.

Yet anarchist commitments don't necessarily rule out the use o incarceration to prevent or reduce serious rongdoing. harges o rongdoing, trials, and punishment can, and do, occur in communities that are not or ga nied as states, as ith many pre-modern traditional socie ties. is ind o treatment, an anarchist might allo, is the province o stateless communities, as opposed to an exclusive prerogative o territorially sovereign states ( here understood in the Westphalian sense). sel governing (though non- state) community could come to consensus that the practice o imprisonment is the most eective, most humane, and airest ay to limit serious rongs and therey maintain a ourishing community.

rison reormers generally accept that it is sometimes necessary and justiale to use harm to prevent harm. ome aolitionists, hoever, reject the use o harm to address harm. e pacist aolitionist (ho might also e an anarchist) thus does have a consistent position on the use o harm. ome pacists do not merely oppose illing, state violence, and ar ut are against all vio lence and coercion. ereore, it is easy or them to explain hy they ahor and reject prisons. mprisonment, as a orm o involuntary connement that curtails prisoners' asic lierties, necessarily involves the use o orce and the intentional imposition o harm. t is a violent practice. e challenge or pacists is to explain convincingly hy there is a duty to astain rom violence even hen e are rongly threatened y it and even hen aggressors ill not other ise e contained or deterred.

dout e have a duty to asor or sumit to the harm that others rongly see to inict upon us. also dout e have a duty to alays choose light or supplication hen violently threatened. t ould tae a lot to persuade me that harming others, particularly hen the harm is nonlethal, is *always* unjustied. o e sure, pacism raises in ter est ing philosophical uestions aout the po liti cal morality o nonviolence. on't explore them urther, though. pacist aolitionism is not the orm o aolition that nd most challenging or compelling. nd avis does not use pacism as a premise in her arguments against prisons. ndeed, the orm o lac radicalism rom hich avis's anti-prison activism initially emerged, and for which I have much sympathy, positioned itself in stark opposition to the mainstream Civil Rights movement's commitment to rely solely on nonviolent resistance to fight injustice (see Chapter 1).

#### Imprisonment as Slavery

As we saw in Chapter 1, many influential black radical thinkers— George Jackson, Huey Newton, and Assata Shakur—have compared prison to enslavement. Davis herself maintains that "slavery continues to live on in contemporary institutions—as in the cases of the death penalty and the prison." 28 She states that there is "a clear relationship between the rise of the prisonindustrial-complex in the era of global capitalism and the persistence of structures in the punishment system that originated with slavery." Davis tells us that because new democratic institutions were not developed to end the conditions that created American slavery, "black people encountered new forms of slavery—from debt peonage and the convict lease system to segregated and second-class education. The prison system continues to carry out this terrible legacy." <sup>30</sup> Perhaps most famously, she claims, "obvious vestiges of enslavement persist within the U. S. prison system. The Thirteenth Amendment [to the U. S. Constitution abolished slavery for all except those who have been convicted of a crime. That is why many of us have suggested that we need a modern-day abolitionist movement."31

If the practice of imprisonment is akin to slavery, then prison abolition would naturally be an urgent and necessary response for all who care about justice. The two institutions—slavery and imprisonment—are strikingly similar and have sometimes been combined. Enslaved Africans, for example, were imprisoned throughout their terrifying and deadly journey across the Atlantic during the Middle Passage. Slavery can and has taken place in the context of incarceration, as with the post–Civil War convict-leasing system in the United States.<sup>32</sup> And the threat of incarceration has been used to perpetuate slavery or slave-like conditions. Yet there *are* differences between enslavement and imprisonment that are morally relevant to assessing the legitimacy of incarceration as punishment.

Before getting to those differences, we should pause again to register that the thesis that imprisonment is a kind of slavery is extremely radical, particularly if the paradigm for slavery is the chattel slavery that Africans and peoples of African descent experienced in the Americas. And the charge that prison is legalized slavery, if true, would have far-reaching practical implications. Slavery, understood as absolute despotism, puts the enslaved and their captors in a state of war. This kind of abject oppression, particularly when it endures over a long period, is widely thought to license the use of political violence and to void the authority of laws that permit and facilitate the practice and perhaps to invalidate the entire legal order and governing regime. For instance, the slave rebellion in Saint-Domingue and the revolutionary struggle to found Haiti as an independent nation were premised on this moral foundation.<sup>33</sup> Of course, the fact that a moral or political position is radical or calls for drastic action does not show that the position is incorrect. Nevertheless, we should keep the radical implications of the critique in mind as we assess its soundness and consider alternatives.

There is no doubt that slavery is a powerful and enduring symbol in black political culture. The historical memory of enslavement has prooundly shaped lac identities and continues to have deep emotional resonance among lac peoples. n addition, ugitive slaves and slave revolts are generally venerated as heroic in lac po liti cal culture.t is thereore not surprising that prison aolitionists in the lac radical tradition regularly invoe slavery and slave re sis tance hen seeing to moilie people, particularly rican mericans, in anti-prison initiatives. ut my aim is not to assess hether narratives aout slavery and its similarity to imprisonment are eective means or inspiring po liti cal action. hetorical strategy, though oviously impor tant, is not my primary interest in aolition. am concerned ith invocations o slavery in con temporary social criticism, and see to determine hether the *substance* o this orm o criticism is valid, and i so, ho it ears on the disagreement eteen reormers and aolitionists.

Within some systems o slavery, slaveholders have (near) asolute poer over their slaves. is dominion includes complete control over the ody and activities o the slave, sometimes extending to the discretion to determine hether the enslaved ill live or die. Hoever, hen a state's poer over prisoners is legitimate, it is not aritrary despotic poer. Human rights re uirements, constitutional restrictions, and the demo cratic authority o legislative odies properly limit the state's poer to control and shape the lives o prisoners. mprisonment cannot e permissily imposed ithout satisying due pro cess reuirements— just searches, reedom rom coerced conessions, haeas corpus, rights to deend onesel against charges, access to legal counsel, impartial trials, air sentences, opportunities to appeal court judgments, and so on.

Moreover, it is not a necessary eature o imprisonment that prisoners are sold, leased out, or used as collateral in commercial deals. Ending the practice o commodiying prisoners does not reuire the aolition o prisons as such. nstitutionalied custodial connement need not entail that the state has property rights over a prisoner's ody or laor. or does claiming that incarceration is sometimes legitimate imply that prison o cials are permied to use torture or corporal punishment to orce prisoners to or or to ensure laor discipline.

t is true that locs, physical restraints, and guards are used to prevent prisoners rom escaping. ut coercive mea sures to prevent escape are sometimes justied, as ith extremely violent patients in psychiatric hospitals or ith prisoners o ar. ll orms o incarceration, hether or not punishment is the aim, entail signicant intererence ith the asic lierties o those conned (reedom o movement, association, privacy, and so on).

ince enslavement and imprisonment ofen involve involuntary laor, the slave/prisoner analogy may seem more promising i or under coercive conditions is highlighted. Yet e should distinguish eteen orced laor as an indenite or permanent condition (hich is typical o slavery), and a speciied and limited period o involuntary laor, as might e imposed as part o a prison sentence. e scope o the involuntary laor might also e restricted to a specic, perhaps even narro, range o activities, and excluding things lie the coerced provision o sexual ser vices or other degrading activities. When the timerame or and range o activities is thus limited, it is not ovious to me hy prison laor couldn't e a legitimate penalty or serious crimes. ome ho are convicted o lesser crimes are sentenced to periods o community ser vice or assigned speciic laor tass. is laor is not voluntary either, ut its imposition can sometimes e justied.

e ojection to prison laor cannot e that it comines to di er ent types o penalty— incarceration and involuntary laor. ter all, monetary ines and prison terms are sometimes comined, as are nancial restitution and community ser vice. cannot see hat principled reason there could e or oridding such mixed penalties, provided they are proportionate to the crime and could help reduce crime overall.

ssume that an explicit period o imprisonment (or instance, seven years) is a morally permissile and proportionate penalty or certain crimes (say, aempted murder). lso suppose that limited or assignments are a legitimate punishment or criminal rongdoing. these assumptions hold, then it seems to me that oering a *shorter* prison term on the condition that the convicted oender or during the period o connement is sometimes permissile. e same thing happens hen community ser vice is oered as an alternative punishment to a justied prison sentence. e reasonale assumption here is that i an oender chooses a sentence that includes prison laor over a longer prison sentence that lacs a or component, then they must regard the rst as less severe.

ere is a poer ul counterexample to the claim that it is morally acceptale to oer a shorter prison sentence i the o ender accepts or penalties. the oer o a shorter sentence included a condition that the oender e sterilied, that ould clearly e ojectionale even i the oender ere to accept it. n May , ennessee Judge am enningeld signed a controversial court order permiing prisoners in the White ounty jail to receive thirty days o their sentence i they alloed themselves to e sterilied, and several imprisoned omen and men agreed to the arrangement.is outrageous "oer" might lead one to conclude that so- called alternative penalties are alays unjust ecause they are *coercive*. Once incarceration is the sentence (particularly hen the sentence is long), e can expect some convicted persons to do almost anything, even sel mortication or degrading acts, to reduce their prison time.

On the other hand, i the oer o a shorter sentence included a condition that the prisoner regularly see a psychotherapist, undergo treatment or a drug use disorder, or participate in vocational training, this stries me as much more acceptale. erhaps this is ecause these alternative penalties (though maye initially regarded as unelcome y the prisoner) could help the imprisoned person, at least in the long run. is is a good reason to ensure involuntary prison laor enets prisoners in some ay other than simply shortening their time in prison. ey could, at least upon reection or in retrospect, come to endorse the value o such or.

ot only could steriliation irreparaly harm prisoners; it ould, i not reely chosen, rongly interere ith their reproductive reedom. erhaps another lesson o the counterexample is that the alternative sentence must tae the orm o a penalty that the state has the authority to impose. teriliation cannot e a legitimate penalty, hether taen alone or added to a prison term. ut a limited or assignment could e, as or example ith community ser vice.

ompelled community ser vice and prison laor can e justi ed on grounds o deterrence and rehailitation. oth orms o or are typically disagreeale, are not reely chosen, and are generally regarded as urdensome. ereore, the threat o their imposition can serve as an incentive to avoid reaing the la. nvoluntary laor, hen it is o the right sort, could also instill discipline, useul sills, cooperative haits, and sel- esteem. is moral reorm could thus reduce the lielihood that the prisoner, once released, ill commit urther crimes.

ome aolitionists might accept that prison laor that serves the common good in a just society is permissile. Yet they might oject, not so much to the act that prison laor is involuntary, ut to the act that such compelled or ould e per ormed under the dominion and or the purposes o a *private will*— a corporate poer, rather than a pulic one. oerced privatied prison laor— particularly hen done or corporate prot— argualy maes such or a orm o involuntary *servitude*. We each have a asic interest in having the reedom to astain rom oring or companies that produce goods and ser vices e strongly disapprove o or that have practices (including laor practices) e oject to. We should not e orced to sumit to the aritrary commands or to serve the private ends o another.

We do not, hoever, have a similar lierty ith respect to pulic ser vice, as e can justialy e reuired to provide, say, military ser vice and jury duty, at least hen the acground social structure is just and the governing regime legitimate. Here e ould e sumiing to the pulic ill under the rule o la, and our eorts ould contriute to maintaining the just social order rom hich e enet. the goods and ser vices produced through prison laor ere used y other state agencies in the provision o pulic goods, this could not e reasonaly construed as involuntary servitude. Moreover, reuiring prisoners to contribute labor that serves the public good would be one way for them to repair the civic bonds that have been frayed due to their criminal conduct. It could pave the way for reconciliation with their fellow citizens.

It could be objected that prison laborers are denied freedom of occupational choice, as they are usually assigned their tasks or must choose among a narrow range of options. Prisoners also typically lack a recognized right to organize, strike, and bargain for better work conditions. Perhaps these labor freedoms (like freedom of religion and freedom from torture) are liberties that cannot be curtailed even if one has committed a serious crime. So there might be a case that prison labor is unjust (if not a form of slavery).

The case would face some difficulties, though. The state, through imprisonment alone, would be interfering with what appear to be even more fundamental liberties—freedom of movement, association, privacy, and so on. But maybe this interference is necessary for crime control in a way that interfering with labor freedoms is not. In addition, a sentence of community service would also curtail labor rights but does not appear to be inherently unjust. Still, prison reformers could, and probably should, insist that incarcerated workers have legal counsel or chosen representatives (if not unions) to advocate and negotiate on their behalf regarding labor assignments, compensation, and work conditions.

But let's suppose it is always wrong to use prison labor to penalize legally prohibited wrongdoing. In a society that is otherwise just, would it also be unfair to require convicted prisoners to help reduce the costs of their room and board? I am not certain that it would be. It would not be unfair, for example, to expect prisoners to prepare their on ood, clean up afer themselves, and do their on laundry rather than have the pu lic pay or these ser vices to e provided at no cost to prisoners. is or is comparale to ordinary domestic laor. this type o prison or does not run aoul o airness, hy ould it e unair to expect prisoners to also help deray the costs o their clothing and ood y producing goods or providing ser vices useul to pulic agencies Even Marx allos that some o the or a age laorer does is *necessary labor* (the or needed to meet the material needs o orers and their dependents). e cap i tal ist, recall, only appropriates *surplus* laor— that is, the laor eyond necessary laor.

ncarcerating prisoners in a humane ay is expensive and inevitaly dras on pulic revenue that could e used or other purposes. When prisoners have dependents, the pulic might have to supplement the income o their amilies. nd, argualy, all in society ho are ale should, on grounds o reciprocity or productive justice, contriute *something* to reproducing the social and material conditions that sustain our common lie together. o the reuirement that prisoners or in some capacity is not, as such, unjust, even i or *as punishment* is.

laves are generally unpaid or paid very lile. One could oject, then, that prisoners orced to or are slaves insoar as they are not paid, not paid a maret age, or not paid a air age. ut suppose they ere paid a maret age. is compensated laor ould raise the already considerale costs to the pulic o taing care o prisoners' asic needs. Would state conscation o a portion o these ages to deray the expense o incarceration e unair am not sure that it ould e. t ould e comparale to a tax or to garnishing ages or an unpaid pulic det.

evertheless, there is lile dout that prisoners should receive higher ages than they typically do. (or instance, in no state in mer i ca are they paid anyhere close to the ederal minimum age, hich is itsel egregiously lo.) Yet eer pay or prison laor ould still e reorm, not aolition. Or i eer pay or prison laor does count as "aolition," then many re ormers are aolitionists, and the call to aolish the prison turns out to e a moderate demand— hich is not to say that it ould e easy to secure it.

ould emphasie that the opportunity to orhile in prison could e o considerale value to prisoners themselves, at least under current economic structures (or example, here there is an extensive laor maret and no unconditional guaranteed asic income). t ould give prisoners a chance to sho that they are reliale orers and could help them estalish an employment rec ord during their period o connement, hich could improve their employment prospects once they are released. is or history could, in addition, e used to sho that they are ready to e released, that they ill e ale to secure and eep a jo and thus are less liely to turn to crime. e or itsel gives prisoners something constructive to do. nstructured prison lie is intensely oring and monotonous, and too much prisoner idleness ofen leads to mischie and interpersonal conict, hich needlessly adds to the urdens o prison.

mprisonment is extremely hard on the amilies o prisoners and ofen strains (and sometimes reas) amilial onds. prisoners have opportunities to earn money, they can nancially assist their amilies, i only in small ays, and this can help to strengthen or repair amily ties. gif rom an imprisoned parent can mean a lot to a child and reduces the shame prisoners sometimes eel or eing unale to play a larger role in the care and raising o their children. rough paid or prisoners could also earn money to uy things they ant (small creature comorts), hich lessens the nancial urden on their amilies. Or they could save some money to ease their reentry into society.

Moreover, hen prison laor plays a ey role in the maintenance and operation o the prison, this gives prisoners some leverage in argaining or eer oring and prison conditions. ey can then ithdra their laor in protest (or threaten to do so) and may therey gain some concessions. Where all the necessary or is done y prison sta, prisoners have lile poer they can ield collectively (apart rom, say, rioting or hunger stries).

Generally, prisoners should e permied to exercise as many o their asic lierties as are compatile ith their prison sentence and the reuirements o custodial care. is means alloing prisoners to exercise many o their po liti cal lierties and economic reedoms, as ell as permiing them regular contact (through phone calls, leers, electronic communication, and in- person visits) ith persons outside the prison here easile. e thin o their penalty as hard treatment designed to control crime (through deterrence, rehailitation, or incapacitation) rather than as civic death (the suspension o all their asic rights), exile (anishment rom civil society), or retriution (imposing the suering they deserve), then this maes perect sense.

o reasonale person thins that hen oenders are penalied through nes or mandatory community ser vice, they should also lose their social, civic, and economic reedoms. ese reedoms are properly curtailed only insoar as this is necessary to impose or administer a just sentence. We could and should construe imprisonment similarly. o, or instance, acilitating and compensating prison or could e a ay o respecting prisoners' right to or and earn money. us, prisoners should at least, here easile, have the *option* (and perhaps e strongly encouraged) to or hile incarcerated.

What this series o reections has revealed is that the practice o imprisonment is not, or at least need not e, a orm o slavery (here enslavement is understood as inherently unjust). Yet the main pro lem ith the slave laor/prisoner laor analogy is that someone convicted o a serious crime (unlie, say, a chael slave) has een judged to have commied a grave rong, and prison laor is the penalty or the transgression. a person's crimes do not permit the state to curtail their lierties to control crime, then imprisonment, even ithout involuntary laor, is eectively *kidnapping*— the rongul aduction and connement o another against their ill. Oviously, a state cannot permissily punish someone— hether through imprisonment, involuntary laor, nes, property conscation, or suspension o privileges—on the grounds that the person is a memer o a stigmatied, dislied, or poerless social group. it can justly punish at all, it can do so only in response to an unlaul act that is legitimately prohiited; and it can impose such penalties only on the person(s) ho commied the act.

e aolitionist criticism that practices o imprisonment are continuous ith slavery is most compelling hen understood as a critiue o some past or existing prisons. t is a orce ul and appropriate moral condemnation o prisons as they once ere and as some no are. ome prisons do share eatures ith slavery that make them morally unacceptable. But it is not a powerful criticism when applied to all prisons or to prisons as they might be if suitably reformed. Nor does it help to resolve the reform-versus-abolition debate. The moral charge that prisons are slavery would justify abolition only if the practice of imprisonment could not exist without sharing objectionable features with the practice of enslavement.

#### Prisons as a Legacy of Slavery

Davis and like-minded abolitionists identify surprising *historical* relationships between enslavement and imprisonment. Different historical links can be postulated, and the practical significance of each link—for example, whether it points toward reform, demands abolition, or has no practical import—varies. I see this criticism as offering a *genealogical critique* of the prison, and consider several ways to understand the historical connection between enslavement and imprisonment.

Within the critical theory tradition, genealogical critique does not always aim to show that the practice being examined should be abandoned or replaced. It needn't imply the automatic rejection of the object of critique. The objective of the historical analysis can sometimes be to free us from a too-easy acceptance of the practice, from a complacent and unreflective endorsement of it.<sup>41</sup> The critical analysis often works by demonstrating the role of contingent power relations in the origins of the practice, which dissolves the sense of inevitability that surrounds it. The genealogical critique can free, if not radicalize, our imagination, empowering us to experiment with different ways of doing things or at least to consider new possibilities.

Many people, ithout giving the maer much thought, treat the practice o imprisonment as natu ral and inescapale, as a necessary eature o social lie that has alays een and thus ill alays e ith us. aptive to this picture, they do not see the need to justiy or scrutinie the prison. Genealogical critiue can rea the hold o this perspective (hich many are unaare they are in the grip o), enaling us to tae a more critical stance toard the practice and possily leading us to mae signicant changes to it. thin e can read Michel oucault's *Discipline and Punish: e Birth of the Prison* () as oering a critiue o this sort (though other interpretations are pos sile).

o the extent that avis's genealogical critiue o imprisonment (tracing the genesis o prisons to practices o enslavement) rees our imagination, encourages reevaluation, and prepares the ay or arguments or prison aolition, regard it as immensely valuale. We should not tae the prison or granted or regard its justication as sel- evident, and the practice is ripe or rethining. Hoever, i the genealogical critiue is meant to e part o the case or aolition— that is, to e an argument or a movement to end the use o prisons—it has limitations.

e genealogical critiue holds that the con temporary practice o imprisonment is a "legacy" o slavery. Let's consider this the standard ormulation. lternative ormulations include asserting that prisons "are a structural inheritance o slavery," "are an institutional descendant o slavery," "are a heritage o slavery," "have historical resonances ith slavery," "have their roots in slavery," "exhiit traces o slavery," or "are a surviving vestige o slavery" all ormulations to e ound in avis's ritings on prisons.

o this ay o puing things— that existing imprisonment practices are a legacy o slavery— might suggest that slavery and imprisonment are not only oth rong ut rong or the same reason. is is an argumentative strategy that Marx ofen employed in his critiue o capitalism. He ould identiy common eatures o slavery and serdom (eatures that ere then, and no, commonly held to e rong) and then aempt to sho that capitalism had these same eatures despite appearances to the contrary. ll three systems, he maintained, are dehumaniing and despotic orms o involuntary servitude. avis, too, can e plausily read as claiming that imprisonment is, essentially, a orm o slavery and should thereore e opposed on the same moral grounds. Yet this argument, already addressed, is not a genealogical critiue, as its soundness does not depend on a historical connection eteen slavery and the prison. t depends only on oth practices eing rong or the same or similar reasons.

"Legacy" could mean something lie "remnant" or "outdated"—in eect, an osolete holdover rom another time, as hen avis speas o the "vestiges" o slavery ound in prisons.e practice o imprisonment should have ully collapsed ith the aolition o slavery, yet its ruins continue to impact our pre sent. Here the general moral taeaay is that prisons had nearious uses in the past (to acilitate and extend slavery, say), and they serve no useul purpose in the pre sent, nor ill they in the uture. Hoever, this ould eg the uestion against re ormers, ho elieve that incarceration has good and ad uses in the pre sent and, ith appropriate reorms, could e used solely or legitimate purposes in the uture.

o have "roots" in slavery might suggest that slavery *nourishes*—that is, remains a causal ingredient in reproducing current practices o imprisonment. lavery, even long afer it as abolished in the United States, has caused generations of people to be deeply disadvantaged. This unrectified disadvantage makes many vulnerable to incarceration. Prisons are full of people who were socioeconomically disadvantaged prior to their imprisonment. He descendants of American slaves continue to be among the most disadvantaged groups in the United States, and also represent a strikingly disproportionate share of the prison population. If an explanatory cause of this overrepresentation among the imprisoned is the fact that the harms of slavery have not been fully rectified or compensated, then this clearly calls for redress.

Yet it is unclear why such rectification should take the form of prison abolition. The root of the problem is not the existence of prisons but pervasive and deeply unjust socioeconomic disadvantage more broadly. The appropriate response would therefore be to remove the disadvantages that make the descendants of slaves vulnerable to being arrested and imprisoned. This would mean not only ensuring due process and the rule of law but also preventing racial discrimination, securing equal educational opportunity for all, enhancing employment opportunities for the jobless and underemployed, securing housing for the homeless, protecting worker rights, increasing income subsidies for the poor, de-concentrating and redistributing wealth, guaranteeing universal health care, politically empowering the socially marginalized, and other such measures.

It could be argued that what has been "inherited" from the era of slavery are ideologies and institutions (racism and prisons) that *perform the same functions* in the present. In effect, these functions persist as inherent (or near inherent) features of prisons and related ideologies. This is a version of the

"ineradicable logic" of institutions thesis, which I will address in the next chapter.

If "legacy" means something like "inherited from" or "handed down from the past," we still must ask whether the objectionable features were also bequeathed and if so, whether these can be removed without destroying the inherited item itself or turning it into something else entirely. A business that operated according to racist values in the past when in the hands of its previous owners might operate now in a way that satisfies requirements of racial justice because the business is under the direction of new, antiracist owners. Institutions are more like property than like genes. Those who "inherit" institutions have considerable control over what they will be like going forward, because they can adopt different aims, can change institutional rules and procedures, can alter the rights and responsibilities of those who participate in the institution, and can choose new personnel, including new leadership. Consider the many multigender and multiracial colleges and universities (like my home institution) that used to be open only to economically privileged, Protestant, gender-conforming white men.

This point is entirely consistent with—indeed, a necessary feature of—a broadly historical materialist outlook. Marx thought that the means of production in the hands of the bourgeoisie were instruments of subjugation and exploitation. But once the proletariat takes hold of them, placing them under worker control and no longer using them as private capital to maximize profit, these means—whose immense productive power has been cultivated under capitalism—will be the basis for freedom, community, and material prosperity for all. The fact that these highly developed means of production would be a legacy of "wage slavery" is not a good reason, according to Marx, to refuse to use them under socialism.

Marx made a similar argument about the state itself. He believed that under capitalism the modern bureaucratic state functions as the executive committee for arranging the affairs and advancing the interests of the bourgeoisie. Yet, after the revolution, the state would be an emancipatory instrument in the hands of the proletariat, who would use it to dismantle the oppressive elements of capitalism and lay the groundwork for communism.

Perhaps the penal arm of the state (like, say, intergenerational monetary bequests) is a feature of the old and decaying social order best discarded in the new. This is one way of interpreting the call for prison abolition—that when the truly free society is successfully built, it will be, and should be, one without prisons. This claim cannot be established, however, by merely pointing to the fact that prisons were forged within and have been inherited from an unjust social order. Capitalism, by Marx's own accounting, develops many things (including laborsaving technology and efficient ways of organizing work) that we can expect to be preserved in a socialist society.

#### Reform and Redress

Prisons as we know them, now and in the past, are often dehumanizing, horrid, even torture chambers. Many existing prisons have far too much in common with slavery. <sup>45</sup> Injustices in the wider social structure can also affect the fairness and legitimacy of penalizing crime through incarceration and prison labor.

mprisoning memers o oppressed groups or serious rongdoing, though sometimes necessary to protect the vulnerale, is a morally trouling practice. ese prisoners are due redress in the orm o corrective justice. Had they received such redress, these prisoners may not have ound themselves running aoul o the la. orcing them to or hile incarcerated, though not slavery, can e a sustantial insult, particularly hen they are the descendants o slaves. e state, hose very legitimacy depends on securing just conditions or all, lacs the moral standing to condemn much o the rongdoing it penalies, as it is ofen responsile, in part, or the circumstances that lead to crime. nd it cannot justiy reuiring the unjustly disadvantaged to or to cover the costs o their imprisonment hen it has so uerly ailed to ensure justice in the society rom hich these prisoners come.

ut punishing the justly convicted y orcing them to do unpaid or is not alays unair, let alone an instance o slavery. e situation might seem other ise ecause o injustices that lie elsehere, including ithin the roader criminal justice system. Ofen the under lying pro lem is that the prison sentence is unarranted or unair given the nature o the crime (or instance, needlessly harsh). Or, given structural injustices in the roader society, the state lacs the moral standing to punish the criminal oense (or example, hen it penalies economic crimes among the poor). Or prison conditions are already so needlessly severe that orced laor ould e cruel and degrading. nd, all too ofen, a prisoner did not commit the crime or hich they ere convicted, or, even i they did, due pro cess standards ere not adeuately met and so they ere not convicted airly.

All this, I believe, the prison reformer can readily, even strongly, endorse. Indeed, for these reasons, some existing prisons and perhaps some whole prison systems should be closed. Yet these conclusions, as distressing and infuriating as they are, do not constitute a compelling case for abolishing the general practice of imprisonment. Prison, no matter how humane or well administered, is an undesirable place to be. There can be no doubt about that. This of course is part of the point, at least insofar as the incarceration is a form of punishment. So far, what the abolitionist case against prisons suggests is the urgent need, not only for prison reform, but for broader social-structural reform. In this way at least, abolitionists and radical reformers are often, despite appearances, on the same side.

#### **CHAP T ER 3**

#### **A Broken System? Racism and Functional Critique**

e aolitionist case against the practice o imprisonment is complex. s discussed in the previous chapter, there is the charge that prisons are dehumaniing and related to slavery in ays hich mae their continued existence ojectionale. ut another criticism comes up repeatedly in aolitionist ritings, one that centers on the unction o prisons.

e unctional argument taes multiple orms, hich can e classied into our general versions: that the unction o the prison is economic exploitation (or the acilitation o such exploitation); that the unction o the prison is racial sujugation (or to perpetuate racism); that the unction o the prison is to repress political resistance; and that the unction o the prison is to conceal intractale social pro lems. ese claims are est understood as conclusions o a type o social analy sis, amiliar rom some va ri e ties o Marxism and critical theory, that call *functional critique*.

ant to riey elaorate on each o these claims and oer a more precise ormulation o the structure o unctional critiue. ut my principal ocus here is the claim that prisons serve a racist unction. (e other three claims get more extensive treatment elsehere in the oo.) ocusing on the case o racism illustrates the poer o this orm o social critiue ut also highlights its limits. e unctional critiue o prisons, ill argue, does not sho that prisons should e aolished rather than reormed. ut, understood in a ay 'll explain, the critiue can estalish that, in the nited tates at least, e should radically reduce our reliance on prisons.

s a reminder, y "the prison" don't mean merely the acilities in hich prisoners are conned. or do have in mind partic u lar prisons, lie oledad, an Quentin, or iers. mean the general institutionalied *practice* o incarceration, hich orci ly conines prisoners ithin an enclosed space, physically separates them rom the pulic, claims custodial guardianship over them, sujects them to the directives o prison ocials, and treats them in these ays as a penalty or criminal oenses. e prison is an institutional apparatus o captivity, surveillance, and social control, an institution that cannot operate ithout coercion and severe constraints on prisoners' reedom.

#### avis on the unctions o risons e orm o unctional critiue that ngela avis avors dras heavi ly on Marxism. he elieves that capitalism (lie slavery and serdom) is a degrading and despotic system o involuntary servitude. e unction o capitalism, she maintains, is not to meet human needs through the ecient production and ree exchange o useul commodities ut to maximie prot or the enet o a small ruling elite. ese nancial gains are garnered at the expense o those outside the ruling class (primarily age laorers) and are not the product o " ree" exchange ut extracted through orce, thef, and raud. is rongul extraction o prot taes many orms. ere are, or instance, institutions that ostensily serve the pulic good ut, in act, serve only (or mainly) to maximie corporate prot. avis elieves this is true o prison systems (see hapter ).

avis is not a class reductionist or an orthodox Marxist. he does not elieve that all oppression is ultimately or primarily a orm o economic exploitation or class- ased sujugation. he maintains, lie others in the lac radical tradition, that *racism* is also a orm o oppression. lthough ofen intimately related to economic suordination, racism is a distinct injustice, rongul in itsel. avis holds that the practice o punitive incarceration is racist, perpetuates racism, and creates ne modes o racism.

ccording to avis, the prison also serves as an instrument or po liti cal repression (see hapter ). t should not e surprising that those suject to economic exploitation and racial domination ofen resent and resist the people and institutions that oppress them. espite the riss involved, some ill naturally reuse to sumit to suordination and servitude. When people do rise up to oppose an unjust social system— hether individually or collectively, spontaneously or in a coordinated ashion— the state uses the penal system to put don or contain this re sis tance and to deter others rom engaging in similar deance.

rison, avis argues, "serves as a place to are house people ho represent major social pro lems." ap ital ist predation creates and exacerbates social problems—poverty, homelessness, violence, disorder, mental illness, and drug abuse. These problems cannot be solved within the existing social framework. Those who cannot be integrated into the current market economy in a way that is consistent with maximizing corporate profit are often incarcerated to keep them from public view. This circumstance obscures deep dysfunction in the social system or presents it as an "ordinary" problem of crime.

I turn now to the point and structure of functional critique. Not all function statements ("the function of X is Y") are offered as explanatory or critical. Sometimes the ascription of a function to an institution is simply a matter of identifying one of its purported beneficial consequences, suggesting an answer to the question, "What good does X do?" Or one might be identifying the institution's official purpose, that is, the justifying aim generally offered for why the institution is worthwhile and should continue to exist.

Davis isn't doing either of these. She is not talking about the penal system's "beneficial" consequences but its more destructive ones. The fact that some group (for example, capitalists or the ruling class) benefits from imprisonment is, for Davis, part of what makes prisons objectionable. She doesn't think prisons serve to prevent crime, to rehabilitate offenders, or to impose the suffering that offenders "deserve." For her, to identify the "real" function of the prison is to explain why the prison continues to exist despite not actually serving its official purpose, and, on this basis, to morally condemn it.

The explanatory and the critical dimensions of functional critique are closely related but can be examined separately. So e could set aside hether the conseuence is good or ad and ocus on hether identiying the conseuence really explains hat it purports to explain. nd e could leave aside the explanatory uestion and aend to hether the conseuence is as ad as the critiue implies. Hoever, to arrive at aolitionist conclusions using unctional analy sis, the explanatory claim must *ground* the critical claim. at is to say, prisons must persist *because* they serve an oppressive unction. s ill aempt to mae clear, it is not enough to sho (assuming it can e shon) that prisons came into existence to serve these unctions. or is it sucient to sho that prisons tae the horrid orm they typically do ecause they serve oppressive unctions. prisons can e reormed so that they are humane, air to prisoners, and only perorm legitimate unctions, then unctional critiue cannot yield aolitionist conclusions. (rison aolition might, hoever, e justied on some other grounds.)

n critically examining unctional critiues o prisons, am not challenging the validity o unctional explanation as such. or do say that unctional explanations o social phenomena are never sound. nstead, ant to oer an interpretation o avis's unctional claims aout prisons and ashether, i true, these claims ould justiy the aolition o prisons.

#### e General orm o unctional ritiue adical unctional critiues can sometimes seem compelling ecause they are oered in vague, esoteric, or meta phorical language. One ofen hears social criticism that taes the orm, "e system isn't roen; it's operating the ay it's supposed to." Or some ill say, " ese oppressive conseuences are to e expected, given the *logic* o the system." uch amiliar unctionalist claims suggest that "the system" cannot e reormed or xed, only done aay ith or replaced ith something entirely di er ent. Hoever, to ully assess the poer o such unctional critiues, greater precision is needed.

o say "the (or a) unction o *X* is *Y*," here this is meant as a critiue o *X*, the critical theorist is essentially maing three related claims:

- . *X* causes (or is a causal contriutor to) *Y* (in social system *S*).
- . e act that *X* causes *Y* explains *X* (or some impor tant eature o *X*).
- . *Y* is unjust or oppressive (or acilitates an oppressive *S*).

e target o a unctional critiue can e an institution, a elie system, or oth si mul ta neously. Let's say *X* is an institution (or example, a school or educational system). We can thin o institutions as constituted y *a set of public rules, social roles, and goals*. is system o rules and roles enales and regulates sustained cooperation or some explicit purpose. (chools have a schedule, a curriculum, and standards o evaluation; they have administrators, teachers, and students; and they aim to have students learn through ormal instruction and examinations.) hese rules speciy procedures, lines o authority, prohiitions, prerogatives, and standards. articipants in the practice generally understand these rules and their institutional roles, ut might not ully comply ith the rules or carry out their role oligations conscientiously.

We can call the *goal* that core participants pulicly avo the institution's *ocial purpose*. (nd an institution can have more than one ocial purpose. o, or instance, a school might aim to prepare students or college, to teach them sills valued y the laor maret, and to prepare them or responsile citienship.) e institution may or may not achieve its ocial purpose (at least not ully). Ocials may, and ofen do, revise rules and redene roles or create ne rules and roles so that the institution eer achieves its aims or so that it continues to achieve its aims despite a changing environment.

o, the participants in an institution (or some poer ul suset) may privately share an aim that diverges rom or even conicts ith the institution's ocial purpose. (erhaps school administrators or teachers surreptitiously see to indoctrinate students into a par tic u lar po liti cal ideology or to inculcate a disposition to alays sumit to authority.) Let's call this concealed or unacnoledged aim a *covert purpose*. e *operative aim(s)* o participants in an institution— that is, the goal(s) they *actually* aempt to achieve— can e an ocial purpose, a covert purpose, or oth.

olloing oert Merton, call something a unction o *X* only i it is an *actual eect* o *X*. When an oservale causal conseuence o an institution is generally aligned ith the ocial purpose o that institution, e can reer to this eect as the institution's *manifest function*. (e students learn in accordance ith the school's ocial curriculum.) e institution is unctioning as it purports to (though not necessarily as ell as it could). n institution can e malormed or roen such that it ails to perorm its ocial purpose or such that it perorms the purpose poorly. Here e say that the institution is *malfunctioning* or *dysfunctional*.

causal conseuence o an institution that helps to explain the institution ut is not the institution's ocial purpose is a *latent* unction o the institution. (e students ho aended the school accept a partisan ideology or are sumissive in the ace o authoritarian demands.) is latent unction may e attriutale to the covert purposes o the institution's participants (or some poer ul suset thereo). Here, a concealed, unac noledged, or maye even disavoed goal is the real operative aim, notithstanding any ocial purposes the institution is said to serve.

Hoever, the unction— that is, the conseuences— may e unintended or unrecognied y participants in the institution. Or— and this point is underappreciated— even i *some* participants do see these conseuences, they may lac the collective ecacy to ring them aout. (o, or example, teachers may try to indoctrinate their students ut ail miseraly; yet the students, ecause o some unnoticed structural eature o the school, come to accept the po liti cal ideology nonetheless.) e elcome conseuences are, ith re spect to these participants' conscious agency, merely ortuitous. Yet to e the *function* o the institution, these conseuences cannot e mere happenstance. ey must, in some ay, explain the institution itsel. 'll return in a moment to ho an institution's unintended conseuences could have this ind o explanatory signicance.

ut rst, hat acts aout an institution is a unctional critiue meant to explain ince the causal conseuences o an existing institution are the relevant explanatory acts, unctional critiues are not generally invoed to explain hy an institution came to exist to egin ith. unctional analy sis may, hoever, explain hy the institution *persists* despite changes elsehere in the society. Or it may help us understand hy the institution is so *resilient* in the ace o roust aempts to do aay ith it.

e unction o an institution might explain its *structure*— its specic rules and its social roles. Or, nally, it might explain hy the institution operates the ay it does— hy its participants tae the individual and collective actions that they do.

One explanatory value o the maniest/latent distinction is to mae sense o an institution that doesn't appear to achieve its ocial purpose. avis does this hen she suggests that prison systems persist (indeed have even expanded) despite the act that prisons don't actually prevent crime (their ostensile aim). he then argues that their covert purpose or unintended or unrecognied conseuence is something else— economic exploitation, racial domination, po liti cal repression, and the disguising o social pro lems. n other ords, the *latent* unction o prisons is creating or maintaining vari ous orms o oppression.

o let's suppose the target o unctional critiue is a idely held elie system. (in o the system o elie that some call "neolieralism.") ese elies may not e ully conscious and might e merely implicit in the dispositions and uerances o those ho share them. (Maye the aith that competitive mar ets alays promote human elare despite the ineuality they generate is merely assumed rather than a considered judgment.) ere can also e shifs over time in the content o the elie system ithout the system losing its asic integrity. (eolieralism can concede that some government regulation enets the pulic and that not all pulic unctions should e privatied.) When such a elie system shapes identities, encourages haits, or other ise inuences action, it can have signicant social eects. Many ho are unamiliar ith or openly reject the elie system can nonetheless be greatly impacted (for good or ill) by the fact that *others* embrace and act on these beliefs.

Sometimes the beliefs in question have been intentionally propagated to effect certain social consequences. When demagogues or propagandists are successful, we can say that the function of these ideas is to bring about these actors' conscious (though perhaps covert) purposes. At other times, the beliefs are developed and spread more spontaneously. Either no one (or almost no one) seeks to give them the social impact they have; or, though some seek this outcome, they lack the capacity to bring it about. Yet the wide acceptance of the belief system is explained by its social consequences.

A functional critique of a belief system is based, in part, on the bad practical consequences wide acceptance of the beliefs are said to have for society or some social group. These consequences generally include fostering or reinforcing an unjust social arrangement. However, despite these unwelcome social consequences, it would be irrational to reject the belief system and wrong to encourage others to reject it if the beliefs in question are true, morally sound, or otherwise epistemically well grounded. Consider the belief that the overwhelming power of the state would quickly crush any violent rebellion. Provided the belief is true, it should not be rejected, though its spread could lead to passivity or resignation in the face of political repression. The spirit of resistance should not be advanced with false or misleading claims. To avoid tacitly endorsing the use of propaganda, functional critique typically includes attributing some distortion, moral error, or misrepresentation to the belief system in question. Indeed, on some accounts, the oppressive social consequences are brought about through the cognitive or moral failings of the belief system. (Ordinary working people suffer, it might be thought, because of the wide acceptance of the false belief that high economic inequality, concentrated wealth, and low taxes are to everyone's advantage.)

These *social illusions* lead people to fail to recognize or fully appreciate that they are situated within (and might be unwittingly perpetuating) oppressive social relations. This misperception of reality or faulty moral reasoning affects the subjects' cognitive, emotional, and volitional relations to the social world they inhabit and, consequently, influences their conduct and structures their social practices. Belief systems that play this distinctive role in society are, in Marxist parlance, *ideologies*.

#### Racism and Prisons

Davis has long held that antiracism should play a central role in abolitionist theory and practice. She argues, "If we are already persuaded that racism should not be allowed to define the planet's future and if we can successfully argue that prisons are racist institutions, this may lead us to take seriously the prospect of declaring prisons obsolete."

Notice the form of argument. Racism (like slavery) is a grave wrong and widely known to be so. The practice of imprisonment, despite appearances to the contrary, is a form of racism. Given the principle "If X is a grave wrong, then X should be stopped," we can conclude that the practice of imprisonment should be ended. Accordingly, Davis holds that antiracist activism should include advocating for the abolition of prisons (and some activists in the Black Lives Matter movement have taken up the call.<sup>10</sup>). The key burden of this argument is to sho that (and perhaps ho) prisons are inherently or incorrigily racist.

n calling prisons "racist," avis is maing a numer o distinct ut related claims aout the relationship eteen racism and imprisonment. he says, or example, "La- and- order discourse is racist, the existing system o punishment has een deeply dened y historical racism. olice, courts, and prisons are dramatic examples o institutional racism." e rst and third o these claims are, elieve, properly understood as conclusions o unctional critiue.

e claim aout la- and- order rhetoric centers on the role o *ideologies* in unjust socie ties. or instance, racist elie systems can serve to legitimie incarcerating masses o people. Widespread racial prejudice, hich ofen underlies or exacerates ear o crime, leads people to tae aggressive and sometimes drastic mea sures to protect themselves rom perceived threats to their lierty, person, or property. avis argues that the idea that there is a "lac crime pro lem" is an ideological distortion ith deep roots in slavery and convict leasing and is no ostered y mass media depictions o lac lie. deological racism represents lac persons as disposed to criminality, hich in turn seems to license violent tactics y la enorcement and even y private citiens (such as George Zimmerman illing rayvon Martin in lorida in or Gregory and ravis Mc Michael illing hmaud rery in Georgia in ).

Moreover, there are elie systems that, ostensily, are not aout race at all yet nonetheless serve to legitimate the suordination o racially stigmatied groups. "La- and- order," "tough on crime," and "ar on drugs" rhe toric is ofen said to unction as ideological legitimation or hite supremacy. What appears to e a race- neutral justication or aggressive la enorcement to "ght crime" or to ensure "pulic saety" serves as a rational-

iation or race- ased domination, humiliation, rutality, and cruelty.

o i the *sole* reason that imprisonment is accepted as legitimate is due to racism or some other ideology, then a unctional critiue ould go a long ay toard estalishing the need or prisons to e aolished. , hoever, there is a plausile pulic justication or the practice— say, that it is a air and e ective ay to control serious crimes— then the justication must e shon to ail i the unctional critiue is to justiy aolition. e existence o a ad justication or a practice, even i idely accepted, does not preclude there eing a good one. nd the act that some act on a ad justication doesn't mean that none act, or could e rought to act, on a good one.

When avis asserts that prisons are an instance o institutional racism, she is not suggesting that their *manifest* unction is racial domination. Ocials o the .. criminal justice system do not proclaim pulicly that a goal o la enorcement is, say, to maintain hite supremacy. ather, avis elieves that racial domination is a *latent* unction o con temporary prisons.

What ever its maniest unction, an institution's goals are racist hen the covert aims o its ocials (particularly those ith the poer to mae and revise the institution's rules) are to oppress or other ise harm memers o a racial group. e institution's rules may e race- neutral in their explicit content yet e designed to ring aout or maintain the sujugation o a racially stigmatied group. t ould e appropriate to strongly condemn such an institution even i its constitutive rules ail to secure its reprehensile goals. n eec tive ness does not insulate an institution rom moral criticism. ut it ould not e correct to ariute a latent *function* to the institution unless its covert purposes are actually achieved.

Even i an institution's ocials don't have racist goals, the institution ould still e racist i its rules, hoever sutly, are racially iased or discriminatory. ese rules might have een ashioned, perhaps in the distant past, ith racist intent ut are no applied ithout aareness o their origins. Or the rules, despite not having een designed ith this end in vie, may nonetheless unairly advantage one racial group over another ithout ocials noticing the ineuity. acism might e pre sent in ho rules are applied and also in hether rules are complied ith. e institution's goals and rules could e legitimate, ut administrators may ail to impartially apply and consistently comply ith these rules due to their (perhaps unconscious) racial prejudice. o maer the maniest unction o the institution, hen this distorting racist inuence is pervasive yet goes uncorrected y ocials, e are dealing ith a case o institutional racism.

is rameor, hich call *intrinsic* institutional racism, captures much o hat avis says hen she insists that prisons are a case o institutional racism. or instance, she claims, " ere are persisting structures o racism, economic and po liti cal structures that *do not openly display their discriminatory strategies*, ut nonetheless serve to eep communities o color in a state o ineriority and oppression" (emphasis added). he also says, "When e consider the disproportionate numer o people o color among those ho are arrested and imprisoned, and the ideological role that imprisonment plays in our lives, ant to suggest that the prison population in [the nited tates] provides vis i le evidence o ho is not alloed to participate in this democracy."

Given long- standing ste reo types aout so- called lac criminality, prisons are an especially ertile site or the reproduction o racist ideology and the operation o institutional racism. ndeed, avis has suggested that ecause o the orings o the racialied prison system in the nited tates since the all o ormal slavery, lacness and criminality have come to e eectively euated, stigmatiing all lac people (ut especially young lac men) and maing them vulnerale to police ause and incarceration regardless o hether they are actually guilty o any rongdoing. One might conclude then, on antiracist grounds, that prisons should e aolished rather than reormed.

is line o argument has much truth in it. Yet its implications or the reorm- versus- aolition deate are unclear. On one reading, avis is claiming that the ideological lin eteen lac (male) identity and criminality can e roen only y aolishing the prison system itsel (at least ithin the nited tates). no one goes to prison, then no one, including lac people, can e regarded as a "criminal." ut this can't e right. One could e thought to e a criminal even i one never goes to prison or is never even arrested, as as true o most victims o lynching and as the tragic recent examples orayvon Martin and hmaud rery sho. e racist ste reo type is that lac people are *disposed* to commit crimes, hich does not depend on their eing caught, charged, or caged. the lin eteen lacness and criminality is as strong as avis suggests, then ending imprisonment or crimes on't e sucient to rea the lin. or lac people to e ully ree o this orm o racism, not only ould the criminal justice system have to e aolished altogether ut the very idea o "crime"— that is, serious la reaing— ould have to e delegitimied or made osolete as ell.

ere is no dout that racially disparate imprisonment rates *reinforce* the ideological construct o the "lac criminal" and nourish the irrational ear o lac people. We should eep in mind, though, that racism operates in several institutional contexts, not just in the criminal justice system. nd ste reo types aout lac people eing stupid and lay have existed as long as (i not longer than) ste reo types aout lac people eing violent and criminal. chools, or example, are pervaded y ste reo types aout lac people's cognitive deciencies, and there is a stu orn racially mared academic achievement gap. Yet despite these la men ta le acts, e ould not call to aolish schools, only to improve them and mae them more euitale. or do e call or the aolition o jos or orplaces ecause o the ste reo type aout lac people eing indolent or the long- standing racial disparities in employment that might seem to lend credence to the ste reo type. or ould e see to aolish the institution o the amily on the grounds that there are stigmatiing ste reo types aout lac reproductive and parental irresponsiility and that lac amilies are disproportionately ragile and roen.

What this suggests is that charges o ideological and institutional racism can yield aolitionist conclusions only i the institution in uestion either is already irredeemaly unjust (that is, apart rom eing racist) or perorms no socially necessary unction. ese reections on other inds o institutions also suggest that, at least sometimes, e should devise ays to loc or limit the inluence o racial ideology and discriminatory practices ithin an institution rather than giving up altogether on the institution itsel.

deological and institutional racism are poer ul orces in prison systems in the nited tates and elsehere. Yet there are many ho are capale o sincerely rejecting racist elies and reraining rom acting on racial iases. acially prejudiced personnel— rom the top o an organ iation don to the oom rans— can e identied and replaced. acially discriminatory rules can e discovered, exposed, and discarded. us, uncovering the racism ithin existing prison systems, even hen such racism has a long history or is pervasive, is not suicient to estalish that prisons should e aolished rather than reormed.

#### unctional Explanation and njust ocial ystems o ar, have discussed some ays that the conseuences o imprisonment can e oppressive. have also considered ho latent unctions o prisons can e oppressive hen these unctions depend on either covert goals or discriminatory institutional practices. Yet the truly radical dimensions o avis's unctional critiue cannot e ully captured in these terms. or avis, the racial disparity in imprisonment and the racialiation o prisoners are not "incidental"eatures o cap i tal ist society (say, the result o la-enorcement ocials' correctale racial prejudice) ut a *necessary* conseuence o a cap i tal ist system ith roots in race ased slavery and colonialism. o see the ull implications o this idea, e must rely on a richer, ut also a more controversial, conception o unctional explanation.

e .. prison system is a vast netor o carceral institutions, hich includes ederal and state prisons, municipal and county jails, and juvenile and immigrant detention centers. is netor can operate only in conjunction ith other institutions— primarily legislative odies, la-enorcement agencies, courts, and parole or proation agencies. ere is great variation in incarceration rates and penal policy across states and regions o the country. is complex system o institutions is not one superagent ith cohesive plans and aims. t does not, nor can it, act with one mind. <sup>20</sup> Within any given subsystem, there will be officials and participants with conflicting goals and motives. Politicians, police officers, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, jurors, parole officers, prison administrators, and correctional officers often have divergent interests and ambitions. And they carry out their duties (whether conscientiously or poorly) in interaction not only with each other but also with persons suspected of crimes, persons accused of crimes, victims of crimes, witnesses, prisoners, and the formerly incarcerated. There is good reason to doubt that these diverse officials strategically coordinate their actions (or that they *could* coordinate their actions) to defend the interests of the ruling classes or white people. So, a functional critique of the U. S. prison system in terms of criminal justice officials' conscious but covert aims will be of limited value.

It might be more promising to attribute a *master function* to prisons: namely, that prisons serve to stabilize unjust social systems. The other functions attributed to prisons—racial domination, economic exploitation, political repression, obscuring social problems—are subsidiary or are to be understood in relation to this master function. Prisons perform this stabilizing function through, say, fostering racial division, incapacitating the most rebellious elements in society, deterring people from developing a revolutionary posture, protecting property claims from militant challenge, and so on.

The basic social-theoretic premise is that unjust modern societies are, by their nature, *unstable*. Thus, those that persist over time tend to develop and maintain prisons, which enable the survival of these oppressive social systems despite their inherent instability. To be sure, unjust social orders are not stabilized by penal regimes alone. Brute force is never sufficient. Ideologies also function to secure hierarchical and inegalitarian social systems. They do so by encouraging people not to question the system's legitimacy and by inducing the oppressed to believe that their obedience to law is not only prudent but morally required.

I think this framework fits much of what Davis says about the relation between prisons and unjust societies. For instance, she argues that the penal system functions as a weapon to preserve the status quo when resistance movements emerge to challenge the legitimacy of the social order. She also argues that the "overriding" function of the prison is not crime control but social control and political containment—the repression of "proclivities" to challenge legal regulations and the extraction of total obedience to the law, particularly property laws, which protect the assets of the ruling class. She also argues are supported to the law, particularly property laws, which protect the assets of the ruling class.

Now the mere fact that prisons are functional for unjust societies doesn't show that prisons exist *because* (let alone *only* because) they are functional for unjust societies. (Pencils are functional for scratching that part of our back that is hard to reach, but that's not why pencils exist or continue to be produced.) The beneficial consequences for a ruling class could be a mere accident, an unintended byproduct of a practice that exists for other purposes. So what more has to be established for the master-function claim to be truly explanatory?

One way of making good on a functional explanation is to identify a *feedback loop*, say, from an ideology or institution to a pattern of causal consequences and from these consequences back to the ideology or institution itself. The ideology or institution persists *because* it has consequences that reinforce or preserve it. In other words, the persistence of the ideology or the institution (or the persistence of both) is explained (at least in part) *by* the ideology's or institution's functional consequences.

Along these lines, Davis identifies a process she calls a "selfreproducing cycle."23 The prison, though not a belief system, can perform essentially the same function that ideologies do. An institution or social practice can serve an ideological function in that it can mislead us about or conceal important social facts. It can encourage or reinforce false beliefs about social reality, a misperception that can buttress an unjust status quo. In a society where racial ideology has currency, racially biased lawenforcement practices obscure the oppressive workings of capitalism. Capitalism creates joblessness, poverty, and desperation, which gives the oppressed an economic incentive to turn to the underground economy—the drug trade, prostitution, theft, robbery, illegal gambling, trafficking in stolen goods, and so on—and thus puts them at high risk for imprisonment. The long-standing and powerful stereotypes about black people as lazy and violent lead people to explain racial disparities in employment and imprisonment in terms of black people's moral failings, and the disparities themselves seem to "confirm" the stereotypes. Fear of the "black criminal" can appear to warrant strong retributive sentiments and to license practices of containment. <sup>24</sup> In this way, an ideology (racism) and an institution (the prison) can have social consequences that explain why the ideology and the institution persist.

#### The Limits of Functional Critique

Let's suppose prisons serve all the functions Davis attributes to them, including the master function of stabilizing unjust social orders. Still, I don't think we can conclude from this that we should end the practice of imprisonment. Why not? Well, we'd first have to see whether prisons also serve any legitimate and vital functions. If they do and there is no functional equivalent within reach, we may need to reform the prison (or other related features of the society) so that prisons have fewer of the pernicious consequences Davis identifies. Or we may, if feasible, effect social changes that eventually eliminate the *need* for prisons. (For example, if there is very little serious crime, then drastic law-enforcement efforts aren't necessary.) Put more tersely, abolition would follow from this functional critique alone only if either there is a viable functionally equivalent institution or set of practices with fewer bad consequences, or there is no legitimate function that prisons serve.

Recall that prisons, like many other institutions, are capable of performing more than one function, even under the same social conditions. In fact, functional critique does not rule out an institution serving both a latent function and its manifest function. Indeed, an institution could serve its oppressive functions *better* if it also achieves, to some extent, its official purpose. In that way, the institution's unjust structure wouldn't be readily apparent and so would be less likely to engender militant resistance. (Capitalism, for example, does produce many desirable consumer goods and services and enables some members of the working class to become wealthy.)

So the fact that imprisonment serves a racist, repressive, or exploitative function is compatible with it also serving to protect people from unjust aggression against their liberty, person, or possessions. Of course, the prison cannot serve these oppressive functions and still be *just*, even if it does manage to prevent some serious crime. And this is one reason why radical reform efforts, within the criminal justice system and elsewhere, are so urgently needed.

The abolitionist could concede that prisons serve multiple functions yet insist that we cannot have the legitimate manifest function of the prison (securing public safety) without its oppressive latent functions. What reason might we have to think this? Sometimes proponents of functional critique regard institutions (or at least some of them) as having an "ineradicable logic" or "essence" that is present whenever and wherever the institution in question exists. Let's consider this possibility with respect to prisons.

There's a weak sense in which an institution could have an essence: namely, its official purpose is one of its constitutive features. Incarceration is "imprisonment," strictly speaking, only if it is imposed as a crime-control measure. Otherwise the practice is something else, say, kidnapping or revenge. However, if the idea is that latent functions of an institution always remain intact regardless of changes in the institution's rules, procedures, social roles, or personnel and regardless of alterations in the surrounding social context, then the notion is not very plausible.

It is undeniable that an institution could have one set of consequences in circumstances $C_1$ but an entirely different, even incompatible, set of consequences in circumstances $C_2$ . Imagine, for instance, that $C_1$ is marked by severe racial and economic inequality but $C_2$ is not. An institution could be functional for more than one type of system, including just and unjust social systems. Schools—depending on what, whom, and how they teach and who does the teaching—are presumably functional both for capitalism and for socialism, for a highly unequal society and for an egalitarian one. A similar thing can be said about families and workplaces. So, as far as I can tell, we can't decide whether abolition is preferable to reform if all we know is that the relevant institution is functional for an oppressive system. Something more must be established.

Sticking with the idea that prisons have a master function, Davis could argue that racist, capitalist societies are actually homeostatic systems: their characteristic injustices endure because changes in one part of the system are adjusted for elsewhere such that oppression is maintained. Similar to the way that the human body adjusts to maintain body temperature and blood pressure, there are mechanisms that keep some groups stigmatized, exploited, and subordinated despite even dramatic shifts in the institutions of the society. The prison (like banishment, execution, and public torture in previous eras) might be thought to be one of these key mechanisms. Some unjust societies, on this account, are not just self-reproducing systems but self-adjusting systems.

The homeostatic thesis is a radical claim, one that is difficult to prove and may even be unfalsifiable. I'm not certain that Davis would endorse it. But some who emphasize the continuity between slavery, Jim Crow, and mass incarceration seem attracted to it. So, for the sake of argument, let's suppose the homeostatic thesis is true. What implications would it have for the reform-versus-abolition debate? I can think of two.

First, if an unjust society is really a homeostatic system, meaningful social change from *within* the system—that is, using socially accepted methods for bringing about social change—looks hopeless. Prison abolition, as a practical political aim, would likely have to be achieved using means that are widely condemned in the society. Homeostatic systems are composed o many interdependent and shifing parts and, despite their dynamism, have a tendency toard a relatively stale euili rium. o i the asic ele ments o the social system remain intact, e have no reason to elieve that the aolition o prisons ould stop a unctional euivalent rom emerging or prevent an adjustment elsehere in the system that rings it ac to the status uo.

econd, suppose the prison is not just one o many ele ments in the social system ut a *linchpin*— a ey piece that holds the system together. t is, let us say, euivalent to a vital organ in the human ody. n that case, anti- prison theory is most at home in a revolutionary po liti cal rameor, and the point o antiprison practice ould e to destailie the social system as a hole. On this ay o thining, the prison stands in the ay o meaningul social change and must e rought don or made inoperative i structural transormation is to occur. ndeed, some lac radicals regard prisoners (or some suset o them) as indispensale memers o the revolutionary orce ho, as po liti cal prisoners, must e lierated i the emancipatory eort is to succeed (see hapter ).

Hoever, this po liti cal vision shifs the ocus aay rom the prison as such to a deate over hether the society as a hole can e reormed or must e dismantled (perhaps orcily) and reconstituted on a undamentally di er ent asis. is is undenialy a uestion orth asing, one that raises the theoretical and practical staes consideraly. ut, on such a vision, prison aolition is essentially *tactical* and must then e assessed on grounds o practicality and lielihood o success versus alternative tactics. My primary concern in this oo is ith the radical po liti cal philosophy that treats a prison- ree society and orld, not as merely a strategic po liti cal aim, ut as a undamental moral ojective.

#### Moratorium on mprisonment

Let's set aside the homeostatic model o unctional critiue and its associated revolutionary tactics. avis could still argue that prisons have a strong *tendency* or *propensity* to e used or ad ends, at least ithin certain social environments. Just as salt has the dispositional property to dissolve in ater, prisons are disposed to contriute to oppression. On this account, prison re ormers are lie those ho say, "Guns don't ill people; people ill people." eormers contend that prisons can e used or good or ad purposes, depending on ho governs them and hether they are used responsily. is contention on the part o reormers, e must concede, is a hal- truth.

onsider the current social environment in many ealthy cap i tal ist socie ties, including the nited tates. Here, avis ould argue, e nd po liti cal poer and ealth concentrated in the hands o a small elite ho enet at the expense o the great majority. overty is deep and engenders despair, resentment, and shame. Many are rustrated and angry aout their lac o economic security and limited access to uality education. acial and other vis i le minorities are eared, despised, maligned, and routinely scapegoated. e general ethos is one o unridled amition, ruthless competition, and indierence to the suering o the most vulnerale. nsurprisingly, depression and drug ause are idespread. o is interpersonal vio lence and raud.

n such an environment, prisons, lie guns, are a menace. e people ho ould ield them (or, anyay, ar too many o them) are likely to do so irresponsibly or even maliciously. It is not that prisons are *inherently* dangerous or prone to abuse no matter the social environment. The social context matters enormously. In a racially stratified capitalist regime with immense socioeconomic inequality, low wages for the moderately skilled, and meager welfare entitlements for the poor and unemployed, we should *expect* incarceration to be widely abused and overused. The latent functions of imprisonment in the current unjust environment are, indeed, exploitation, political repression, and racial subjugation. Until we dramatically alter the social envi-

ronment within which prisons operate, we should, it could be argued, put a moratorium on the use of prisons.

Such a moratorium is not tantamount to abolition, because it would not rule out prisons for all time and in all places. Prisons could still be legitimate under certain circumstance or in some locales, particularly when the social order is just or nearly so. It would, however, entail regarding their current use in places like the United States as illegitimate and intolerable. This moratorium would be based on the injustice of background structural conditions, not on a condemnation of existing prison conditions. That is, it should be distinguished from a moratorium based on the inhumane conditions inside specific prisons. Where prison conditions drop below human rights requirements, prisoners should be moved or released until the prison in question has been suitably reformed and renovated. The kind of moratorium I have in mind is also different from a moratorium on building new prison facilities, which some abolitionists advocate too.<sup>25</sup> Although I would be against expanding the prison system or increasing the prison population in the United States, I would not necessarily oppose uilding a ne prison i it replaced one that as inhumane or unhaitale.

What am discussing no is a moratorium on the practice o imprisonment that ould e justied on grounds o systemic injustice. Were such a moratorium to e instituted in a par tic ular society, the an on imprisonment could e restricted to specic oenses or could include all oenses. e an could also e limited to certain jurisdictions (here, say, social injustices are particularly egregious), or it could encompass the hole o .. society. t the most radical end o the spectrum, the moratorium ould e society- ide and unrestricted as to oense. More limited moratoriums ould e restricted to certain locales or to specic oenses (or example, less serious ones).

e call or a moratorium on the practice o imprisonment has serious merit. the only legitimate purpose prisons served as rehailitation, prison's great dangers and its urdens on the oppressed ould pro aly e sucient to justiy even a radical moratorium. e tragic truth, though, is that in this same social environment and largely or the same reasons, the oppressed are vulnerale to violent aggression, not just rom the police and correctional ocers, ut also at the hands o ordinary citi ens, many ohom are oppressed themselves. t is the unjustly disadvantaged ho are most vulnerale to eing physically threatened, eaten, raped, or illed, sometimes y co- ethnics, neighors, riends, intimate partners, and even amily. s e aempt to transorm our socie ties and orld into something more just, e must tae due care to protect the vital interests o the oppressed. We may invite greater dangers or them y removing the limited means o protection— police and prisons that are availale, as trouling and racist as they typically are.

This problem—how best to reduce the burdens on the oppressed—makes me hesitant to embrace a radical moratorium on the use of prisons. The proponent of a radical moratorium would hold that until we transform our society into something considerably more just, the state should admit no new persons to prison and should release those now incarcerated, regardless of the crimes for which these persons have been convicted and regardless of whether there is reason to think they committed these crimes. We must, they would insist, rely exclusively on non-carceral alternatives to control crime, even when dealing with the most serious crimes.

Rejecting a radical prison moratorium does put me (and some abolitionists) in the uncomfortable position of having to countenance that prison's benefits (crime prevention and prisoner rehabilitation) may be, at least temporarily, worth the prison system's oppressive costs, including its contribution to reinforcing racism. Still, we might defend a less radical prison moratorium. If instituted, it could mitigate ideological and institutional racism, thus making the toleration of punitive incarceration under unjust conditions a less bitter pill to swallow.

Suppose we reserved prison primarily for those who commit the most serious and egregious crimes. Here I have in mind primarily crimes against the person—murder, rape, kidnapping, child abuse, sex trafficking, and aggravated assault. We might also include arson, great financial crimes (think Bernie Madoff), and cybercrimes that threaten democracy. These acts cannot be justified or excused even under deeply unjust circumstances, and they typically cause lasting trauma or significant and irreparable harm. When feasible, these wrongs must be prevented to protect the vital interests of the vulnerable. Other oenses should either e decriminalied altogether or, here criminaliation is arranted, carry lesser and non- carceral penalties (or example, nes, home connement, restitution, temporary loss o privileges, community ser vice, supervised pro ation, and electronic monitoring). Where incarceration is used, it should e joined ith rehailitative ser vices, educational opportunities, jo training, psychiatric and drug- ause treatment, and preparation or reentry into society.

When considering a moratorium on prison use, it is est to distinguish hat to do aout potential uture crime rom hat to do in response to crimes that have already happened. e limited moratorium position just descried concerns preventing oenses yet to occur, either using prison (in limited cases) or non- carceral penalties. is is a call or radical sentencing reorm and or a (temporary) halt to the use o punitive incarceration or minor and moderately serious crimes. n ovious corollary ould e moderate *decarceration*. a moratorium is arranted, then it ould also mae sense to release prisoners ho have not commied the most serious crimes (or example, those hose orst oense is a drug- related crime). ey could e treated as i they had ully served their time or, here necessary or pulic saety, alternative penalties could e imposed. nd these nely released persons should e eligile or rehailitative and reentry ser vices.

Many prison reormers elieve that the prison population in places lie the nited tates should e dramatically reduced and that the prison system should not e expanded. ey oppose mass incarceration and the structural injustices that led to it, ut they are not opposed to incarceration as such. ather than aolition, a restricted moratorium on the use o prisons could e the apt ay to express their vision. o, although am septical that the unctional critiue o prisons can justiy aolitionist conclusions, it can, thin, help us see the urgency, not only or undamental prison and sentencing reorm, ut also or roader structural reorm o society itsel.

#### Extrinsic nstitutional acism and enal olicy avis's analy sis o imprisonment as institutional racism oers isdom and insight. Yet hen cast as a unctional critiue, it cannot estalish that the eradication o prisons is morally re uired or even desirale. at said, a *modied* orm o this critiue could help estalish the need or a limited moratorium on prison use in the nited tates and elsehere. t can do so ithout relying on controversial unctional explanations and ithout insisting that there is alays a covert racist purpose ehind the practice o imprisonment.

lac radical thiners developed the concept o *institutional racism* to account or the act that racism can exert inuence in institutional contexts here ocials do not consciously hold or openly express racist elies and intentions. Earlier discussed *intrinsic* institutional racism, ith a ocus on covert goals and discriminatory practices. Hoever, institutional racism can also e *extrinsic*. n institution's policies can e racist, not only in virtue o the racist aitudes or goals o those ho mae and implement policy, ut also in virtue o the *consequences* o an institution's policies, even hen these conseuences are unintended or unoreseen.

Extrinsic institutional racism occurs hen oicials use a policy that is race- neutral in content and pulic justication ut nevertheless has a significant or disproportionately negative impact on a disadvantaged racial group. Those who make and apply the policies need not intend this result and may not themselves harbor racist attitudes. The institution's practices are nonetheless wrong, because they perpetuate the negative effects of ongoing or past racist actions and because they thereby encourage racist attitudes and stereotypes.

Some social groups are already disadvantaged by racism, and an institution that is not intrinsically racist may still play a role in reinforcing the oppression of these groups. These detrimental effects can lead some to believe that the disadvantaged occupy their low social station because of their own moral failings or inherent inferiority, inviting the conclusion that they (rather than the social structure) should be blamed for any failure to flourish. The institution may not itself be responsible for the group's prior disadvantages, and the racism the institution is complicit with may be extrinsic to the institution itself. Nevertheless, corrective justice—the principles that govern how we should respond to and rectify injustice—may demand that the public actively seek to reverse or mitigate these oppressive institutional effects. This reduction or shift in the weight of oppression could be achieved through the implementation of policies that would have a less adverse effect on disadvantaged racial groups.

Davis thinks that the destructive power of the "black criminal" notion—an ideological idea—cannot be defused unless we abolish prisons. In the United States, black people are disproportionately locked up, and this might continue to be the case even if intrinsic institutional racism within the criminal justice system were eradicated. After all, joblessness, poverty, and educational disadvantage are strongly correlated ith criminal oending, and lac people are disproportionately unemployed, poor, and educationally disadvantaged. part o the orry is that racial disparities in imprisonment seem to "con rm" ste reo types aout lac criminality, therey reinorcing antilac ideology, then eliminating or reducing these disparities ould seem lie a logical response. e uestion is hether the criminal justice system should play a role in this.

, as avis maintains, the practice o imprisonment urther marginalies racially stigmatied and disadvantaged social groups, this is a reason to change penal policy even i incarcerating lac people ho commit crimes is not inherently racist and prisons actually prevent crime. e could secure a reasonale level o pulic saety ithout increasing the urdens on the oppressed or reinorcing negative racial ste reo types, then e should opt or these less harmul policies. n par tic u lar, i it could e shon that relying largely on non- carceral policies ould adeuately control crime ut ith less adverse impact on racially stigmatied groups, then a prison moratorium ( hether radical or limited) might e justied or even morally reuired.

e asic idea is this. We should or to correct the structural injustices that engender crime *and* lighten the penalties on oppressed oenders here pos si le even i this ould cost the pulic a lot more than simply relying on incarceration alone, and even i this ould mean, at least in the short term, that e all must live ith somehat higher levels o crime.

#### **CHAPTER 4**

## The Prison Industrial Complex: Profit, Privatization, and the Circumstances of Injustice

Some abolitionists call for the dismantling of the "prison industrial complex." This form of abolition is in many ways insightful and appealing, for reasons I will discuss. Yet as a critique of punitive incarceration it also has serious limitations. After laying out these insights and shortcomings, I want to offer a defense of the use of nonprofit prison privatization in limited contexts—that is, in societies that, while maintaining some degree of legitimacy, are marred by serious structural injustices.

Some otherwise sympathetic to the abolitionist cause stop short of calling for a complete ban on prisons. They allow that incarceration—whether as detention, rehabilitation, punishment, or incapacitation—has (or at least could have) a legitimate public function. Yet they are deeply troubled by the ways that privatization, commerce, and profit figure in many prison systems, particularly those in the United States. Thus, taking inspiration rom ngela avis, they call or an end to the prison industrial complex, though not necessarily to prisons as such. ose commied to a more radical aolitionist vision see the complete eradication o prisons as a long- term ojective ut sometimes treat the aolition o the prison industrial complex as an intermediate goal. ecoupling incarceration rom cap i tal ist enterprise is, or them, a necessary step toard a prison- ree orld.

One o avis's core ojections to incarceration is that, as generally practiced, it is an immoral usion o in eec tive state crime- control mea sures, the privatiation o pulic unctions, and the maximiation o corporate prot. avis sees to aolish prisons partly ecause she vies them as components o a vast and destructive "prison industrial complex."is designation, she tells us, is meant to dra aention to the act that prison construction, oner ship, administration, and ser vices, along ith prison laor, aract large amounts o private capital, and that commercial proit rom prisons is a driver o mass incarceration.

n using the expression "prison industrial complex," avis is doing more than highlighting the commercial unctions o carceral practices. he is maing ovious connections ith the "military industrial complex."e moneymaing dimension is a ig part o the moral indictment, as is the tendency o oth complexes to rely on "security" as ideological justication. rison systems and the military also use similar technology, and there are military prisons. ut there are to urther dimensions to avis's critiue. e rst is the act that prisons ofen unction as machinery o ar and as means o po liti cal repression, as discussed in hapter . e second is the act that the practice o imprisonment (hich necessarily relies on police ocers and prison guards) is an inherently violent enterprise. is as discussed in hapter hen considered justications or preventative harm and set aside pacism as a asis or prison aolition. o, the dimension o the prison industrial complex yet to e considered is the connection eteen incarceration and cap i tal ist enterprise, or, as avis sometimes puts it, the "usiness- government linages" in the penal system.

#### ncarceration as etention s discussed, incarceration has several purposes. have mainly ocused on incarceration hen its purpose is punitive— that is, to penalie those convicted o crimes. o eer grasp aolitionist ojections to the prison industrial complex, the use o incarceration as pretrial detention (or hat might e eer called "preconviction detention") must e addressed.

Let's distinguish to pretrial periods. irst, there is the period directly afer arrest, hen la- enorcement agents tae a suspect (perhaps against their ill) into custody or uestioning or to ace ormal charges, ut prior to ormal charges eing rought and prior to a ormal plea on the part o the accused. e accused ill e incarcerated during this period, hich ideally should e rie (hours or days; not ees or months, certainly not years). econd, there is the period directly afer a ormal plea o "not guilty" ut prior to a trial to determine guilt. (is is "pretrial detention" strictly speaing.)

ere are to plausile justications or detention in jail. e rst is that there are strong reasons to elieve that the accused ill not appear or trial or hearings or (hat amounts to the same) ill reuse to sumit to accountaility mea sures. e second is that there are strong reasons to believe that the accused is a serious danger to others and therefore incapacitation is warranted.

It is worth noting that to completely abolish incarceration as pretrial detention would mean that the public would have to rely on voluntary compliance with court orders and that the police would be prohibited from forcibly arresting suspects, even those accused of the most serious crimes and those known to be highly dangerous. If there are less harmful alternatives that would adequately ensure that the accused will submit to accountability measures (for instance, cash bail, supervised release, or electronic monitoring), then these would be preferable to incarceration. There may be some question about the costs of these alternatives (and who should pay them) that would make incarceration preferable and defensible. But I will largely leave this issue aside.

Now these non-carceral alternatives could lead to exploitation in commercial bail agreements and profit from electronic monitoring technology. There are opponents of the prison industrial complex who want to abolish commercial bail services and even cash bail itself. Under current circumstances, there is the worry that this could lead to more people in jail (and for longer) or to greater electronic monitoring and thus greater state surveillance, which some abolitionists, including Davis, also oppose. Some might argue, though, that if cash bail as a practice is permissible, prohibiting commercial bail would be an unfair interference with personal liberty. Why shouldn't the accused (or their family or friends) be permitted to make a contract with another private actor to share the cost and risk of bail?

If bail were always set at a cost the accused could be expected to pay relying solely on their own personal financial resources, commercial ail ouldn't e necessary. ail might e reasonaly set, though, on the assumption that riends or amily ill help ith the costs. When such voluntary nancial assistance is orthcoming, this not only suggests that the accused has strong ties to the community (and so is unliely to ee the jurisdiction) ut also that riends or amily memers are con dent that the accused ill appear or trial and hearings (or could e rought to do so through persuasion or inormal pressure). the deault assumption is that riends and amily ill help, then it is not unreasonale (and perhaps ise) to sometimes set ail somehat eyond the personal means o the accused.

Yet, the act that a person lacs riends or amily ith the resources or reuisite trust doesn't mean the person on't sho up or trial. 'm inclined to thin that such a person should pro aly e permied to use commercial ail ser vices, as this may e their only means to assure the court that they ill mae court appearances hen called. ail- ond agent ould e unliely to mae such an agreement, though, i they laced the poer o arrest (or at least o electronic monitoring and collateral conscation). Other ise, commercial ail ser vice companies ould run an unreasonaly high ris o deault, perhaps maing the enterprise unprotale or very liely to ail. ese companies are eectively assuring the court that they ill ensure that the accused ill appear in court. ey are therey exercising the euivalent o policing poers, despite eing private organ iations.

e advocate or the aolition o the prison industrial complex might insist that the pulic ully cover the costs o electronic monitoring, supervised release, and la enorcement to ensure that the accused appears in court. is ould eliminate the need for bail altogether (though some among the accused may prefer bail to electronic monitoring) and therefore limit the financial burdens on the accused and their loved ones and reduce the extent to which criminal justice is a commercial enterprise. I find this position compelling.

Indeed, the abolitionist could go further. Where the criminal justice system is fair and widely believed to be so (which is not the case in the United States), we should expect citizens to appear for trial when the public (through its official representatives) has accused them of committing crimes. It should be mutually understood to be their civic responsibility and moral duty. Accordingly, it could be argued that since the accused has yet to be convicted, the presumption of innocence suggests that neither jail nor bail nor electronic monitoring is warranted unless there are overwhelming reasons to believe the accused represents a grave danger to the public and thus needs to be temporarily incapacitated. Given that the U. S. system of criminal law is not entirely fair, there is even stronger reason to abandon bail as a mechanism of accountability.

#### Prison, Privatization, and Profit

One way to argue for the abolition of the prison industrial complex is to focus critical attention, not so much on prisons, but on capitalism. For instance, the critic of the prison industrial complex could argue that capitalism is an oppressive social system—say, unjust, undemocratic, dehumanizing, or exploitative—and so its basic institutions (such as private ownership of productive assets, wage labor, markets, and private finance) should be dismantled and replaced. On anti-capitalist grounds, it would also e natu ral to oppose the prison industrial complex, as it necessarily relies on and is enmeshed ith cap i tal ist practices and products. n this ay, there is a direct road rom a critiue o capitalism to the demand to aolish the prison industrial complex.

ut this ground o opposition ould apply to *many* institutions and organ iations— not only prisons and the military ut also schools, hospitals, ans, nes organ iations, communication netors, mass transportation, homes or the el derly, and even the amily. e thesis that the prison industrial complex should e aolished ould then just e a theorem derived rom the more general claim that *capitalism* should e aolished. n institution that necessarily depends upon and operates through an inherently unjust practice could never e ully legitimate and ould e morally tainted y its association ith the oppressive practice. risons ouldn't e special in that regard; and the primary critical tas ould e to convince septics that no orm o capitalism is compatile ith true human reedom— hich, on one plausile interpretation, as Marx's aim in *Capital*.

Yet avis and other aolitionists have ojections to the prison industrial complex apart rom their general ojections to capitalism. ey are also concerned ith ho prisons interact ith or are shaped y capitalism, and these concerns ill e my ocus. o isolate these specic orries, eeping them distinct rom opposition to capitalism itsel, shall assume that capitalism is not inherently unjust. o e clear, am not assuming that *existing* cap i tal ist practices are just, ar rom it. assume only— and here primarily or the sae o argument— that there is a realistic orm o capitalism that ould e compatile ith a stale, just, and demo cratic society.

o gain urther clarity aout hat, morally speaing, is at issue, e need to mae explicit the meaning o some relevant terms. *Privatization* is the pro cess y hich a property or enterprise goes rom eing government oned (or pulicly oned) to eing privately oned. rivatiation can involve to types o rights transer: the transer o *owner ship rights* to assets (such as land, acilities, vehicles, or machinery) and the transer o *operating rights* to an enterprise (say, the prerogative to provide certain goods or ser vices). ometimes a pulic unction (or instance, la enorcement, education, transportation, or sanitation) is carried out, at least in part, y a private organ iation rather than a government agency or pulic- service employees. is *outsourcing* arrangement is acilitated y pulic- private contracts and needn't involve the transer o oner ship rights. ulic institutions also ofen mae use o *private suppliers* or goods and resources needed to carry out relevant pulic unctions, ut ithout turning over any oner ship or operating rights.

rivate organ iations can e or- prot or nonprot. *Prot* is a nancial enet that is realied hen the amount o revenue gained rom a usiness enterprise exceeds the costs (including taxes) needed to sustain the enterprise. e primary purpose or goal o or- prot organ iations is to secure prot. e rely on cap i tal ist princi ples, any prot that is gained through the enterprise elongs to the usiness's oners, ho are ree to decide hat to spend it on (or example, reinvestment in the enterprise, stocs or onds, personal consumption, donation, and loying) and ree to save it or uture use.

nonprot private organ iation exists or purposes other than generating prot, such as serving a community, advancing a cause, or eneting the general pulic. lthough the organiation's memers may e concerned ith revenue, costs, dets, and eciency, they are concerned aout these nancial maers only insoar as they ear on eeping the organ iation operating, expanding it, or maing it operate eer. Memers o a nonprot do not on stoc in the organ iation and thus have no claim on nancial enets ased on oner ship rights. onpro its are also oten (though not alays) mission- driven, and thereore mae decisions to advance their mission on grounds hich their or- prot counter parts may not tae into account.

 *Labor compensation* is di er ent rom prot. lthough oth can serve as motives and reards, laor compensation is a nancial enet derived rom providing a ser vice or doing some tas. t is payment in exchange or actual or. uch payment can e given to a pulic- service employee oring or a government agency or to an employee oring or a private organiation (prot or nonprot). Employees are ree to decide hat to spend their compensation on (or instance, stoc, consumption, gifs, loying, and so on) and may save it or uture use. e distinction eteen commercial prot and laor compensation is meant to mar the dierence eteen deriving a nancial enet rom *owner ship* and deriving it rom *work*.

With these distinctions in mind, e can more readily see that ojections to the prison industrial complex can tae a variety o orms. leave aside ojections on grounds o costeectiveness and ocus on moral ojections. or instance, a concern could e that some private organ iations are rongly earning prot rom prisons. Or the ojection might e to granting administrative poer over prisoners to private organiations. Or perhaps the issue is hich specic prison unctions are eing outsourced to the private sector. Or the concern may e over oner ship rights, hich is its on orm o poer, a type o poer that, hen it comes to prisons, is perhaps only legitimately held y the pulic.

#### orruption, Wrongul Gain, and erverse ncentives gain, assume, ith avis, that *retribution* or rongdoing is not a legitimate pulic unction.at is, on't rely on the premise that those ho commit crimes *deserve* to suer and that the state has the rightul authority to use incarceration to ensure they endure this suering. ut on one inuential vie, and the one avor, the ocial unction or principal purpose o prisons (lie other la- enorcement institutions) is to provide security to the pulic y preventing and controlling crime— that is, y eeping crime ithin tolerale levels so that every one's asic lierties and rightul possessions are adeuately secured. e provision o this essential pulic good is a undamental state responsiility. ndeed, on some accounts, it is the primary justication or governmental authority and or the state's claim on a monopoly over the use o coercion.

avis claims, hoever, that or- prot companies in the prison industry do not actually see to provide security ut only to mae money or shareholders. e real or latent unction o these institutions is to amass private ealth under the ideological cover o providing a necessary pulic good. rison privati ation is, in eect, a *scam*— a ay to accumulate private capital using pulic unds (and sometimes using prison laor) and on the pretext o maing an essential contriution to pulic saety.

is critiue reaches eyond the amiliar charge that cap i tal ists are greedy and indierent to the human costs o their enterprises. t is an ojection to neolieral governance, in par tic u lar to pulic-private contracts to carry out pulic unctions. Governments mae contracts ith private companies in prison- related industries. resumaly, these contracts ould not e reneed unless government ocials ere satised ith the ser vices provided (assuming there is sucient competition or government contracts). is suggests that these ocials (and perhaps the institutions ohich they are a part) are *corrupt*, that they are colluding ith usinesses that prot rom pulic revenue ithout providing the relevant pulic good. or- prot companies ofen engage in loying eorts that exacerate the pro lem o corruption among pulic ocials. ey also sometimes participate in misinormation campaigns to mislead the pulic and therey say it in their avor. have no dout aout the reality or seriousness o these pro lems o corruption. Yet here authorities clearly *misuse* carceral institutions and *abuse* their poer to mae and implement crime- control policies. omething similar happens in the arenas o education, health care, and housing.

Hoever, a similar orm o corruption can occur ithin a holly pulic prison system. ulic ocials, too, can e indi erent to hether prisons help to secure pulic saety. eir chie concern is sometimes eeping their jos (along ith the compensation, poer, and status aached to their positions). nd it is not just high- level pulic ocials ho have motives that could undermine pulic unctions. Loer- level pulicservice employees may e similarly motivated. or instance, prison- guard unions have a nancial stae in eeping prisons open and ull regardless o hether this ould prevent crime or rehailitate prisoners. onseuently, they may e tempted to deend the need or draconian sentences. ey also have an incentive to resist managerial or technological innovations that ould ease the urdens on prisoners ut reduce the need or correctional ocers.

Unfortunately, the broader public often fails to check these abuses. Citizens might not hold these officials and public employees accountable for their poor performance and unethical conduct because they lack the power to do anything about it, or because they don't know about the corruption, or because they are insufficiently concerned about the problem, perhaps because they lack sympathy for those convicted of felonies.

The vice of being indifferent to whether a public good is adequately provided can afflict public institutions and private organizations. Whenever it is possible to continue acquiring benefits regardless of the quality of the goods or services provided, we should not be surprised if some fail to carry out these responsibilities in good faith and in a conscientious way. Private organizations hardly have a monopoly on institutional corruption. Such corruption should be exposed and ended, which requires being vigilant in both the public and the private sector.

But let's suppose the relevant private organizations actually provide adequate services and products in a cost-effective way. Would the fact that profit is their motive and reward be sufficient reason to prohibit the practice of privatizing prisons? Davis thinks so, and for two reasons. She objects to the *source* of these profits, namely, the intentional deprivation of freedom and imposition of hardships on prisoners and their families. She also thinks that the *profit motive* undermines the effective provision of public goods (in this case, security) and is a strong incentive to maintain horrid prison conditions (as a cost-cutting measure to maximize profit).

The first concern—the unsavory source of profit—suggests that the relevant principle is that *no one should gain financially* 

*om the suering caused by imprisonment*. Yet even i prisons ere constructed, maintained, and administered solely y pulic- service employees, these employees' laor ould e (and should e) compensated and so they ould gain nancially rom the suering o inmates and their loved ones.

erhaps the ojection is not to air compensation or necessary or ut rather to proting rom oner ship o prison- industry rms. e distinction eteen prot and laor compensation doesn't appear to help, though, ecause at least some nancial gain rom property rights ould appear to e permissile in this domain. or example, prisons need supplies and resources ood, clothes, edding, medical supplies, euipment, technology, toiletries, uel, and so on— that, in a cap i tal ist society, ill e provided, at least partially, y or- proit organ iations. e oners or shareholders o these companies ill thereore prot rom prisoners' suering and curtailed reedom. ndeed, incarceration maes capital gains pos si le or at least some employees o pulic prisons, or they (at least the more highly paid among them) can use a portion o their pay to uy shares in companies, and this oner ship may yield nancial enets. lthough somehat indirect, this too ould e proting rom the suering caused y incarceration.

slightly di er ent under lying princi ple is this: *No one should prot om the harmful wrongdoing of others*, in this case, rom the serious crimes o prisoners. gain, this is overly road, and or the same reasons as eore. Medical personnel and hospitals do no rong hen they expect to e paid or treating victims o serious crimes. nd a private com pany reasonaly expects to turn a prot rom the sale o its goods and ser vices used in such medical treatment.

t could e maintained that one is permied to prot rom others' harmul rongdoing ut *only if in so doing one also contributes to repairing the harm, redressing the wrong, or preventing further such wrongdoing*. is might explain the moral acceptaility o the medical case. ut a private prison that contains convicted serious oenders ill usually satisy this condition as ell.

sounder princi ple ould e something lie this: *One should not seek to prot om suering caused by injustices one has perpetrated.*n other ords, it is rong to act so as to prot rom one's *own* harmul rongdoing. One might inadvertently prot rom a rong one has commied, ut one may not act rongly so as to prot rom the rong. is is idely and rightly regarded as impermissile. elieve avis is on rm ground here. o the extent that a corporation is lameorthy or creating or perpetuating crime, it should not turn this rongdoing to its advantage y proting rom prisons. ill return to this point.

avis's second concern ith prot rom prisons is that it creates *perverse incentives*— namely, practical reasons to loc up people and to impose long sentences even hen this on't prevent crime. t is a morally unacceptale situation hen there exist operative reasons to impose unnecessary suering. n response to this legitimate orry, reormers could insist that arrests, indictments, verdicts, sentencing, parole, and release decisions e made only y those ithout a nancial stae in the outcome o those decisions (and perhaps ho can't e hired or red y someone ith such a stae). ey might also maintain that government ocials ho regulate or oversee the prison industry should e prevented rom having a nancial stae in that industry. ese reorm eorts ould e directed toard reducing conicts o interest eteen actors in prison- related rms and the aim o air and humane crime prevention. o reasonale and honest deender o prison privatiation elieves that the corrections industry should e ree to operate ithout pulic oversight and government regulations.

is response, hoever, is not entirely adeuate, as the pro lem runs deeper. ere is in act a second perverse incentive: to eep the costs o prison administration as lo as pos si le so as to increase prots. is incentive can lead to limiting or cuing educational, vocational, health care, psychiatric, or rehailitation ser vices. t can lead to unsanitary environmental conditions, lo- uality or unhealthy ood, and prisoner overcroding. t can lead to reducing correctional sta to dangerously lo levels or to hiring the cheapest orers availale ithout due regard or their competence and commitment to doing the jo ell.

e cost- cuing pro lem can negatively aect the administration o pulic prisons, too. ulic revenue is limited. udgetary considerations (including pulic det and decits) can lead to the elimination o valuale prison programs and the hiring o inadeuate sta. nd the pulic, given its usual contempt or prisoners and emrace o retriutive aitudes, may not support greater spending or higher taxes to improve the lives and saety o prisoners, thus placing a demo cratic constraint on hat pulic ocials may do to improve prisons. o the incentive to eep costs don ( hether to increase prot margins or to stay ithin ud getary constraints) is poerul and pre sent or pulic and private organ iations.

Hoever, the incentive to cut costs, even or vital goods and ser vices, is *inherent* in or- prot enterprises. ere is no ay to eliminate it. e pulic can only try through government oversight and regulation to prevent corporations rom acting on the incentive in ays that compromise the provision o adeuate pulic goods and ser vices. y contrast, the pulic could e convinced on grounds o justice, human rights, or pulic saety—to spend more money on prisons and prison ser vices. is is one reason to preer pulic prisons over privatied or- prot prisons.

ere is another reason to preer pulic prisons over privatied or- prot prisons. ot only do or- prot private prisons have no incentive to rehailitate prisoners or to reduce recidivism. ey have an incentive to *promote* crime and criminality. reating prison conditions that mae prisoners more liely to reoend once released or more liely to violate prison rules that extend their prison stay is actually good or usiness. nsoar as or- prot prisons exacerate the crime pro lem in this ay, they prot rom suering caused y their on unjust actions. (ecall our earlier princi ple: *One should not seek to prot om suering caused by injustices one has perpetrated.*) e injustices at issue are encouraging criminal activity and complicity in any suseuent crime. e temptation to engage in such rongdoing might e so strong and the resulting harms so enormous that it ould e eer not to run the ris o using or- prot private prisons. e general pulic is not suject to such temptation. t sees cost- eective ays to limit crime. Ecient crime control means not only greater pulic saety ut also more pu lic resources or things lie schools, hospitals, and pars.

t could e argued that the pro lem is not so much proting rom prison oner ship or prison administration as it is proting rom prison *labor*. rivate companies do sometimes contract ith the state to gain access to cheap prison laor ( hether in a pulic or private prison). Yet here inmates can reuse to or or private companies ithout incurring penalty, the act that a private com pany prots rom prison laor isn't in itsel unjust— *unless capitalism is unjust*. Many non- incarcerated persons, to meet their material needs, see employment rom or- prot companies that pay lo ages.

erhaps Marx as right that age laor under capitalism is a orm o slavery— dehumaniing servitude under despotic rule. ut i so, prison laor that enets private rms ould e an instance o a much more idespread unjust practice that occurs inside and outside prison alls, not a distinctive orm o oppression. nd, again, our call should thereore e or the aolition o *capitalism*, not the aolition o prisons, except insoar as they are part o the cap i tal ist system. n any case, prot can e secured rom prisons ithout extracting it directly rom prison laor. hus, ending prison laor or raising prisoner ages, though perhaps elcome on other grounds, ill not aolish the prison industrial complex.

One motive or the privatiation o a pulic unction is to eaen or ga nied laor, hich eeps ages lo. is is an o jectionale ay to reduce pulic expenses, or it leaves orers vulnerale to exploitation and rongly reduces the value o their asic lierties. t is clear that government can save money y relying on private companies partly ecause these companies unairly sueee laor (including prohiiting or undermining unions). ut reorm seems pos si le here, too. Governments could get some o the advantages o agreements ith private companies (or example, eciency due to specialiation and economies o scale) hile only contracting the ser vices o vendors ith air laor practices, including respecting the right o orers to or ga nie and strie.

Hoever, avis opposes pulic prisons that rely on orprot companies or *any* goods and ser vices. nd she extends her critiue to domains eyond la enorcement. he argues that there are certain vital pulic goods— security, education, shelter, and health care— that should e availale to every one on the asis o *need* alone and that providing these goods shouldn't depend on hether doing so ould also turn a prot. rivate or- prot companies should play no role in the provision o these pulic goods, on her account. ereore, these pulic ser vices, she argues, must e moved entirely to the pulic sector.

nd this idea appealing, yet it is dicult to see ho a nonsocialist government could ensure universal access to education, health care, and housing ithout extensive reliance on or- prot companies. ome o the personnel, supplies, technology, vehicles, and acilities needed to provide these goods and ser vices ould have to come rom the or- prot private sector. Just consider hat it taes to uild and maintain a single high school— one or more uildings, hundreds o oos, computers, dess, chairs, electricity, ood, clean ater, la euipment, sporting euipment, art supplies, cleaning supplies, maintenance euipment, medical supplies, and so on. o avoid reliance on or- prot companies completely, the government ould have to tae over almost the entire economy just to ensure that all children have access to a decent school. t the very least, the government ould have to enale, support, and rely exclusively upon nonproit orer cooperatives. Hoever, this ould mae avis's opposition to privatiation— hether o prisons or anything else— just a conseuence o her opposition to capitalism. t ouldn't have to do ith prisons per se.

#### onprot rison rivatiation e critiue o the prison industrial complex— again, hen not simply a general expression o anti- capitalism—is est regarded as principled opposition to structural injustice.at is, it is concerned, not aout privatiation o carceral unctions as such, ut aout privatiation in the context o a ide range o serious social injustices, rom economic and racial injustice to gender injustice and undemocratic practices. nder the current unjust acground social conditions, a scheme o cooperation eteen the pulic penal system and the corporate orld is deeply orrisome, even rightening. uch a collaoration has many perils that are dicult, i not impossile, to limit adeuately through government regulation and pulic accountaility mea sures. Moreover, the continuing reliance on or- prot private prisons is liely to urther erode pulic trust in the criminal justice system, hich needs to eidely accepted as legitimate i it is to e eective at crime control. o maintain or regain po liti cal legitimacy, justice in criminal la must not only e upheld ut must e *seen* to e upheld. ransparency and accountaility are crucial here, and commercial mechanisms and the prot motive can inhiit, i not undermine, these demo cratic ends.

otice, hoever, that the choice is not limited to pulicly oned, ully government- operated prisons or private or- prot prisons. here is also the possiility o a nonproit private organ iation administering and perhaps oning a prison a cil i ty. rison privatiation *without prot* could e a viale option under certain special, although not uncommon, circumstances.

uch an unusual and perhaps uixotic proposal immediately raises a e uestions. irst, ho, practically speaing, ould such an arrangement or econd, hy thin this arrangement ould e etter, rom a moral point o vie, than the alternatives— pulic prisons, private or- prot prisons, or no prisons at all nd third, under hat circumstances might this pulic- nonprot arrangement e justied ell- unded private organ iation commied to protecting the interests o a vulnerale population or to promote the pu lic good could mae a contract ith a government (local, state, or ederal) to tae over some core carceral unctions. mong these unctions are ensuring prisoner saety (rom others' aggression and sel- harm), health care (including mental- health care), nutrition and physical tness, maintenance and sanitation, prisoner supervision and perimeter security, discipline or prison- rule violations, acilitating in- person and remote interaction eteen prisoners and their amilies and riends, and educational and vocational ser vices.

nonprot private incarceration a cili ty could also e used to hold those charged ith crimes ut not yet convicted. gain, pretrial detention is overused, and ail is sometimes set too high and ofen completely unnecessary. ut to the extent that such mea sures are needed to ensure accountaility or incapacitation, private jails could e used hen ail is denied, cannot e raised, or is reused y the accused. e private organ iation could e held responsile or custodial care and or ensuring that prisoners appear or trial. his ould e unctionally euivalent to holding a private entity nancially liale (through oreiting their ond payment) or hen the accused ails to appear in court.

ome might oject to permiing private agents to use coercion or vio lence against prisoners, insisting that the use o orce should never e delegated rom the pulic to a private actor. Let's assume this position is sound. t ould not rule out nonprot, private prison administration and ser vices. e enorcement o a prison's perimeter (to prevent escape and unauthoried entry) and the use o orce to ensure saety, order, and discipline could remain exclusively in the hands o state agents, that is, pulic employees trained and ocially authoried to play this role. e remaining unctions ould e in the hands o a private organ iation and its employees and volunteers, suject o course to pulic rules and accountaility. is ould e similar to other private organ iations (or example, private universities and hospitals) that rely on the police or certain purposes or under certain circumstances.

o let's assume that some coercive unctions can e legitimately outsourced or privatied. ( fer all, physical orce *is* sometimes used in private psychiatric hospitals and schools.) o the extent that private security is relied upon, such personnel could e reuired to receive specialied and pulicly approved training and to go through psychological evaluation and acground checs. erhaps all correctional ocers in the private organ iation should e reuired to pass certain tests and to secure a license to serve in this capacity. is is already true o medical personnel ho or in prisons (pulic or private).

o reduce reliance on coercion and vio lence in the a cil i ty, it might e ise to permit only nonviolent oenders to e admied to a private prison. Or prisoners convicted o violent crimes could e permied ut only i they are appropriate or a minimum- , lo- , or perhaps medium- security prison. or example, some prisoners, convicted o violent crimes long ago, are no el derly or inrm and pose no ris to others. Or prisoners serving a sentence for a violent crime may have shown themselves to be no danger to other prisoners or prison staff. But all prisoners who, for reasons of custodial care or security, are best held in a maximum-security facility could be excluded from private prisons.

If the major administrative and service roles within the prison were undertaken by the nonprofit organization and the prison itself was owned either by the organization or the public, this would effectively eliminate the problems of wrongful financial profit and profit as a perverse incentive. The organization would not be in violation of the principle that no one should seek to profit from suffering caused by their own unjust acts, because it would not be seeking to profit from the enterprise at all. Neither those who own nor those who run the prison would have a right or duty to maximize profit or shareholder gains. Unlike the for-profit prison industry, nonprofit prisons would have no financial incentive to increase crime rates, recidivism, or societal punitiveness. They could concern themselves with money matters only insofar as this was necessary to ensure the continuance of the prison. They could carry out the entire operation at cost, folding any budget surplus into improving prison conditions, services, and administration.

To reduce the risk of impropriety and corruption, the private organization could have an all-volunteer board with no members who have a stake in prison-related industries. Paid staff could be kept to a minimum. Participation from affected communities could be encouraged or even required. Of course, it might be difficult for a nonprofit organization (or even a group of such organizations) to raise sufficient funds to build a prison facility, or to buy or rent the land on which a prison would sit.

Hoever, the pulic could on the land and acilities and the prison could e operated (in hole or in part) y a private organ iation. e pulic- private arrangement ould concern prison administration and ser vices on pulic property, not prison construction or the renting o private property. is, too, should reduce concerns aout intrusions rom corporate actors and the corrupting inuence o the prot motive.

nonprot private prison ould secure part o its unding rom the pulic and so ould e suject to pulic accountaility mea sures. ut it ould also secure some o its unding rom private donations. is ould enale concerned memers o the community to help shape the leadership, goals, and operation o the institution, rather than relying exclusively on state ureaucracy and usiness interests. ese private donors could, or example, aim to satisy higher standards or custodial care than pulic prisons are reuired to. ey could oer more or eer ser vices to prisoners, including educational, vocational, medical, drug- treatment, and reentry ser vices.

or those deeply concerned aout the plight o disadvantaged lac, Latinx, and indigenous peoples in the nited tates (social groups ho are disproportionately incarcerated) ut septical that existing governments can e trusted to secure adeuate custodial care or prisoners rom these populations, this pulic- private arrangement could e an ave nue or community control over central ele ments o la enorcement. t could also e a ay to address unacceptale prison conditions. this is correct, then some outsourcing o penal unctions could e enecial to the oppressed.

ose ho call or aected communities to play a signicant role in crime control, including civilian oversight o the police, cannot consistently maintain that la-enorcement unctions, to e legitimate, must e carried out entirely y pulic- service employees. unjustly disadvantaged communities are to e truly empoered in the criminal justice arena, then they must possess eective private organ iations that can counteract auses o state poer and reduce institutional corruption. nonprot, justice- promoting organ iation that could in a id to run a jail or prison could play this role.

n suggesting a role or private nonprot prisons, am *not* claiming that a just society ould permit these pulic unctions to e moved to the private sector. is is a tentative proposal or nonideal conditions— or the circumstances o *injustice*. When social conditions are grossly unjust and the state lacs legitimacy in the eyes o the most disadvantaged, private interventions are sometimes justied, even reuired. ystemic state ailure can necessitate aggressive actions rom civil society. e argument that punishment, to e legitimate, must e imposed through the collective *agency* o the pulic and in *name* o the pulic and so administered solely y pulic- sector employees demo cratically authoried to play this role is not applicale under conditions o intolerale injustice. Given that the state operates ith a serious decit o legitimacy, the uestion is hat practical mea sures o crime control, hether pulic or private, can e justied to those aected y those mea sures, particularly those among the oppressed.

onsider ail- und organ iations, such as e ail roj ect or the ational ail und etor hosted y e ommunity Justice Exchange. erhaps in a just orld, there ould e no cash ail and pretrial detention ould e used (i at all) solely or those ho pose an immediate danger to the community. Or maye an egalitarian social order ould ensure that each person had sucient nancial reserves to cover any ail costs. ut in our highly uneual society, in hich poverty is idespread and cash ail is set or even minor inractions, ail- und organiations— hich raise money rom private donors to cover ail costs— play a vital i imperect role or the disadvantaged, ho ould other ise e stuc in jail until trial, ofen losing their jos as a result, unale to care or dependents, and needlessly separated rom amily and riends. nonprot ail und rees them rom these urdens and maes such persons less liely to e exploited y or- prot ail- ond companies. More than this, though, such organ iations could potentially save lives.

onsider the tragic case o andra land. On July , , land, a - year- old lac oman, as pulled over or ailing to signal a lane change. exas state trooper rian . Encinia, a hite man, got into an altercation ith land afer she reused to put out her cigaree and exit her vehicle. Encinia arrested land, charging her ith assaulting a pulic servant, hich is a elony. land as ooed into the Waller ounty Jail in Hempstead, exas, and her ail as set at \$, though a \$ ond deposit ould have secured her release. land ased amily and riends or help ut as unale to come up ith the money. On July , just three days afer her arrest, she as ound dead in her cell, hanging rom a noose ormed rom a trash ag. e death as ruled a suicide y medical examiners.

ere are many trouling eatures o this case. uch a routine trac stop should not have led to an arrest. ere is the misconduct (and maye the racism and sexism) o Ocer Encinia, ho as later indicted or perjury or alsely claiming that land had put his lie in danger. Encinia also ailed to de- escalate the confrontation and, arguably, initiated it by arbitrarily demanding that Bland put out her cigarette. Given that Bland posed no threat to others, there is a strong case to be made that she should have been released without bail. But it's indisputable that her life could have been saved with the help of a bail-fund organization.

Bland's story also illustrates a failure of custodial care. During intake, she reported struggles with depression and that she had once tried to kill herself after the death of her newborn. Yet she was placed in a cell alone and not put on suicide watch. Because of this institutional negligence, Bland's family filed a wrongful-death lawsuit, which was settled in 2016 for \$1.9 million. In 2017, Texas enacted the Sandra Bland Act, which calls for police training in de-escalation strategies, special protections for those in custody who suffer from mental illness, and independent investigations of all prison deaths. Cases like Sandra Bland's reveal how nonprofit and justice-promoting organizations could assist the disadvantaged not only through bail funds but also by providing effective and caring prison administration.

More generally, many in unjustly disadvantaged and racially stigmatized communities need protection against wrongful aggression and violence—murder, rape, and aggravated assault. Some of the perpetrators of these wrongful harms are, tragically, themselves members of such communities. So, although community members want these crimes prevented and highly dangerous persons incapacitated, many (including some victims) are reluctant to hand over criminal offenders to a state responsible for racialized mass incarceration and inhumane prison facilities. In the right hands, nonprofit private prison administration and services could e a viale, i temporary, alternative.

don't no i the pulic- nonprot arrangement have descried is *eco nom ical ly* easile. t may e unrealistic to expect private actors, though trustorthy and genuinely concerned ith the plight o prisoners, to e ale to raise the necessary unds to operate a prison on a nonprot asis. erhaps any such nonprot organ iation ould e outid y a or- prot rm. e arrangement could also e *po liti cally* uneasile, in the sense that there may e no practical path to taing aay prison administration rom the state or rom pulic correctional ocers' unions.

#### Responding to Crime: Incarceration and Its Alternatives

For centuries, communities have used some form of punishment to penalize those who wrong others. Before the wide use of modern incarceration, these punishments were almost always unspeakably cruel and harsh, including execution, maiming, enslavement, torture, banishment, and severe beatings. And these practices still exist in some countries. Imprisonment is generally considered to be more humane and less brutal. But this comparative advantage is insufficient to justify the practice. Nor is the fact that prisons are present in every nation of the contemporary world a good reason to think their existence should, or needs to, continue. A practice that deprives people of basic freedoms and imposes other serious harms requires a deeper defense.

As I have emphasized, those who defend the practice of imprisonment must justify it by showing that prisons prevent or reduce crime. Many abolitionists, including Angela Davis, deny that prisons help to control crime. Indeed, part of what makes the functional critique of prisons so compelling (see Chapter 3) is that it relies on a simple and almost irresistible inference: since prisons have been around for so long but don't actually prevent crime, something other than crime prevention another and perhaps nefarious function—must explain their persistence.

Prison abolitionists argue that the practice of imprisonment does not and, even with reforms, could not help to prevent serious crime. If I were convinced that this charge was true, I would advocate for prison abolition. Though I do not believe that imprisonment is inherently or incorrigibly dehumanizing, inhumane, despotic, racist, or exploitative (see Chapters 2-4), I do believe that it inevitably causes significant harm to prisoners and their families. Since I do not accept retribution as a defense of imprisonment, the harm that prisons cause can only be justified by the good that they do or, with suitable reforms, the good that they could do. Imposing incarceration on those who commit crimes is a severe response to even serious wrongdoing. To justify the practice, we must be reasonably confident not only that it treats the accused fairly (through due process measures) but that it actually helps to control crime.

However, even if prisons do prevent crime, or could be reformed so that they do, if there are less harmful crime-control measures that would be at least as effective, we should opt for those. Davis and other prison abolitionists have defended alternatives to prison that they believe are less violent and more efficacious. So I will also consider those alternatives and ask whether they are superior and could displace prisons.

#### Deterrence

In theory, prisons reduce crime in three ways. They may do so through *deterrence*, that is, through the threat of imprisonment, which discourages criminal wrongdoing by way of prudence or fear. They may do so through *incapacitation*—being physically prevented from committing crimes due to confinement and separation from the public. And they may do so through *rehabilitation*, via in-prison services and organized activities designed to turn prisoners away from crime and to enable them to live a crime-free existence once released.

With respect to deterrence, two important questions arise. First, does the general threat of prison deter? Second, does the unpleasant experience of incarceration lead former prisoners to commit fewer crimes than they otherwise would? I won't attempt to provide a comprehensive answer to these questions. These are largely complex empirical matters that philosophical analysis alone cannot settle. Philosophy can, however, help to frame the relevant moral and policy questions. It also has a role to play in interpreting the practical significance of pertinent empirical findings.

It is helpful to distinguish between two forms of deterrence: general and specific. General deterrence is the *threat* of penal sanctions for committing a crime, which provides an incentive to refrain from crime. This is the threat everyone in society is under when a practice of punitive incarceration exists. Its effectiveness is usually measured by comparing crime rates with imprisonment rates—for example, looking to see if crime declines as imprisonment rises. Specific deterrence is a matter of how the *experience* of imprisonment (the loss of basic freedoms and opportunities that others enjoy) provides a disincentive for prisoners to reoffend once released, and is usually measured by recidivism rates.

Deterrence, whether general or specific, is a function of the *likelihood* that an offender will be punished and the *severity* of the punishment. Or to be more precise, it is the *belief* in the high probability and severity of punishment that has the potential to deter. If the probability of being punished is perceived to be very low, then the penalty, even if severe, will not have much if any deterrent effect. If the penalty is not regarded as particularly unpleasant, then the penalty, no matter how certain, won't deter.

There is evidence that, at a certain level of severity, lengthy prison terms do not deter any more than shorter ones. Given that we should impose no more suffering than is needed to keep crime within tolerable levels, this gives us reason to make American sentences shorter, probably considerably shorter, as they are in other parts of the world. In the United States, the extremely lengthy prison terms (sometimes thirty or more years) could be justified only on grounds of retribution, which I reject. Similarly, there is evidence that once the overall prison population reaches a certain per capita level, increasing incarceration has a negligible impact on further reducing crime rates and might even be counterproductive.<sup>2</sup> This is yet another reason to be deeply troubled by mass incarceration. Although the rate of imprisonment in the United States has gone down in recent years, the country still has the highest incarceration rate in the world (ahead of Russia and China), but far from the lowest crime rates 3

Sometimes when abolitionists claim that prisons do not reduce crime, they are best understood as asserting that *mass* 

incarceration does not reduce crime, a claim I would not dispute. Showing that dramatically increased punitiveness does not reduce crime is not, however, the same as showing that no amount of incarceration reduces crime. When philosophers ask whether imprisonment serves as general deterrence, we are asking whether fear of imprisonment prevents more crime than if we did not have the practice of punitive incarceration. We are not asking whether increasing the *severity* of carceral penalties (for instance, lengthening sentences) or the likelihood of imprisonment (for example, raising the probability of prison admission given an arrest) will reduce crime. Questions such as these presuppose that we already have the practice of imprisonment and, on this supposition, ask which law-enforcement and penal policies would be most effective. And, as I suspect, perhaps a less harsh and less aggressive approach to law enforcement would control crime better. 4 But this point, though important, does not go to the heart of the reform-versus-abolition question.

We can ask whether changes in a penal system alter the crime rate. For example, we can see whether increasing a sentence for a given type of crime reduces the incidence of crimes of that type. We can also see whether decreasing a sentence for a given type of crime increases the incidence of crimes of that type. But both questions are different from asking whether in the absence of a penal system crime rates would go up or down or stay the same. They are also different from asking whether, say, if incarceration were no longer a penalty for homicide, there would be more or fewer murders.

What we really need to know is whether there is an achievable and cost-effective prison system that would prevent more crime than any non-carceral alternative. The comparison is not between different carceral regimes—say, between a more or less punitive set of policies—but between a carceral regime and non-carceral crime-control measures. Answering this question definitively through empirical means is difficult if not impossible.

For instance, we cannot test directly for general deterrence using a randomized experiment. The entire population of a country is under the penal regime, that is, subject to criminal law and its sanctions. There is no practical or ethical way to have a treatment group that is not vulnerable to the penalty of incarceration and a control group that is under the threat (particularly where control/treatment group membership is randomly assigned) so that we can compare the results of the experiment. Perhaps, though, some ingenious experiment will be devised that permits an indirect test of the hypothesis.

Historically, philosophers have fallen back on so-called thought experiments. The traditional social contract tradition in political thought—from Thomas Hobbes to Jean-Jacques Rousseau—has asked us to imagine a "state of nature" (that is, a social world without a state and thus without any formal mechanisms of law enforcement). And they have concluded that any rational person would rather live under the general threat of punishment (even severe punishment) than live without effective law enforcement. These speculative thought experiments, though suggestive, are not fully persuasive. They either presuppose a contested conception of human nature, or invalidly generalize from introspection. But they do highlight the fact, already noted, that one's position on abolition will naturally depend on generalizations about what humans are like or what they would be like under rather different social conditions than currently prevail. ill return to this issue elo and in hapter .

ocial scientists and criminologists disagree over hether severe prison terms deter serious crimes. Hoever, "studies o police presence consistently nd that puing more police o cers on the street has a sustantial deterrent eect on serious crime." ere is also strong evidence that the strategic and proactive deployment o police to crime "hot spots" reduces crime. When policing deters, there is reason to thin that part o hat ould-e oenders ear is eing arrested, charged ith a crime, and ultimately convicted and sent to prison. ear o arrest alone pro aly plays some role, ecause eing arrested generally carries stigma and can disrupt a person's plans. ut the more rightening dimension o arrest is the prospect o incarceration. so, then ear o police is, at least in part, ear o prison. hereore, prison does have some deterrent eect, though only in conjunction ith eective policing.

n analogous point can e made aout surveillance. e monitoring o pulic space— not only y police ut also y surveillance cameras, private security personnel, and ordinary citiens— has risen sharply over the last e de cades. uch surveillance argualy deters through the threat o detection and capture, hich increases the lielihood o conviction and therey imprisonment. n general, increasing the certainty o punishment is a more eective crime- control mea sure than increasing the severity o punishment.

Yet there is at least one interpretation o these ndings aout police presence that suggests that ear o prison is not the under lying mechanism. ome may ear, not so much eing arrested, ut eing sujected to police vio lence. e physical danger that these encounters ith police pose could lead some (particularly disadvantaged rican-merican, ative merican, and Latinx males) to avoid crime or even the appearance o criminal rongdoing. Here the deterrent eect ould e due to ear o *police* rather than ear o prison. eing suject to police rutality and excessive orce is oviously a violation o asic civil rights. ut i e loo to socie ties here ear o police rutality is lo or here police are mostly unarmed and e nd a similar deterrent eect o proactive or place- ased policing, then this should increase our conidence that this eect is largely due to ear o prison. nd there is such evidence, including in places lie the K, eden, and enmar.

Hoever, i policing does deter, this is oth good and ad, at least in socie ties lie the nited tates. t is good ecause it is a eer outcome i ould-e oenders do not actually commit crimes or ear o arrest than i they ere to oend and then go to prison. General deterrence is eer than specic deterrence and carceral incapacitation, at least rom a moral point o vie and possily ith re spect to cost- eectiveness. Where general deterrence has een eective, harm rom rongdoing is averted and those tempted to oend are not harmed y incarceration. otential victims get protection ithout sending anyone to prison. t is thus a general harm- reduction strategy. nd eective policing may cost less than incarcerating people, hich is enormously expensive. ut even i ecacious policing ould e more expensive, the moral enets, in terms o the reduction in overall harm, could outeigh the nancial costs.

On the other hand, police are too oten a menace to lac people (and other people o color) in the nited tates, particularly to those who live or work in deeply disadvantaged black neighborhoods. 8 In addition to worries about harm done through police violence, there is the concern that when police regularly harass, unfairly treat, or disrespect black people, this lowers the sense of legitimacy of criminal law in the eyes of many blacks, particularly those living in racially segregated and poor communities. <sup>9</sup> There is an increasing and enduring sense of distrust and hostility toward law enforcement, passed on over generations, due to a supposedly just institution regularly behaving unjustly. This loss of legitimacy weakens the power of criminal prohibitions to produce compliance, as the threat of sanctions works best when combined with general respect for the law and trust in law-enforcement officials. 10 Moreover, when people regard law-enforcement officials as illegitimate, they may refuse or be reluctant to cooperate with criminal investigations, thus lowering the probability that offenders will be caught or punished. So in addition to worries about police violence, with more police contact there is the concern that such contact will further erode trust in law enforcement. The violence and harassment that disadvantaged black people commonly experience at the hands of the police might even seem to warrant ending policing, which some scholars, organizers, and activists have called for.11

So, it seems we face a dilemma. If we rely heavily on police to prevent crime, we potentially expose black people to greater police violence and harassment (that is, if the harms of policing scale with the level of policing, which seems reasonable to assume). Yet if we dramatically reduce reliance on police, black people may be exposed to more crime, including serious crime like murder. Is there a way to get the general deterrent effect of policing while reducing black people's vulnerability to police violence and harassment?

The obvious answer is that prison reform and police reform must be combined. We need prisons to deter serious crime; however, imprisonment as a practice is unworkable without police. But we don't have to, nor should we, live with policing practices as they are. Procedurally fair policing is called for by constitutional requirements of due process, a basic liberty of all citizens. Fairer treatment from police can also reduce the incidence of police brutality and repair deficits in legitimacy. This is clearly a long-term solution, as is true of broader social-structural transformation. In the meantime, and considering the dangers that current policing practices pose, perhaps a moratorium on certain *forms* of policing is called for.

For instance, limits could be placed on the range of offenses for which police have discretion to arrest, say, by making only the most serious criminal charges arrestable offenses. Court orders might be required for lesser charges. Arrest quotas could be prohibited altogether, as they arguably create perverse incentives and threaten citizens' civil rights. The circumstances under which the police have a right to stop, question, search, or pursue suspects could also be strictly limited. Limits could be placed on the situations in which the police have the discretion to investigate suspicious persons or circumstances. The range of situations in which the police have a right, or are obliged, to come to a scene when called could be narrowed. There could be much greater reliance on social workers and mental-health professionals to deal with social problems rather than always turning to the police. These would be reform efforts to reduce direct interaction between police officers and black people.

Hot-spot policing must be based on the high incidence of serious crimes in the area or the volume of complaints from community members, not on the racial makeup of the neighborhood. This should be data-driven policing, and racial profiling must be prohibited and strongly discouraged. 12 Use-of-force rules and procedures could also be altered, with serious penalties for officers who fail to comply, including facing criminal prosecution. Rewards could be offered to officers who develop a reputation for showing restraint in the use of force and who are effective in de-escalating volatile situations. Certain uses of force (for example, chokeholds and other neck restraints) could be strictly prohibited, and the use of lethal force could be severely limited (for instance, clear directives for when an officer may possess, draw, point, or discharge a firearm). Such measures are of course far from perfect and are not a full solution to the problem. But if they or similar policies were widely instituted, this might allow disadvantaged black communities to gain the crime-prevention benefits of proactive and hot-spot policing while reducing their vulnerability to the harms of police misconduct.

In many places, including the United States, recidivism is high.<sup>13</sup> Many former prisoners, within only a few years or even months after release, are rearrested, convicted, or sent back to prison (whether for a new crime or parole violation). It could be that some who reoffend cannot be deterred by the general threat of imprisonment despite having had the personal experience of prison. But there is also evidence that imprisonment can have a *criminogenic* effect on some prisoners. This is worrisome and a possible problem for reformers. Yet even if existing prisons do foster crime to some extent, this might be correctable.

## 159

Prison conditions, prison administration, in-prison services and opportunities, and prison sentencing are all objects of social reform, which if successful could significantly reduce the criminogenic effects of prison. As already noted, prison conditions can be and often are horrid—overcrowding, insufficient and incompetent staff, overuse of isolation, violence and sexual assault, inadequate sanitation and nutrition, lack of medical and psychiatric care, and so on. Prison staff can be cruel, arbitrary, and despotic. In some prisons, gangs wield enormous power, keeping some prisoners tethered to street culture and its lawbreaking ethos, while acculturating others who may have had less prior connection to such antisocial attitudes. Many prisons fail to offer prisoners the counseling services (such as cognitivebehavioral therapy) and educational or vocational and employment opportunities necessary to reenter society as equal participants. And, as noted earlier, prisoners are generally held in prison for far too long. These needlessly lengthy sentences enable the corrupting dimensions of prison life and culture to have a deeper imprint on the incarcerated.

Reentry and reintegration conditions in the wider society must also be objects of reform. When the formerly incarcerated try to regain equal status, they are often subject to pervasive discrimination and civic exclusion, which can encourage a return to crime, either out of economic necessity or social alienation. Where a practice of imprisonment also makes clear to prisoners and former prisoners that the public takes satisfaction in their suffering, is indifferent to their mistreatment, and will never welcome them back into society on equal terms, high rates of reoffending are to be expected. But these wrongful practices and this unforgiving social attitude are not universal. Not all societies exhibit them.<sup>15</sup> So there is reason to be optimistic that the criminogenic effect of imprisonment can be reduced through effective reform efforts inside and outside prisons.

It is possible that some cannot be deterred from reoffending because of firsthand experience of prison, even when prison conditions are humane and reintegration into society is effectively facilitated. Prison as specific deterrence may be of limited value in controlling serious crime. If so, this suggests it should not be a primary aim of imprisonment. Indeed, heavy reliance on specific deterrence could invite efforts to make prison life especially grim or unpleasant and may encourage the abuse of prisoners. Given this danger, there is reason to make the experience of imprisonment largely a matter of enhancing prisoners' capacity to refrain from crime by offering in-prison services and opportunities for rehabilitation.

But skepticism about the value of specific deterrence leaves open the question of whether serious crime would occur in the absence of the general threat of imprisonment. Looking at recidivism rates will not answer that question. What we need to know is why the *law-abiding* do not commit crimes, and whether fear of prison plays any role in their compliance.

Most people don't seem inclined or tempted to engage in the most serious forms of wrongdoing. Such grossly immoral behavior holds no attraction for them. They may even be repelled by it, particularly interpersonal violence. Among those who might be so inclined or tempted, some may hold themselves in check through moral considerations alone. Recognizing that unprovoked aggression against others is wrong is sufficient to keep them from acting violently or otherwise violating others'

asic rights. Others may comply simply ecause the la re uires it and they re spect the la. ose insuciently moved y considerations o morality or legality may remain nonviolent to secure the approation (or to avoid the enmity) o their ellos or their gods. ome might e adeuately deterred through non- carceral sanctions, lie nes, property conscation, supervised proation, and community ser vice.

Yet the concern remains that giving up on the general deterrence that prison seems to provide could encourage or enale harmul rongdoing among the other ise la- aiding. e disincentive o a prison term could e a useul motivational supplement or those ith a sense o justice ut a ea ill. Or it might soer the mind hen the heat o passion threatens to overhelm. onsider the idespread and salient disposition to respond to eing victimied ith retaliation. evenge is a poer ul i ugly motive. e threat o prison or acting rom vengeance could curtail such acts.

art o the reason that prison might ail to deter eectively in places lie the nited tates is that the acground social conditions are so harsh and unyielding or some that rising prison is, or at least seems, rational (having a higher expected utility than remaining ithin the ounds o the la). When there isn't much to lose (including social reards and pulic esteem) ecause one is already living an unrelenting miserale existence, then acing prison is less scary, or one might engage in unlaul conduct in desperation despite the ear.is suggests that prison might deter more eectively under more just conditions. Or at least, e cannot conclude rom the act (i it is a act) that prison does not deter under highly unjust conditions that it ould not deter under more just social arrangements.

Earning money in the inormal economy or gray maret is also uite limited in prison. o it is not just the loss o personal reedom and the separation rom amily and riends ut also (though or most pro aly less signicantly) the economic opportunity costs o imprisonment that can potentially deter.

#### ncapacitation

Let me turn riey to incapacitation. Human eings share many traits in common ut also dier in ays that can limit the overall eectiveness o general deterrence. ome people enjoy taing riss— ith their money, relationships, reedom, odies, and lives. or some, the act that they could go to prison or engaging in an illicit activity might e part o the thrill, even i they later regret the gamle. ome people are so myopic and presentoriented that they discount the uture costs o their actions. Some are intensely driven by passion, glory, or ideology and so disregard the risks associated with their actions. I highlight these obvious differences among human beings not to disparage anyone. These are normal and well-known variances in human personality that law-enforcement policy must take into account.

No society can bring the probability of punishment for a crime to a hundred percent. We generally cannot impose penalties immediately upon offense—criminal investigations and due process take time. We cannot eradicate all forms of irrationality, improvidence, and weakness of will. Therefore, we should not be surprised that, perhaps despite our best efforts, some people will not be deterred from committing crimes, even serious ones. But those who are risk-neutral or risk-averse and whose actions generally track their judgments *can* be deterred through formal sanctions. And those who cannot be deterred and refuse to turn away from serious crimes must sometimes be incapacitated through incarceration, at least temporarily, to protect others from grave harm.

It might seem unfair to imprison those who can't be deterred by the threat of incarceration. Perhaps it is not their fault that they have personality traits or habits of mind that make them impervious to credible threats. Why should they be made to suffer because they possess these characteristics? The social benefits might not seem sufficient justification to impose such suffering on persons who are unmoved by the threat of carceral sanctions.

Although they may not be at fault for being the kind of person who does not rationally heed credible threats, they might nonetheless be blameworthy for committing serious crimes. People should not be punished because they fail to heed the threat o incarceration. ey should e punished ecause o their rongul actions. When it comes to criminal la, it is the reusal to re spect ey moral reuirements that is the main pro lem, not people's personality traits or their aitudes toard ris. We all have a responsiility to rerain rom murder and rape even i e are strongly tempted to commit such terrile acts and even i e are aracted to danger. e severe penal response that incarceration represents ould not e justied i the harms potentially averted ere relatively minor. ut this coercive response is sometimes arranted hen it comes to serious crimes ecause o the vital interests at stae.

o e clear, don't have in mind people ho suer rom serious mental illness or ho have severe cognitive or emotional disorders. When such people commit serious crimes, the response, i necessary, should e treatment in a psychiatric hospital, not imprisonment. am taling aout people ho *can* comply ith these moral and legal reuirements ut ho nd it more challenging to remain in compliance ith them than the average person does. ese outliers are certainly oed due process eore any sanctions are imposed. ut they are not ronged i sanctions are imposed despite their nding it more dicult than others not to succum to temptation.

onsider men and omen. s a generaliation, it appears that adult males nd it more dicult to resist aggressive and antisocial impulses than adult emales. (n the nited tates, or example, the male prison population is roughly percent o the total prison population. imilar numers are ound in the nited Kingdom.) e act (i it is a act) that men nd it harder to rerain rom illully harming others than do omen ould not, tae it, mean that men should not ace prison or their harmful wrongdoing. (I leave aside whether individual sentences should vary by how difficult it was for the perpetrator to comply with the relevant law.<sup>17</sup>)

In general, I doubt that would-be offenders are owed an incentive to refrain from such serious wrongs. The public owes the disincentive of imprisonment to people who are vulnerable to victimization. We should maintain a penal regime for purposes of public safety, to discourage and prevent criminal conduct within the general population. These penalties are a prudent concession to the unfortunate reality that some among us—not just monsters or predators but ordinary people—can be expected to act wrongly in the absence of sanctions. Would-be offenders do not all have the same opportunity to avoid these penalties. They do, however, have *sufficient* opportunity to avoid them. They can refrain (though perhaps not without difficulty) from actions that they have no right to engage in, that they have overriding moral reasons not to perform, and that cause others great and irreparable harm or deep and lasting trauma.

Our basic conception of human beings as rational agents who respond to incentives and disincentives gives us theoretical reasons for thinking that prisons reduce crime through general deterrence. There is also, as discussed earlier, empirical evidence that prisons prevent crime. These theoretical considerations and this empirical evidence are, to my mind, compelling. However, I can see why some might not find them fully convincing, and there is no consensus among social scientists and psychologists who study the matter. This fact—that there is room for reasonable doubt about whether prisons prevent crime—may be the strongest argument in favor of abolition.

Here, prison aolitionists dra our attention to a pos si le eaness in our penal system that reormers should tae seriously. Yet e still need to as hether non- carceral alternatives ould are any eer.

Some persons with mental-health disabilities or psychological disorders commit crimes including serious offenses. The public should certainly offer, facilitate, and subsidize the therapy and medication necessary to heal or assist those suffering from debilitating psychological maladies. This help should extend to those who have known challenges managing their anger or who otherwise find it difficult to refrain from acting on aggressive impulses. There are, however, at least two limitations to relying on mental-health care to control crime if doing so would mean altogether abandoning incarceration.

The first is that some persons with mental illnesses are, because of their maladies, a danger to others. To protect the vulnerable, these dangerous individuals must sometimes be incarcerated (a form of incapacitation) while they undergo treatment. When appropriately conceived and carried out, this kind of incarceration should not be considered punishment, as these individuals either have not committed a crime or are not responsible for any crimes they have committed. Although an added purpose of this incarceration (medical care) would be different from the sole aim of imprisonment (crime prevention), from the perspective of those confined, the two forms of incarceration might still look and feel much the same. Both would inevitably involve severe restrictions on liberty and loss of privacy, and both would generally cause significant emotional distress. The main difference would be that the mentally ill would be released once they no longer posed a danger to others, while at least some criminal offenders would remain incarcerated until they served their full sentence.

It is true that a prison abolitionist could consistently allow the involuntary incarceration of persons who are mentally ill and clearly dangerous. Davis, for example, favors the abolition of prisons and penitentiaries but, so far as I can tell, is not opposed to psychiatric hospitals, at least not in principle. It is the *punitive* character of some incarceration that she is against. I think this response—distinguishing punitive from nonpunitive incarceration—has some power, but mainly against a conception of penalties as retribution. When the penalties are not conceived as retaliation or deserved suffering but serve only to prevent crime, they function similarly to involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital.

The other limitation of mental-health care as a crime-control. measure is the need to respect personal liberty, specifically the right to not seek treatment. Some with known or suspected mental illnesses refuse to be treated or even diagnosed. There are those who initially accept treatment but then don't show up for therapy or won't take prescribed medication according to protocol. Such persons sometimes act aggressively toward others but could perhaps be effectively deterred by the threat of incarceration, either in a prison or a mental-health facility. After all, many who suffer from psychological disorders are not so debilitated that they are incapable of responding effectively to moral or prudential reasons. And some with mental illnesses are not without rational agency or a sense of justice and can therefore be held responsible for their wrongful actions (though they may be less culpable than those who lack such mental challenges). Respecting their freedom to refuse treatment while also protecting third parties from violent crime might require reliance on incarceration.

A similar limitation arises with therapeutic remedies for problems of drug use. Free treatment for drug use disorders and decriminaliing drug use ould liely reduce crime. ut e can expect there to e some ho reuse treatment and go on to commit serious crimes. Many on't see treatment or their addiction or on't tae prescried medi cation, and some o these persons may commit crimes to eed their hait, or act violently under the inuence o a drug.

avis and other aolitionists avor rehailitation as a response to criminal oending. Yet they don't elieve such rehailitation can e eectively carried out in a prison. avis argues that prisons mae prisoners violent (or more violent) and thus they are ostacles to (rather than instruments o) rehailitation. he also suggests that eective rehailitation ill occur only hen oenders can exercise their asic reedoms rather than eing deprived o them.

Other ise, not only ould the pulic remain vulnerale to ne oenses, ut oenders on't get the help they need.

As I emphasized at the start, I strongly favor using noncarceral penalties to control crime where feasible and effective. Yet some lesser penalties, such as community service and home confinement, are difficult to enforce without the threat of incarceration for noncompliance. There's a sense in which prison, even if rarely used, anchors the entire scheme of penalties. Without it, society has few formal means to enforce its laws, mainly fines and the suspension of privileges, which are unlikely to be effective against serious crimes, such as rape and murder.<sup>22</sup>

#### Transformative Justice

Reparative justice and restorative justice aim to support victims, promote healing, compensate for harm done, and facilitate reconciliation. With reparative justice, the point is not simply to repair the harm, though this is critically important. The goal is also to set things right between the wrongdoer and the wronged and thereby resolve a legitimate grievance. With restorative justice, the call is to go beyond seeking closure and repairing harms (psychological, physical, or material) toward restoring relationships between people that have been broken or damaged due to injustice. Where the wrongdoer and the person wronged had no prior relationship, a new relationship is created by the wrong itself, a relationship with enmity or fear at its core. When successful, restorative justice measures bring about genuine reconciliation between victims and those who have wronged them.

Reparative and restorative justice are sometimes treated as components of the broader idea of *transformative justice* (sometimes called "community accountability"), which is a conception of justice that rejects the notion of "criminal justice" altogether and that refuses to rely on punitive incarceration or the police. <sup>23</sup> It is conceived as a mutually exclusive alternative to criminal law and its enforcement. Indeed, abolitionist advocates of transformative justice do not even use the language of criminal law—for example, "crime," "illegal," "offender," and "felon"—but instead favor the less stigmatizing language of "harm" and "persons who have harmed others." The focus of transformative justice is threefold.

First and foremost, transformative justice aims to respond to interpersonal violence and harm by lovingly attending to the needs of survivors—those who are harmed, aggrieved, or otherwise negatively affected by harmful wrongdoing. Survivors need support, safety, and healing from their trauma and loss. To be made whole, survivors often want those who harmed them to publicly acknowledge their wrongs, to accept responsibility for the harm done, and to apologize and make amends. Criminal prosecution does not, and cannot, address these needs. The necessary practices of care and accountability can be cultivated and maintained by community-based nonprofit organizations and grassroots advocacy groups or through decentralized and informal social networks. Communities must be empowered to address wrongdoing among their members. These communal practices are to be rooted in dialogue and the goal of repairing harm, not in getting even or the desire to inflict further harm. They are to be inclusive, voluntary, and nonviolent. Examples include crisis intervention, counseling, mediation, mutual aid efforts, safe houses, de-escalation methods, and the provision of emergency services.

## 173

The second focus of transformative justice is preventing future harm by addressing the material circumstances (such as homelessness and lack of money) and power dynamics that give rise to harmful wrongdoing. Abolitionist organizers committed to transformative justice aim to change the local circumstances that ignite or fuel interpersonal aggression and violence but without relying on law enforcement. This would involve addressing food and housing insecurity, encouraging those addicted to drugs or alcohol to seek treatment, helping to resolve long-standing enmity between individuals or groups, instituting afterschool programs and extracurricular activities for youth, providing political education on sexism and sexual consent, and facilitating family counseling. Again, these programs are to be initiated and carried out by local nonprofit organizations, advocacy groups, or social networks with thick ties to the relevant community.

In addition to community-based measures to meet the needs of survivors and to prevent harm, a third focus of transformative justice is working through group solidarity and intergroup coalitions to bring about far-reaching social-structural change. Such social justice goals should include eliminating poverty, providing adequate education for all, reducing unemployment, equitably sharing wealth, and creating more democratic social relations. For abolitionists in the black radical tradition, this would mean ultimately abandoning welfare-state capitalism in favor of social democracy or socialism. Systemic injustice and economic inequality are drivers of violence, fraud, and theft, and so corrective justice can also dramatically reduce harmful wrongdoing without sending people to prison. Criminal law gives no serious attention to the underlying social causes of crime, and having a disadvantaged acground is rarely treated as a legitimate excuse or even a mitigating actor or those ho violate the la.

elcome these approaches to harmul rongdoing and to social- structural change. eparative, restorative, and transormative justice practices should play a much larger role in responding to crime and interpersonal harm than they typically do. olitionists are correct that e should expand the range o practices e use to address harmul rongdoing. We should emrace experimentation ith transormative justice measures, especially given the limited eectiveness and narro scope o current criminal la procedures. ide array o strategies is reuired to respond eectively to crime, its causes, and its harmul conseuences. riminal la should not e our sole or even our primary approach.

s aolition eminists emphasie, transormative justice is ofen a ing response to domestic, gender, and sexual violence. n these cases, support or survivors, reconciliation, and healing rom trauma are paramount, and penaliing those ho caused the harm is secondary or sometimes counterproductive. n the discourse o transormative justice, there is a rejection o the idea o "victims" in avor o "persons ho have experienced harm" or "survivors." is is ecause thining o onesel as a victim (rather than a survivor) can e disempoering, as i one ere dened y the harmul act, and thus can inhiit reclaiming agency and moving past the injury and trauma. ose ho have een rongully harmed oten eel or suspect that they are partly at ault or hat happened to them, and this sense o shared lame sometimes haunts survivors, leaving them ith a deep sense o guilt and shame. Having the one ho caused the harm tae responsiility or it can itsel thereore e healing. o holeheartedly agree that criminal prosecution generally ails to ully address the vital needs o survivors. Other practices, including those o transormative justice, are eer suited to this tas. Ofen the survivors o harmul rongdoing are searching or something other than (or at least in addition to) a criminal conviction and punishment or the guilty. nd they should have it.

t is also true that criminal la is not ell suited to address the under lying social conditions that uel vio lence. or is it a proper instrument or altering the asic institutions o society or or redistriuting resources on a societal scale. e role o criminal la is and should e limited; it must e supplemented y other less harmul practices and policies, and transormative justice mea sures should e among them. ut the act that this narro instrument or responding to crime— that is, criminal la and its enorcement— ails to meet all the needs o survivors and is an inadeuate means or structural transormation does not mean it cannot serve a vital social purpose or that it can e readily replaced.

e main limitation o transormative justice is that it depends on the illing participation o persons ho have experienced harm and persons ho harm. at it is a voluntary and nonviolent strategy to address harm is a great virtue. ut e cannot alays expect illing cooperation rom the relevant parties. ometimes a survivor ill decline to participate in these reparative and restorative pro cesses and may even reuse to send or permit a surrogate. Ofen survivors on't eel sae, and in act on't e sae, i those ho harmed them are eectively ree to aac them again, particularly i the aggressors sho no signs o remorse. urvivors and the roader pulic still need an eective mechanism to stop or inhiit those ho mean others harm. riminal justice procedures, though ar rom ideal, should e availale to survivors hose assailants reuse to e held accountale and to survivors ho are unilling to participate in transormative justice practices.

When all goes ell, transormative justice practices can prevent urther acts o vio lence. ome reparative mea sures can have a secondary rehailitative unction, or instance. e person ho caused harm may honestly repent and renounce any intention to commit uture harm. Or they may nd the process o reconciliation suciently healing that they no longer carry the motives or dispositions that initially led them to do rong. eparative and restorative justice can prevent harm i the apology is sincere and those ho have done rong regret their actions. When reparations are a part o restorative justice, the amends must e reely given ith an acnoledgment and apology. is provides a contrast ith reparative justice in a legal context. Material reparations need not alays e given voluntarily to repair the harm done; or example, through successul litigation and court order, reparations could e paid to survivors o racist police vio lence. Legal authorities can extract restitution and reparations rom an un illing or unrepentant aggressor. is too can help survivors heal, or nancial resources are ofen necessary or them to get the support they need. La enorcement and reparative justice are not then incompatile, and they sometimes or eer in tandem. We do not have to choose eteen them. ose ho are sentenced to prison should mae every eort to repair the damage done y their rongdoing hile in prison, once released, or oth.

Another limitation of transformative justice is that neither reparative nor restorative justice can fully address the loss when a homicide has occurred. Reconciliation with the loved ones of a murder victim is not equivalent to reconciliation with the victim, whose lost life cannot be repaired or compensated. And persons who have killed another generally do not want their identities revealed and typically will evade accountability measures when possible. So, at least when it comes to murder, to rest the security of the vulnerable on transformative justice practices alone is to countenance enormous risk, which is one reason why I offer a qualified defense of strategies to deter and sometimes to incapacitate those strongly inclined or tempted to kill others.

Some abolitionists defend transformative justice as a challenge to criminal justice. I do not see why the two need be at odds. They are incompatible only if transformative justice requires a commitment to anarchism or unconditional pacifism, as discussed earlier (Chapter 2). They might appear to be opposed if the goal of criminal justice is thought to be retribution. But, as I have argued, the enforcement of criminal law is best understood as a public means for preventing and controlling crime. This goal is to be accomplished through general deterrence, rehabilitation, and, in exceptional cases, incapacitation.

It could be argued that transformative justice challenges the very idea that the enforcement of criminal law through imprisonment is, or ever could be, "justice." How could involuntary captivity and the suffering it inevitably causes constitute justice? But criminal law, when legitimate, is designed to protect our most basic liberties, including our right not to be killed, sexually assaulted, or physically attacked. Justice requires that these liberties be secure. They are secure only if people are reasonably protected against their violation. Otherwise, the liberties are merely formal and have limited practical value. Law that is unenforced provides no real protection for these vital interests. The general threat of legal sanctions contributes to such protection only if the threat is credible, which means the sanctions must be imposed when fair rules of due process warrant this. Justice is done, not because the guilty are made to suffer through confinement, but because criminal law procedures have worked as they should in maintaining a general practice of penal deterrence.

#### The Reality of Crime

Angela Davis ends her influential book *Are Prisons Obsolete?* with a moving story of reconciliation after a heinous crime.<sup>24</sup> In 1993, Amy Biehl, a white woman from California, was stoned and stabbed to death in a black township in Cape Town, South Africa. Four men were convicted of the crime and given an eighteen-year prison sentence. Remarkably, Biehl's parents supported the amnesty petition of the men, and they were released from prison in 1998 as part of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation efforts. Restorative justice in this case required the victim's family to forgive the act that cost them the life of their daughter—forgiveness that they gave freely, and which enabled the perpetrators' redemption.

This kind of admirable and merciful action was perhaps necessary in the extraordinary circumstances of transitional justice after a long period of violent civil conflict in apartheid South rica. ut is it reasonale to expect citiens to adopt this posture, as a general practice, toard people ho try to ill them or ho murder those they love is laudale disposition to orgive might e acceptale or a religious group or an other ise highly cohesive community. Hoever, in a large, complex, and pluralist society o people ho are largely strangers to one another, it stries me as too much to as i eective deterrents, incapacitation, and rehailitation are availale to help control such serious crime.

t is disappointing that the pro lem o serious crime is so ofen dismissed, arely mentioned, or donplayed in aolitionist ritings. ome claim that ear o crime is irrational or racist and that people have more to ear rom the police than rom so- called criminals. Or, as in the story just related rom avis, violent crime is ramed in the context o reparative and restorative justice. ut once the pro lem is conronted orthrightly and ithout the enet o a conciliatory ending, the regreale need or prisons ecomes harder to deny. vivid and tragic example may help to ring an ele ment o realism to the discussion and to mae concrete ho imprisonment can prevent irreparale harm.

ynthia Glover, an rican-merican grand mother living in e Orleans, has lost ive close amily memers to gun vio lence— three o her our children, her rother, and her grandson. hey ere each illed in separate incidents in e Orleans, though Glover elieves that at least to ere illed y the same person. Her oldest son, ayne, as shot and illed, just outside ynthia's apartment, in . He as only . o one has een charged ith his illing. ynthia's only daughter, Kendrell, as shot, just around the corner rom ynthia's home, in . Kendrell as . ynthia's son ornell as shot, again just outside her home, in . (n , a person as convicted and sentenced to thirty years or ornell's murder and or attempting to ill ornell's cousin Michael Glover three years earlier. s ornell lay dying on the street rom multiple gunshot ounds, he identied his assailant y name. second gunman as never identied.) ynthia's grand son ayne ("Lil ") as also shot to death, a loc rom ynthia's home, in . He as nineteen. o one has een charged in connection ith ayne's death.

ynthia's only surviving and youn gest son lred (ho has also een shot on to separate occasions) is serving a ten- year prison sentence or possession o a rearm y a elon. (ynthia says she rought the gun on a visit to lred's house ut then orgot it there. t as later discovered y lred's parole o cer.) oth ynthia and lred are orried that he, too, ill e illed. ynthia no sleeps ith a loaded mm handgun y her side. Her ed aces the ront door o her apartment in case she needs to tae uic action in sel- deense. he has installed cameras outside and throughout her house in lgiers, a section o e Orleans.

e neighorhood that ynthia Glover lives in and here she lost so many loved ones has an aysmally lo arrest rate or homi cides, ith only to o tenty- three murders resulting in ormal charges rom to . Lo arrest rates allo murderers to remain menacing orces in the community, to act violently toard others ithout ear o going to prison. Lo arrest rates also lead ould-e oenders to elieve they can tae advantage o others and even ill them ith impunity. e conse uences can e devastating, as the Glover amily learned.

some o the individuals ho illed or ounded her children had aced punitive incarceration, even i only as a realistic threat, her lie might not have een lled ith so much unspeaale loss and perhaps she ouldn't e sleeping alongside a loaded gun.

dout that there are legitimate means that ould prevent all serious crime. ere ill e no "end to crime." e most e can hope or is to minimie crime, to reduce it to a point here every one has as much saety as anyone could reasonaly expect and here constant ear o rongul acts that do great and irreparale harm is irrational.

With serious crime a rare occurrence, it could e argued that the practice o imprisonment is indeensile. just and good society ould simply live ith this small ris o harmul rongs (perhaps maing use o non- carceral penalties and transormative justice practices) rather than impose the suering that prison causes. his approach to serious crime is even more plausile hen e eep in mind that imprisonment harms not only prisoners ut also those ho care aout or depend on them. o, one ay o understanding avis's alternative measures is to see them, not as eradicating all serious crime, ut as ringing crime don to a level that imprisonment ecomes too drastic a response to the pro lem.

ut in those remaining occurrences o serious crime in the imagined prison- less society, hat could the pulic say to victims ey could complain that had e estalished a credile general threat o imprisonment, their assailants may have re rained rom aacing them. Or here an aggressor has seriously harmed others eore, any ne victims could rightly complain that the state should have incapacitated the individual (at least temporarily) to prevent harm to anyone else. e pu lic could have taen perectly permissile mea sures to avert this harmul rongdoing ut chose not to. Given that a primary responsiility o a legitimate state is to protect residents ithin its jurisdiction rom unjust harm to their person, the state ould e correctly seen as ronging the victims o crime.

#### **Dreaming Big: Utopian Imagination and Structural Transformation**

his oo egan ith the assumption that prison reorm is needed, ut sought to conront the challenge that reorm is not a radical enough goal. We have thought through aolitionist criticisms o the practice o imprisonment, analyed primarily through the leading or o ngela avis. ere is much in her ide-ranging critiue o the prison industrial complex that is compelling and enhances the case or radical reorm in existing prison systems, and la- enorcement practice more generally. Yet the case or the aolition o prisons is not holly convincing. ncarceration has legitimate uses, including as punishment, at least hen acground structural conditions are reasonaly just. e use o prisons to protect the vulnerale can sometimes even e justied in the context o systemic injustice.

Yet avis's arguments or prison aolition are proing, insightul, and cannot e dismissed. uilding on her rich or, I offered considerations in favor of a limited moratorium on the use of prisons in the United States. We need to restrict our use of imprisonment to only the most serious offenses, the wrongs that do great and irreparable harm or cause deep and lasting trauma and which are wrong independently of whether the law prohibits them (*mala in se*). We should also dramatically shrink the current prison population, releasing those who have served long sentences and those whose crimes have not caused serious or irreparable harm.

In this concluding chapter, let me address possible abolitionist objections to my arguments in favor of prison reform. I also want to further distinguish the valuable utopian dimensions of abolitionist theory and practice from those that should be abandoned. And I will explain why even an extremely restricted use of prisons, which I believe is warranted in the United States today, must be combined with broader structural reform of society.

### Abstraction, Idealization, and Counterfactuals

Some readers will have methodological concerns with my arguments. Many critical theorists and radical political philosophers are suspicious of so-called ideal theory and utopian reflection. They worry that such theorizing abstracts away from concrete historical realities in a way that serves the status quo. Elsewhere I have defended my approach to political philosophy, in which both ideal theory and nonideal theory have an essential role. That defense was offered largely within a liberal-egalitarian (or social-democratic) framework. Now let me explain how my approach is compatible with core commitments of Marxism and black radicalism.

Marx thought that the working class should, and would, abolish capitalism, at least eventually. Workers would do this by ending both private ownership of productive assets and markets in wage labor. Marx maintained that as long as capitalism continued, so would dehumanizing and despotic forms of involuntary servitude and also widespread poverty. He insisted that political subjugation, labor exploitation, and economic insecurity were inherent features of capitalism, not contingent characteristics of capitalist practice in this or that country or historical era. But to show that capitalism could not be reformed and must be abolished, he engaged in abstraction, idealization, and counterfactual reasoning. This kind of theorizing was politically wise and philosophically productive. Had he not engaged in it, opponents of socialism could plausibly respond to his critique by arguing that existing capitalism could be altered or improved upon to avoid the forms of oppression he identified. For instance, they could argue that instituting a generous welfare state, a living minimum wage, unemployment and retirement benefits, workplace protections for labor and a right to strike, a progressive tax scheme, and universal education and health care would adequately respond to Marx's most serious criticisms of capitalism.

Marx's analysis of the capitalist mode of production in terms of the surreptitious extraction of surplus value involves considerable abstraction from history and existing practice. He acknowledged that capitalism, as a matter of historical fact, arose and developed through "blood and fire"—that is, through violence, repressive laws, and the coercive expropriation of the peasantry.

s he tells us in *Capital*, "us ere the agricultural ol rst orcily expropriated rom the soil, driven rom their homes, turned into vagaonds, and then hipped, randed and tortured y grotesuely terroristic las into accepting the discipline necessary or the system o age- laor."

Yet Marx's critiue o capitalism and his call or its aolition did not rest entirely on this damning historical analy sis. or did he rely solely on the act that direct orce, corporate thef, illicit collusion among rms, and commercial raud are commonplace in cap i tal ist socie ties. He sought to sho that even i mar ets operated ithout coercion, stealing, corruption, or sindling (as ourgeois ideology says they are supposed to), capital ould still e concentrated in the hands o the e and the great majority ould thus e at their mercy.

When as hether the practice o imprisonment should e reormed or aolished, am engaging in a similar orm o a straction and idealiation, and or the same reasons. am not sugarcoating history or eing evasive or naïve aout grim concrete realities. My goal is to determine hether there are easi le changes that could e made no or in the uture that ould lead prisons to serve legitimate ends ut ithout the orms o injustice that avis and other aolitionists rightly condemn. e existing practice o imprisonment has deeply unsavory origins and operates, in many places, in a ay that cannot e justied to prisoners and their amilies. ut or aolition, in its radical orm, to e compelling, septics ill naturally ant to no hether prisons ould still e ojectionale afer realistic and suitale reorms.

When aolitionists claim prisons cannot e reormed, they could e saying that all (or most o) the changes that reormers have proposed ere actually made and yet the same or similar pro lems persist and things have not sustantially improved. Yet many o the proposed reorms have discussed in this oo have not een instituted, at least not universally and certainly not in the nited tates. n this ay, the practice o imprisonment has the same status as the practice o socialism. n response to critics, deenders o socialism (lie deenders o prisons) insist that there is a realistic orm o socialism that departs in crucial ays rom socialism as e have non it. is orm o socialism ould e demo cratic and stale and ould meet every one's needs in a reasonaly ecient ay hile at the same time respecting individual lierty and reedom o expression. e socialist maintains that not all practical orms o socialism have een tried and that the history and existence o authoritarian and po liti cally repressive socialist regimes does not sho that realiing a just orm o socialism is impossile.

ome radicals argue that *history* shos that prisons cannot e reormed. e rec ord o ailed reorm eorts shos the project to e misguided ecause utile. is is not the same as saying that imprisonment, lie slavery, is inherently unjust. lavery cannot e "reormed," only aolished. ut that is ecause it is intrinsically rong. ere is no orm o slavery that could e justied to the enslaved. have tried to sho in previous chapters that punitive incarceration is not inherently unjust. e claim am no considering is aout hat history (not moral reection) can teach us. have several uestions aout this use o history to estalish aolitionist conclusions.

irst, ho are e to tell the dierence eteen these to pos si le states o aairs

- () t is extremely dicult to reorm practice *X*.
- () ractice *X* cannot e reormed despite our est eorts.

The historical record can establish that (1) is the case. If serious, steadfast, and repeated reform efforts have been made in the past but few if any of these efforts were successful, then there is reason to conclude that (1) is true. Genuine social reform, particularly when fundamental change is sought, can be enormously challenging to achieve. But (1) can be true while (2) is false. The reform of educational institutions in the United States has been similarly arduous and protracted, and there is much work still to be done to make them fully inclusive, fair, and effective learning environments. Yet the difficulty of such reform is not a reason to believe it cannot be accomplished. We should expect that creating just institutions will be incredibly hard and that there will be numerous setbacks. The arc of the moral universe, as Martin Luther King Jr. has taught us, is indeed long, much longer than many of us would like. This fact does not counsel patience with injustice—"freedom now" should always be our demand—but it does suggest that we should be slow to reconsider our ideals when faced with recalcitrant and entrenched power.

Moreover, radicals should be wary of relying solely on a long record of failed political efforts to show that the goal of these efforts cannot be achieved. After all, various social movements have tried to make the United States a just society—a truly democratic, egalitarian, non-sexist, and non-racist society—since its founding, and have so far been unsuccessful. Why should we think the basic structure of U. S. society can be reformed (by, for example, moving away from a capitalist economy toward a socialist one) but that prisons cannot? Simply pointing to failed reform efforts in the past is not sufficient to establish the counterfactual claim that regardless of any social changes that could e made, no set o prison reorms could mae imprisonment legitimate.

n addition, hat historical grounds do e have to elieve that it ould e more challenging to reorm prisons than to aolish them the opposition has thus ar proved so poer ul that it could successully thart all aempts at undamental reorm, hy should history give us hope that an aolitionist movement, hich involves contending ith the same reactionary orces, ould prevail What is more, the po liti cal proj ect o aolition is itsel liely to e a protracted strug gle, ith many rong turns and ailures along the ay, and ith e major victories in the short term.

One could simply concede that, try as e might, e cannot easily aolish prisons, ut insist that *if* e could do so, e should. Or reason and evidence could counsel us to expect the orst (that prisons ill remain ith us, at least or a very long time); ut aith that good shall ultimately triumph over evil urges us to hope or the est (that one day, in the distant uture, prisons ill dis appear). ut these pessimistic conclusions or millenarian hopes are not hat avis and other lie- minded activists elieve. eir aolitionism is meant as a realistic and historically grounded po liti cal goal, something not only orth realiing and hoping or ut that is realiale, through activism and organ iing eorts, in the oreseeale uture.

i nally, the prison reorm initiatives that have een tried, e should rememer, have occurred in a context o deep structural injustice. Ho do e no that, ere e successul in maing the acground social structure more just, e could not (in that ne context) ully reorm the practice o imprisonment dout that imprisonment could ecome a ully just practice when the wider social structure is profoundly marred by racism, misogyny, economic exploitation, imperialism, and poverty. But that does not mean that prison reform is impossible, only that our reform efforts should not be limited to improving prisons.

#### Utopian Reflection and Practice

I believe that radical abolitionism is utopian. This feature is, or can be, one of abolition's key virtues. Hopeful idealism and a willingness to call for fundamental social change are precisely what is needed in response to the enduring injustices, complacency, and cynicism that are so characteristic of our times. Yet utopianism is also, in other ways, among abolition's flaws, as I will explain. I begin with what makes utopian abolition valuable.

Angela Davis and other radical abolitionists oppose a "reform" framework because they believe it reinforces the ideological notion that prisons are a necessary and permanent feature of social life and prevents us from searching for and experimenting with alternatives. I am not persuaded that prison reform is impossible or that prison abolition should be a central social justice objective. Yet I do believe abolitionists are correct that we should not treat prisons as inevitable or "natural" and that a search for alternatives is entirely worthwhile. Accordingly, one way of thinking about prison abolition is as a *framework for ethical reflection*. We imagine a world without prisons and consider what attitudes, social relations, and institutions would be necessary to create and sustain that world. This is utopian thinking but in the good sense. It can allow us to gain a vantage point beyond ideological modes of thought, which function to reinforce social injustices.

By analogy, consider "poverty abolition." Rather than assume poverty will always be with us, we imagine a world without poverty, where everyone's basic needs are met. Regarding such a world as feasible can keep us from being complacent about the poverty that surrounds us. We should look beyond simply trying to "reduce" poverty or making it more bearable for those who suffer it. We then focus on constructing and experimenting with social arrangements that prioritize securing basic material well-being for everyone, without regarding our initial failures as establishing that this cannot be done. This utopian critical reflection is a healthy and potentially productive attitude to have toward prisons and poverty.

It is also crucial to contemporary socialist thought. Marx was extremely critical of utopian socialists who treated socialism as a set of ideals to be realized or who used moral arguments to effect radical social change. Marx's advocacy of socialism was, he insisted, rooted in a sober scientific analysis of capitalism and a materialist theory of historical development. Capitalism was to be abolished through militant and partisan class struggle, not through moral suasion or ordinary democratic channels. Nor did Marx do more than provide the barest sketch of a post-capitalist future.

Davis, though a former member of the Communist Party and deeply influenced by Marx, does root her socialist commitment in moral ideals like justice, freedom, community, and peace. She does not avoid moral appeals. Her case against capitalism is not grounded principally in historical materialism. Davis believes that capitalist societies are unjust, undemocratic, and needlessly violent, and these are the bases of her opposition. She also realizes that if her case is to be persuasive

(even to members of the working class), she needs to give skeptics reason to believe an alternative social arrangement is within reach and would do a better job embodying the ideals she favors. The same is true of her advocacy of a world without prisons.

In other words, Davis recognizes the need to state not only what she is against but also what she is *for* and, just as important, to show how this vision can be realized using means that are morally permissible and at our disposal. Science, while increasing our *capacity* to effect dramatic change, cannot tell us what to value, what is worth fighting for, or which tactics are legitimate. History, though it too has its vital lessons to impart, does not exhaust the scope of the possible, provides no roadmap for the future, and guarantees no victories. Moral vision and dreams of freedom are critical resources.<sup>6</sup>

Abolitionist ethical reflection can demonstrate its practical value through community-based practices that prefigure, in an incremental way, a post-carceral future. The abolitionist alternatives that Davis recommends—mental-health care, drug-abuse treatment, non-carceral rehabilitation, reparative justice, and restorative justice—could be developed and expanded now, notwithstanding the continued existence of prisons. With the widespread and effective use of these alternatives, many previously skeptical persons may come to trust them as crime-control strategies and thereby become more open to abandoning (or at least greatly limiting) the use of prisons. As Davis suggests, "The creation of new institutions that lay claim to the space now occupied by the prison can eventually start to crowd out the prison so that it would inhabit increasingly smaller areas of our social and psychic landscape."

However, I am skeptical of three utopian elements in some strains of black radicalism. The first is the appeal to "radical imagination" when such appeals are unconstrained by what we know empirically or are not grounded in scientific knowledge. There is a tendency to call for the dismantling of long-standing practices (abolition) when we do not know what effects this would have or whether the predictable consequences would be tolerable or worth the effort. Here I believe it would benefit black critical theory to reduce (not abandon) its skepticism toward mainstream empirical social science, particularly quantitative and experimental studies of the effectiveness of lawenforcement efforts (see Chapter 5).

The second is the assumption, sometimes only implicit, that all wrongful aggression must be due either to structural injustice, imperialism, or mental illness. The optimistic thought seems to be that if we were to create just societies and a just global order, and to treat (rather than punish) those with mental illnesses, prisons would be obsolete. Yet interpersonal violence was prevalent before the emergence of racism and capitalism, even before Christian and Islamic imperialism, and in a wide variety of societies. 9 Another reason to suspect that there would be serious interpersonal wrongs even under just conditions is the existence of familiar human vices such as the thirst for power, greed, jealousy, lust, and wrath. These character flaws and temptations have been present in every society of recorded history, not just in capitalist or racist societies. And they are known to lead to great wrongdoing and social strife. These ordinary human failings are core themes of world literature going back centuries, and they are objects of long-standing religious prohibition in a range of faiths. It is thereore hard to elieve that such vices ould e eradicated y a just social order or y an end to class exploitation, empire, sexism, and racism.

One hypothesis is that the prison system is a particularly egregious and salient example othese myriad orms o injustice. t serves as a microcosm o all that is rong ith existing social arrangements. erhaps it is easier or people to accept that radical social change is necessary once they have understood and contemplated the manyrongs that the prison represents.this is correct, can see the isdom o draing people's aention to the prison pro lem insoar as it helps them etter grasp the roader structural pro lem. is ind o theory and practice could unction as political pedagogy, as a method o political education and a starting point or radical po liti cal engagement. What is still lef unexplained, though, is hy po liti cal re sis tance should e or ga nied around aolishing prisons hen it is the ider structural rameor that needs to e changed.

nother hypothesis is that some aolitionists see prisons as a distinctive symptom o under lying structural injustice, a telling marer o an oppressive society. ocie ties that mae extensive use o prisons, their theory goes, do so to deal ith injustices that ould e handled eer through a structural transormation o society itsel. O course, prisons exist in every country in the orld, so the diagnosis ould have to e that all existing socie ties are unjust, perhaps ecause o their reliance on cap i tal ist practices and their endemic patriarchy and misogyny. ut rather than elaorate a conception o social or gloal justice and deend it against rival visions, these aolitionists argue that e should change society and the orld so that prisons are not needed. n a sense, that is their theory o justice: e radically transorm society so that it is unnecessary to impose incarceration to deal ith social pro lems, justice ould then (more or less) have een realied.

Yet this approach to critical theory and social change evades crucial and controversial uestions o po liti cal morality. What are the princi ples o justice that e ought to realie, and hich easile orms o social lie ould satisy these princi ples it turns out (as thin it does) that prisons are not inherently unjust and may e socially necessary even in a just social order, then the theory ails to identiy hat our most asic po liti cal aims ought to e. rison aolition ould then e an admirale ut misdirected movement. Moreover, y using this approach prison as reliale proxy or systemic injustice—e ris alienating potential allies in the strug gle or structural transormation y creating polariing disagreements over issues that are not undamentally at stae. ill illustrate this point y returning to avis.

Drawing inspiration from Du Bois's idea of "abolition democracy," Davis argues that social justice requires more than ending unjust practices. It must also include building new and more democratic institutions. In the case of unjust societies that rely heavily on prisons, she takes this argument a step further. 11 She argues that prisons are a reliable sign that fully democratic institutions have yet to be established. Part of imprisonment's function is to mitigate or contain the antisocial consequences of social problems—poverty, homelessness, inadequate education, drug abuse, lack of health care, and so on—that only a just social structure can truly solve. These social problems encourage criminal activity, which funnels the oppressed, neglected, and marginalized into prisons, only to release them even worse off. Those heavily burdened and marginalized by structural injustice cannot readily live crime-free lives without greater material resources, political empowerment, and basic social services. Deep structural and institutional reform of society would therefore, on Davis's account, make prisons unnecessary.

But this argument suggests that prisons are still necessary now, until such structural transformation has been brought about. Indeed, Davis says, "[Prisons] cannot, therefore, be eliminated unless new institutions and resources are made available to those communities that provide, in large part, the human beings that make up the prison population." Prisons are not, then, obsolete. However, according to Davis, we should, through protracted and militant political struggle if necessary, do everything in our power to make them obsolete. We do this, in part, by creating genuinely democratic institutions that reject racism in all its forms and that show equal respect and concern for everyone. These institutions should extend to political economy, which would mean not structuring social life around private wealth accumulation and the pursuit of profit.

However, if the existence of prisons is not a reliable sign of structural injustice (because, say, imprisonment can be an effective and legitimate response to the problem of serious crime), then the debate between prison reformers and abolitionists is a red herring and a distraction from what could be a more basic common objective. I have argued that we have good reasons to believe prisons can be reformed and not much reason to think we will ever fully transcend our need for prisons. I strongly agree that there are far too many people in prison due to structural injustice, but this does not mean that prisons would be obsolete were justice realized. If I am right, it is the existence of a vast prison population with a strikingly disproportionate representation of stigmatized and disadvantaged social groups that is a sign of structural injustice. It is not the existence of prisons per se.

Nevertheless, and this is the key point, both prison reformers and abolitionists can, and should, share a goal: to fundamentally change the social conditions that so often give rise to the need for punitive incarceration. Davis's four measures—greater access to mental-health care, drug treatment, rehabilitation services, and mechanisms for transformative justice—are good places to start. In societies like the United States, the kind of reform I favor would also include a restricted moratorium on the use of prisons (which would be used to punish only the most serious crimes) and on the use of certain policing tactics (those that needlessly bring the police into close contact with black people), joined with a commitment to broader structural reform.

The latter point is critical, because without a demonstrated commitment to structural reform from officials and from the public, imprisonment as a practice lacks legitimacy. The poor and racially stigmatized (who constitute most current and former prisoners in the United States) would have strong reasons to doubt that the criminal justice system serves to protect their interests even if due process procedures were scrupulously followed. If the structure of a society is deeply unjust, the oppressed will naturally conclude that penal policies are designed to protect the possessions and personal safety of the affluent and powerful at the expense of the disadvantaged and marginalized.

When I say that, upon reflection, I remain a reformer rather than an abolitionist, the scope of reform I imagine is not limited to prisons or policing or even to the criminal justice system more broadly. Like Davis, I think criminal justice reform is grossly inadequate unless it includes fighting for broader economic and racial justice. And such structural reform can also help to prevent crime.

For instance, the property-crime rate is *highly* sensitive to employment and wage rates. <sup>13</sup> Property crimes generally decline when employment and wages improve for low-skilled young men, and they rise when joblessness becomes more common and wages drop. Given the extreme wealth concentration, income inequality, and high rates of poverty that currently exist, corrective justice in the economic sphere is called for, independently of crime-control concerns. Many already have a legitimate claim on a fairer tax and subsidy scheme and on a job that pays a living wage or on a guaranteed basic income. Even setting aside these considerations of economic justice, if we want to prevent crime without relying primarily on prisons, then improving the economic circumstances of low-skilled young males would go a long way.

Rape, murder, and aggravated assault are much less responsive to labor market improvements, unfortunately. This is not surprising, given that such violence is often driven by motives other than money. Robbery, though a violent crime, is generally motivated by the prospects of material gain and so could be reduced by economic justice measures.

Prisons in the United States are disproportionately filled with black people, most of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds or neighborhoods, and who have been convicted of property crimes, robbery, or drug offenses. As discussed in Chapter 3, extrinsic institutional racism in the criminal justice system reinforces stereotypes about black criminality, engenders fear of black males, and generally stigmatizes black people as deviant. These racial disparities in incarceration could be reduced through policy changes in law enforcement and sentencing. But we can also reduce them by preventing discrimination in the labor market and enhancing educational and economic opportunities for low-skilled black people.

There is no question that incarceration is grossly overused. It is sometimes dehumanizing; frequently abused; poorly administered; inadequately funded; and too closely tied to corporate profit. Far too often prisons are a vehicle for racial domination, economic exploitation, and political repression. Still, I am not convinced that abolishing prisons is morally required—or, at the moment, wise.

n the nites tates, grave acground injustices (discrimination, ailures in education, poverty, in euality, and so on) shape the amitions and volition o some ho commit crimes. Many are deeply disadvantaged y past or ongoing injustices, hich can lead them to commit unlaul and sometimes violent acts— either out o need, rustration, despair, alienation, or de ance. o protect the vulnerale rom rongul aggression, it may e necessary to sentence the most violent o these oppressed oenders to prison. is should e done reluctantly, ith adeuate support or reentry, and only afer less harmul mea sures have een tried ut ailed.

What is most needed no is not so much to aolish prisons ut to redress the systemic injustices that too oten lead to crime and to the imprisonment o the oppressed. Or to put it in a slogan: on't aolish the prison; aolish the gheo.

Some prisons (for example, many minimum-to-low-security prisons) are internally organized with prisoners quartered in large rooms with many occupants, in cubicle quarters, or in open dormitories. Small cells for one or two occupants are most common in medium-to-maximum-security prisons, where prisoners have committed violent offenses or have a history of violence toward other prisoners or prison staff. Where higher levels of security are necessary, the cell does, however, lessen the need for supervisory personnel and so may save money. It can also reduce the need for constant surveillance (to prevent harm or escape) and so could (at least when limited to one occupant) also provide some privacy for prisoners.

- 19. Prisoners are deprived of some ordinary rights to protect prisoners and prison staff and to prevent escape. Custodial care and the imposition of sentences require these interferences with prisoners' freedom. But perhaps beyond these, prisoners should retain their full rights where feasible. One issue is that many rights prisoners might like to claim (and whose exercise wouldn't interfere with the imposition of their sentence) would cost the public to facilitate (for example, communications with the outside world through mail delivery, internet service, or phone service). Most of these costs the public can be expected to absorb, as they are not high or are made artificially high due to monopoly. There is, however, a question of how far the public should be expected to go in facilitating the exercise of prisoner's rights. There is also a question of whether prisoners can be expected to help cover these costs.

- 20. I should note that there are some radical abolitionists who believe that we should never resort to the practice of psychiatric incarceration, not even for suicidal adolescents or for mentally ill persons who pose a grave danger to others. Here, confinement and segregation are regarded as components of a "carceral logic" that must always be opposed and that no cost-benefit analysis could ever justify.

Influential contemporary defenses of philosophical anarchism include Robert Paul Wolff, *In Defense of Anarchism* (New York: Harper & Row, 1970); A. John Simmons, *On the Edge of Anarchy* (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993).

- 37. Paying prisoners below a market wage might drive down wages for those not incarcerated, so that might be a reason to pay market wages. However, the wrong of not doing so, if it's a wrong, would not be a wrong to prisoners. For a historical perspective on this long-standing issue, see Rebecca M. Mc Lennan, *The Crisis of Imprisonment: Protest, Politics, and the Making of the American Penal State,* 1776–1941 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008).

- 5. There is an important debate over the validity and centrality of functional explanation in Marxist social theory. For example, G. A. Cohen has argued that the central claims of historical materialism (Marx's theory of history) are not coherent or plausible unless functional explanation is a valid form of scientific explanation. I will not weigh in on this debate but will assume that at least some forms of functional explanation are valid. For details, see G. A. Cohen, *Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defense*, Expanded Edition (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000), chaps. 9–10. For criticisms of functional explanation in the context of Marxist theory, see Jon Elster, "Marxism, Functionalism, and Game Theory," in *Debates In Contemporary Political Philosophy: An Anthology*, ed. Derek Matravers and Jon Pike (London: Routledge, 1990), 22–40.
- 6. For instance, influential abolitionist organizer Mariame Kaba says: "Importantly, we must reject all talk about policing and the overall criminal punishment system being 'broken' or 'not working.' By rhetorically constructing the criminal punishment system as 'broken,' reform is reaffirmed and abolition is painted as unrealistic and unworkable."

But America's local, state, and federal penal systems are complex assemblages of laws, policies, and practices, which have emerged and evolved over time. Far from being the realization of some national plan, what we call "mass incarceration" is the cumulative result of multiple contributing causes, operating at distinct governmental levels, prompted by different events and considerations, involving diverse political actors and coalitions, and enacted in thousands of laws, policies, and enforcement practices."

But what if relying solely on prison alternatives to deal with violent crime would cost the public a lot, say, two or three times as much? For example, home confinement and electronic monitoring with ample law enforcement nearby to prevent unauthorized movement might be effective but financially costly. Could a society still be just (though not perfectly good) if it chose to rely on prisons rather than pay these higher costs? I'm not sure how to answer this question, but I think it's worth asking.
