### Journal Information

Social Justice is a quarterly journal that was founded in 1974. It seeks to promote human dignity, equality, peace, and genuine security. Its early focus on crime, police repression, social control, and the penal system has expanded to encompass globalization, human and civil rights, border, citizenship, and immigration issues, environmental victims and health and safety concerns, social policies affecting welfare and education, ethnic and gender relations, and persistent global inequalities. The journal has framed its vision of social justice with an understanding of the international dimensions of power, inequality, and injustice. It presents divergent viewpoints in a readable fashion for concerned citizens with an interest in current affairs, while including ample notes and references to satisfy the academic reader.

## Publisher Information

Social Justice is a project of Global Options, a tax-exempt educational and research organization. Crime and Social Justice (the journal's original title) merged with Issues in Criminology in 1976.
