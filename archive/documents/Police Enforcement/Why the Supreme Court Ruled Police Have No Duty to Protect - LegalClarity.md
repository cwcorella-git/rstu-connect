# Why the Supreme Court Ruled Police Have No Duty to Protect

Learn the constitutional distinction between limiting state power and guaranteeing individual protection, and how this shapes the legal duties of the police.

A common perception in the United States is that police have a legal obligation to protect individuals from harm, but this is not the case under federal law. The U. S. Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that law enforcement agencies do not have a constitutional duty to protect a person from the criminal acts of another. This principle stems from specific interpretations of the Constitution and has been shaped by decades of legal precedent.

#### The Foundational Supreme Court Rulings

The modern understanding of this legal principle was shaped by the 1989 case De Shaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services. The case involved Joshua De Shaney, a young boy who suffered permanent brain damage after being severely abused by his father. Despite numerous reports of the abuse to the county's social services department, the agency failed to remove Joshua from his father's custody. His mother sued, arguing the county's failure to act violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.

The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, rejected this argument. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist concluded that the Due Process Clause is a limitation on the state's power to act, not a guarantee of safety from private violence. The Court reasoned that the Constitution's purpose is to protect people from the state itself, not to ensure the state protects them from each other, so the county was not liable.

This precedent was reinforced in the 2005 case Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales. Jessica Gonzales had obtained a restraining order against her estranged husband. When her husband abducted their three daughters, she repeatedly called the Castle Rock police for help, but they failed to enforce the order. Her husband subsequently murdered all three children, and Gonzales sued the town, claiming the police had deprived her of a property interest in the order's enforcement without due process.

The Supreme Court disagreed, ruling 7-2 against Gonzales. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, held that the enforcement of a restraining order was not a mandatory entitlement but was subject to police discretion. The Court determined that a

constitutional violation.

## The Legal Reasoning Explained

The legal theory underpinning these decisions rests on the "public duty doctrine." This doctrine establishes that a government official's duty, such as that of a police officer, is owed to the general public, not to any single individual. Unless a specific promise of protection has been made to a person, the police are not legally liable for failing to prevent a crime, as this general duty does not translate into a specific duty to one person.

This concept is clarified by the distinction between "negative" and "positive" rights. The U. S. Constitution is primarily a charter of negative rights, specifying what the government cannot do, such as restricting speech or depriving a person of liberty without due process. Conversely, the Constitution does not grant "positive rights," which would be an entitlement to receive services from the government. A right to police protection would be a positive right, and the Supreme Court's rulings affirm the Fourteenth Amendment does not create such an obligation.

## The Special Relationship Exception

An exception to this general rule exists when a "special relationship" is formed between an individual and the state. This relationship is not created by simply asking for help but arises when the state takes an individual into its custody, restricting their ability to care for themselves. Common examples include incarceration, involuntary commitment, or placing a child in foster care. Because the state has deprived them of their freedom to act on their own behalf, the Constitution imposes a duty to provide reasonable protection.

A related concept is the "state-created danger" theory. Under this doctrine, a state may be held liable if its own actions create or exacerbate a danger to an individual. This is a narrow exception and requires proving that the state's conduct placed a person in a worse position than they would have been in otherwise. It is not enough that the state failed to prevent a danger; it must have played a part in creating it.

## State Laws and Protections

While the U. S. Constitution does not mandate a duty to protect, state laws and constitutions can offer greater protections. The Supreme Court's rulings establish a minimum for constitutional rights, but states are free to provide more expansive rights through their own legal frameworks. A police department might be shielded from liability under federal law but could still be held accountable under a specific state statute.

Some state legislatures have enacted laws that impose a duty on police to act in certain situations, like responding to domestic violence calls or enforcing restraining orders. Similarly, some state courts have interpreted their own laws to recognize a duty to
