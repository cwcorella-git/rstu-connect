# [9] INTRODUCTION

On May 8, 1888, the Brazilian minister of agriculture, Rodrigo Augusto da Silva, came before the lower house of the nation's legislature, the Chamber of Deputies, to propose a project of the executive branch, a law to abolish the institution of slavery. A committee created by the Chamber to study the proposal immediately gave its support, calling for an urgent vote on the measure. In the report presented by Deputy Duarte de Azevedo, he said that the committee was convinced that it was impossible to delay for even a moment "the long aspiration of the Brazilian people... a social and political necessity". He characterized abolition as "an act of homage to the century's civilization, and to the generosity of heart of all those who love humanity's common good". His words were met with applause and shouts of jubilation from the full gallery and from every corner of the Chamber itself. Outside, a crowd of more than five thousand people had gathered to witness the proceedings.

After the proposal of a few amendments and a brief discussion, the deputies dispensed with customary formalities and moved in record time to a vote. Eighty-three deputies voted in favor, and only nine voted against. They all belonged to the Conservative Party, and eight of them represented a single province, Rio de Janeiro — the last refuge of slavery. The great coffee planters of the decadent areas of the Paraíba valley, through the [10] votes of their representatives, were giving voice to their determined opposition to a measure that would deal a final death blow to their already shaky fortunes. For them, abolition without any compensation for slaveowners was a blow from which they could scarcely recover. There was nothing they could do, however, to prevent the approval of the law. It was impossible to contain the vibrant enthusiasm of those more fortunate whites for whom abolition would not be a mortal wound.

After it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies, the measure was sent to the Senate, where it provoked a similar exhilaration. Charged with the same sense of urgency, the senators approved it on May 13, sending it on to the Regent, Princess Isabel, the current head of state. That afternoon, she signed the law that became known in Brazilian history as the Lei Áurea [The Golden Law]. In celebration of the moment of abolition, May 13 became a national holiday, and the Chamber of Deputies commemorated the occasion with a five-day recess.

More than 700,000 slaves — most of them in the provinces of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro — were thus transformed overnight into free persons. In plantation slave quarters and in the communities of fugitive slaves known as quilombos, ex-slaves celebrated their liberty. Newspapers praised the law of abolition with page after page of commemoration. In the streets of towns and cities, the people loudly voiced their enthusiasm for the end of slavery.

Thus, by a simple legislative act endorsed by the Crown and acclaimed by most of the population, a major institution that had been in place for more than three hundred years was simply eliminated. However long and difficult had been the paths to this moment, in the end it proved unnecessary to plunge the nation into a civil war, as had happened in the United States. There, slaves gained their freedom after a long and cruel war in which the slaveowners fought to preserve their slave property from massive armed attack by the armies of the Union. And, despite the fears of some slaveholders, there was no surge of inter-racial violence such as had occurred a century before in Santo Domingo (now the Dominican Republic and Haiti), between slaves and their French masters. In Brazil, the catastrophes forecast by those who expected the country's economy to collapse also did not [11] occur. After a very brief period of uncertainty, life returned to normal. Both in the cities and on the plantations, production quickly resumed its customary pace.

For a few of large plantations owners, abolition did mean ruin and a precipitous loss of status — "a horrible blow", said one of them. Or, in the words of one descendent of a slave owner, "it was the worst assault that until now has been perpetrated against private property". Those who had hoped to be compensated for the loss of their slaves saw their dream vanish. Embittered, they turned against the government they thought had brought ruin upon them. But their resentments and protests were lost among the jubilant shouts of the ex-slaves, and the cheers of all the other people who had identified themselves with the cause of abolition.

In June 1888, the Chamber of Deputies, in its answer to the Crown's formal Speech from the Throne, responded to Princess Isabel in very strong terms:

We freed ourselves, Madam, from the ominous legacy that we had maintained until today solely to avoid distressing our agricultural industry; we restored to human beings those forums essential to their dignity in light of the principle of political equality; we consecrated the principle of the uniformity of civil status and thus eliminated from our legislation the only exception repugnant to the moral basis of national law and to the liberal spirit of modern institutions.

This fact, which bears witness to our social and political advancement, and which should add to the consideration that Brazil deserves from civilized nations, was loudly applauded inside and outside the Empire.1

With this declaration, the Chamber of Deputies considered its obligations to the former slaves to be completed. It had accomplished its mission: to liberate white men from the weight of slavery and from the contradictions that existed between slavery and the liberal principles embraced by the Brazilian [12] Constitution of 1824. They had removed the stain of backwardness that they believed had shamed the nation before the world. Brazil was the last independent nation in the western world to eliminate slavery! For a majority of the members of parliament, who had worked for abolition, the question was now settled. The ex-slaves were to be left to their own devices. It would be up to them, from now on, to convert their emancipation into reality. The law might guarantee them formally the judicial status of free persons, but it did not provide them with the means to make their freedom effective. Legal equality was not sufficient to eliminate the enormous social distances and prejudices that three centuries of bondage had created. The Lei Áurea abolished slavery, but not its legacies. Three hundred years of oppression are not annulled by the stroke of a pen. Abolition was only the first step in the direction of true emancipation. Still, abolition was a conquest, if only of incomplete effect. And it is the story of this conquest that we will tell here.

When we examine the events that led up to abolition, a number of questions arise: why, for instance, was an institution that had been accepted without serious objection suddenly repudiated in 1888? Why was the project of abolition set in motion with such sudden urgency? How can we explain why so many members of the legislature, including those who had been elected with the support of slaveowners, approved the law almost without debate? Why did the slaves' masters not try to prevent, with arms in their hands, this attack on their property, which was actually guaranteed by the Constitution? What role did the slaves and free blacks play in this process? Why did abolition take so long in Brazil? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in the chapters that follow.

#### [13] CHAPTER 1

# FROM THE DEFENSE OF SLAVERY TO ITS CONDEMNATION

For three hundred years, from the sixteenth through the eighteenth century, slavery was routinely practiced and accepted by Brazil's dominant classes without any serious questioning of the legitimacy of bondage. Many even justified slavery with the argument that it rescued Africans from their lives of ignorance and converted them to Christianity. This conversion liberated them from sin and opened the door to eternal salvation. In this fashion, enslavement might even be considered a grand blessing for the blacks! For us today, such argument may seem to be merely cynical, but at the time it had persuasive power. The social order was considered an outcome of the workings of Divine Providence, and thus not open to question. The common belief was that it was God's will that some were born nobles and others plebeians, some rich and others poor, some free and others slaves. According to this notion, it was not man's place to meddle with the social order. And so, justified by religion and sanctioned by church and by state, slavery was simply not questioned. The Church limited itself to counseling patience to the slaves and benevolence to their masters.

It is not difficult to imagine the effects of such ideas. They permitted the dominant classes to enslave blacks without any pangs of conscience. During the colonial period, the very few individuals who broke the norm and criticized the slave trade [14] and even cast doubt on the legitimacy of slavery itself, were expelled from the colony, and the slave trade continued without impediment. Only the slaves themselves found fault with their bondage, manifesting their ideas through escape and rebellion. But they not only found little sympathy among free people, but instead encountered fierce repression.

## Liberalism and Slavery

But in the course of the eighteenth century, doctrinal and supernatural justifications of slavery were contested. In its struggle to dismantle the ancien régime, the European bourgeoisie created new concepts that little by little began to undermine the world view that had justified the traditional social order. With the goal of combating the ancient privileges that had cemented the existing social and political order, the revolutionaries of the eighteenth century repudiated the idea of the divine right of kings, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the people, demanding the creation of representative forms of government. They also affirmed the supremacy of civil law and the natural rights of man, among them the right to property and liberty, and they insisted on the equality of all before the law.

The theoretical origins of abolitionism were rooted in these revolutionary ideas of the eighteenth century. Until then, slavery was seen as the ordained effect of divine design. Now, slavery would begin to be understood as a creation of the human will and therefore transitory and revocable. While, in the past, slavery had been considered a divine remedy for the vices and ignorance of the Africans, it was now coming to be seen by some people that vice and ignorance were actually the results of slavery. The terms of the equation were being inverted. People began to criticize slavery in terms of morality, religion, and economic rationality. For them, slavery was incompatible with Christianity, slave labor less productive than free, and slavery itself an institution that corrupted morals and customs.

While in Europe the bourgeois revolution was producing its intellectual fruits, in Brazil, those colonists who increasingly felt oppressed by Portuguese policies enthusiastically embraced [15] the new revolutionary ideas. But for such colonists, some deep contradictions lay at the heart of those very ideas. How could they reconcile their rights to their own slave property with the right of the slaves (as human beings) to their own liberty? How could they harmonize the necessary subjection of the slaves with their equality before the law, which, according to the new political philosophy, was an inalienable right of all mankind?

In Brazil, slaves and free blacks quickly grasped the revolutionary significance of the new ideas. Just as quickly, the slave masters became aware of the dilemma that those ideas created. In 1789, when dissatisfied colonists in Minas Gerais, in a movement known as the Inconfidência Mineira, contemplated the possibility of an uprising against the Portuguese administration, they asked themselves if it would be possible even to begin a revolution against Portugal without first freeing their slaves. They recognized how much the colonial elite depended on slave labor, but they also worried that in the midst of an insurrection it would be impossible to control the slave masses, who would surely be emboldened by the new notions of universal liberty and equality.

A few years later, it became clear that such worries were not unfounded. In 1798, a mixed group of slaves, mulattoes and free blacks was condemned in Bahia for promoting "the abominable French principles" and for conspiring against the constituted order. The group accused of participating in the "Bahian Conspiracy" — like many other revolutionaries to come had not actually read the great authors of the French Enlightenment such as Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu, or Raynal, so celebrated among intellectuals of the period. But they had grasped, in their own fashion, the straightforward message of liberty and equality of the new revolutionary ideology. The Bahian conspirators certainly knew little of the French, but France could still serve as a symbol of the yearning for freedom. The fierce repression visited upon them for promoting "French principles" only seemed to reinforce the symbolic connection between France and liberty. The authorities were identified as oppression, the principles of the Enlightenment with freedom. As a result, the repression itself only contribuited to give more power to these ideas.

Inevitably, the new ideological discourse had many interpretations, and its symbols many meanings. Each social group [16] understood the new set of revolutionary ideas in its own way, and since society was divided into groups with contradictory interests — masters who wanted to keep their slaves in captivity, and slaves who wanted freedom — the reading of the revolutionary primer was equally contradictory. Revolutionary rhetoric and symbolism, with its abstract and universalizing spirit, might temporarily conceal this fundamental difference. But practical experience would very soon expose it.

At the time of Independence, the slaves' hopes were frustrated. The new Constitution of 1824 actually included an article that transcribed, virtually word for word, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (1789), which affirmed that liberty was an inalienable right of men. Nevertheless, about half the total population of Brazil remained enslaved. The Constitution simply ignored the slaves. In fact, it did not even acknowledge their existence. The constitutional guarantees of rights simply did not apply to them.

Despite the Constitution's flagrant disregard for the humanity of the slave, its abstract consecration of liberal principles was the first step toward the creation of a critical public conscience concerning the system of slavery. The question that would arise, from that point onward, was how to justify slavery in a society that was explicitly committed to liberal notions of liberty and equality? How to deny to the slaves the human rights that, in principle, belonged to all.

During the period of Independence, and for many years after, a majority of Brazil's dominant class continued to depend entirely on the labor of slaves. Given this, it simply turned a deaf ear to the arguments of the few people who, guided by the Enlightenment ideas in vogue in Europe, insisted on the contradiction between liberalism and slavery and condemned slavery in moral, religious, and economic terms.

## The Enlightenment Discourse

The few members of the dominant class who, at the time of Independence and after, diverged from the prevailing discourse and condemned slavery were hardly typical of the Brazilian elite. [17] For reasons having to do with family history, or with their own professional careers, they did not identify entirely with their own social class. Hipólito da Costa, for example, was one of the first to publicly criticize slavery; but he did so in a periodical published not in Brazil but in London, the Correio Braziliense [The Brazilian Mail]. He lived in England, in easy contact with the new liberal ideas. Not surprisingly, then, he could write as early as 1811

that slavery was contrary to the laws of nature and to the moral dispositions of mankind, and recommend the replacement of slave by free labor.

No more typical of the ruling elite was José Severiano Maciel da Costa, author of Memória sobre a necessidade de abolir a introdução de escravos africanos no Brasil [Memorial Upon the Need to Abolish the Introduction of African Slaves Into Brazil] (1821). He called for the immediate abolition of the slave trade, and suggested ways to remedy the scarcity of free labor. But, as with Hipólito da Costa, his attitudes were not typical of the Brazilian elite.

Though Maciel da Costa was educated at the Portuguese University of Coimbra (like many other sons of important Brazilian families), he did not, like most, immediately return to Brazil. He was appointed a magistrate in Portugal, and became an administrator in the service of the Crown. From 1808 to 1817, he served as governor of French Guiana. During these early years, he became an ardent admirer of the usual French intellectuals and also of important English writers such as Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham. His years of living abroad allowed him a certain distancing from the most immediate interests of the Brazilian elite — many of whose attitudes he actually shared. Like other members of his social class, he was horrified by bloody slave uprisings in Santo Domingo and Barbados, thus feared that something similar might happen in Brazil. He worried that the slaves, contaminated by notions of liberty and equality, might massacre whites. But Maciel da Costa's criticism of slavery was not just the result of such apprehensions. It was born, above all, of his conviction — characteristic of European bourgeois thought — that slave labor actually produced less profit than free labor, and also inhibited the growth of industries. This view was not shared by most of the slaveholders of the time. But, [18] despite the seeming "progressive" nature of his proposal to end the slave trade, his arguments struck a strong note of racism quite typical of the slaveholding class. Among the negative effects of slavery that he criticized was that slavery was responsible for the "bastardization" of the Portuguese "race".

The ideas of the patriarch of independence, José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva, were not very different. In 1823 he wrote Representação à Assembleia Constituinte [Representation to the Constituent Assembly]. As it happened, the Representação was published in France in 1825, but was never formally presented to this constitutional convention before it was dissolved in 1824

by the Emperor. José Bonifácio argued that it was impossible to have an enduring constitution in a land where a majority of the population was enslaved. He believed that slavery was a nefarious institution that corrupted morals and customs and inhibited the progress of the country. But, like Maciel da Costa or Hipólito da Costa, he was hardly representative of the dominant elite. He had spent most of his life in Portugal, first as a student and then as a functionary of the royal government. He held important offices in the Portuguese administration before finally returning to Brazil at the age of fifty-six. He had already spent ten years traveling in Europe, visiting many countries. When he returned to Brazil on the eve of independence, after more than thirty years abroad, he brought with him an enormous amount of cultural baggage. An avid reader and an inquisitive spirit, both scientist and humanist, a worldly man of much experience, José Bonifácio soon became a confidant of Prince Dom Pedro, and played an important role in the eventual proclamation of independence. But he soon alienated the Brazilian political elite, which could not tolerate his criticisms of slavery and his proposal to end the slave trade. Irritated with what seemed to them José Bonifácio's very radical ideas, slaveowners and slave traders joined together to do everything possible to remove him from power.

Despite their criticisms of slavery, neither Maciel da Costa nor José Bonifácio ever came close to advocating the immediate end of slavery. They both perceived the emancipation of the slaves as a delicate matter, very difficult to resolve. They both argued that in order for abolition to be decreed, there must first [19] be a series of measures designed to ease a gradual transition from slave to free labor.

# Pro-Slavery Discourse

While these few isolated voices denounced the incompatibility between slavery and Christianity (that incompatibility so rarely perceived during the colonial period), while they enlarged upon the conflict between slavery and the liberal principles that had inspired the Constitution, while they condemned slave labor as being less productive than free, and while they denounced the demoralizing effects of slavery upon morality and customs, the great majority of the free population continued to ignore their arguments and to oppose any action against the slave trade or any step toward the gradual extinction of slavery.

The same arguments continued to be used in defense of slavery that had been in vogue since the colonial period. One common argument was that their bondage actually benefited the slaves because it removed them from African barbarism and introduced them to the civilized and Christian world. Another was that the slaves were simply not able to survive in freedom. Some recognized that slavery could be condemned in moral terms, but that it was a necessary evil, since the national economy simply could not function without the slaves. According to them, the end of slavery would bring about the ruin of the country. This was the position that gradually came to predominate among the Brazilian elites. Given this conceptual maneuver, the representatives of the nation could proclaim the liberal ideals in Parliament or in Provincial Assemblies, all the while continuing to import slaves from Africa in increasing numbers, to meet the growing practical demand for more laborers.

# Radical Discourse

Criticism of slavery may not have found much of an echo among the elites that dominated Brazilian society, confined as it was to a tiny enlightened and europeanized minority; but it [20] did gain some traction among ordinary people in urban areas. In the numerous popular satirical leaflets (pasquins) that circulated in the streets of the cities, there were frequent criticisms of slavery, the slave trade, and of the prevailing forms of racism. These attacks were expressions of small groups of radicals who kept themselves on a combat footing in various parts of the country, and broke into the open in revolts like the Confederation of the Equator (1824), various rebellions during the period of the Regency (1831-1842), and the Pernambucan Revolution of 1848-50, which became known as the Revolução Praieira, or The Beach Revolution.

In light of the very large number of pasquins that have survived until today, it is possible to reconstitute this radical, essentially Jacobin, mode of thought — even though the current state of historical research does not enable us to say much about who actually read these leaflets. Most of them were printed in batches of a few hundred copies, and had very brief lives. Only rarely did one of them achieve greater circulation, as did the famous O Progresso, with its four thousand copies. The publishers of the pasquins were a varied lot: unemployed intellectuals, pharmacists, doctors, and other individuals — all improvised journalists — who appointed themselves the spokesmen of slaves, free blacks, artisans and petty merchants. Some of these radical authors and publishers became full-time professionals, and frequently the same man published numerous pasquins at various places and times.

The pasquins were expressions of class and racial conflict, which, during the period of Independence and after, frequently took the form of attacks on the elites and on the government. Because of this, the authors of the pasquins frequently had to confront the police, and their lives were punctuated by periods of prison or exile. A few of the less fortunate were condemned to death for their involvement in revolutionary activities. Such was the case of the famous Frei Caneca, who was accused of publishing "incendiary writings". Along with ten comrades, he was convicted of sedition and put to death in 1824.

Individuals of exalted spirit and caustic language, these pamphleteers were the legitimate spokesmen of radical or Jacobin ideas. Some were white, but others were black, like Luis [21] Ciriaco da Silva, or mulattoes like Antônio Pedro de Figueiredo, the editor of O Progresso, a periodical that circulated in Recife from June 1846 to September 1848. Some were more consistent than others, and we can follow them from pasquim to pasquim, agitating for the same causes, year after year. Others, like Torres Homem, began by attacking the government and eventually supported it. Many of them were of humble origin — men who acquired enough education to be able to transform themselves into public spokesmen for the oppressed. They enlisted under the banner of the Liberal Radical opposition, and placed their pens at the service of all the discontented.

The golden moment of these pamphleteers was the Regency (1831-40), when contradictions of class flowered into a series of revolts, and the struggles for power were intensified. The voices of Brazil's Jacobins made themselves heard during the numerous uprisings of the period. The pasquins of that decade are full of attacks on unproductive land grants, criticisms of slavery, proposals for emancipation, denunciations of racial prejudice, attacks on foreigners who were invading Brazilian markets and controlling commerce and destroying local artisanal producers, censures of abuses committed by the dominant classes, criticisms of political centralization, lifetime Senate terms, and the Council of State. *A Nova Luz Brasileira* [The New Brazilian Light], the property of Ezequiel Correia dos Santos and João Batista de Queiroz, is a very good example of this type of periodical.

These kinds of Jacobin writings appear to have given voice to the social visions of artisans, petty shopkeepers, junior military officers, and other petty-bourgeois urban groups, indignant over the increasing control of commerce by foreigners, the invasion of local markets by European products, the devaluation of the currency, an increasing inflation, and the control of the state apparatus by a small minority with elitist and ultraconservative attitudes. Many of the common people in the cities were free blacks and mulattoes — which clearly helps to explain the pamphleteers' denunciations of racism and their sympathetic advocacy of emancipation.

This advocacy of emancipation did not coalesce into an organized movement during the first half of the nineteenth century. During this period, the theme of slavery and the slave [22] trade was still a subdued note in the orchestration of the multiple discontents that found expression in the political battles of this agitated period of the history of the Empire. One by one, the insurrections of the Regency were steadily repressed by a government that, after yielding in the Additional Act of 1834 to demands for increased provincial autonomy, became more and more concerned with maintaining the "social order". The popular revolts of the 1830s and 1840s stunned the elites and prodded them toward increasingly conservative positions. Balaios, cabanos, farrapos, praieros, and many other participants of popular revolts that dared to challenge the hegemony of the elites were silenced. The second half of the century began under the aegis of a prosperous elite and an apparently stable government of political conciliation. But prosperity and stability continued to depend on slave labor. And the elite continued to be dependent on the institution of slavery.

# [23] CHAPTER 2 ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADE

Estimates of the population of Brazil at the time of Independence are not very reliable, but it is possible to calculate that, of a total of a little over 3.5 million inhabitants, about 1.5 million were slaves. At that time, they were concentrated in the sugar-producing areas of the northeast (54 per cent) and in the old mining areas (20 per cent). In Rio de Janeiro, where the national capital was located, there was also a considerable concentration of slaves, and this was growing because, in outlying areas, landowners had begun to plant coffee, a product which would come to constitute the great wealth of the nation. In these three areas, taken together, lived more than 85 per cent of the slaves.

On the great plantations and in the smaller farms, in the cities and in the countryside, the slaves were the principal labor force. Peddlers, artisans, porters, domestic servants, carters, most of them slaves, thronged the streets of the cities in their incessant toil.

Travelers who visited Brazil in the period were unanimous in their observation that the most humble of men, as soon as he could put together a little money, would purchase a slave, and start to live on the labor of his new property. To own slaves was the ideal of the great majority of whites who, with rare exceptions, appeared to perceive no other way of solving the labor problem. So it is not surprising that, after independence, despite the government's promise to England that it would put an end to the slave trade, the traffic continued unabated.

## [24] England's Position

It was international pressure that led finally to the approval of the Law of 1831, which prohibited the slave trade. Most of the pressure came from England. After Britain's Parliament prohibited the slave trade in its own colonies in 1807, England became the champion of emancipation, and its naval vessels began to interdict slave ships of other countries on the high seas. Frequently, slavers bound for Brazilian ports were captured by British warships. This gave rise to interminable legal disputes, provoking great irritation among those who wanted the traffic to continue. They accused the English not only of violating Brazil's national sovereignty, but of plotting the ruin of the country's economy. Even an author like Maciel da Costa, who condemned slavery and advocated the end of the slave trade, accused England of bad faith. England, he said, "struggled with such insistence for the universal abolition of the slave trade, because she intended to ruin the agriculture of the Caribbean colonies of France and Holland, and to create obstacles to Brazilian prosperity". Another writer, Domingo Alves Branco, accused the British government of wanting to subjugate all other nations to its power. The British policy toward the slave trade, he said, though represented as an altruistic act "under the holy name of zeal for liberty", had no other real purpose than to bring Brazil to ruin. Those who defended the slave trade were even more critical: they accused England of hypocrisy, pointing out that English companies operating in Brazil had no scruples about owning slaves. And they insinuated that Africans aboard ships the British navy seized were actually transported to British colonies in Africa, where they were subject to the usual forms of bondage.

## Economic Dependence

Despite such protests, it proved difficult to resist English pressure. After Independence, Brazil had become a virtual British colony, as a result of its extreme economic dependence on England. This dependence began when France invaded Portugal, and the Portuguese Crown and Court removed to Brazil in 1808. [25] The Emperor, Dom João VI, granted important commercial privileges to the British, as a compensation for aid the English had given him at the time. As a result of commercial treaties signed in 1810, England came to have a privileged position in Brazilian markets. Thanks to favorable tariffs, British products invaded Brazil's domestic commerce. Simultaneously, England became the principal purchaser of Brazilian export goods.

The price of this economic dependence quickly became obvious for one segment of the population. Brazilian artisans suffered drastically from the competition of English manufactured goods, and the presence of cheap imported factory-produced goods blocked the development of national industries. Even more seriously, after Independence Brazil accumulated millions of pounds sterling in debts to England. England also became the mediator between Brazil and Portugal. Thanks to British intervention, Portugal recognized Brazilian independence — provided that Brazil paid Portugal a sum of £2,000,000. The money had to be borrowed in London's financial markets. With this maneuver, Brazilian elites began the practice that became habitual for the rest of the century: financing their own public and private deficits by borrowing from the English. Given all this, England gained a position that allowed for almost coercive pressure on the Brazilian government.

In 1826, as part of the process of renewing commercial treaties, England succeeded in imposing a requirement that Brazil prohibited the slave trade within three years after the signing of the agreements. Thus, with the law of November 7, 1831, the Brazilian government kept its promise; from that date forward, any African who reached Brazilian shores would be considered a free person. Serious penalties were enacted for those who violated the law.

But in practice, the law of 1831 was simply ignored. To the great irritation of British representatives in Brazil, the number of new slaves brought into Brazil from Africa continued to increase. Between 1831 and 1850 — when a new law was enacted to reinforce the prohibition of the trade — more than half a million slaves were imported into Brazil, in utter disrespect for the law. Although illegal, the slave trade continued to be considered normal and legitimate by most of the white population. [26] Enormous fortunes were made in the unlawful traffic, and infamous slave traders continued to circulate socially among the elites of the time.

Censures of the horrors of the slave trade and other criticisms of slavery fell on deaf ears. Neither the eloquence and prestige of men like José

Bonifácio, the pressures of the British, the declamations of a handful of Jacobin radicals, nor the prohibitions of law were able to overcome the interests that organized to defend the Transatlantic traffic in human beings. And what made ending the slave trade increasingly difficult was the transformation of Brazilian agriculture in response to expanding international demand for tropical products. To satisfy this demand, plantation owners needed more and more laborers, and it scarcely occurred to them to look for any solution other than the system of slave labor to which they were fully accustomed.

## Contraband

Various tricks were devised by the slavers to circumvent the law. Slaves were put ashore on remote beaches where there was no enforcement. Ships carried false flags to confuse both British pursuers and Brazilian officials. The connivance of government officials was secured with bribes or threats. When all else failed, and some zealous judge resolved to actually exercise his authority and punish the traders, he soon discovered that the people were ready to give cover to the traffickers. Some did this out of their own interest, others for reasons of family or friendship, others out of fear of reprisals — and still others out of nothing more that indifference.

In a society in which a few powerful families controlled politics and government, it was difficult to make them respect the law, especially if the law interfered directly with their own interests. It was equally rare to encounter anyone who dared defy them. Everyone knew that vengeance would not be long in coming. Consequently, whenever authorities opened an official inquiry against anyone involved in the trade, they could usually find no witnesses willing to testify. The traffic continued with impunity. Government functionaries were themselves frequently [27] implicated, one way or another, in the flow of human contraband. Dependent on the patronage of the elite for their positions, the functionaries were frequently the very first to turn a blind eye. All this contributed to the unimpaired flourishing of the trade. So obvious were the abuses that some people even proposed abolishing the law of 1831, instead of abolishing the trade. But the law continued to be in force, if not enforced.

Despite all the abuses and obstacles to its execution, however, the mere existence of the law created a new situation. However deeply involved the elites were in the illegal traffic of slaves, and however committed they were to the preservation of slavery, they still were divided by political rivalries and by contests for power. Factions in these power struggles could use the law to persecute their adversaries. Groups identified with the political opposition attacked those who were in power, accusing them of breaking the law; those in power also tried to use the law to harass their adversaries.

In this fashion, even if it was ineffective, the law was maintained; if it did not stop the traffic, the law did contribute to its demoralization. The slave trade continued, but its legitimacy became, in principle, questionable. It had become an illicit activity, and, more significantly, the nation had undertaken an international obligation to end it. Under formal agreements between Brazil and England, the British navy had acquired an unquestioned right to capture vessels used in the traffic.

Fifteen years passed, and the British warships patrolling the South Atlantic were unable to put a stop to the trade; fifteen years in which the Brazilian government did not fulfill its obligations. The interests involved with the labor system and the slave trade continued to defy the law and to resist English pressures. Proposals designed to strengthen the law of 1831 presented during these years to the Chamber of Deputies were repeatedly rejected. Antagonism toward the English only increased. The slavers and their allies were skillful at inciting public opinion against England, exploiting nationalist sentiments, and accusing England of disrespecting Brazil's honor and autonomy. Tensions grew when the time came to discuss the renewal of the commercial treaty between the two countries. The British insisted on maintaining all of the commercial concessions it already [28] had. But the Brazilian government resisted. One of its principal sources of revenue was tariffs on imports, and the government wanted to revise some of these tariffs upward, which displeased the British. In retaliation, England proposed to formally reopen the question of the slave trade.

England now began to provide money to abolitionist publications, in an effort to apply pressure on the Brazilian Parliament. Simultaneously, the British navy intensified its war on the traders. In flagrant violation of Brazilian sovereignty, British warships entered Brazil's territorial waters in pursuit of slave ships. An act passed by the English Parliament in 1845

declared it legal for the navy to capture and hold any vessel wherever employed in the slave trade.

In the years between 1849 and 1851, the British seized no fewer than ninety vessels suspected of carrying human contraband. The threat of a naval blockade of Brazil's coasts and other diplomatic pressures eventually had their effect. The question of the slave trade was reopened in the Brazilian Parliament. Brazil's situation was complicated in 1849 by the possibility of a war in the region of the Rio de la Plata, on the country's southern frontier. There were indications that Brazil's southernmost province, Rio Grande do Sul, might be attacked by forces of the Argentine governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas and his supporter Manuel Oribe, a military leader in Uruguay. With a possible war on the horizon, Brazil needed British support more than ever.

## The Law of Eusébio de Queiroz (1850)

Once the question of the slave trade had been re-opened in Parliament, the government dedicated itself to promoting a new law that would impose more severe penalties on slave traffickers. The law was approved in 1850 and became known as the Law of Eusébio de Queiroz, after the cabinet minister who was its chief promoter in Parliament. It defined the importation of slaves as an act of piracy, subject to military trials and the most severe punishments. Vessels involved in the illicit commerce, and all goods aboard, could be seized and sold, with a fourth of [29] the proceeds paid to anyone who had tipped off authorities, and the rest going to the capturers. Any captives on the vessel would be sent back to its port of origin, or to any other port outside the Empire, at government expense. Until this was accomplished, they would be put to work on public projects, under the "tutelage" of the government.

After the law was approved, the authorities redoubled their efforts in the pursuit of contraband slaves, while England remained vigilant. But despite its decision to pursue traders, the government continued to deal cautiously with cases of denunciation, arguing that the larger interests of society required that "a veil be drawn over these matters". The slave trade diminished, but did not cease altogether. Rumors of contraband shipments continued to be heard everywhere.

On January 11, 1851, a representative of the English Crown, Sir James Hudson, wrote to Minister Paulino de Souza, denouncing the presence of various unpunished slave traders and complaining about the existence of large sheds prepared to receive consignments of illicit slaves. He even specified numerous points along the coast where these crude warehouses were located: Cabo Frio, Rio de São João, Rio das Ostras, Macaé, Campos, Manguinho, Marambaia, Mangaratiba, Dois Rios, Mambucaba, Fazenda do Alegrete, Perequê, and others. He stated that, in light of this flagrant disrespect for the law, the English would resume the inspection of vessels they had suspended earlier at the request of the Brazilian government.

## "Conservative Party."

## "The Question of the Servile Element."

"This is what the Conservative Party is, in the opinion of the illustrious planter Paulino de Souza. The party must be grateful to him." Revista Ilustrada, year 10, n.405, p.1. March 24, 1885.

Hudson's accusations were not unfounded. Brazilian archives are full of documents that reveal efforts to continue the traffic. One such document dated January 8, 1853, refers to the offloading of slaves in Rio de Janeiro from a vessel of United States registry. Another, from March of the same year, concerns the presence in Perequê, in Santos, of large canoes and whaleboats used in the traffic. They belonged to a certain Valêncio Augusto Teixeira Leonil, who according to the document had returned to Brazil after having been sent into exile. One document dated December 27, 1854, mentioned the existence of an association of important people in Jacareí and Paraibuna, whose purpose was to promote the traffic. In the same year, the Minister of Justice informed the president of the Province of São Paulo that Domingos [30] José da Costa, builder of the government's Naval Arsenal, had left for Campos to arrange three boats destined for Africa. Other documents of the same period referred to foreigners involved in the slave trade, and threatened them with deportation. Another report, of 1856, hinted at the arrival of slaves coming from the United States. Rumors and reports of this type continued for more than a decade, heightened by the Civil War in the United States, when it was often said that American slaveholders were seeking refuge in Brazil for themselves and their slaves. Still, despite numerous difficulties, the law of 1850 had better results than that of 1831. The slave trade gradually diminished, and finally ended altogether.

# [31] CHAPTER 3 THE QUEST FOR ALTERNATIVES

The end of the slave trade had an immediate effect on the prices of slaves. The jump in prices was felt most sharply in the frontier areas, where the demand was greatest. In short order, prices doubled, and they continued to rise until the 1880s. In 1850, the price of a male slave between fifteen and thirty years of age was 500 to 600 *mil-réis*. Ten years later, that price had tripled, to one *conto* and 500 *mil-réis*. By 1880, the price was two-and-half *contos*. By the end of this period, a slave with a skill — a carpenter, barber, or blacksmith, for example — would eventually fetch five or even six times what an ordinary slave had cost in 1850.

Faced with such exploding prices, plantation owners even began to concern themselves with the way their slaves were treated. At mid-century, an abundance of manuals began to appear, offering slaveowners practical advice about how to keep their slaves alive and somewhat healthier.

#### Brazilian Workers

The end of the slave trade prompted plantation owners to consider alternative solutions to the problem of the labor force. [32] Some suggested the possibility of using free Brazilian workers. Most planters, however, were doubtful of this solution. Most free workers lived on the outskirts of the large plantations, on small landholdings, where they practiced a subsistence economy; only sporadically did they make themselves available to work for the great landlords. Others actually lived on plantations, where they earned the right to farm a small piece of land by doing work that was considered inappropriate for slaves; they might, for example, be used to clear forested areas, an activity that was potentially life-threatening and thus not a suitable task for a valuable slave.

One way or another, the free worker had access to land from which he could draw the necessities of life, and so could resist having to work fulltime for the plantation owner, something he would do only if forced. The problem of compelling free men to work was a general one in the entire western hemisphere. Expulsion from the land, forced labor and debt peonage were the usual methods employed in Mexico, Guatemala, Peru and other countries in Latin America to force the rural peasantry (campesinos) to work on the plantations. Such methods were, however, quite difficult to put into practice.

The shortage of available labor was not felt equally in all areas of Brazil. In the more settled regions with the largest number of slaves, the problem was less acute than in frontier areas where new plantations were being opened and expanded. In the Northeast, the problem was somewhat attenuated by the devastating droughts that drove many free families off their own plots of land. They were forced to travel into more fertile areas where they had to look for work. On the other hand, the problem was most severe in the province of São Paulo, where there was a very rapid expansion of the cultivation of coffee.

## Immigrants

Some planters in São Paulo began to think of finding a solution for the labor problem in white immigration. The notion that Brazil contained immense unpopulated territories that might be [33] settled by immigrants who could make a contribution with their culture and industrious habits, was not new. Since the time of Dom João VI, various attempts at colonizing immigrants had been made at several places in Brazil, most of them in the south, in Paraná, Santa Catarina, or Rio Grande do Sul. Frequently, the immigrants were settled in groups in remote and isolated areas, far from potential consumers in urban markets, or on infertile land nearer to towns or cities. Only rarely did these efforts succeed. Sooner or later, beset by many difficulties, the immigrant colonies dispersed and their settlements dwindled.

This type of organized colonization did not interest the coffee planters of São Paulo. They wanted workers for their own plantations. So they were much more enthusiastic about the possibility of recruiting individual workers in Europe. They became particularly interested in a project of Senator Nicolau Vergueiro of São Paulo, an important planter and political figure, who mounted a systematic effort to find and recruit European workers. Between 1847 and 1857, the enterprise known as Vergueiro and Co. brought a number of immigrants to the center-west area of São Paulo. They came financed by the planters and were obligated to labor to pay off the costs of their transportation (with interest). They were contracted on the basis of "partnership", and were thus committed to perform all the tasks involved in the cultivation and maintenance of the owners' coffee plants and the processing of their crops, in return for a share in the resulting harvest.

## Conflicts between Immigrants and Planters

It did not take long for conflicts between planters and their immigrant workers — colonos, as they were called — to come to the surface. On Vergueiro's own plantation, the strife became so bitter that government representatives and even European consular officials had to intervene. Most of this early group of colonos had come from Germany or Switzerland, filled with dreams and attracted by promises the promoters of immigration had made to them. Now they rebelled against the harsh realities they encountered on the plantation. They complained that [34] they were treated as slaves, forced to buy all their supplies from the plantation storehouse at exorbitant prices, that they were not paid what they were owed, that the plantation accounts were fraudulent, and that the landowners provided them with immature coffee plants that produced little or nothing, while reserving productive plants for their slaves to work with. The planters, for their part, accused their colonists of failing to live up to the terms of their contracts, of being lazy and disorderly (their traditional complaints against their black slaves), and of being the dregs of European society.

As soon as they could pay off their debts to the planters, the immigrants abandoned the plantations. Sometimes they simply fled, leaving their debts behind them. The system of "partnership" satisfied neither the landowners nor their immigrant sharecroppers.

Very few planters maintained an interest in using immigrant workers to replace slave labor. Most of them continued to be convinced that only slave labor was able to withstand the rigors of coffee culture. Disillusioned with their experience, they continued to buy slaves, paying the ever-increasing prices.

# The Internal Slave Trade

The African slave trade was replaced by an internal traffic within and between Brazil's provinces. An estimated seven to ten thousand slaves per year were sold from other parts of the country into the provinces of the Center-South. Slaves were shifted from cities and from less productive agricultural regions to the more dynamic plantation areas. An increasing number were concentrated in areas that were producing export crops, while free labor made some tentative advances in other areas, above all in the towns and cities. By the 1860s, free workers were outnumbering slaves in many urban areas.

The planters of the Northeast watched this internal slave trade with apprehension. Attracted by higher prices, traders preferred to sell slaves to the coffee planters of the South. This, in turn, inflated the price of slaves in the Northeast. The planters of the Northeast tried without success to close off the sale of [35] slaves outside their provinces. Beginning in the 1850s, many local laws were passed that taxed the export of slaves across provincial boundaries. But this did not effectively hinder the sales of slaves to the South, where the higher profitability of coffee agriculture allowed the planters to pay the ever-higher prices for their labor supply. Meanwhile, the sugar and cotton planters of the Northeast, faced with falling international prices for their products, became less and less capable to compete for slave laborers.

What complicated the situation was that — in contrast to what happened in the United States — Brazil's slave population did not increase naturally after the end of the slave trade. The death rate among slaves was very elevated, and their birth rate was not high enough to offset it. The demand for slave labor increased, but the slave population did not. The problem, then, only grew worse. Meanwhile, as the slave population stagnated, free population grew rapidly. At the time of Independence, the slave population represented about half the population of the nation. In 1872, slaves accounted for only about sixteen per cent of the total; on the eve of abolition, that number had declined precipitously to about five percent.

At the beginning of the century, a majority of the slave population was concentrated in the sugar-producing areas of the Northeast and in the old mining regions. When abolition came, a majority of the slaves lived in the provinces of the Center-South: Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and São Paulo.

# Concentration of Slaves on the Great Plantations

At the time of Independence, the provinces of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, São Paulo and the Município Neutro (the city of Rio de Janeiro) contained 446,589 slaves out of a total of 1,163,146. In 1872, those same provinces counted 881,477 slaves out of a total of 1,548,632. Their slave population had doubled in half a century. At the time of Independence, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais had accounted for one-third of the slave population; when abolition came, those provinces held two-thirds of Brazil's slaves. The provinces of the Northeast had accounted for a little more than half the slave [36] population at the time of Independence; on the eve of abolition, they held slightly less than onequarter.

In sixty years, from the 1820s to the 1880s, there was a massive concentration of slave labor in the provinces of the Center-South of the country. It was São Paulo that received the greatest influx. This is easy to understand, because at the time of Independence, Rio and Minas already had heavy concentrations of slaves inherited from the colonial period. São Paulo, at the beginning of this period, had relatively few slaves, at least compared to Rio and Minas. But its slave population grew from 21 thousand in 1823 to 169 thousand in 1872. Meanwhile, the slave population in the region's other provinces also grew: in Rio from 150 thousand to 300 thousand, and in Minas from 215 thousand to 330 thousand. In other words, while the slave populations of Rio and Minas were doubling, that of São Paulo was increasing eight-fold. This growth was a result mainly of the coffee expansion. Obviously, not all the slaves labored to produce coffee; throughout the period, slaves were involved in a great variety of other activities. But the most dynamic sector of the economy — and the most dependent on slave labor — was certainly coffee. Even in Minas Gerais, where the coffee economy did not have the supreme importance it did in São Paulo, and where a majority of the population continued to live on subsistence and petty commerce, more than a third of the slaves worked in the coffee areas of the province by the 1870s.

The continuous expansion of the coffee plantations, fueled by the steady increase in international demand, caused the problem of labor supply to be particularly acute in those areas. However, if the great plantations continued to be dependent on slave labor, in the cities the free worker was replacing the slave. And it was exactly among the urban population, less and less dependent on slave labor, that the abolitionists would find their main support.

<sup>1</sup> The currency of the Brazilian Empire was the real (plural réis). A thousand réis was one mil-réis. A conto was one thousand mil-réis, or one million réis.

#### [39] CHAPTER 4

# ABOLITIONISM: THE PRIMARY PHASE, 1850-1871

Until about the middle of the nineteenth century, there really was nothing that could be characterized as an abolitionist movement in Brazil. The critics of slavery continued to find little support, and proposals for emancipation aroused very little enthusiasm. Here and there, an independent spirit might publish an essay on the advantages of free labor, a member of Parliament might propose a measure designed to improve the daily lives of slaves, or a poet could lament their sufferings. The essay would be ignored, the parliamentary project put on the shelf, and the poem forgotten.

In 1851, Deputy Silva Guimarães proposed to the Chamber that future children born to slave mothers be set free at birth, and that the separation of married slaves be forbidden. Another Deputy, José Inácio Silveira da Mota, began to exert steady pressure toward the same goals. Year after year, between 1857 and 1865, he presented proposals to remove slaves from cities to rural areas; to prohibit foreigners, convents and monasteries, or the government itself from owning slaves; to make it illegal to call out in the streets offering slaves for sale; to prohibit public slave auctions; forbidding the separation of slave couples, and setting an age limit of fifteen for the separation of slave children from their parents. Even when such proposals did manage to get approved in the Senate, they either went silently astray in the [38] Chamber, were placed under "study" in some committee or other, or were summarily dismissed. The modest program of Silveira da Mota had to wait nine years to be finally made into law. Clearly, there was still enormous indifference to the plight of the slaves.

## The Slave in Literature

Despite the indifference of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the number of people who took some interest in the difficulties of the slaves increased. Slavery became a literary theme. Gonçalves Dias published A escrava [The Slave Woman] in 1846. Ten years later, José de Alencar staged O demônio familiar [The Family Demon], a comedy of manners satirizing the upper reaches of society in Rio de Janeiro, but also denouncing the evils of slavery. Soon after, he wrote Mãe [Mother], a play dedicated to his own mother, which turned another dramatic light on the sufferings of those in bondage. Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, who gained fame as the author of A Moreninha [The Young Brunette], published in1869 his novel Vítimas e algozes [Victims and Executioners], which painted the system of slavery in extremely dark colors. A group of writers from the Northeast — Juvenal Galeno, Trajano Galvão de Carvalho, Francisco Leite Bittencourt Sampaio, Joaquim Serra — made significant room for slaves and for other blacks in their works. The melancholy black, homesick for Africa; the slave tortured in the fields; the master's children's faithful nurse; heroic runaways; the virginal slave harassed by her master; the righteous slave seeking to avenge his stained honor — a veritable gallery of literary types on display in rural Brazil served as frequent motifs for these authors. Now and then, more pointed criticism of the slave system came to the surface. Among the writers of this period, it was Castro Alves who most forcefully dealt with the lives of the slaves. Born in Bahia in 1847, he was, in his shortened life, one of the slaves' most ardent advocates. His attractive physique, his juvenile enthusiasm, and his eloquent dramatic style enspirited audiences. But once the voice fell silent and the tears dried, they had to face once more the harsh routines of daily life, where slaves and slavery were inescapable realities. Occasionally, to be sure, the [39] audiences' enthusiasm might be a bit more durable, and under the impact of unleashed emotions an emancipation association would be created and money collected to buy manumissions, or to defend slaves in the courts of law. More often, though, the emotions were soon exhausted by such works of beneficence. A few slaves might gain freedom, and then the organization would cease to exist. Abolitionist newspapers appeared and disappeared at the same pace. Only in academic environments were abolitionist efforts kept in motion over time. But their impact was negligible outside the lecture halls and classrooms.

Beginning in the 1860s, however, the movement would gain momentum in the principal urban centers of the country.

## Reform and Abolition

The transformations that Brazilian society experienced after the ending of the slave trade created tensions that generated repercussions in the political arena. The precarious unanimity of the elites was broken, and on the political level conciliation between the parties became increasingly difficult.

Several industries had developed during the 1850s and the tracks of the first Brazilian railroad had been laid. Economic crises in 1857 and 1864 had provoked serious panics, and financial speculation had alarmed many Conservatives. Political conciliation, which had followed the suppression of the Beach Revolution in Pernambuco in 1850, came under threat from the growing internal uneasiness in both political parties. Conservatives and Liberals, who functioned more or less harmoniously in the 1850s, were now challenged by extremists of their own parties. The partisan nucleus of each of the parties had to exert itself in order to hang on to its hegemonic position. The first important schism manifested itself at the heart of the Conservative Party, when a group led by important politicians — José Antônio Saraiva, José Tomás Nabuco de Araújo, Zacarias de Góes e Vasconcellos, and the Marquis of Paranaguá, broke with their party and defected to the Liberals, forming the Liga Progressista. To justify this political maneuver, Nabuco de Araújo argued that instead of struggling against the democratic tide, the true statesman should seek to guide and control it, so that the future of the nation would not [40] be compromised. From that point forward, conciliation between the parties was unworkable.

The progressive and reformist spirit seems to have emboldened many Liberals who intended to press their party to assume more radical positions. Soon, a wing of the Liberal Party more sympathetic to emancipation surged forward. But resistance was strong, both from more cautions Liberals and from Conservatives.

In 1865, when asked to raise the question of slavery in Parliament, the Marquis of Olinda — then an Imperial minister and head of the Cabinet responded that even one word that could be understood to suggest emancipation, no matter how elaborately it was adorned, would open the door to a thousand calamities. Not to mention the subject; to avoid discussion of so perilous a question; and if this proved impossible, to simply do nothing that would allow any anti-slavery proposal to be approved these were the parliamentary strategies employed by a majority of the elected representatives. They thus avoided even the possibility of any measure being passed that might pose a threat to slave property. All proposals that looked toward emancipation were stillborn.

Again in 1865, the Emperor asked a member of the Council of State, Senator Antônio Pimenta Bueno (later the Marquis of São Vicente) to work out a project that could lead to emancipation. Pimenta Bueno, in response to the Emperor's request, drafted a proposal for a law emancipating children born to slave mothers. He also suggested the creation of Provincial Councils of Emancipation, proposed the liberation of slaves belonging to the government within five years, and freeing slaves belonging to monasteries and convents within seven years. Even this hesitant project found little support in the Council of State. The Emperor, for his part, decided not to press the matter. And at this juncture, a war with Paraguay monopolized political awareness and no one seemed disposed to risk discussing the matter of slavery.

# International Pressure

Still, abolitionist pressure increased, coming not only from within Brazil but from abroad. In 1866, for example, the French [41] Junta for Emancipation sent the Emperor an appeal in favor of emancipation. It bore the signatures of the most prominent names in the French anti-slavery movement. But more important than such appeals from abroad were the effects of the Civil War in the United States. When that war ended in 1865, slavery had been obliterated in the American South. Now only Brazil and two Spanish colonies, Puerto Rico and Cuba, continued to maintain an institution that was universally condemned. Most of the cultivated tiers of Brazilian society could not fail to recognize this uncomfortable new reality. Slavery was an outmoded and archaic institution, condemned by every civilized nation, a symptom of Brazil's backwardness.

The number of organized abolitionist groups was growing in the nation's urban areas. And now it was not only students or poets who agitated the issue. It was not only the pasquins that preached liberation. Important journalists, lawyers, doctors and engineers, men and women, joined the movement. Major newspapers began to discuss the question. Public opinion was making itself heard. And, even more important, some political figures began to raise the subject in Parliament. On November 6, 1866, the government decreed freedom for all slaves who had been designated to perform "military service" in the Paraguayan War. This step, although it actually affected only a small number of slaves, generated great repercussions in public opinion.

At the opening of Parliament on May 22, 1867, the Emperor's Speech from the Throne raised the question of emancipation: "The servile element of the Empire cannot fail to deserve your consideration". The legislators, he continued, should attempt to "attend to the elevated interests that are tied to emancipation" — but in a way that respected property rights and did not damage "our primary industry, Agriculture". The point was, clearly, to be phrased with extreme caution, so as not to provoke irate opposition. The Emperor merely called parliament's attention to the need to consider the question when it might be opportune to do so, that is, when and if they themselves found it convenient to do so. He made it perfectly clear that he had no intention of asking the legislators to interfere with the slaveowners' property rights, or with the smooth functioning of Brazilian agriculture.

## ![](_page_46_Picture_1.jpeg)

## "Congresso Internacional."

"Pardon me, please… with that little Negro you may not enter."

[Emperor Dom Pedro:] "But I cannot part with him. After all, it is he who dresses me, who gives me food, who… who serves me in every way."

"Ah, well… All right, by virtue of the illustrious qualities of such a wise sovereign, I suppose the civilized nations will doubtless admit you." Revista Ilustrada, year 8, n.347, p.8. June 30, 1883.

The response of the deputies to the Emperor's speech was couched in nearly identical language. "The Chamber of Deputies adheres to the idea of opportunely and prudently considering the question of slavery in our Empire, as is required by our civilization and our true interests, respecting always current forms of property and without doing serious damage to the country's agriculture." This laconic response was accompanied, as usual, by no concrete measure whatever. In July 1867, Zacarias de Góes (a member of the Council of Ministers and a prominent figure in the Liberal Party) yielded to pressure from some members of the party and submitted to the Council of State a project that modified somewhat the proposal submitted by Pimenta Bueno two years earlier. The revised proposal included a provision that would abolish slavery in Brazil on the final day of the nineteenth century, more than thirty years in the future.

[43] Despite its very moderate terms, the proposal detonated vigorous opposition in the Council of State. A majority of the members, tied to the interests of the landowning class, responded very negatively, predicting that the proposal would lead to economic ruin, and would also set loose social conflicts of unimaginable proportions. In Parliament, Liberals and Conservatives joined forces to prevent even a discussion of the problem. In both parties, however, there were some individuals who were disposed to take up the issue of slavery. They were, for the time being, defeated, and the representatives who spoke for the slaveholders carried the day. The question was "postponed", on the pretext that, with the nation involved in a very serious war, the time was not right to even discuss emancipation.

In the Speech from the Throne of 1868, the Emperor returned again to the question, promising this time to actually present to Parliament a specific proposal of the executive. But the Liberal ministry headed by Zacarias de Góes, faced with very strong opposition within the party, was unable to maintain itself in control of the government. The fall of the Zacarias de Góes ministry unleashed a grave political crisis. To replace it, the Emperor decided to call upon an aged Conservative. This was enough to provoke violent opposition from the Liberals who now saw themselves cut off from power. The parliament, where Liberals held a clear majority, was dissolved and new elections were decreed, in which the Liberals were defeated. Voters were alienated because it had been clear for quite some time that the government was winning elections only through violence and electoral fraud. So the outcome of this vote was no surprise. But the Liberals, irritated and distressed, set in motion a virulent campaign of attacks on the Conservative ministry and proposed a bundle of reform measures that had already been frequently suggested but that had so far not found decisive support on the Chamber.

In May 1869, Liberals released a manifesto written by Nabuco de Araújo and other prominent party leaders. It proposed greater autonomy for the provinces; autonomy for the judiciary; a system of education independent of the national government; the transformation of the Council of State into a mere administrative organ; an end of lifetime terms for members of the Senate; direct elections; the creation of a civil registry to [44] replace family records kept by the Church; secularization of the cemeteries; religious freedom and the extension of the right to vote to non-Catholics; and, finally, gradual emancipation of the slaves. The manifesto ended with what appeared to be a threat: "Reform or Revolution!". Followed, however, by a conciliatory promise: "Reform, and the Country Will Be Saved".

Despite its daring tone, the manifesto still did not satisfy the most radical wing of the Liberal Party. A few months later the members of this sector of the party launched their own manifesto, demanding a more extreme set of reforms: the abolition of the Emperor's "Moderating Power" to intervene in the affairs of the legislature and to choose government ministers; the dismantling of the National Guard, which was primarily concerned with maintaining social order; an end to the Council of State; and the immediate rather than gradual abolition of slavery.

The crisis provoked a great deal of political mobilization. Newspapers and radical clubs sprang into existence everywhere. The reform programs attracted the discontented of every complexion and anyone who, for whatever reason, simply opposed the government. Liberals organized a great deal of propaganda in favor of the reforms, including the emancipation of the slaves. Debates about abolition gained new energy, and the abolitionist movement new vigor.

## Proposed Laws Favoring Emancipation

In the Chamber of Deputies, abolitionists now went on the offensive. They presented various proposals between May and July of 1869 to improve the living conditions of the slaves and to move toward their eventual emancipation. The abolition of physical punishments; the liberation of children born to slave mothers; a concession to slaves of the right to purchase their own manumission; the emancipation of slaves owned by the government; the exclusion of slaves from work in the cities — these and other proposals were submitted one after the other. Few of them won discussion and examination. In August, a proposal that had originated in the Senate to prohibiting the separation of slave [45] children under fifteen from their parents was actually approved. Public auctions of slaves were also outlawed (with some exceptions), and the right of slaves to buy their own freedom when their masters died was made into law — provided, however, that there was no objection from the deceased master's heirs or his creditors. Still, the question of actual emancipation continued to be avoided, despite the pressure that Liberals brought to bear on the ministry.

The Paraguayan War had now ended, and it no longer provided a convenient reason to postpone the discussion of abolition. Undermined by internal divisions, the ministry soon fell. A new Conservative ministry was formed. To head it, the Emperor summoned Pimenta Bueno, who had been responsible for a cautious proposal of emancipation that had been presented to the Emperor a few years before. But Pimenta Bueno also did not have enough support to retain power and he resigned after a few months. On March 7, 1871, a new ministry headed by a very prestigious Conservative, the Viscount of Rio Branco, presented itself to the Chamber of Deputies, announcing that it would press for a discussion of a law liberating future children born to slave mothers. The months between that announcement and the final passage of the law were months of acute agitation. Now, the parliamentary debates, the discussions in the press, and the public mobilization that swept the law forward did more to advance the cause of abolition than all the efforts of the few idealists who had battled for abolition during the preceding decades.

## The Slave in the Paraguayan War

During the Paraguayan War, the question of emancipation stood out in sharper relief than it had before. Not only did the government grant freedom to any slave designated for military service, but it extended that freedom to their wives. At the same time, slaveowners anxious for commendations and titles of nobility, sent more and more slaves to the battlefront. Others tried to evade military service for themselves or for their sons by sending slaves to take their places.

[46] Having a son who is not part of the National Guard [which would have exempted him from serving in the regular Army] and owing to the circumstances in which we find ourselves with the war against Paraguay and wishing to strive together with my contingent for the triumph of my Country, I resolved to offer for a place in the Army, as a substitute for my son, my slave Marcolino de Camargo, to whom I grant liberty for this purpose (Campinas, January, 1867)

Declarations of this sort were very commonplace. During the war, many slaves were indeed emancipated by their masters. And many runaway slaves enlisted in the military. At the end of the war, they were considered free. A movement of sympathy and support assisted slaves who had fought for the nation. A master who attempted to reclaim a slave who had returned from the battlefields found himself at odds both with government authorities, who wanted to ensure the slave's freedom, and with public opinion, which condemned the slaveowner's behavior.

A decision of the Ministry of Justice, dated February 9, 1870, declared that a person who had enjoyed his freedom for three years after serving as a free man in the naval fleet, not only should not be returned to the mistress who was trying to reclaim him, but should immediately be set at liberty. In the same year, the chief of the São Paulo police distributed a circular containing the following declarations:

Individuals of servile condition who were part of our Army in the Paraguayan War need not return to slavery, even if they enlisted by hiding their actual condition. It is our duty to provide the means for restoring them to liberty, reserving to their supposed masters the right to seek compensation from the Imperial Government, but giving proof of ownership, so that there is no repetition of what occurred in Paraíba do Sul, where a volunteer of the Nation, violently captured and delivered to a private person who claimed to be his master, was afterward set free only after governmental intervention.

Decisions and circulars like these were being issued everywhere. Despite the great variety of cases considered, the thrust [47] was always the same: a volunteer who served the nation could not be a slave. On June 15, 1870, The Baron of Muritiba informed the chief of police that the fact that a black person had served in the military constituted a presumption of liberty, which could not be abridged without the authorization of a competent judge.

The participation of slaves in the war furnished new arguments for those who were struggling for emancipation, and the campaign for abolition intensified. Abolitionist clubs, societies, associations, and journals were organized in all the principal cities of the country. Masonic lodges began to lend support to such initiatives. In São Paulo, a famous black descendent of slaves, Luiz Gama, organized a judicial campaign in support of emancipation. Grounding his actions in the law of 1831 against the slave trade, he insisted in courts of law on the freedom of slaves that, he argued, had been brought into the country illegally after the law was passed and could not be kept in captivity. Luiz Gama's campaign constituted a genuine threat to slaveowners, since a very large number of those currently enslaved had in fact entered Brazil after 1831, and their bondage may have been a violation of Imperial law.

The 1870s began, then, in a mood of apprehension on the part of those who owned slaves, and renewed enthusiasm on the part of those who struggled for their emancipation. The political crisis unleashed by the fall of the Liberal ministry in 1868 acted as a catalytic element. The debates about the Free Birth Law [Lei do Ventre Livre] carried on in the Chamber of Deputies and also in the press would now make emancipation a national question.

#### [49] CHAPTER 5

# ABOLITIONISM, THE SECOND PHASE: THE Free Birth Law

The government's proposal for the Free Birth Law [Lei do Ventre Livre], which would emancipate children born to slave mothers, was presented to the Chamber of Deputies on May 12, 1871. Among both Liberals and Conservatives, there were deputies in favor of the idea, and others opposed. The debates went on for months. There were inflamed discourses on both sides, and the chairman of the house was compelled to call to order deputies who engaged in excessive personal attacks, or to silence the galleries when they broke into noisy applause for those deputies who spoke in favor of the law. The press covered the debates in detail and they were followed with great interest by the public. In urban centers, the abolitionists organized meetings and distributed pamphlets endorsing the proposed law. The proslavery faction, for their part, also did not slacken. From various parts of the country, petitions condemning the prospective law rained down upon the parliament. And a great number of books and articles were published, both in favor and against.

## Proponents and Opponents of Emancipation

For some, the proposed law went too far; for others, it was excessively timid. Its defenders used both moral and economic [50] arguments. They insisted that free workers were more productive than slaves. They claimed that slavery deterred white immigration, since potential immigrants were wary of moving to a land of slaves. Emancipation, they contended, would open the doors to that much-desired immigration. Deploying moral arguments, they denounced those opponents of the law who defended slavery on the basis of property rights. It was not legitimated, they said, to invoke property rights in a discussion of slavery; property rights applied only to things, and not to people. "Slave property", said Torres Homem — a notable political figure, a man of color and humble origins who had reached the Senate after a brilliant career as a lawyer and journalist — was a "monstrous violation of natural law". "A great majority of Brazil's slaves", he said, "are descendents of slaves introduced into the country through a traffic not only inhumane but criminal. Nothing could be more just than to take steps to put an end to slavery".

On the other side, the most entrenched of the defenders of slavery described the law as an unwarranted intrusion of the government into private affairs. In addition, they argued, the law would violate the Constitution's own guarantees of property rights. Since the colonial period, the practice in Brazil had been that any child born to a slave mother was the property of her master. Any law that might grant freedom to the child of a slave was, therefore, an attack on property, and — even worse — would open the door to other, more extreme forms of government interference with property rights. Pro-slavery deputies also warned that the law would bring ruin upon the slave-holders and would put at risk both public order and the national economy. They also predicted that the law would instigate great agitation among the slaves, since it undercut the principle of authority that was the foundation of the system of slavery. They argued that liberating children and keeping their parents in bondage would create two classes of individuals in the slave quarters, thus undermining the entire institution of slavery, since it would not be long before all the slaves began to question the legitimacy of their captivity. And there were even some who characterized the proposed law as a scheme inspired by "communism".

The novelist José de Alencar, one of the most combative of the opponents of the law, even argued that the law would transform the slave family into a nest of discord, extinguishing [51] maternal love, generating hostilities between parents and children, contaminating the new generations born into the vices of slavery. To applause, he concluded,

"Gentlemen, I do not defend here only the interests of the slave-owning class; I defend above all the unhappy race that would be sacrificed". Alencar, who opposed the law on such grounds, was not, however, disposed to support emancipation of parents as well as children, since he thought the slaves needed to be prepared for liberty.

Other pro-slavery deputies tried to make the case that the slaves were actually better off than free workers. The slaves, they said, never lacked food or clothing, while free workers were left to their own devices.

This collection of arguments, taken as a whole, represented the way of thinking of the tier of masters committed to slavery as the basis of the social order. To them, any reference whatever to emancipation sounded like a threat. Because of this, the parliamentary battle was arduous. The opponents of the law did what they could to impede its procedural progress in the Chamber, boycotting sessions in the hope that nothing could be done because of the absence of a quorum. But despite these attempts to block the law, there were enough supportive deputies, from both Liberal and Conservative parties, to ensure that the law would eventually make its way through the Chamber's procedures. A group of Liberals did believe that the proposed law was excessively conservative. They would have liked to see a more drastic measure, one that would establish a definite date for a full and definitive emancipation of all slaves. This group was a minority, even among Liberals. But its very presence made Rio Branco's proposal seem much more acceptable in the eyes of the pro-slavery deputies than this drastic threat of total emancipation! Perhaps, the new law would even put a stop to the abolitionist agitation, since it would guarantee the slow but inevitable end to slavery in Brazil. This was, in fact, the program of Rio Branco himself: reform in order to avoid more extreme radicalization.

## The Project of Rio Branco

Rio Branco defended his project as the most reasonable and workable of all the available solutions. It could renew the [52] threatened public tranquility and prosperity and, above all, restore the confidence of the slaveowners, who could not sustain the uncertainty with which they were living, terrorized by the specter of abolition. Resistance to the law, he argued, could only provoke public discontent to a point where a moderate and conciliatory measure might no longer be acceptable. The proposed law offered considerable advantages to the slaveowners. It condemned slavery to disappear in the long run, without damage to the economy, giving the proprietors ample time to accommodate to the new situation. And it did so with ample respect for property rights.

Despite the alarmist tone of those in the Chamber who worked against the law, it was, as Rio Branco maintained, a moderate delaying tactic designed to accommodate the interests of the slaveowners and the pressures of the abolitionists. In its first article, the law provided that "The children of slave women who are born in the Empire after the date of this law shall be considered to be of free condition". But these children, known as ingênuos, would remain in the power of the masters, who would be obliged to maintain them until they reached the age of eight. At that point, the owner could choose to deliver the child to the state and receive 600 mil-réis as compensation. Or the master could choose to keep the slave until the age of twenty-one; in that case, the ingênuos were obliged to render "free services" in return for their lodging and maintenance until they reached that age. In practice, this meant that children born of slave mothers, though "considered" free, would remain effectively enslaved until they were fully adult. This would make it possible to perpetuate the slave system for two or three more generations.

Years later, the ardent abolitionist Rui Barbosa would calculate that if no further action had been taken, there would still be slaves in Brazil until the third decade of the twentieth century. In fact, if a child born just before the law passed bore a child at the age of forty, that child would have had to perform "services" for his/her owner until the year 1932.

The law had other articles and provisions of lesser importance. Perhaps the most significant of these was the creation of a governmental Emancipation Fund whose purpose was to purchase the manumission of a certain number of slaves every [53] year in each of the provinces. The revenue to finance the fund was to come from a variety of sources: a head tax paid by masters on each of their slaves; a special state lottery; taxes on the sales of slaves; fines paid under the law; legacies and donations; and budgetary quotas eventually created by governments at every level, national, provincial and municipal.

The law also granted the slaves the right to create a personal savings account, known as pecúlio, for money they earned with extra work they undertook with their master's consent, plus any gifts, inheritances or stocks they might possess. On a slave's death, half this account would automatically belong to his or her mate, and the rest to any other heirs. If there were no other heirs, the remaining half would be put into the Emancipation Fund. If the pecúlio grew large enough to fairly compensate the master, the slave would be entitled to purchase his freedom.

The law also liberated slaves belonging to the government, any donated to the Crown, those whose owners died without heirs, and those abandoned by their masters. The law observed, in passing, that it was the responsibility of masters to provide for slaves that became invalids.

To facilitate the execution of the law, the government was to create a general registry of slaves (known as matrícula) to prevent potential frauds. The law stipulated that any slave who was not properly registered, through fault or omission of the master, would be considered free, with substantial fines charged against their masters. Parishes were required to maintain special books for registering births and deaths of children of slaves born after the law was approved.

After months of debates and political maneuvers on both sides, and despite the fervent protests of the defenders of slavery, the law was finally approved, to the applause of the crowds who were packed into the galleries of the Chamber. Sixty-five deputies voted for the law, forty-five against. The principal opposition came from the delegations of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, and Rio Grande do Sul. Together, these five provinces had 48 deputies in the Chamber. Of these, 34 voted against the law, and only 14 in favor. The provinces of the North and Northeast voted massively in favor of the law. Of the 54 deputies from the provinces to the north of Bahia, 45 voted [54] for the law and only 9 against. So the law was passed over the obstinate opposition of a majority of the representatives from the Center-South of the country, the very areas with the densest concentrations of slaves.

In all Brazil, slaves accounted for about 16 per cent of the population. But in São Paulo, they constituted 20 per cent, in Rio de Janeiro almost 40 per cent, Minas Gerais about 16 per cent, and, in Rio Grande do Sul, 21 per cent. Taken together, these four provinces contained about 62 per cent of

Brazil's slave population, 955,109 slaves out of a total in the country of 1,540,000. The great landowners continued to depend almost exclusively on captive labor, and their representatives in parliament constituted the main opposition to the new law. Curiously, however, the delegates from São Paulo — where the great coffee planters were dominant — were evenly divided, for and against the law. And in the remaining provinces of the Central-South (excepting the city of Rio de Janeiro and the province of Espírito Santo, whose representatives all opposed the law) the votes were also divided, some against and others in favor. Even in these provinces, heavily populated by slaves, a significant sector of society was receptive to some form of gradual emancipation.

## Political Parties and the Free Birth Law

Notably, a majority of the deputies voted independently of their party affiliations. Despite the fact that the law was proposed by the Conservative ministry, some Conservatives voted against it, and some Liberals voted for it, despite the fact that theirs was the opposition party. Only a few Liberals who actually favored emancipation voted against the law because of strictly partisan considerations. Such was the case of Zacarias de Góes, who supported emancipation, but thought that the proposal should have come from the Liberals and not the Conservatives. But in general, the issue of emancipation was relatively immune to the ordinary requisites of party loyalty, so much so that the minority of conservatives who opposed the law threatened to bolt from their party and form a new one, and a great number of Liberals chose to explicitly support the advance of emancipation.

[55] In the Senate, the law met with less opposition. This was, in part, because the senators could keep their seats for the rest of their lives and were less dependent on the voters, so that they could (within limits) ignore the political excitements of the moment. Thirty senators voted for the law, and only seven against. Of these seven, five represented coffee areas: three from Minas Gerais and one each from Espírito Santo and São Paulo. In the Senate as in the Chamber of Deputies, the pressure to vote against the new law was strongest in the areas dominated by coffee and in the beefproducing areas of Rio Grande do Sul.

## Frauds

The proposal finally became the Free Birth Law on September 28, 1871, three months after it was presented to the Chamber of Deputies. All the agitation that was stirred by its approval prompted a great deal of popular mobilization. In short order, the debate over emancipation moved from the conference rooms of abolitionist associations and the closed spaces of "academic" institutions to the public squares. For many young people beginning their literary or political careers, the debates surrounding the new law served as a baptism of fire. They overwhelmingly identified themselves with reform and emancipation, and in the years that followed continued to fight for those causes. The Free Birth Law did not put an end to the debate over abolition. It was only a first step along the path.

Despite all the intense agitation surrounding the new law, it produced limited effects in the short run. Most slaveowners decided to keep children of slave women until they reached the age of twenty-one, rather than turn them over to the government. In 1882, the Report of the Ministry of Agriculture registered only fifty-eight instances of masters surrendering ingênuos in return for compensation. These few had been "assigned" by the government to private citizens. All the remaining stayed on their plantations under the "tutelage" of the masters.

The parish records of the "matriculation" of slaves, and the records of the Emancipation Fund were plagued with various kinds of irregularities. Registering their slaves exacted a toll on [56] their owners, and the government responded by making things a little easier with an 1872 decree that allowed more time for the registration of new-born slaves. And when the registrations were finally made, important details were often missing. Masters altered baptismal certificates to show that a child had been born before the passage of the law. And there were other methods of evasion. Slaves with adequate pecúlios were not permitted to buy their manumission, and this prompted not only complaints but legal processes. The provincial Councils of Emancipation found it difficult to meet, and functioned only irregularly and ineffectively. In 1875, the president of the province of São Paulo, aware of the problems, went so far as to publish a declaration of his agriculture ministry requiring the provincial Council of Emancipation to work regularly, so that the government could promote the liberation of slaves through the Emancipation Fund, as the law provided.

There were other problems. When the Councils of Emancipation did attempt to function, they were subject to heavy pressure from slaveowners seeking to evade the law by one means or another. There were masters who tried to emancipate sick or disabled slaves, rather than those who were better qualified under the provisions of the law. They did this in the hoping of gaining compensation for slaves that were already of no actual worth to them. Masters also hurried to manumit slaves in return for contracts that bound them to continue to provide "services", when those same slaves were high on the lists of those eligible for liberation through the Emancipation Fund. Meanwhile, the actual resources of the Fund were being reduced, so that in the end not many slaves actually benefited from its activities. Between 1873 and 1883, more than seventy thousand slaves were manumitted in Brazil. Of these, a few more than twelve thousand gained their freedom through the Emancipation Fund.

Worse still, ingênuos continued to live and work as slaves, subject to being sold along with their mothers, to being punished like any other slave, working as though they had not been touched by the Free Birth Law. For them, liberty continued to be a promise deferred to a distant future.

Abolitionists were quick to denounce the failings of the law and to expose the evasions and frauds that frustrated its [57] execution. They began to propose more drastic measures that might put a definitive end to slavery. The advocates of slavery, for their part, now clung to the very law they had so vigorously opposed. For them, the Free Birth Law simply closed off the entire question of slavery. Emancipation would be the inevitable result of the law — even if the slaves had to wait half a century for it. For those who were attached to the system of slavery, nothing was left to do but await the effects of the current law. They believed the law had put a definitive end to abolitionist agitation. Soon, however, they would discover that they had deceived themselves. The abolitionists returned to the charge, this time with even more vigor.

#### [59] CHAPTER 6

## FROM THE OX-CART TO THE RAILROAD

Fifty years had passed since José Bonifácio wrote his criticisms of the institution of slavery. During this period, the emancipation of children of slave mothers had been proposed many times in the Chamber of Deputies, without finding any support. The defenders of the idea, which in 1822 would have seemed visionary, had confronted heavy resistance from the most entrenched agricultural sectors, which opposed any legislation whatever that might in any way undermine the basis of an institution on which they were entirely dependent. Even in 1871, their spokesmen voted against the Free Birth Law. Now, however, important elements of Brazilian society were much more inclined to accept the gradual abolition of slavery.

The 1871 law was, in effect, a compromise between the most reactionary slaveowners and the abolitionists. It was the plantation masters' concession to the opponents of slavery, whose numbers and influence had increased markedly during the 1860s. The law had another dimension, as well: it was the response of the Conservative Party to the demands of liberals. By taking the political initiative and proposing the new law, the conservatives sought to disarm the liberals' reformist platform.

What was not possible in 1871 was the complete abolition of slavery, the goal of the more radical among the liberals. [60] Parliament would simply not approve any measure designed to achieve that purpose, not even if it established a date in the far distant future for the final end of slavery! Nonetheless, if the idea of abolition was unacceptable in 1871, seventeen years later slavery would be easily abolished. What happened, then, in those intervening years between 1871 and 1888 that made such a dramatic change possible?

The answer to this question is by no means simple. Various factors contributed to the change. Some were related to the eco-nomic and demographic modifications that Brazil was under-going. Others were related to social and political transformations. Still others were the direct outcomes of the abolitionists' organized campaign. Finally, in the years that led up to the Lei Áurea, a decisive factor was the massive uprising of the slaves, a generalized insurrection that disrupted the economy and led the slaveowners themselves to abandon their longtime opposition and to accept abolition as the only way to restore social order.

This chapter will examine only the economic, demographic, social and political transformations that helped change Brazilians' attitudes toward slavery and abolition. The active efforts of abolitionists and of the slaves themselves will be explored in succeeding chapters.

## Decline of the Slave Population

From 1822 to 1888, Brazil experienced many fundamental changes. The free population expanded from about 2 million people in 1822, to about 8.5 million in 1872, then exploded to almost fourteen million in 1888. The slave population went from a little over one million in 1822 to around oneand-a-half million in 1872, but then fell to about 700,000 in 1887. This meant that the slave population not only declined in absolute terms, but fell even more drastically in proportion to the free population. At the same time, the number of slaves in urban areas fell even more rapidly, and slavery became much more concentrated in rural areas, especially in the parts of the country tied [61] to the export economy. In the city of Rio de Janeiro, for example, while the free population was practically doubling, the number of slaves fell from 100,000 in 1864 to a little more than 7,000 in 1887. In São Paulo, the same drastic decline occurred. In 1872, the city still had about 4,000 slaves; in 1886 only about 600 were registered.

There were several causes of the decline of the urban slave population. The rising prices of slaves and the increased demand from agricultural areas prompted many city-dwelling owners to sell their slaves to rural landowners. Also, in the cities it was much easier for slaves to find ways of getting money for their pecúlios, to use to buy their liberty. It was in cities, too, that the abolitionist movement was well-organized. Abolitionist associations promoted street parties, charity auctions of donated goods, and other activities designed to raise money for emancipations. All this increased the number of manumissions. It is probable, as well, that the death rate among slaves was higher in the cities. But, whatever may have been the reasons for it, the decline of urban slave population created more opportunities for free workers. The urban populations were becoming much less dependent on slave labor, and much more inclined to lend a receptive ear to abolitionist appeals.

The transition from slave to free labor also was occurring in some rural areas, particularly in the Northeast. Already in 1866, the report of the minister of agriculture observed that in Ceará the replacement of slave labor by free workers was well advanced. In 1870, the president of Pernambuco, Diogo Cavalcanti de Albuquerque, noted that in some districts in his province the number of free workers was greater than the number of slaves. Even in areas of the sugar economy, the number of free workers was growing; by the middle part of the century, there were three free workers for every slave. By 1872, free workers were so much more numerous than slaves that in some areas there were fifteen free workers for every slave. In many provinces, the slave population came to represent only a very small proportion of the total population. In Ceará, slaves accounted for 4.5 per cent, in Rio Grande do Norte, 5.1 per cent, in Paraíba, 6.8 per cent, in Goiás 5 per cent, and in Amazonas, only 1 per cent.

## [62] Mechanization

While the slave population was decreasing in comparison to the free, many technological improvements were introduced into the systems of production. In the most prosperous coffee plantations, as well as in the sugar mills of the Northeast, these innovations increased the efficiency of labor, improved the quality of the products, and fundamentally altered the rhythms of production.

In 1857, two thirds of the sugar mills of Pernambuco ran on animal power, about 31 percent used water power, and only some two percent were run by steam. After 1870, the number of steam-powered mills grew, reaching about 21 per cent in 1881. In the 1880s, there was a rapid multiplication of the number of large, steam-driven, centralized mills with productive capacities much greater than the traditional small mills. It was the era of the creation of great sugar factories that would, in time, replace the oldfashioned mills. These changes in the system of production altered the rhythms of work and relations of production, permitting greater rationalization of the uses of labor. Areas under cultivation were expanded, and the need for labor increased. But the growing number of free men in nearby areas provided a more than ample supply of workers for the planters. Simultaneously, in the 1870s the Northeast's semi-desertic backlands were ravaged by a calamitous series of droughts. Thousands of people were forced off their own small holdings of land and had to withdraw to areas that had more rainfall and to seek work, offering the landowners easy access to an inexpensive supply of labor.

In the coffee regions, a changing situation also permitted the more efficient use of the labor force. New plantations were opening in response to increased international demand. The planters were attempting to improve both the way that coffee was produced and the quality of the final product. New types of drying terraces and innovative techniques of peeling and drying the beans improved the final yield. Travelers who visited coffee plantations in the frontier areas, where coffee production was high owing to the rich fertility of the soil, described plantations where the coffee beans were pounded and hulled, then graded and polished, and finally sacked and weighed — all by machines. [63] The machinery accomplished in little time what had previously been the slow and laborious work of many hands. Moreover, the coffee produced in this new fashion met with more favorable acceptance in the international market, where it brought higher prices. These transformations increased workers' individual productivity, and so led to a decreased need for laborers.

# Railroads

In the second half of the nineteenth century, there were also great improvements in the means of transportation. The products of the plantations — which until then had been moved on the backs of donkeys, in ox-carts, or on boats — began to travel by railroad. The construction of rail lines not only permitted the opening of plantations in areas that had been economically unworkable because of their remoteness, but also helped increase profitability by lowering freight costs and offering more rapid and secure deliveries. Laborers that once had managed and maintained troops of donkeys and carts with their oxen, could now be used for other types of work.

Thanks to these developments in methods of production and transportation, plantation owners no longer needed to keep large bodies of slaves occupied throughout the entire year. It became possible to reduce the permanent labor force and to hire extra workers at harvest time. This meant that free workers for hire became more practical, if not more profitable. Instead of tying up capital in the purchase of a slave, a landowner could contract with a colono, a free worker who typically lived on the plantation and performed tasks in return for wages or some other form of compensation. At harvest times, the entire family of the colono could be recruited into the work force. This system offered the planters various advantages. He did not need to immobilize so much capital in the purchase of slaves, he was not responsible for the free worker´s maintenance, and the death of a colono did not represent a capital loss.

Even as conditions increasingly favored free labor, the prices of slaves continued to rise, and the costs of their labor became more and more onerous.

"Every day, the train of progress is taking on more passengers. In many places, and above all in the province of São Paulo, the laborers themselves do not hesitate to get aboard private initiative always beating the official. What ridiculous figures these statesmen make, with their Law of September 28, 1885, which prolonged the life of slavery to the end of the century, when three years later it would be entirely extinct." Revista Ilustrada, year 12, n.462, p.4-5. August 13, 1887.

## [66] The Advantages of Free Labor

Slowly, some planters began to recognize that they might be better off with free workers than with slaves. José Vergueiro, for example, published an article in 1870 in a major São Paulo newspaper demonstrating that the work of colonos was more profitable than that of slaves. A hundred slaves, he estimated, were worth at least 200 contos of réis. With such a sum, he argued, a landowner could easily acquire the free workers he might need. Computing the expenses of the slaves' food, clothing, medical care, plus the interest that could have been earned on the capital in other investments, he concluded that the running costs of slave labor could very well exceed the salary that a free worker might be paid. Then why keep tying up capital in slaves, especially since the Free Birth Law made it clear that slavery was condemned to eventually disappear as a system of labor?

In addition to such direct factors favoring free labor, there was another, indirect but no less important. With the rapid expansion and diversification of the economy during the second half of the century, alternative new opportunities for the investment of capital had multiplied. Banks, insurance companies, railroads, textile mills and other enterprises had flourished. For the planter class, these businesses created new investment opportunities. And equally attractive were interest rates on bonds the government issued to borrow money to cover budget deficits created by its expanding new public responsibilities.

Such investments were very attractive to planters even when the actual income on the stocks or bonds was less than the profit on investment in agriculture. Financial diversification provided a measure of security against the risks and fluctuations of the export economy. Because of this, great planters like Antônio Prado became associates of various companies, investing capital in railroads, banks, insurance companies, government bonds, real estate, and even other plantations. In this way, the development of capitalism in the country made it less attractive to invest capital in slaves than it had been in the past, when there were fewer alternatives.

But even if an increasing number of planters made such financial calculations, based on visible social and economic [67] transformations, and became convinced of the superiority of free labor, a majority of the planters continued to doubt that it was possible to find free workers willing to work on the plantations. Most of them believed that the slaves would work only when physically forced to do so. The general view was that once they were free, they would abandon the plantations. And if slaves did forsake the plantations, where could free workers be found to do the work? Because of this, many planters continued to oppose abolition. And they also had to fear the loss of capital tied up on their slaves. So they resisted any measure, however cautious and timid, that did not completely respect their property rights, and their right to be compensated if the government freed their slaves.

# Chinese Immigration

Conscious that slavery was a threatened institution, some planters in the newer coffee regions — particularly affected by the problem of labor supply — began to look once more to immigration as a solution. Some suggested promoting Chinese immigration. By reputation, the coolies (as these immigrants were called) would accept any kind of work, no matter how humble, and would also accept very low salaries and extremely modest living conditions. Coolie labor had already been used, with apparent success, in other countries of Latin America and in the United States.

In the opinion of those planters who still remembered their failed experience with the earlier immigrants from Germany and Switzerland, it was exactly this type of subservient immigrant, accustomed to rude and demanding labor, that was needed. Only the Chinese, they thought, would be able to submit to the low wages and precarious living conditions on the plantations.

In the Agricultural Congress organized in 1878 by the imperial government, a number of planters advocated the Chinese solution. They did not meet with the kind of support they had expected. Many of those who attended the Congress were suspicious of the idea. Prejudiced against the Chinese, they accused them of being corrupt by nature, addicted to every sort of vice, [68] and claimed they would only corrupt the Brazilian population with their evil customs. One member of the Congress, Cristiano Otoni, giving voice to the beliefs of those who feared this new immigration, described the Chinese as weak, naturally lazy, drugged physically and morally by opium, prostrated by the depravity and evil habits that beset them from the cradle. Not everyone at the Congress, however, was so pessimistic. Some members were convinced that the Chinese immigrant might, at least temporarily, resolve the labor problem.

Both these points of view were amply discussed in the Provincial Assembly of São Paulo. Some representatives argued that the Chinese were good workers, and that this had been shown by successful experiments in British Guiana, California, and Cuba. They also claimed that the Chinese were less demanding than Europeans, and so would be a cheaper labor force. Others argued that earlier Brazilian experiments with coolie labor proved that Chinese immigrants would be a disaster: they had quickly converted themselves into either fishmongers or thieves! [69] Those who opposed chinese immigration also spoke of the danger of mongolization of brazilian population.

## ![](_page_68_Picture_1.jpeg)

"Well, if the planters want Chinese, let them have Chinese." Revista Ilustrada, year 8, n.358, p.4. October 20, 1883.

Interest prevailed over prejudice. A company was organized to promote Chinese immigration to Brazil. But the company encountered serious obstacles to its mission, among them the refusal of British and Portuguese officials in Hong Kong and Macau to allow Chinese workers to board ships bound for Brazil. The obstacles proved to be so great that the planters lost their enthusiasm for the project and turned their attention to other solutions. They would find the workers they wanted in Italy.

## European Immigration

Before the 1870s, the immigrant did not count for much in the coffee economy. The real increase in immigration came after the Free Birth Law and was, to a degree, a result of that law. Between 1875 and 1886, four times as many immigrants entered the province of São Paulo as in the forty preceding years. But it was in the two final years before abolition that the Italian immigration really took off. In 1886-87, more than a hundred thousand immigrants, most of them Italian or Portuguese, reached the province. Then, between 1888 and 1900, São Paulo would receive no less than 800,000 immigrants — more than the total number of slaves in the entire country in 1887, on the eve of abolition. At the middle of the nineteenth century, during the first tentative attempts to introduce immigrants into the coffee areas, the landowners had financed the transportation. Little by little, after 1870, the provincial government took over this responsibility. In the 1880s, the province laid out enormous sums to underwrite immigration. Between 1881 and 1891, it would spend 9,244,226,550 réis, most of it during two years, from 1884 to 1886. From the moment the government began to finance immigration, the economic risks involved were spread among the entire population, but the benefits flowed directly to the owners of large plantations. From that point on, they could more comfortably confront the transition from slave to free labor.

[70] At the beginning of the 1880s, however, a majority of the plantation owners continued to be dependent on slave labor. Immigration continued to be, for them, more hope than reality, and they continued to be doubtful of the possibility of replacing slave by free labor. For this reason, they continued to oppose abolition. On the other hand, those interested in encouraging immigration began to argue that, so long as slavery survived in Brazil, it would be impossible to promote immigration on a large scale.

## Divergent Opinions

All developments and transformations that were taking place in Brazil would help make a transition in the 1880s to free labor more viable, and, in some cases, actually desirable for all parties. This did not mean, however, that the plantation owners, starting then, could be converted to abolitionism. A majority of them continued to be skeptical and apprehensive. Still, among planters in the more productive regions, the first voices favoring the adoption of free labor began to be heard, and not just in the coffee areas but also in other regions of the country. This generated conflicts between planters favorable to free labor and those who continued to doubt the feasibility of replacing their slaves with free workers.

In the sugar regions of the Northeast, a large number of sugar planters would have endorsed the words of Augusto Milet, a sugar producer in Pernambuco, who argued, in 1876, that the supply of rural wage workers was insufficient to provide agriculture with the necessary labor force, and that it would therefore be madness to depend on free labor to replace the thirty or forty thousand slaves that still were employed in sugar production. It was impossible to count on the wage worker to do the physical work in the fields and mills at the pace that the production of sugar demanded. The idea that a sugar mill could function with free workers seemed to him a utopian notion. Only the largest sugar factories would be able to employ free labor, he argued in a debate against another important sugar producer who spoke in favor of free labor.

[71] Analogous conflicts arose in the coffee areas. A year before abolition, in a letter to Rodrigues Alves, Rodrigues de Azevedo, a planter in Lorena (in São Paulo's portion of the Paraíba Valley), bitterly commented:

Unfortunately, the North (of the Paraíba Valley) is not like the West, where the fertility of the soil and the abundant production invite free labor and make it pay. Here, we do not have nor can have colonization so soon; until there is an agricultural transformation, the slave or national worker cannot be dispensed with. What colono would want to work a thousand coffee plants to collect only 600 pounds? But, for this very reason, we cannot be dismissed or sacrificed to our wealthy brothers; on the contrary, it would be good government to sacrifice them to us. If they are convinced that slave labor does not presently repay the producer, and is a burden for those who use it, then let those who think this liberate theirs, independently of any law; but don't let them come and force those others who out of necessity cannot share their opinions, and force them to do the same.

The planters most tied to slavery were men like Rodrigues de Azevedo in São Paulo or Milet in Pernambuco, men whose plantations were less profitable (because of soil exhaustion, or because they were not close to the new means of transportation), men burdened with debts and mortgages and without the capital or credit necessary to modernize their methods of production. They continued to struggle desperately against abolition. More fortunate others, with more capital and more productive plantations, could face the prospect of abolition with less anxiety. The unity of the planters was broken. A vanguard stood apart from the majority and was ready to look for alternative solutions to the labor problem.

## Urban Groups

Although this vanguard might accept the idea that free labor was better than slave, it did not become outright abolitionist. Abolition continued to recruit its support among sectors of the [72] urban population. In the course of the nineteenth century, a number of these sectors had grown in importance as a result of the development of capitalism.

Some commercial centers, such as Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Campinas, São Paulo and Pelotas, had undergone notable development. The population of the city of Rio de Janeiro went from 274,000 inhabitants in 1872 to more than 450,000 in 1886-87. The population of São Paulo also grew rapidly.

There was a proliferation of urban cultural institutions, schools, newspapers, publishers, and libraries. The number of people practicing liberal professions, like law or medicine or teaching, increased rapidly, as did other professions associated with urban life. There were increasing numbers of doctors, engineers, lawyers, journalists, professors, and government officials. These men still lived caught up in the old webs of patronage and clientele that determined success or failure. Some, like the famous abolitionist leader Luiz Gama, were of lower-class origins. Others, like Joaquim Nabuco, were descendents of important families. Most were white, but among them there were also a few blacks and persons of mixed race. They were connected to the dominant elites by family ties or by services rendered. Some, like Andrade Figueira, remained faithful servants of the dominant class. Others, like Rui Barbosa, became critics of the ruling elites and made themselves the spokesmen of newly emerging urban groups. It was these men who, offended by the system of patronage, became the allies of those economic groups less tied to slavery, took up the banner of radicalism, defended reforms, criticized traditional ways of thinking, literary and artistic forms, and proposed new methods of teaching, and sometimes attached themselves to abolition and to republicanism.

Obviously, it would be fruitless to look for complete coherence among such individuals. Some were abolitionists; others favored a more reformist approach to emancipation. Some, like Joaquim Nabuco, favored abolition if it were done through legislation, but recoiled from the idea of a general uprising by the slaves. Others, like Antônio Bento, went further and became involved in a movement known as the caifazes, who in the 1880s actively helped slaves to escape. Some, like Luiz Gama, were abolitionists and republicans; others, like Nabuco, were abolitionists [73] but monarchists. But, despite the variety of causes and principles they held to, it was among such people that abolition found most of its active supporters.

In the cities, women also played a fundamental role: they formed emancipationist and abolitionist associations, promoted charity sales of donated articles and collected funds destined to purchase manumissions; they organized conferences favoring the end of slavery, and even took part in public demonstrations. They formed a large part of the reading audience for those poets and novelists who had enlisted under the anti-slavery banners.

Others who played an important role in the movement against slavery came from more modest tiers of urban life — owners of small fishing boats in the Northeast, coachmen, railway workers, and many others. Among these were numbers of immigrants, blacks and people of mixed race, who acted in solidarity with the anti-slavery cause.

It was various forms of pressure applied at the beginning of the 1880s by these emergent urban groups that forced Parliament to re-open the question of emancipation.

#### [**75**] CHAPTER 7

# ABOLITIONISM, THE THIRD PHASE: THE LAW OF THE SEXAGENARIANS

The debates over the Free Birth Law had established a new dimension to the question of the emancipation of the slaves. The law was amply debated by the press, and public opinion was mobilized. Everywhere, abolitionist groups had been organized. The offices of newspapers, magazines and abolitionist clubs became gathering places for students, intellectuals and professional men in general. Through these organizations, young people coming from other provinces were immediately enlisted. Someone from São Paulo reaching Recife, or a person from Pernambuco arriving in São Paulo, quickly and easily found a community. A candidate in search of a political career, who might not have support among the regular party cliques, could now find a new electorate; the poet a new public; and marriageable young women new forms of sociability.

In addition to everything else, abolitionism was a generous and Christian cause and spoke to the philanthropic sentiments that Brazilian society cultivated. To favor the emancipation of the slaves was to favor progress and civilization, since slavery had been condemned in the name of progress and civilization in the most developed countries. Nothing was more attractive than those magic words to young professionals fascinated by Europe. Abolition thus became a noble cause, and the defense of slavery became abominable. To join the ranks of abolitionism was also to combat the oligarchies that were still committed to slavery. [76] For some, abolition was a conviction, for some, an expedient, and for some others, both; and the abolitionist ranks went on gaining more recruits.

When the 1880s began, abolitionism took on new energy, especially in urban centers. In various provinces, people carrying placards in favor of emancipation paraded through the streets of the capitals and other cities. Everywhere, meetings and conferences were held and collections of money made to help the cause. Some abolitionists reached the point of actively inciting slaves to violence and rebellion. Informal tribunals were held in public squares, pamphlets were distributed preaching that slavery was a crime, and property in slaves was theft. The agitation would reach a peak during the ministry presided over by Manuel Pinto de Sousa Dantas, when the cabinet would propose a plan to free all slaves over sixty years of age.

"At the head of the jangadeiros of the Northeast, [Francisco José de] Nascimento blockades shipments of slaves from Ceará to the South." Revista Ilustrada, year 9, n.376, p.1. 1884.

In the nation's capital city of Rio de Janeiro, the agitation seemed uncontrollable. The students of the Polytechnic School, of the College Pedro II, and of other institutions demonstrated loudly in favor of emancipation. Their example was followed by the aldermen of the Municipal Chamber. The jangadeiros of Ceará (owners of fragile ocean-going fishing boats, symbols of the struggle for emancipation in that province)

were acclaimed when they visited Rio on the invitation of the city's abolitionists.

# The Slaveowners Protest

In the Chamber of Deputies, there was no lack of protest against this wave of agitation. Andrade Figueira, leader of [78] the pro-slavery faction, attacked teachers of the Polytechnic School, who had greeted the news of emancipation in Ceará 1 with festive speeches and celebrations. In his opinion, instead of dedicating themselves to teaching the young, these professors had set themselves to hold "within the school building itself" an abolitionist festival; not content with this, they had formed associations with their students, annihilating school discipline and "perverting" their young pupils, instilling in them habits of disorder and anarchy.

Petitions rained down upon Parliament from irate plantation owners, outraged by the unimpaired progress of the abolitionist campaign. The spokesmen for the pro-slavery interests demanded, in the Chamber of Deputies and also in the press, that steps be taken to put a stop to the agitation. The planters fell into line. They conspired on the plantations. They persecuted and even threatened with death abolitionists who dared to preach their ideas even in the small towns of the interior. They broke into abolitionist meetings with arms in their hands. Their henchmen invaded and damaged the offices of newspapers, threatened their journalists, and drove them out of the cities. Bringing all their political influence to bear, the planters did everything they could to remove judges and other public officials who had helped slaves or displayed any sympathy for abolition. They insisted that abolitionism was an artificial movement, promoted by the disorderly and irresponsible who threatened the very future of the nation. They asked Parliament to take steps to suppress abolitionist propaganda.

One of their petitions, sent to Parliament in 1884, summed up the positions of these pro-slavery groups:

The abolitionist movement, which intends to accelerate the complete abolition of slavery in the nation without considering [79] the terrible consequences of this step and would bring down ruin upon agriculture and the country in general, forces us to appeal to the Brazilian Parliament, insisting on the adoption of urgent and energetic measures designed to prevent that this shameful avalanche in its vertiginous descent prostrate completely the future of our agriculture, so indebted in these times by the shortage of labor and by the lack of both confidence and capital. Every Brazilian feels the throb in his breast of the noble and generous sentiment of liberty; not a single planter does not hope for a resolution of this great problem that agitates the nation. But the moment has not yet arrived; there is no reason to accelerate a march that, outside legal limits, abolitionists wish to make... At an opportune time, when agriculture has been prepared for this decisive act, in our hearts will also echo this cry for liberty.

Destroying the great column that supports the State, agriculture, [...] the imprudence of a few men thirsty for glory, will certainly cause the nation to find itself sliding into a complete destruction.

The petition went on to talk of the necessity of finding alternative solutions to the problem of labor supply, and of the need for laws that would guarantee workers for agriculture, prepare the slaves for their freedom, force freedmen 2 to work, and protect the planters "from the freed slaves and from the indolence congenital to all of their race". It also asked for measures of repression of excesses and disturbances that abolition's "exalted adepts have carried into our public squares".

A majority of those who had been against the Free Birth Law in 1871 now came forward to praise it, and to argue that that law, in itself, already resolved all the problems, since it had established a gradual emancipation without injuring property. This wise law, they now said, was being threatened by "spirits disoriented by the fever of a blackened abolitionism... that brought horrible consequences and had thrown the country into an abyss". And they denounced "the devastating abolitionist wave that parades itself ostentatiously in the public square in a [80] dangerous movement that is tolerated by the authorities" — and in disrespect for the law of 1871.

On June 14, 1884, the Bahian Imperial Agricultural Institute, drawing together planters and merchants, sent to the Chamber of Deputies a very similar petition. It, too, was quite typical of the pro-slavery ideas of the period:

More than an asset, more than an element of private fortune, the slave is a social institution, a component of work, a force of production and, in the end, of the nation's wealth.

The agriculture and commerce of this province are not pro-slavery, as no one is in this century in which we are living. But slavery, having entered into our customs, our habits, the whole of our social and political life, is so enmeshed in it that to extinguish slavery at once will compromise the entire national life, disturb the internal economy, launch us into poverty, onto the path toward crime and over a precipice into unspeakable ruin.

The petition ended by recounting the advantages of the Free Birth Law, and pleading for the maintenance of social order.

The most energetic and symptomatic of all the petitions came from Boa Esperança, in Minas Gerais. It denounced the "anarchic" abolitionist movement for the tumultuous manner in which it intended to gain the emancipation of the slaves, offending property rights "inciting by its utterly imprudent propaganda the ferocious instincts of the slaves against their peaceful masters, to the point of endangering their safety and the security of the work that contributes most to our public fortunes".

And so the petitions filed on, repeatedly touching the same rhetorical notes, inside and outside Parliament. The pro- and anti-slavery press took on a passionate and sensationalist tone, exchanging lurid reciprocal accusations. The anti-slavery press condemned the crimes of the masters; their opponents condemned the crimes of slaves who, they claimed, had been instigated by the abolitionists. At times, the confrontations between the two sides became dramatic. The more audacious the abolitionists became, the more aggressive were the pro-slavery responses. While rebellious slaves could now count on more sympathy from those people who had been converted to [81] abolitionism, they also confronted increasingly violent reactions from masters who felt threatened and did not hesitate to call out their dependents and henchmen, in response to even the slightest rumor of insurrection.

One incident that took place in Itu in 1880 indicated the level that tension had reached. Four slaves had murdered the son of the planter Valeriano José do Vale, and soon found themselves imprisoned in the town's jail, awaiting judgment. They were dragged from the jail and quickly massacred by a multitude of more than three hundred furious people, armed with axes, hoes, knives and clubs. The pro-slavery faction used the incident to denounce the extremes of violence that slaves had come to; the abolitionists took up the same set of facts to condemn the brutality of an institution that provoked such desperate and violent actions. "I, who profoundly envy these four apostles of duty", Luiz Gama would say of the murdered slaves, "would die of disgust if, through infamy, I found myself surrounded by that horde of unspeakable assassins".

Brazilian society was so polarized that what the defenders of slavery understood to be crime, was for the abolitionists an act of nobility. What for the abolitionists was horrifying and unjust violence, was for the proponents of slavery a justifiable defense of property.

Crimes and slave revolts became constant themes in the press. Articles full of shocking details aroused both sides. The defenders of slavery were convinced that public order was threatened with collapse because of the abolitionists' "irresponsible agitation". So they redoubled their demands for vigilance, and called for repressive measures that might put a stop to that agitation. The abolitionists, for their part, publicly denounced the violence committed by the slaveowners and their henchmen, and insisted that only abolition could put an end to such abuses.

## The Dantas Ministry

It was in this tense setting that the proposal to emancipate slaves over sixty years of age was presented to the Chamber of Deputies by the ministry of Souza Dantas. Despite the limited [82] impact of such a proposal, which would not actually free very many slaves, and most of them not very useful as workers, it provoked great resistance from slaveowners and their representatives in Parliament. Antonio Moreira Barros, who represented São Paulo coffee planters, resigned in protest from his position as president of the Chamber, unleashing a parliamentary crisis. To justify his gesture, he lamented the fact that the ministry had embraced the principle of emancipation without compensation for masters, a position he viewed as a direct threat against all slave property.

## ![](_page_81_Picture_0.jpeg)

"These unfortunates will probably be handed over to their masters, who, imitating the ferocious Dr. Davino, will take effective steps to ensure that they will not run away again." Revista Ilustrada, year 12, n.469, p.8. October 29, 1887.

Faced with the minister's proposal, the Chamber split. It became clear once more that the question of abolition rose above party loyalties. There were Conservatives and Liberals on both sides. In spite of the proposal's origin in a Liberal Cabinet, nine members of that party aligned themselves with the Conservatives in opposition. The ministry, encountering opposition within its own party, found itself in a manifestly difficult position. Could [83] it survive? After ten days of debate and maneuver, the Chamber had to vote on a motion of no confidence, moved by a Liberal deputy from Minas Gerais.

A number of Deputies spoke in the ministry's defense. Rui Barbosa, a famous orator and one of the abolitionist leaders in the Chamber, warned those who opposed the new law that the more they resisted gradual emancipation, the more they helped the process along:

The parliamentary movement for emancipation does not retreat at all. There is no majority powerful enough to deter it. Your seeming victories rebound against you. Out of each one of them, the liberating spirit rises again, even more powerful, more insistent, more daring. . . . The moderate concessions you refuse to make today, will satisfy no one tomorrow.

## ![](_page_82_Picture_1.jpeg)

"The opposition went so low, showed itself so small, that it only accomplished one thing, making Conselheiro Dantas into a giant." Revista Ilustrada, year 10, n.407, p.1. April 18, 1885.

[84] The passionate and enthusiastic speeches offered by abolitionist leaders had little effect. So did the warm support the abolitionist press gave to the ministry. Its popularity also proved to be of little avail. When the vote came on the motion of no confidence, forty-two Conservatives were joined now by seventeen Liberals who refused to support their own ministry. Delegates from São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais — the provinces with the largest concentrations of slaves — voted very heavily against the ministry. It was supported by only seven delegates from those three provinces, including the capital city of Rio de Janeiro. Well-known Liberals like Moreira Barros, Souza Queiroz, João Penido, Afonso de Assis Figueiredo, and Vieira de Andrade, voted against the government. It was a victory for reaction. The ministry was threatened, but would it find a way to survive the crisis?

Agriculture clubs and commercial associations continued to work against the proposed law. Petitions continued to reach Parliament. "Life and property must not be at the mercy of this handful of adventurers", said one. "The groups of destroyers that now are gathering in the country promoting propaganda with the purpose of abolishing slavery are the same who in Russia formed the nihilist party, in Germany, the socialist, and in France, the communist. Let us therefore be prepared against these derangers", said another. To further complicate matters, from Ceará and Amazonas, where the slave population was very small and where emancipation was practically a reality, came manifestos in favor of definitive abolition.

Faced with the opposition of the Chamber of Deputies, Dantas requested that the Emperor dissolve the Chamber and call for new elections. As the discussion in Chapter 9 of the life of Joaquim Nabuco will show, the abolitionists thrust themselves energetically into the campaign.

The events of 1884 were repeating those of 1871. Abolitionist agitation and mobilization of public opinion helped accelerate the process ending slavery, but, at the same time, it provoked violent reaction on the part of those who worked to preserve slavery. And so, despite the energetic efforts of the ministerial faction to win the elections, the result was a disappointment for [85] them. Rui Barbosa, author of the report that endorsed Dantas' proposal, was not reelected. The votes cast for Joaquim Nabuco were challenged. In Minas, one of the members of the Dantas Cabinet, Mata Machado, was defeated and replaced by a defender of the interests of the slaveowners. The ministry could not survive. It now fell by a vote of fifty-two against, fifty in its favor. A new Liberal ministry was formed, and a new proposal — a modification of the former motion — was presented to the Chamber of Deputies. The modifications protected the rights to slave property by providing compensation to the masters for any slaves the law might liberate. The new proposal also responded to the demands of slaveowners by providing severe penalties against anyone who assisted or protected fugitive slaves.

Analyzing the new proposal article by article, in front of a very large audience in the enormous Polytheama Theater, Rui Barbosa showed how the alterations to the original proposal changed it completely, transforming it into an actual concession to the slaveholders.

In fact, the new project stipulated that any slaves over sixty who might be liberated would be required to continue to work for nothing for three years, or until the age of sixty-five, as a form of compensation for their masters. It even offered monetary compensation to any master who might spontaneously decide to liberate any of his slaves.

# The Cotegipe Ministry

Predictably, the revised proposal provoked repudiation by the more extreme abolitionists. At the same time, it found new support among many who had opposed the original Dantas project. The opposition of the more radical abolitionist members of the Liberal Party weakened it, and the justinaugurated ministry was unable to sustain itself. José Antônio Saraiva, head of the Cabinet, stepped down. Conscious of the difficulties the Liberals were having in getting a law passed, the Emperor decided to call on a Conservative to form a new ministry. This time, he selected a very skillful representative of the agricultural sector, [86] the Bahian João Maurício Wanderley, Baron of Cotegipe, an old and very experienced Conservative leader. Thanks to his efforts, and to the compromises and concessions he was able to make, the revised project became law in 1885. It became known as the Saraiva-Cotegipe Law, or the Over Sixty Law [Lei dos Sexagenários].

"After fighting against it so hard, today they embrace this law with enthusiasm! What ridiculous incoherence!" Revista Ilustrada, year 9, n.387, p.4. July 31, 1884.

## ![](_page_86_Picture_1.jpeg)

"The gravedigger of the sexagenarians, says Joaquim Nabuco in his first speech to the Chamber of Deputies. Poor old things! [Manuel Pinto de Sousa] Dantas gave them hope that they might die in freedom. But [José Antônio] Saraiva wants to bury them in their chains." Revista Ilustrada, year 10, n.413, p.1. June 30, 1885.

During the extended debates that had absorbed Parliament and mobilized public opinion since 1884, giving renewed energy to the abolitionist campaign, it became clear that some sectors of the landowning class had already become convinced of the inevitability of abolition. Their only concerns were to ensure a transition from slave to free labor that would not paralyze production and to make certain that the slaveowners would be compensated for the loss of their slave property. Only a few of them now rejected every possible measure that might alter the status quo, arguing that the Free Birth Law had effectively sealed the question of slavery's long-term future. Among the [88] important opponents of any further change in the law were Andrade Figueira, delegate from Rio de Janeiro, and Barros Cobra, Augusto da Câmara Lima (the Baron of São Leopoldo), and Benedito Cordeiro Campos Valladares, all from Minas Gerais.

An important split had occurred among the representatives of the coffee areas. Antônio Prado, a very wealthy and prestigious planter from the western part of the province of São Paulo, who initially opposed Dantas, then Saraiva, now lent his support to the new law — after he himself had overseen the important concessions made to slaveowners. He now declared that the paulistas [those from São Paulo] were convinced of the advantages of free labor, and were already taking steps to replace their slaves with immigrants. He was speaking for many planters of the frontier areas who had finally become convinced that the only real solution to the problem of labor was to introduce immigrants on a grand scale.

Many slaveowners had evolved since 1871, when the bare mention of any step that might hint at emancipation had provoked tremendous resistance. Men like Silveira Martins, who in 1871 had stiffly opposed any measure that might help the cause of emancipation, now in 1884 were making speeches endorsing it. Others, like Joaquim Nabuco, who had favored gradual emancipation in 1871, had now become abolitionists in favor of a complete and immediate end to slavery. By 1884, the institution was not only condemned to disappear as a result of social transformations and parliamentary legislation, but also had been demoralized by the insistent assaults it suffered from the abolitionists.

The Over Sixty Law was actually a desperate rear-guard attempt by the proponents of slavery to slow the march of emancipation. But it was too late. The people had wrung from the hands of the elite the control of the movement. Abolition had become a popular cause and had the support not only of ample numbers of the common people, but also of important sectors of the middle classes, and even of some representatives of the elites. It also had the endorsement of the Princess and the Emperor. The movement was now uncontrollable. Nothing could deter it. [89] The last hopes of those who still thought they could resist this devastating march could only sink to earth when, in 1887, officers belonging to the Clube Militar sent to Princess Isabel a petition asking that they be relieved of the dishonorable duty of pursuing runaway slaves.

"Political party is no more. Neither Liberals nor Conservatives. Now it is abolitionists or slavers!

Where do we go from here?" Revista Ilustrada, year 12, n.472, p.5. November 19, 1887.

The final blow to the institution of slavery would be struck by the slaves themselves, who, with some help from abolitionists and with the sympathetic support of most of the free population, had begun to simply abandon the plantations, disrupting work, and making the planters' situation untenable. The rebellion of the slave quarters was the culminating point of the abolitionist movement.

## ABOLITIONISM AND ABOLITIONISTS

Although on the most general level, the abolition movement was a result of profound changes in Brazilian society in the course of the nineteenth century, this does not explain why some individuals became abolitionists and others did not. Personal motives are hidden in the multiple circumstances in the life of each one. The biographies of famous abolitionists like Luiz Gama, André Rebouças, Joaquim Nabuco, Antônio Bento and others, demonstrate that the paths that lead to abolitionism were many and varied. Examining some of these lives can help us to understand at least some of the general determinants that explain their choices.

## Luiz Gama

Gama was black. He was born in Itaparica, Bahia, in 1830, the son of a free black woman and a businessman who, when faced with financial difficulties, did not hesitate to sell his ten-year-old son into slavery. Luiz was taken to Campinas, in the province of São Paulo, where he spent a number of years as a slave. In 1848, he ran away and enlisted in the Urban Guard, a local police force. Enjoying the protection of some educated friends, he managed to begin to study law and became a rábula, a kind of street lawyer without a diploma. In 1859, he published [94] a book of satirical poems, under the pen name of Getulino. In his poetry, he castigated the Brazilian social elite, singling out particularly eminent men who passed themselves off as white, despite being the descendents of blacks. In one poem, he wrote:

If, in breasts that smolder with enormous infamies medals are gathered and prizes of honor, it's because, with money, the staggering dolts launder their deceits and change their color too.

#### He went on:

If audacious, rapacious knights or barons, just by being grandees should outfox the law, it's because there are judges who grasp at their presents then find them not guilty, these brothers of the herd.

In another, even more sarcastic poem, Gama embraced his own blackness, while he jeered at those rich and powerful who passed as white, betraying their own race:

I cannot tolerate a judge who with heedless vanity barters law, betrays justice, does to all an injustice rigorously grinds the poor, shielding the rich and noble, only to find horrendous crime in the beggar that he afflicts. If I am black, then I'm a goat,1 no matter. How could this count?

[95] Goats there are of every caste. The species is so very vast…

there are gray ones, those with stripes, chestnuts, white-faced, and the spotted, black goats, "white goats", and let us all be very frank, some plebeian, others noble, some are rich and some are poor, others only charlatans… Nobles, counts, duchesses too, madams rich, also marquises, deputies and senators, gentlemen, aldermen prima donnas so pretentious, puffed up in their nobility, bloated princelings, shameless knightlings, friars, bishops, cardinals, buffoons grand, imperial, poor folks, rich folks in all of them I see my kin.

Despite such caustic attacks on the Brazilian elite, Gama continued to circulate among them. What cleared the way for him was patronage. The natural talent of the young black man attracted the attention of some important figures, who gave him their protection and support. Gama became a journalist and began to write for various newspapers and reviews — literary, satirical, political and abolitionist, among them O Diabo Coxo [The Stumbling Devil] (1864); O Cabrião [The Bore] (1865), O Ipiranga (1867), and O Radical Paulistano (1868).

In 1865, Gama's principal patron lost his office because of the fall of the Liberal ministry and the rise of the Conservatives. Gama, like many men who were protected by Liberal political figures, voiced his hostility to the political system and became a member of the recently created Republican Party.

By this time, Gama already stood out as an abolitionist leader, and he was more than a little disappointed to learn, at one of the first meetings of the Republican Party, that most of those present — even some men of mixed race like his friend [96] Glicério — did not think the time was right to align the party with the abolitionist movement. They were afraid of losing the protection of wealthy planters. From this point on, Gama's relationship with the party was tense; he preferred to cast his lot with the abolitionists, rather than be tied to a group of slavocrats. He dedicated himself to defending slaves in the courts of law, and sometimes hid runaways in his own house and helped them elude their pursuers. Already in 1870 he had argued, in defense of a slave accused of killing his master, that every slave who killed a master only killed in self-defense. This view, hardly orthodox at the time, could only earn him the anger of slaveowners inclined to stonewall emancipation. Not surprisingly, then, he feared for his life and went about armed to protect himself from the vengeance of some outraged master.

With the help of some masonic lodges, Gama undertook a campaign to liberate slaves, based on the 1831 law that had prohibited the slave trade. Using this legal tactic, he was able to win the freedom of several slaves in the city of São Paulo. His efforts also extended to other towns of the province's interior: Campinas, Jundiaí, and Lorena. His unceasing activity on behalf of slaves earned him a group of admirers, most of them students in São Paulo's Law School, who collaborated with him in his abolitionist work. Until his death in 1882, he fought for the slaves' cause. He did not live to see the end of slavery, but his efforts were not wasted. His comrades kept up the fight, and saw his dream become reality in 1888.

## André Rebouças

Another illustrious black man who distinguished himself in the abolitionist campaign was André Rebouças. He was a descendent of a family of well-to-do Bahian political figures. As the son of a delegate, he received a very thorough education. In 1834, he took the entrance examination for the engineering course of the Military School, and the following year he gained a place in the Army. At the end of the fifth year of his training, he stood fifth in his class, earning distinction in astronomy, botany and mathematics. His intellectual identity was defined: he would be an engineer, a promising career in a country that [97] had just begun to develop. This vocation would not only provide him a way to earn a living, but would also carry with it a certain sense of social superiority. He would be an engineer in a country were engineers were scarce. He would try to stand out because of his professional competence. Through his profession he hoped to find acceptance in the world of the whites.

But there was no lack of occasions in which his color seemed to him a serious obstacle. Although educated and freely circulating in elite society, Rebouças was black, and being black in a country of slavery was not at all simple. He was denied a grant to travel and study abroad, and he blamed his color. He went abroad anyway, thanks to the help of his father.

Rebouças probably imagined that his acceptance by the elites would depend on his professional competence. Because of this, while in Europe, he inspected docks, examined the construction of bridges, viaducts, canals and aqueducts, and toured factories. Seemingly, his efforts were to be rewarded. Back in Brazil, he won some government commissions. In reality, however, the assignments came to him thanks to political connections. He began various construction projects, but each time found himself beset by professional jealousies and political persecutions. Some of the commissions he sought were given to others he thought less competent, and when he did succeed in getting an assignment he was attacked by rivals who questioned his professional abilities.

It did not take Rebouças long to perceive that everything was the fruit of political patronage. The dominant oligarchies in power really controlled everything. Nothing was done without their approval, and a patron was essential. Everyone was at the mercy of political patronage, since merit and talent were of little value. Rebouças was irritated by the interference of the politicians, but he could not survive without their support. He was consumed by an incessant struggle against what he saw as the harvest of backwardness, ignorance, and the arbitrary power of a small group of men. So it is no surprise that, already in 1870, he was a presence among the abolitionists. The struggle for the emancipation of the slaves permitted him (as it did many others) to sublimate his personal frustrations. As an abolitionist, he was helping rescue his race from captivity, giving vent to the resentments against the injustice he himself suffered because he was black, and at the same time was attacking those elites on whose [98] patronage he was so dependent but who had subjected him to so many humiliations.

In 1860, Rebouças drafted a proposal for emancipation, which foresaw, among other things, the creation of an organization to assist the freed slaves. But he never became a true, radical abolitionist. He preferred to target the masters rather than their slaves. "Addressing the victims", he said, "provokes odium and resentment, addressing the tormentors creates repentance, remorse, the noble desire to remedy injustices". He helped the abolitionist campaign with his material possessions and wrote pamphlets and drafted proposals, but he avoided their rallies. He did serve as treasurer of the Brazilian Antislavery Society and of the Abolitionist Confederation. He also wrote more than 120 articles in the principal newspapers of Rio de Janeiro.

Years later, describing the abolitionists' methods, Rebouças would say with a touch of irony:

We made ourselves into impresarios of public spectacles, at 500 réis per person; we swept out theaters, we nailed up placards; we were simultaneously writers, reporters, editors and distributors; we were the auctioneers at charity bazaars, ubiquitous propagandists in the streets and in the cafés, on the railroads and in theaters, in the Theater São Luiz, in the Theater Dom Pedro II, in the already historic Theater Polytheama, in the Recreio Dramático, in all the newspapers, in three thousand pamphlets, in numberless banquets and dinners, at balls and in parties, and even in the cemetery.

(The mention of the cemetery was a reference to a great demonstration the abolitionists promoted for the burial of the Viscount of Rio Branco)

Like many other men of his age group, Rebouças was a reformist. He fought not only for the emancipation of the slaves, but also on behalf of small landed proprietors, for greater municipal and provincial autonomy, and the liberation of industry and commerce from heavy government regulation. But he never became a republican. Like Joaquim Nabuco, he remained faithful to the monarchy until its final moment in 1889. He then went into voluntary exile and never again returned to Brazil. Disappointed with the "republic of slavocrats", as he described his country after the fall of the monarchy, he spent his late years [99] lamenting the destiny of the emperor, for whom he had great respect and with whom he continued to maintain contact. After the death of the emperor, Rebouças decided to go to Africa, perhaps in search of some sort of lost roots. Despite the insistence of friends that he return to Brazil, he maintained his exile. He finally settled in the Madeira Islands. On May 9, 1898 — a decade after the end of slavery in Brazil — his body was found floating in the sea, below a high outcropping of rock next to the hotel where he had been living. Apparently, devastated by some insidious disease, he had taken his own life.

## Joaquim Nabuco

Another famous abolitionist — perhaps the most famous of them all who died abroad, where he represented the Brazilian government, was Joaquim Nabuco.

Unlike Gama and Rebouças, who were men of mixed race, Nabuco was white — as were most of the Brazilian abolitionists. His origins were distinguished; he was a descendent of an important family of sugar producers of Pernambuco, son and grandson of notable political figures of the Empire. Nabuco was by birthright a member of the Brazilian elite. He was a man of refined tastes, an elegant bohemian, a familiar figure in elevated circles in Paris, London, Rome and New York; nothing would have foretold that he would transform himself into one of the greatest leaders of the abolitionist campaign. What could have led "Quincas, o Belo" — as his rivals called him — to become a militant abolitionist?

Nabuco was born in Recife in 1849. His father, recently elected Deputy, moved to the capital to take his seat. Since the trip would be long and difficult, Joaquim was entrusted to his godmother, the owner of the Massangana sugar mill, who would raise him until he was eight years old. There he lived like any other boy at a great sugar mill, surrounded by slaves. He listened to the tales of the old blacks, played with the slave boys, witnessed the scenes of humiliation and violence that were part of slavery, but also witnessed — as he would later recall — some moments of devotion and loyalty that bound together slaves and masters. Years later, as an adult, he recorded a scene that had [100] lingered in his memory: as a boy, he was sitting on the veranda when a slave boy threw himself at his feet pleading to become his slave. The slave boy was fleeing the punishments of a cruel master and had come to beg his protection. Joaquim intervened, and his godmother bought the slave boy and gave him to her young godson. Years later, this would be the role Nabuco chose to play: the protector of the slaves.

His life on the plantation was suddenly interrupted by the death of his godmother. He was sent to Rio, attended by three slaves — one of them the nurse who had cared for him as he was growing up. He started life again in the house of his parents in the city where the political elite was assembled. Through the house's grand staterooms passed ministers, counselors, senators, deputies, and the barons of the Empire.

When his primary studies were completed, Joaquim Nabuco enrolled in the city's celebrated school of law, the Faculdade de Direito de São Paulo. It did not take long for him to conquer the student body with his brilliant rhetoric, his physical attractiveness, and his important name. He seemed destined to follow in his father's footsteps. He would be a politician, and make his career in the Parliament. In 1868, his father's Liberal Party suffered a serious defeat. With the fall of the Zacarias ministry, the Conservatives assumed the control they would maintain for ten years. During those years, the Liberal Party was banished from power. Offended by the Emperor's decision to call on the Conservatives to form the new government, and irritated by the Conservative hegemony, the Liberal Party set loose a campaign in favor of various reforms. They condemned the political system, attacked even the Emperor, and demanded changes. One of the signers of this new party manifesto was the father of Joaquim Nabuco.

In the Faculdade de Direito, the atmosphere was very turbulent. Nabuco, predisposed by family tradition to political strife, became an orator, journalist and student leader. With Castro Alves, Rui Barbosa and other equally brilliant companions, he took part in literary conclaves and academic assemblies, where he defended the reform proposals. In 1869, at the height of the political crisis, he went to the city of his birth, Recife, along with a friend, the son of the Baron of Penedo, a young man of [101] wealth and aristocratic manners whose father was a member of the Brazilian Legation in London. In Recife, he was welcomed into the homes of the Baron of Vila Bela, the head of the Liberal Party, and of other equally important families whose wealth had been gained at the expense of slaves' labor. Nabuco passed his days and evenings in an intense social round. Nothing seemed to suggest that the young playboy would come to contest the legitimacy of an institution that was a principal pillar of that cheerful and frivolous society that moved from ball to ball and dinner to dinner.

During this time, however, touched by memories of childhood, Nabuco paid a visit to Massangana, which was about twenty miles south of Recife. It was there, he later recalled, that he swore an oath to defend the cause of the slaves. This story may not be true. It may have been created later, when Nabuco wrote his autobiographical Minha Formação [My Formation], in which he recalled this visit to Massangana. In any case, the truth is that, at this point in his life, Nabuco already identified himself with the cause of emancipation. He was treading in his father's footprints. In a letter of 1869, he wrote to his father that he yearned for the destiny of an Abraham Lincoln.

After being graduated from the law school, Nabuco returned to Rio. He was not attracted to the practice of law. His true vocation was politics. He would have liked to repeat the feats of his father and grandfather. But at this juncture it was not easy for a young Liberal to begin a political career.

The conservatives considered themselves solidly entrenched in power. What opportunities were available to Joaquim Nabuco, a Liberal and a political novice? He decided to try journalism, but had trouble finding themes that would hold the attention of readers. When his essays generated little enthusiasm, he considered travel. But he lacked the necessary resources. Not even his father's prestige appeared to be enough to win him a government grant. So he went back to his writing. This time, he hit upon a more successful theme: he wrote about reform. But even this hint of success could not keep his enthusiasm from cooling. He kept thinking of Europe, the dream of every rich and spoiled young man. Finally, his father decided to provide the money and Nabuco set out for Paris.

[102] He alternated his time in Paris between little dalliances and visits to famous French writers — Ernest Renan, Hippolyte Adolphe Taine, "Georges Sand" — who all received him cordially. His connections with the Brazilian embassy facilitated contact with famous French political figures. As a carefree tourist, he visited Italy, Switzerland and England, everywhere moving in elevated social circles, writing and reciting inconsequential poems in French.

Anxious for the approval of intellectuals in France, he distributed copies of his book of poems, Amour et Dieu. In return, he received cordial notes, but no substantial encouragement. His European year completed, he returned to Brazil elegantly garbed and full of literary pretensions. But once more he had difficulty finding a foothold and begin to consider a career in diplomacy.

In 1876, thanks to the intervention of prestigious friends, he was appointed attaché to the Brazilian Embassy in the United States. What he really had wanted was a posting to London, but even his father's prestige was not enough to gain that for him. The candidates were many, the appointments few. He took up the post in the United States, and remained in it until he could no longer stand the tedious tasks he was given. He turned again to travel, the only activity that seemed to satisfy him at this point in his life.

In 1878, the situation changed; the Liberal Party returned to power. The doors than had been shut now opened. Nabuco gained the posting to London he had wanted, and also the promise of a seat in the Chamber of Deputies. The death of his father interrupted his European stay and brought him back to Brazil. The commitments that the Liberal Party chief, the Baron of Vila Bela, had made to Nabuco's father, promising to endorse his son Joaquim's candidacy for a place in the Chamber were kept, despite considerable opposition within the party. The Liberals of Pernambuco just did not trust this elegant youth who until this point had offered no evidence that as a deputy he could adequately represent the interests of the provincial elite. Their doubts escalated when Nabuco took the stage at Recife's grand Teatro Santa Isabel to identify slavery as the great problem of Brazilian democracy. The audience received this challenging declaration with derisive jeering.

[103] Despite the ill-will of many in his own party, and because of the prestige of his family and the support of the Baron of Vila Bela, Nabuco won the election, though by a slender margin. He entered Parliament as deputy for Pernambuco in Brazil's 17th legislative session, alongside several of his old colleagues from the Faculdade de Direito — among them the young Bahian who would distinguish himself in the abolitionist campaign, Rui Barbosa.

In the Chamber, Nabuco made a very successful debut. He discovered a new vocation: orator. He enchanted the galleries with his speeches in favor of progressive causes, abolition among them. His brilliant rhetoric gained him a great reputation. His position in Parliament gave the abolitionists a privileged forum. The abolitionist press acclaimed him. In the Gazeta da

Tarde, the famous mulatto abolitionist José do Patrocínio transformed Nabuco into a hero. Nabuco, this descendent of the grand Pernambucan oligarch Paes Barreto, this son and grandson of senators, had introduced himself to Parliament as a defender of slaves! The identification of Nabuco with abolitionism was fixed. With other leaders of the movement, he founded the Brazilian Anti-Slavery Society.

To seek the support of international abolitionist associations, Nabuco now returned to Europe. No one was better qualified for the mission. Wherever he went, he was received with the honors due to an important leader. What a difference between the youth who in earlier years had anxiously sought out intellectuals like Renan or Georges Sand, only to receive courteous responses, and the parliamentarian, standard-bearer of a just and universally approved cause, who was now received everywhere with respect and deference. In Lisbon, Madrid, Paris and London, the antislavery societies paid homage to Nabuco with accolades that the abolitionist press in Brazil was quick to announce.

The defenders of slavery would not forgive Nabuco this ardent identification with abolitionism. In 1881, as a result of new elections for the Chamber, Nabuco, along with other abolitionist candidates, confronted ferocious opposition. The great planters controlled enough of the electorate to keep these radicals from returning to Parliament — at least temporarily, until the abolitionists could mobilize more public support.

Desolated by the election results, Nabuco once more set out for London, where he remained for some time as a correspondent [104] of the Jornal do Commercio, Pernambuco's most important newspaper. In his free time, he worked on the book that would bring him fame, O abolicionismo, published in 1883 and received with great fanfare by the abolitionist press, especially the Gazeta da Tarde and the Gazeta de Notícias, where several of his friends had positions. The book was a vilification of slavery. Forty years earlier, a forgotten writer named Francisco Cesar Burlamaque, had attacked slavery in almost identical terms, but without attracting much attention. Now, everything had changed, and Nabuco's book was a resounding success among the abolitionists.

While Nabuco remained in London, the abolitionist campaign moved forward in Brazil. André Rebouças, Joaquim Serra, João Clapp and many others set up conferences, organized rallies, wrote pamphlets and articles in favor of abolition. In all the capital cities of the country, abolitionist groups and associations were formed. In some of the provinces, the movement was [105] gaining momentum rapidly, especially in Ceará, Amazonas, and Rio Grande do Sul.

## ![](_page_104_Picture_0.jpeg)

"The abolitionist movement grows more and more remarkable, and the Club of Libertos [freed men and women] of Niterói, headed by the patriotic citizen [João F.] Clapp, provided another obvious proof that the idea is on the move, not only in the streets but also in the heads of many people." Revista Ilustrada, year 7, n.292, p.4. March 25, 1882.

[106] In the capital of the Empire, Nabuco's friends wanted him to return. They counted on him to reinforce the campaign. The moment was all the more urgent because Manuel Pinto de Souza Dantas was now president of the Council of State, and had promised the Emperor he would reopen the question of emancipation in Parliament.

The new head of the ministry had already made it plain that he was not really an abolitionist, but he recognized the fact that they could not be ignored. In the opening discourse presenting his program to the Chamber of Deputies, he declared that he intended to take up the question of emancipation, but prudently, and in a way that would be attentive both to generous sentiments and "humanitarian aspirations", on one hand, and on the other to "the respected rights of property".

"It is the imperative duty of the Government, aided by the Legislative Power, to fix a limit which prudence permits, and civilization insists, that we reach." His motto was: "Do not go backward, nor halt, nor precipitate".

Once more, the government was adopting a conciliatory strategy. The ministry proposed a project of modest proportions, hoping to placate both abolitionists and slaveowners. It would propose measures designed to impede the transfer of slaves from one province to another, an increase in the Emancipation Fund, and the emancipation of all slaves over sixty years old. Despite the efforts of the ministry, the conciliatory strategy failed. A vote of no confidence brought about the dissolution of the Chamber and a call for new elections.

The elections were hotly disputed. Nabuco returned to take part, bearing the halo of a myth the abolitionists had helped to fashion. André Rebouças took charge of preparing a warm reception. Everything became a pretext for attracting public attention to the abolitionist cause. Nabuco's reputation grew steadily, as he became a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies. Despite all the efforts of the abolitionists — and of Nabuco, who claimed he campaigned house-to-house in Recife — he took second place in the voting. In any case, this legislature would last only a short time, and he would retake his seat in the Parliament of 1886-89.

The re-election of Nabuco was the result, in large part, of the votes of the urban population of Recife. Those who could actually [107] vote confronted the oligarchs and supported the abolitionist. A majority of the city's population, however, might sympathize with abolitionism, but did not have the right to vote. This was one of the reasons it was difficult for abolitionist candidates to win elections. The vote remained largely in the hands of the traditional elites, despite the electoral reform of 1881, which had supposedly given greater weight to urban electorates. But after the reform, the total number of urban voters was actually smaller than it had been before. In the national elections of 1886, only 117,671 people voted in the entire country, out of total population of 14 million.

Despite its unrepresentative nature, Parliament still had to take up the question of slavery again. Nabuco continued to press his relentless campaign for emancipation until the final victory of 1888. But throughout the crusade, he always made it clear that he did not favor any sort of mobilization of the slaves themselves. For him, as for Rebouças, abolition was the task of Parliament. "It is in the Parliament, and not on the plantations or in the quilombos of the countryside, nor in the streets and plazas of the cities, that the cause of liberty must be won or lost", he wrote in 1883. But it would in fact be the uprisings in the slave quarters and the work of anonymous abolitionists that would deal the death blow to slavery and make possible the victory of the anti-slavery cause inside Parliament.

History would consecrate the names of Joaquim Nabuco, Luiz Gama, José do Patrocínio, Princess Isabel, and of the Emperor. Theirs would be the laurels of the victory. But aside from these there were many others whose names have left no trace in history: the anonymous heroes of abolition.

Comparing the lives of Joaquim Nabuco, Luiz Gama, André Rebouças, and many other abolitionist leaders recruited among the elites, to which they belonged either by birthright like Nabuco or by acquired right like Gama, it is clear that, despite the many individual differences, they had much in common, even if their origins were diverse. They all belonged to more or less the same age group, beginning their public lives in the 1870s, during the period of the ostracism of the Liberal Party, when the reformist movement began. All of them, one way or another, were affected by the reformist discourse that took [108] shape during that time, in response to the social and economic transformations of the second half of the nineteenth century, but also in response to the political crisis set in motion by the fall of the Zacarias ministry and the ascension of the Conservatives. They all were tossed about by the dizzying ups and downs of politics. Their successes and failures depended heavily on the patronage they received or failed to receive — from the figures of the oligarchy who moved in and out of power. They all maintained an ambiguous relationship with those oligarchs, finding in abolitionism not just a form of political identity but a way of criticizing the elites. For some, abolitionism was a matter of inspiration, for others, it was a political instrument. For some, abolition brought them an audience, for others, it provided a supporting electorate. But for all of them it was a mode of condemning the "backwardness and ignorance" of Brazilian society and of identifying themselves with the "progress and civilization" of Europe. By becoming abolitionists, they made themselves the standard-bearers of "progress" in Brazil. But if their role in the movement for abolition was important, perhaps more important still was the part played by innumerable others, black and white, free and slave, who fought anonymously for the cause of liberation.

<sup>1</sup> The Portuguese word is "bode", a male goat. In Brazil, during this period, it was a slang expression that referred rudely to a person of mixed race.

#### [109] CHAPTER 9

## ANONYMOUS HEROES, THE PROTESTS OF THE ENSLAVED, AND ABOLITION

At the beginning of the 1880s, the abolitionist movement entered upon an insurrectionary phase. At first, this development was nearly spontaneous, but it later became more organized. Secret societies sprang into being whose primary activities were to instigate rebellion in slave quarters and to help slaves to escape. Among such organizations, the best-known are the *Clube do Cupim* [Club of the Termite] in Recife and the group known as the *caifazes* in São Paulo. Much less is known about the activities of many other clubs, organizations and societies that operated throughout Brazil. But the *caifazes* were probably typical of the way such organizations functioned.

## The Caifazes

The *caifazes* were organized by Antônio Bento, born in São Paulo in 1841, son of a pharmacist. He attended the Faculdade de Direito and, after graduation, was a justice of the peace and then a municipal judge. In the positions he occupied, he tried always to defend slaves, following the lead of Luiz Gama. He was profoundly religious, and tried to put his faith at the service of the slaves and their emancipation. He began as a youth to participate [110] in the abolitionist movement. He organized a secret society with a headquarters hidden in the brotherhood of black men of the Church of Our Lady of the Remedies. The society brought together men of varying social backgrounds: businessmen like Abílio Soares and Costa Moreira, pharmacists like Luis Labre and João Cândido Martins, lawyers, journalists, coachmen, workers, artisans and students of the law school. They were whites, blacks and mulattoes. The society's newsletter, A Redempção [The Redemption], urged people to fight against slavery with every means at their disposal.

The caifazes denounced the horrors of slavery in the press, they defended slaves in the courts, they staged public events in favor of emancipation, they collected money to buy manumissions, and they protected fugitive slaves. And they did not stop there. They harassed bounty hunters who tracked down runaway slaves, they sabotaged police efforts, and they denounced abuses committed by masters, exposing them to public shaming. They also tried, through the press and constant propaganda, to keep the public constantly mobilized.

The caifazes operated not only in the city of São Paulo but also in the interiors of the provinces, urging slaves to run away, providing them with material aid, and protecting them during their flight. They spirited them away from their plantations and gave them salaried jobs in other places. They moved fugitives along to safe locations, where they would be secure from their masters' pursuit. One of these safe locations was the famous Quilombo Jabaquara, which had grown up in the mountainous area between Santos and São Paulo. It would eventually become a sheltering place for more than ten thousand fugitive slaves.

# Masters and Slaves

Escapes of slaves was not a new phenomenon. Since the earliest origins of slavery, flight had been a form of slave protest. Throughout the colonial period, authorities had to contend with runaways. To provide men to hunt them down, an official [111] position was created, capitão do mato [captain of the forest, a bounty hunter]. The Portuguese legislation attempted, in every kind of way, to restrain the slaves. It forbade them to carry arms and forbade them to leave their plantations without the express consent of their masters. It punished any free person who might rent a living space to a slave, or conduct any kind of commercial transaction — no matter how minor — with a slave without previous permission of the master. Even more severe penalties awaited runaway slaves, or anyone who gave them aid or shelter. But despite all such laws, chronicles of the colonial period are filled with accounts of runaways, quilombos, and slave uprisings.

Slaveowners lived always with the impression that their human property constituted a potential threat to their safety, and that it was necessary not only to be vigilant but also to mete out severe punishments to the guilty so that indiscipline did not spread to other slaves. Violence was an essential element of the system of slavery. But it was not enough to keep the slaves under complete control, especially in times when in some areas the slaves constituted a large majority of the population. Masters were compelled to devise other forms of control. They tried to secure slaves' loyalty by promises of rewards, including even hints of manumission in return for good behavior.

Ambiguous and contradictory relationships bound masters and slaves together. Violence and affection from the side of the masters, loyalty and betrayal from the side of the slaves, were the antithetical aspects that frequently came into play. If the masters were familiar with slave rebelliousness, they also knew examples of loyalty and devotion, which they tried to reward generously as a way of encouraging similar behavior on the part of their other slaves. Slaves sometimes showed more loyalty to their owners than to their brothers in bondage. Many slave conspiracies were frustrated when the plot was exposed by a slave who put loyalty to the master ahead of loyalty to his own oppressed class. Some of those who betrayed their fellow slaves were consecrated as heroes in the histories of the time. Such was the case of the famous Henrique Dias, whom historians presented as a hero of the wars against the Dutch, failing to mention that the proofs [112] of loyalty for which he was actually compensated included his efforts to destroy quilombos. In the gallery of illustrious men of the colonial period composed by Domingos Loureto Couto in 1767, a place of honor was reserved for the sons of Ganga Zumba, one of the rulers of the huge Quilombo of Palmares (in the present state of Alagoas). They won this illustrious place by fighting alongside the Portuguese against their own fellow men.

All this indicates that there were rebellious slaves but also slaves who adjusted to their situation. A majority of slaves seem to have come more or less to terms with their captivity. If this had not been so, then slavery probably would have been destroyed long before it was officially abolished. In the colonial period, not only was any attempt at rebellion violently repressed, but the slaves themselves lacked the means to plan and organize a large-scale uprising that might have destroyed the institution of slavery.

# The Slave and Abolitionism

In the nineteenth century, the situation was very different. Abolitionism lent a new dimension to the possibilities of slave resistance. It gave the slave new perception of himself, and at the same time molded a public opinion much more sympathetic to the slave. Abolitionism conferred on slave resistance a dignity that it had never had before, lending slave actions a new kind of political significance. It endowed slave rebellion with legitimacy at the same time that it denied the legitimacy of the system of slavery. It made slavery itself the crime, and absolved the slaves of their misdeeds. It made the master the tormentor and the slave his victim.

Abolition lent energy to the slave, and also provided him with tools he had never had before. Thanks to the abolitionist campaign, it became possible for slaves to discover magistrates who were willing to judge them fairly, lawyers ready to defend them, and a population inclined to treat them with sympathy, give them support and protection. Finally, abolitionism provided [113] slaves with an ideology that both justified their resistance and condemned its repression.

"While in Parliament there's only talk and nothing gets settled, the blacks are very speedily scampering away from the plantations. The planters can scarcely hold them back." Revista Ilustrada, year 12, n.466. p.4. September 30, 1887.

But the abolitionist campaign itself was possible only because of the transformations of the conditions of production during the nineteenth century, changes that made slave labor increasingly irrelevant on a national scale even as it continued to be essential for many individual planters. Without the transformations that made it possible to consider alternative solutions to the problem of labor, the abolitionist movement would probably have been impossible. But abolitionism had its own reciprocal effect on the conditions of production. As its impact on public opinion grew and as it gained small parliamentary victories, it helped make slavery seem more onerous to the planters and more and more immoral in the eyes of a growing majority of the population. And it was this grand shift that made slave revolts appear to be legitimate.

In the 1880s, instigated by the abolitionists, slaves began to flee their plantations in ever-increasing numbers. This phenomenon was particularly significant in the coffee areas of São Paulo, exactly the province where the abolitionists were most active.

"Agriculture and the freedman.

Well! Yesterday it was so much whipping to get me to work. Today, only money and adulation. Ha! Ha!" Revista Ilustrada, year 15, n.499, p.6. June 21, 1888.

# Subaltern Classes

During this period, there was frequent talk and writing about unrest in the poorer ranks of society, and also about the support the slaves were finding there. In fact, historians have found that the abolitionist movement enlisted immigrants, free and recently liberated blacks, and men and women of the most diverse origins and social backgrounds. They constituted the mass of those nameless people who contributed so much to the disruption of production on the plantations and to the advance of the abolitionist campaign. For example, abolitionist leaders enjoyed considerable safety when they agitated in the streets protected by capoeiras — fighters who practiced a very effective and acrobatic wrestling technics developed by African descendents (The proponents of slavery sometimes did hire their own capoeiras to protect them from street crowds).

[115] In São Paulo, a considerable number of Portuguese, Italian and German immigrants were arrested by the police and charged with inciting slaves to revolt. Immigrants were captured on plantations, arguing about the idea of property rights and encouraging slaves to run away. Some of these were contracted colonos. Others were peddlers who traveled through the countryside from plantation to plantation selling their trade goods — but also spreading abolitionist ideas. Others owned roadside stalls where slaves made their petty transactions. Still others were railroad workers. A great variety of social types were among those denounced by the landowners and detained by the police as agitators. As abolitionism advanced, these numbers grew: "Today it is not only the slaves who must be feared", said the police chief of Campinas. "It is also those rabble-rousers who excite them".

Counting on the sympathy and even complicity of large segments of the population, the slaves grew more and more daring. Starting in 1884 in São Paulo, it was common to see bands of blacks roaming the streets of cities and towns, defying the authorities, wrenching runaways from the hands of a capitão do mato [slave hunter], or invading trains to liberate slaves from their traveling masters. The audacity of the agitators increased along with their impunity. The abolitionist press praised their deeds. The pro-slavery press responded with virulent condemnations and demands for strong measures to contain the spreading insurrection. Most planters stood with the police, most of the population with the slaves.

As time wore on, it became more and more difficult to contain mass demonstrations of solidarity with the slaves. Urban populations jeered at the police and demonstrated in front of jails to protest police repression and to demand the release of captive slaves. Even the police and the Army began to show signs of disrespect for the established hierarchy. Some soldiers actually disobeyed their officers and supported the abolitionists.

# Disrespect and Demoralization

A typical case occurred in Campinas. At a planter's request, a captain named Colatino, well-known for his harsh actions [116] against slaves, sent a detachment of thirty-four troopers with loaded arms to a nearby plantation to put down a slave uprising. On the road, the soldiers encountered a large number of slave men, women and children who were the property of Antônio Pinto Ferraz. They had abandoned his plantation, complaining of mistreatment. The soldiers immediately seized the slaves and took them to the jail in Campinas under the cover of darkness, probably to avoid an abolitionist protest.

## ![](_page_114_Picture_2.jpeg)

"The police corps of the province of... Sr. Paulino, in the service of rural slaveowners, savagely attack the print shop of the abolitionist newspaper Vinte Cinco de Março [March 25], destroying all the equipment. The abolitionists defended themselves against the vandals with complete courage and fought a grand fight, with wounded on both sides." Revista Ilustrada, year 12, n.469, p.8. October 29, 1887.

The next day, some of the slaves were taken back to the plantation, guarded by soldiers with bayonets fixed. A large number of people assembled at the door of the jail to condemn the actions of the police. Violent words were exchanged between Captain Colatino and the crowd.

The conflict did not end there. An abolitionist journalist, Henrique de Barcellos, unleashed a campaign in the press against Captain Colatino, accusing him of invading the homes of peaceful citizens in his hunt for fugitive slaves. The planters, [117] for their part, thought they had been well-served by the captain, and spoke out in his support. In a provocative gesture of disobedience and disrespect for military hierarchy, two officers under Captain Colatino's command joined a manifestation of support for the journalist. As a result, the two were arrested and sent to Rio de Janeiro, where they were committed to the military prison of Santa Cruz. But there they received a warm demonstration of solidarity by abolitionists, who were increasingly numerous in the ranks of the Army.

Episodes of this sort clearly indicated that the days of slavery were numbered. The planters were becoming more and more isolated, and the authorities more and more impotent (when they were not actually conniving) in the face of an insurrection that seemed to gain momentum every day.

Incidents multiplied in the nation's capital city as well, revealing how far the demoralization of slavery had gone. Confrontations between abolitionists and the pro-slavery faction occurred repeatedly, day after day. The police (and others) did what they could to repress abolitionist actions. In August 1887, a multitude that had gathered in the Teatro Polytheama to protest some unpopular measures adopted by the government was attacked with bombs by a band of *capoeiras* hired to break up abolitionist demonstrations. The police chief, Coelho Bastos, took advantage of this event to prohibit any public assemblies after dark. A meeting organized the following day to protest against this prohibition was broken up by the police. And the police abuses did not end there. Physical attacks against the abolitionist *Jornal da Tarde* happened repeatedly, and there were those who said that paid agents of the government were behind them.

Serious incidents also occurred in the region of Campos, where slave protests were brutally repressed by the police. The offices of a local abolitionist newspaper, *Vinte Cinco de Março* [March Twenty-Fifth] were invaded by the police. The headquarters of the *Gazeta do Povo* [The People's Gazette] was also assaulted. The tactics of the police were the same everywhere in the country. They were trying to dismantle the abolitionist press, which they believed was responsible for unrest and agitation among the slaves. Editors and printers were intimidated in various ways, and when the intimidation did not produce [118] immediate results they were physically assaulted. When people assembled to protest against the abuses committed by the police, they were sometimes met with gunfire. Occasionally, innocent participants died, as happened in Campos, where a black woman was killed during a demonstration. Incidents of this type lent even more energy to the abolitionist campaign, and demoralized even further the repressive authorities — conferring even greater legitimacy on abolitionists in the eyes of the people.

Conflicts of this type were repeated in various parts of the country. It was increasingly clear that abolition had become a truly popular cause. And a truly popular cause is not easily defeated. It was all the more difficult to defeat it when the people could count on the support of some sectors of the dominant classes.

## Manumissions

Most of the planters continued to resist abolition, since it would entail a loss of their capital investment in slaves. Many of them, however, came to see that the situation was becoming more and more untenable. Some reached the conclusion that only emancipation could put a stop to the agitation and the disruption of work. Worried over the flight of slaves, a large number of planters rushed to concede conditional manumissions. The slaves were freed, but only in return for a commitment to continue to work on the plantations for periods that varied from two to five years. Sometimes freedom was granted in return for nothing more than the slaves' promise to bring in the next harvest. Other planters, caught in a bind and fearful of losing an entire harvest, granted unconditional liberty to their slaves, just hoping that they would remain to work on the plantations.

As a result, starting in 1886, the number of manumissions grew very rapidly. In São Paulo, the official registration of March 30, 1887, counted only 107,329 slaves. Two years earlier, there had been more than 150,000. In less than a year, the officials in charge of counting slaves registered 50,000

manumissions — not counting many others that had not been formalized. Runaway slaves should be added to these numbers to produce an adequate [119] measure of the grave predicament of the São Paulo planters. It was becoming increasingly obvious that their position could not be sustained.

"Fortunately, abolitionism is producing the best possible results! There are numberless mass liberations, which daily bring honor upon the masters who concede them." Revista Ilustrada, year 13, n.495, p.4. April 28, 1888.

## The Victory of the Abolitionists

In spite of everything, some planters still hoped to be able to deter the march of the process by resorting to police coercion and repression. They insisted that the government take measures to suppress the agitation. Others, however, came to the conclusion that emancipation was the best option. During 1887, planters came together everywhere to discuss the situation and to propose solutions.

More than a hundred planters of Campinas and Itu signed a statement expressing their concern, and sent it to a known spokesman of the interests of the slaveholders in the Chamber of Deputies, Andrade Figueira. So severe was the unrest, they said, that they could no longer trust in the diligence of the provincial government, let alone in its shrinking legal capabilities. After voicing their shock at the provincial government — which they [120] believed was doing nothing to prevent fugitive slaves from settling in Cubatão — they asked that "prompt and energetic steps" be taken to restore these fugitives to their rightful owners. They also wanted something done to contain the "criminal excesses of the anarchists and orators at *meetings*".<sup>1</sup>

At the same time that Andrade Figueira laid this statement before the Chamber of Deputies, Afonso Celso brought before the chamber another representation written under a quite different impulse. It recognized that the authorities were impotent in face of the current abuses. The people who owned slaves were an insignificant minority, and the large majority was indifferent to the violation of slaveowners' property rights. Thus, governmental authority felt itself too weak to maintain an odious institution "that only the needs of one class justified". This representation pointed out that resistance to the idea of abolition was producing only opposite effects, and that the planters were, little by little, losing the moral support of the rest of the population. It recommended that concessions be made, since whatever was not spontaneously conceded would probably be taken by the slavers, and at the cost of popular conflict and delirium. The statement ended by suggesting that all the slaveholders grant freedom to their slaves, providing that they continue working on their plantations until December 31, 1890.

In 1887, the Republican Party of São Paulo, fearful of losing what support it had among the planters, had avoided taking a clear stand on the question of emancipation, always arguing that the problem belonged entirely to the monarchist parties. Now it changed its strategy. It decided to publicly support a proposed law that would liberate all slaves by July 14, 1889 — the one-hundredth anniversary of the Fall of the Bastile, a grand symbol of the French Revolution. Similarly, the Church now openly manifested its support for abolition. In November 1887, some planters met in São Paulo to create an association promoting the emancipation of the slaves. A little later, an even larger number of landowners returned to the provincial capital, proposing the end of slavery in three years.

## ![](_page_119_Picture_1.jpeg)

"At last, the bishops of the Empire can no longer contain their indignation at the tortures inflicted on the miserable enslaved." Revista Ilustrada, year 12, n.471, p.6. November 12, 1887.

And so began the year 1888. Many people still doubted that abolition would come very soon — among them Joaquim Nabuco. All the more so because a proposal put forward by Afonso Celso the year before, fixing the date for the end of slavery in 1890, had met with massive opposition from deputies representing Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Nothing seemed to suggest that the moment of victory was at hand. One modest measure presented by the Viscount of Jaguaribe had failed even to attract a quorum that would have permitted a vote. The ministry decided to seek no change, but to let matters stand as they were. However, while Parliament continued to appear immobilized, abolitionists were at work in the cities and in the countryside, along the margins of law. At the beginning of 1888, the Cotegipe ministry entered into crisis and was forced to renounce. On March 7, Princess Isabel (now ruling as princess regent) summoned the Liberal João Alfredo Correia de Oliveira to form a new government. The president of the new Council of Ministers, when he first appeared before the Chamber of Deputies, announced his intention to put forward a proposal abolishing slavery. This declaration was greeted by prolonged applause from the galleries of the Chamber.

[122] "The Abolitionist Confederation, not knowing what piece of ground they could apply for, chose the Campo do Acclamação, and invited the public in broad daylight. The government wished to demonstrate its respect for the right of assembly by using horses' hooves to order the people to disperse. Long live the Constitution!" Revista Ilustrada, year 12, n.462, p.8. August 13, 1887.

In her Speech from the Throne inaugurating the new session of the Chamber of Deputies on May 3, Princess Isabel declared:

The extinction of the servile element through the action of national sentiment and of individual liberties, honoring Brazil, went forward peacefully and in such a manner that it is now acclaimed by all classes, and with admirable examples of self-sacrifice on the part of the owners.

When private interest itself comes forward spontaneously to help Brazil rid itself of the unhappy inheritance that the necessities of agriculture had maintained, I trust that you will not hesitate to remove from the nation's law the only exception that it retains that is antagonistic to the Christian and liberal spirit of our institutions.

Christianity and liberalism, which had coexisted with slavery for a very long time, had now become, in almost all eyes, incompatible with human bondage.

Ten days later, on May 13, 1888, the princess would sign the measure that put an end to slavery in Brazil. But as the president of the province of São Paulo would observe, the law only "sealed an accomplished fact".

"In view of the Speech from the Throne (which says 'I trust that you will not hesitate to erase from our public law the unfortunate inheritance, etc., etc.') we expect the Parliament to use all its enthusiasm, a good sponge, and all the ingredients necessary to make this shameful stain disappear forever." Revista Ilustrada, year 13, n.496, p.1. May 5, 1888.

The statement used this English word.

#### [125] CHAPTER 10

## AFTER THE FACT

On May 13, the slaves were finally free. In the streets, the people celebrated the victory. "It was the only popular delirium that I can remember having witnessed", said Machado de Assis of the people's celebrations.

But the process that had led to this festive release had been long and difficult. In retrospect, it is possible to discern a direction and a logic. But for those who participated in this process, it was often incomprehensible, full of uncertainties, anxieties and frustrations. This was true equally for abolitionists and for their opponents.

The celebrations of May 13 obscured the scenes of violence that had preceded abolition. The twenty years of parliamentary campaigning for emancipation, the heated debates that had ended always in compromises from which the slaves actually gained little, the sometimes bloody conflicts, the persecutions of abolitionists, the terror and the rage of the slaveowners, all this was forgotten. On May 13, abolition seemed to be a simple victory for the abolitionists, a benefaction of Princess Isabel, a generous act of Parliament, a conquest by the people, but above all an act of homage to the civilization of the century. The contradictions that had driven the process were hidden behind the peaceful outcome.

[126] Praise and acclaim smothered the protests of those for whom abolition spelled ruin. In the midst of the general elation, it was difficult to hear the voices of those planters whose fortunes were already damaged and plantations mortgaged, who had tried to the very end to hold back the process. These planters looked on abolition through a different lens. They blamed the Emperor for the support he had lent to the cause of emancipation. They accused the abolitionists of irresponsibility and the government of short-sightedness. Resentful of abolition, many of them now joined the Republican Party.

Fifty years later it was still possible to hear echoes of these voices. "The abolitionists were the communists of today, always ready to grab what was not theirs", said one descendent of a master of slaves. "The law of May 13, if it was humane for the slave, was still inhumane for the masters", said the son of a planter whose fortune had been assessed at 100 contos of réis in 1885 and was reduced to 30 contos after abolition.

Today, more than a century later, with the passions of the past at rest, it is possible to understand the process with more clarity. Neither the will of a handful of men, nor the actions of the Emperor are sufficient to explain abolition. The most diverse factors contributed to make it possible. Some had to do with transformations that were taking place on a global scale: the development of capitalism and the industrial revolution doomed slavery as a labor system. Before abolition became a national aspiration in Brazil, slavery had been condemned on both economic and moral grounds in the developed nations. In the second half of the nineteenth century, Brazil was one of only a few countries where there still were slaves. But, by this time slavery had already come to be identified with ignorance and backwardness, and emancipation with progress and civilization.

Just as important as the transformations that had taken place outside Brazil were those through which the nation itself had passed. In several regions of the country, these changes had helped to make slavery an obsolete form of labor. In the 1880s, a considerable number of planters had sought out alternative sources of workers. Even though a majority of them continued to defend slavery as an institution — because slaves represented a capital investment they did not wish to lose — they could face [127] abolition with more calm than had their predecessors who, half a century before, had opposed even the suspension of the slave trade. In the decades prior to abolition, some planters had even become adapted to the use of free labor.

As time passed, the number of those who opposed any change whatever grew smaller. Social groups had emerged that were less tied to slavery, and more inclined to lend sympathetic ears to the abolitionist message. For them, the abolitionist campaign was an indirect tool in their struggle against the oligarchies with whom their relationships were increasingly ambivalent. In this sense, abolition can be understood as an expression of the class struggle being waged in the country in the late nineteenth century. For intellectuals, abolition was a source of inspiration. For politicians, an instrument of political action. To the intellectual, abolition offered a public, to the politician an electorate.

Abolitionist discourse brought diverse groups together, and gave voice to the most varied of interests. The collusion of ample sectors of society made it possible for modest free people and even slaves to mobilize in the struggle against slavery. It was this mobilization that finally brought about the approval of the Lei Áurea. In this way, the law was, as one journalist of the time observed, a victory of the people. And, one might add, of black people, both free and slave.

These, however, did not write their own history. That was told by others. The history that would find its way into the textbooks honored parliamentary actions and laws. These were described as voluntary benefactions of the dominant classes. The heroes were those who — in a country where only a third of the people could read — had the privilege of being able to write and could set down their own history. Those who remained unrecognized were the numberless devoted abolitionists, white, black, and mulatto, without whom emancipation could never have been conquered.

Abolition did not bring about either the fears of the slaveowners or the expectations of the abolitionists. It was neither catastrophe nor redemption. Gregório Bezerra, in his memoirs, tells the story of a black man who had been a foreman on a plantation in the Northeast, where Bezerra had worked as a child during the first years of the twentieth century. "He had been a [128] slave, and continued to be worse than a slave", Bezerra wrote. "And he was wistful for slavery because, according to him, in those times he ate all the meat, meal and beans he wanted, and now ate hardly anything more than a plate of corn mush with water and salt."

"The Revista during the festive commemorations of Abolition.

We would be unfaithful to the most sacred of our printing plates if, before putting it to use, we did not engrave on our first page our thanks to all the societies, associations and classes that so often saluted us during these celebrations." Revista Ilustrada, year 13, n.498, p.1. May 19, 1888.

[129] Product of the desperation of a man who "after abolition was abandoned to his own fate", with no assurance from society of minimum conditions of survival, this testimony of an ex-slave wistful for slavery should not be understood as an endorsement of slavery. It is, instead, an eloquent commentary on the living conditions confronted by many ex-slaves, for whom abolition had represented only the right to be free to choose between the oppression of slavery and the misery in which a great number of Brazil's workers lived (and still live today).

Abolition was only a first step in the direction of the emancipation of the Brazilian people. Arbitrary authority, ignorance, violence, poverty, and the prejudices that slavery created still weigh heavily on Brazilian society. If it is just to commemorate the Thirteenth of May, the commemoration must not confuse us to the point that we transform the liberty it symbolizes into a myth that serves only the oppression and exploitation of labor.

#### [131] CHAPTER 11

## THE IMPACT OF ABOLITION

Abolition did not bring about either the economic ruin or the social chaos that the pessimists had predicted. In fact, from the point of view of the dominant classes, the transition from slave to free labor was extraordinarily successful. The disruption of work by the accelerating flight of slaves during the years leading up to the law that put an end to slavery was followed by a period of rapid reorganization in the more dynamic sectors of the economy. Although planters whose economic situation was already precarious before abolition were damaged, and some actually forced to abandon their plantations, most planters made this transition without severe problems.

Once the elation of the first weeks of freedom wore off, most of the slaves offered no resistance at all, in sharp contrast to the spirit of revolt and rebellion that had prevailed during the years leading up to emancipation. They apparently accommodated themselves rapidly to the lives of free men and women.

Abolition in Brazil was not a result of revolution, such as had occurred in Santo Domingo, nor of Civil War, as in the United States. The owners of slaves had not been forced to confront the imperial government of a mother country, as had been the case in Caribbean colonies like Cuba or Jamaica. In Brazil, the planters could control the transition, especially after 1889, when the centralized monarchy was replaced by a federative [132] republic in which the provinces gained more autonomy. Despite the claims for compensation that planters continued to make for a time, until it became clear that the government would not grant them, the slaveowners were not threatened by any serious inter- or intra-class conflicts. Clearly there were differences among them: the wealthier planters and the proprietors of newer and fully productive plantations were better able to confront the transition than planters burdened with debt and whose plantations were not as profitable. These differences would lead to some protests and resentments. But the planters as a class were all interested in a peaceful transition to free labor. And they all wanted access to easy credit and cheap, abundant free labor in order to deal with the changeover.

The former slaveowners also did not encounter serious challenges from other social groups. The Brazilian middle classes were, in their own ways, members of the planters' clienteles, and with rare exceptions depended on their patronage. They had not reached the point of developing a viable independent project that might be able to challenge the agrarian elite. In addition, many abolitionists, like Joaquim Nabuco, were themselves members of the elite and descendents of important families tied to the agrarian sector. In spite of their inflamed rhetoric in the service of the liberation of slaves, they were more interested in freeing Brazilian society of the "cancer" of slavery than in the fate of the liberated people. Once abolition was won, most of them were satisfied: they had reached their goal.

To understand the lack of measures designed to integrate the ex-slaves into society, it is necessary to keep those facts in mind. Only then can we begin to comprehend why Brazil did not experience a period of "apprenticeship" prior to emancipation, as was the case in British colonies, or an institution like the Freedmen's Bureau in the United States after the Civil War, whose purpose was to assist the ex-slaves. Only then can we begin to understand the silence in the documents of the period about what happened to the slaves after abolition. Only then can we begin to understand why the historians have preferred to study abolition rather than to study its consequences for the emancipated population.

The lack of measures on a national scale meant to assist the freed men and women, and the great variety of programs put [133] into practice in different parts of the country, make it difficult to deal with this problem. Taking the province of São Paulo as an example, it would seem clear that most of the planters were concerned only with ways of guaranteeing a steady supply of workers, either by an increase in immigration or by other measures that would keep the ex-slaves on their plantations. In a letter to his abolitionist friend Cesar Zama, written two months before abolition, the illustrious São Paulo planter Paula Souza boasted about the way the transition from slave to free labor had been made on his plantation. Since January 1, he said, he did not own a single slave. He had freed them all and made contracts similar to those he had with immigrant colonos. Except for a few slaves who had left to search for relatives, the rest had stayed on the plantation. He advised all the other planters to follow his example. He was convinced that in a few months a majority of those slaves who did abandon their plantations would return, as had been the case with members of his family who had emancipated their laborers. There were plenty of workers on their plantations. In addition to former slaves, the planters could call on free people who lived in dependence on the plantations, performing occasional work. At the outset, worried about a possible shortage of workers, Paula Souza had made labor contracts with some of these, who now worked in coffee production and even lived in the old slave quarters, where the only real change was the absence of a lock.

Paula Souza had discovered that he no longer had to clothe and feed slaves. Now he could sell them supplies, even including the milk or collard greens they consumed. This, he explained, was not a matter of greed, but was a way of teaching the former slaves the value of their work.

Like many of São Paulo's planters, Paula Souza had made an easy transition to free labor even before slavery was abolished by the imperial government. It is quite true that he had decided to free his laborers only after the flight of slaves reached such frequency that he was forced to recognize that the only solution was to free them, a recognition that also came to other planters of the province.

The efforts to promote the entrance of immigrants to replace slave labor which had already begun in the first half of the nineteenth century had intensified in recent years, facilitating [134] the transition. In fact, in the final eleven years of the century, three-quarters of a million immigrants would arrive in São Paulo. Although many would return to their native lands, disappointed with working conditions, and others would move into cities as soon as they could, many did remain on plantations, where they worked side by side with former slaves. The abundant supply of workers enabled planters to keep wages low. When freed slaves who had left the plantations found no other alternatives and came back, they encountered masters who, like Paula Souza, had already discovered new methods of exploiting labor.

Not every planter could face the future with the confidence of a Paula Souza. Not all had the means to attract immigrants or to prevent slaves from moving away to areas with more fertile soils, which permitted higher wages than in regions with exhausted soils and low productivity. With abolition, these planters saw their fortunes disappear overnight, before their very eyes. The planter Francisco de Paula Ferreira de Rezende described dramatically the experience of such men. His fortune, evaluated at 100 contos de réis before abolition, was not worth more than 30 contos afterward. Because of a lack of workers, his land lost three-quarters of its value, and even his coffee plants were devalued. Before abolition, they had been worth about 400 to 500 réis each; now they could bring at most somewhere around 20 to 100 réis each. Worst of all, he could find no one with any interest in buying his property. His slaves stayed through the first harvest, but then most of them abandoned the plantation, while those who remained worked at a slower pace and produced less than before. Planters like Ferreira de Rezende, whose plantations offered few possibilities of profit, did not have the options as those with more profitable properties. It was those less fortunate planters who were most dramatically affected by abolition, who up until the last instant had hoped for the compensation that would never come.

If letters, memoirs and petitions to the government make it possible to discover some of what happened to the former slaveowners after abolition, it is much more difficult to know what happened to the ex-slaves. The few surviving references suggest that some left their plantations and tried to settle on what seemed to be vacant land, only to find themselves facing [135] the police or some furious proprietor demanding their immediate removal. Others went to live with relatives in cities and towns, where they could look for menial work. Still others, finding no other alternative, returned to their plantations. A majority apparently never left and after abolition continued to live in their old quarters, doing the same work, now in return for a miserable wage. Their liberation did allow them to move to another plantation, but everywhere they might find conditions were much the same. In the more productive areas, where they could have hoped to encounter more desirable conditions, the better jobs were already monopolized by immigrants. The freed men and women often suffered a double discrimination, both from their former masters and from the foreign workers.

After abolition, the freed people were forgotten. Except for a few isolated voices, no one seemed to suppose that it was their responsibility to somehow facilitate the transition from slave to citizen. Even abolitionists like the acclaimed Joaquim Nabuco, who had striven so ardently for more than a decade in the abolitionist campaign in Parliament and in the press, appeared to believe his mission was accomplished. Most abolitionists had been more interested in liberating whites from the burden of slavery than in extending to ex-slaves the rights of citizenship. The republican government that replaced the monarchy in 1889 denied the vote to people who were illiterate, thus excluding most newly emancipated slaves from the electorate. Few were the abolitionists who, like André Rebouças, continued to insist that their task had not been completed. Rebouças proposed an agrarian reform that would break up the nation's enormous landed estates, an idea initially supported by the Abolitionist Confederation and included in the Liberal Party platform in 1888. The proposal met (and continues to meet until today) with fierce opposition from the great landowners. When the Abolitionist Confederation did attempt to play the role of protector of the ex-slaves, the authorities responded with nothing more than indifference. After abolition, government officials seemed most concerned with increasing their own political power and with controlling the underclass segments of the population. For this purpose, they multiplied state and local laws regulating social behavior. They reinstated antiquated restrictions on many of the [136] kinds of communal festivities common among the black population, such as batuques cateretês and congos. They also multiplied institutions to confine the insane, criminals, abandoned children and beggars. Municipal ordinances strengthened measures designed to restrain the idle and the unemployed, forbidding them to roam through the streets with no visible occupation, and preventing them from seeking shelter in the homes of friends or relatives. One ordinance of the town of Limeira forbade anyone to shelter an unemployed person for more than three days without notifying the police, who could then order the person to "find a job" or spend eight days in the local jail and pay a fine equal to a month's normal wage. Other ordinances attempted to restrain street peddlers, imposing severe penalties on anyone who violated the restrictions.

In the years that followed abolition, the freed people's dreams of liberation were transformed into nightmares because of the miseries they had to confront. They soon recognized that their struggle had only begun. It would be up to them to organize to reach their objectives. Emancipation was only the first step toward liberty. Many years after the end of slavery, the echo of its frustration could still be heard. In 1972, a workers' leader interviewed in Pernambuco by the social scientist Leite Lopes commented that the enslavement of blacks had ended, "but that of the worker, of the poor, still continues".

<sup>1</sup> Batuques cateretês were communal dances to drums; congos or congadas were traditional dramatic dances representing a Congolese coronation ceremony.

## COVER TEXT

From the moment it appeared, Emilia Viotti da Costa's path-breaking Abolition, first published in 1982 and re-appearing now with a new additional chapter, quickly became a model for every historian who undertook the difficult task of putting aside academic jargon to write for a larger public, without sacrificing either scholarly rigor or stylistic subtlety. To take into account the complexities – political, economic, social, and ideological – that shaped the abolition of slavery in Brazil, and to make that history accessible to the general public with-out artificial simplifications, was an ambition worthy of one of Brazil's finest historians. The synthesis that this book presents is a and magisterial treatment of the process of abolition. But throughout the text we encounter a wealth of detailed information and exacting analysis that result from the historian's determination to produce a history that would be accessible to the public but also would meet the highest intellectual standards. The dissection of the different phases of the abolitionist movement, of its political and parliamentary struggles, of the debates surrounding the hesitant sequence of emancipatory legislation, of the rise of popular movements and slave resistance – all dense with exact and erudite information – make this a text that is useful not only for students and ordinary readers, but for professional historians as well. At the outset, for example, discussing the first brief flashes of an anti-slavery consciousness in Brazil, Emilia Viotti recounts the pioneering activity of Hipólito da Costa in the elaboration of a systematic criticism of slavery as early as 1811 – a fact that had been more or less forgotten in modern Brazil. And the book goes on in the same manner, presenting historical situations that explain the emergence of abolitionist movements and their practical outcomes: from laws prohibiting the international slave trade and other emancipation legislation, to long-term demographic changes in the slave system, to the rise of new types of urban protest movements, to the modernization of the transportation system and the industrialization of coffee and sugar processing, to the development of new policies of immigration, and the emergence of an abolitionist consciousness. The result is a rich and vivid account of origins and progress of abolitionism, in which the interpretations of both facts and ideas can be understood from the points of view of the various social groups involved on all sides of the many-faceted process. The book presents a concise synthesis, but within this tightly controlled framework Emilia Viotti is able to impose a complex and coherent interpretation of the ending of slavery in Brazil, and in so doing to shed a great deal of light on the entire period of the Brazilian Empire. As a social historian, she makes it clear that in the final analysis abolition was ultimately a people's victory – and also a very real achievement of the nation's black people themselves, both free and slave. In Brazil, it has been along these innovative pathways that a new historiography of slavery and its abolition developed during the past several decades.

EMÍLIA VIOTTI DA COSTA was born in the city of São Paulo and educated in the Faculty of Philosophy, Letters and Human Sciences of the University of São Paulo. She became a livre docente of that university, but was forcibly retired in 1969 by the military dictatorship that governed Brazil at the time. After that, she taught in several American universities, including Tulane University and the University of Illinois. Then she became a professor in Yale University, where she taught Latin American History from 1973 to 1999.

Her works include Da Monarquia à República [From the Monarchy to the Republic]; Da Senzala à Colônia [From Slavery to Free Labor]; 1932: interpretações contraditórias [1932: Conflicting Interpretations]; Coroas de glória, lágrimas de sangue: rebelião dos escravos de Demerara em 1823 [Crowns of Glory, Tears of Blood: the Demerara Slave Rebellion of 1823], and O

Supremo Tribunal Federal e a Construção da Cidadania [The Brazilian Supreme Court and the Construction of Citizenship], and many articles and essays in scholarly journals. Currently, she directs the collection Revolutions of the Twentieth Century, published by Unesp Press, of the State University of São Paulo.
