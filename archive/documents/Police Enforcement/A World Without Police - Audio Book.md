A reading of a pamphlet stressing the need to abolish police as an institution which provides some practical steps for communities to take in that process.

Imagine a world without police.

We live in a society where almost every social problem--from noisy neighbors to brokentaillights--has become a point of police intervention. The result is an epidemic of harassmentand violence. But what if we found other ways to solve our issues? What if we rolled backpolice power, and abolished the institution entirely? Here you are invited to think and actwith other visionaries, and find ways to achieve a police-free world.
