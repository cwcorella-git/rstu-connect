Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
    Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Corrections to establish
regulations with the approval of the Board of State Prison Commissioners,
including regulations relating to the custody, care, training, health and safety of
offenders. (NRS 209.131) Section 2 of this bill requires the Department to provide
to an offender the original, physical copy of any physical mail addressed to the
offender that the offender is entitled and allowed to receive. Section 2 authorizes
the Director, with the approval of the Board, to adopt regulations exempting the
Department from this requirement if the Department conducts a study and
determines, using evidence-based methods, that complying with the requirement
presents a danger to the health and safety of the staff or offenders in institutions or
facilities of the Department. Section 2 also provides that any such regulations must
be adopted in accordance with the provisions of the Nevada Administrative
Procedure Act. (Chapter 233B of NRS) If the Director adopts regulations
exempting the Department from the requirement to provide offenders with original,
physical copies of mail, section 2 requires the Director to submit the study and any
evidence or data that supports the determination of the Department to: (1) the
Legislative Counsel when the adopted regulation is submitted; and (2) the Director
of the Legislative Counsel Bureau after the regulation is adopted for transmittal to
the Joint Interim Standing Committee on the Judiciary.
    Section 3 of this bill requires the Department to ensure that an offender
completes a medical release of information form at the time of intake and has the
ability to update the completed form as necessary. If an offender in the custody of
the Department is hospitalized for or diagnosed with a critical medical condition

which requires the offender to stay in a medical facility overnight, section 3

custody of the Department is hospitalized for or diagnosed with a critical medical
condition which does not require the offender to stay in a medical facility
overnight, section 3 requires the Department, within 4 hours after the return of the
offender to the institution or facility at which the offender is incarcerated, to
provide the offender with the opportunity to make a telephone call to a friend,
relative or other person to inform the person about the health status of the offender.

facilities requirements similar to those contained in sections 3 and 4.
