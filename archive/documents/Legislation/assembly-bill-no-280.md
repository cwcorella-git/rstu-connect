            Assembly Bill No. 280–Assemblywomen Peters;
                     Bilbray-Axelrod and Torres

                                CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public restrooms; requiring places of public
    accommodation, public buildings and facilities owned by a
    public body, certain areas leased by or on behalf of a public
    body and certain leased areas within a state park that provide
    a single-stall restroom to the public to make the single-stall
    restroom as inclusive and accessible as possible to a person
    of any gender identity or expression; revising provisions
    relating to the signage for such single-stall restrooms;
    requiring certain governmental entities to include in their
    building codes or, if applicable, adopt by ordinance a
    requirement that certain buildings and facilities used by the
    public that contain a single-stall restroom which is available
    to the public be as inclusive and accessible as possible to a
    person of any gender identity or expression and prohibiting
    certain signage on such restrooms; providing a penalty;
    making an appropriation; and providing other matters
    properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
     Existing law provides that all persons are entitled to the full and equal
enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and
accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or
segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sexual
orientation, sex or gender identity or expression. (NRS 651.070) Existing law
provides that a place of public accommodation means any establishment or place to
which the public is invited or which is intended for public use, including, without
limitation, inns, hotels, motels, restaurants, bars, gasoline stations, theaters,
convention centers, bakeries, grocery stores, laundromats, museums, libraries,
parks, zoos, nurseries, private schools or universities, day care centers, senior
citizen centers, gymnasiums, health spas and bowling alleys. (NRS 651.050) If such
a place of public accommodation provides a single-stall restroom to the public,
section 1 of this bill requires the single-stall restroom to be as inclusive and
accessible as possible to a person of any gender identity or expression, including,
without limitation, by allowing: (1) a parent or guardian of a child to enter the
single-stall restroom with the child; (2) a person with a disability to enter the
single-stall restroom with his or her caregiver, if applicable; and (3) a person of any
gender identity or expression to use the single-stall restroom as needed. Section 1:
(1) prohibits the owner or operator of the place of public accommodation from
labeling the single-stall restroom with signage that indicates the restroom is for a
specific gender; and (2) authorizes the labeling of the single-stall restroom as
available for use by any person, including, without limitation, by posting a sign
which reads “All-Gender Bathroom” or “All-Accessible Bathroom.” Section 1
provides that a single-stall restroom is a restroom that: (1) is intended for individual
use; and (2) contains a single toilet or a single urinal or contains both a toilet and a
urinal, neither of which is separated from the other by enclosure within a stall.




   -                                                            81st Session (2021)

Finally, sections 1 and 6.5 of this bill provide that the provisions of sections 1 and
6.5 do not establish a private right of action or authorize the filing of a complaint
with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission.
     Sections 2, 3 and 15 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the
applicability of section 1 and the placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised
Statutes. Section 4 of this bill provides that any person who deprives, interferes
with or punishes another person for accessing such single-stall restrooms is guilty
of a misdemeanor. Section 6 of this bill authorizes any county or incorporated city
of this State to adopt a local ordinance that prohibits an infringement of a person’s
rights, privileges or access to such single-stall restrooms.
     Section 9 of this bill requires each county, city and any other governmental
entity that adopts a building code, including school districts in larger counties, to
include in its respective building code a requirement that any single-stall restroom
made available to the public and contained in a permanent building or facility used
by the public and that is constructed on or after October 1, 2021, comply with
provisions relating to the inclusivity and accessibility and signage of single-stall
restrooms that are identical to the provisions that apply to places of public
accommodations in section 1. Section 9 provides that if a county or city has no
building code, the county or city is required to adopt such requirements by
ordinance. Sections 7, 8 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes relating to
the applicability of the requirements contained in section 9 as well as the placement
of section 9 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
     Sections 11 and 12 of this bill also make provisions relating to the inclusivity
and accessibility and signage of single-stall restrooms that are identical to the
provisions that apply to places of public accommodations in section 1 apply to: (1)
a public building or facility owned by a public body that provides a single-stall
restroom to the public; and (2) an area leased by or on behalf of a public body and
used primarily to provide a service to the public and certain leased areas within a
state park. Section 12 provides that a contract for such a leased area that does not
satisfy these requirements which is entered into on or after October 1, 2021, is void
and unenforceable. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to
the placement of section 12 in the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 14 of this bill
authorizes a person to report a violation of section 12 to the Attorney General, who
is required to notify the public body responsible for the alleged violation. If the
public body fails to comply with the provisions of section 12, section 14 requires
the Attorney General to take such action as is necessary to ensure compliance.
     Section 15.5 of this bill provides that sections 4, 5 and 14, which are the
enforcement provisions of this bill, do not become effective until February 1, 2022.
     Section 15.2 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Division of State Parks
of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources for the costs of
replacement signage and mounting hardware at restrooms in state parks.
