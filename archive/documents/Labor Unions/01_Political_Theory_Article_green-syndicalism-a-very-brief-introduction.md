The exploitation of labor and the exploitation of land under capitalism have always been
integrally connected – one does not occur without the other. From the violence of enclosures
of commons, expanded across the globe through colonialism – ongoing acts that are the
bedrock of capitalist property relations. Through the dispossession, displacement, and social
control of the enclosed upon, in the service of capitalist property and labor markets. Violent
expropriation of land, and the means of the sustenance of life, are the very conditions for
forced production for profit. Labor is rendered exploitable by destruction of its conditions of
autonomous survival.

The connected character of the exploitation of land and labor is shown forcefully in the fact
that the industries most directly destructive of nature are also those which have been most
dangerous and deadly for workers and for Indigenous people. Logging, mining, fishing,
farming.

Ending the exploitation of one is not possible without ending the exploitation of the other. And
yes, this includes landback for Indigenous peoples. Ownership of the earth in the pursuit of
profit is the condition driving the destruction of nature and the destruction of planetary
(including of course human) life. People are rendered as labor for sale and purchase when
nature, their means of survival is.

A fundamental position of green syndicalism is that those working class, those exploited by
capital in re/production and distribution and forced to survive through the labor market are
crucially placed to end the dual exploitation of land and labor. This is so for a few key reasons.

The exploitation of labor and the exploitation of land under capitalism have always been
integrally connected – one does not occur without the other. From the violence of enclosures
of commons, expanded across the globe through colonialism – ongoing acts that are the
bedrock of capitalist property relations. Through the dispossession, displacement, and social
control of the enclosed upon, in the service of capitalist property and labor markets. Violent
expropriation of land, and the means of the sustenance of life, are the very conditions for
forced production for profit. Labor is rendered exploitable by destruction of its conditions of
autonomous survival.

The connected character of the exploitation of land and labor is shown forcefully in the fact
that the industries most directly destructive of nature are also those which have been most
dangerous and deadly for workers and for Indigenous people. Logging, mining, fishing,
farming.

Ending the exploitation of one is not possible without ending the exploitation of the other. And
yes, this includes landback for Indigenous peoples. Ownership of the earth in the pursuit of
profit is the condition driving the destruction of nature and the destruction of planetary
(including of course human) life. People are rendered as labor for sale and purchase when
nature, their means of survival is.

A fundamental position of green syndicalism is that those working class, those exploited by
capital in re/production and distribution and forced to survive through the labor market are
crucially placed to end the dual exploitation of land and labor. This is so for a few key reasons.

The Potential Power of Workers First and foremost, given their central position within the labor
process, and place in workplaces, workers can directly stop harmful industrial practices. This
is most obviously shown in the strike. By withdrawing and withholding their labor, workers
make industrial processes stop. They literally cease to operate. At the same time, given their
knowledge of re/production processes, workers can halt or alter production in ways that do not
raise secondary harms to nature.

Workers hold a potential power which when wielded, can be more directly and immediately
impactful than the external or secondary actions of outside actors. Environmentalists picketing
a plant or construction site, for example, will have less impact than the workers employed

---

there picketing would have. So even the same action can hold more power for one group
compared to another strictly because of their structural position within re/productive
processes.

Workers’ own concerns with health and safety (exposure to workplace contaminants, etc.)
intersect with ecological concerns in very personal ways. So too do their concerns for
community and family in areas affected by industrial processes at their workplaces. This can,
despite rigid stereotypes to the contrary, make workers strong ecological allies.

Tactics The power of worker strategy and tactics – as workers – derives from their special
place within processes of re/production and distribution. The most powerful tactic on the
whole is the strike – the refusal to do land and labor destroying work. The strike is the most
potent direct action – stopping harm from happening and making it difficult or impossible for
capital to continue them. It is not a moral appeal, request, or even demand – it is
consequential action that achieves the intended aim directly, without the mediation involved in
third party actions.

This depends of course on the level of rank-and-file organizing and capacity to stop scabs
from being deployed or to block conservative union leadership from crafting deals with
management. No tactic is deployed in a pure form and organizing is always itself an action.
But even then, using scabs incurs a cost on capital.

Another key tactic is sabotage. The place of workers in acts of sabotage can be crucial when
we talk about green actions, because sabotage can have harmful consequences to natural
environments, particularly where heavy industry is involved. Workers have a close familiarity
and understanding of industrial processes they are involved in and how they can be
sabotaged effectively in ways that are not destructive of nature. They also know the most
significant break points to shut things down.

Workers, because of their placement and positionality also have access to industrial
processes that environmentalists and others do not have and may not be able to gain. This
access cannot be overlooked.

---

I have had numerous conversations with workers, going back to my days as an autoworker,
who carry out sabotage within industrial plants to block harmful processes from happening
(plugging drains, stopping effluent, disabling machinery with toxic exhausts, etc.). Sometimes
it can be as innocuous in appearance as putting a part on the assembly line slightly
improperly and ruining most of a shift of production (as I may or may not have done).

Blockades. Logistical workers have long histories of organizing blockades in support of
community movements and against destructive ecological or social conditions. Perhaps the
most prominent example recently has been the blockading by dockworkers of Israeli state
shipping lines.

Boycotts. Workers can effectively initiate boycotts of harmful products, working with
community members to take harmful processes or products out of operation. Insider boycotts
against harmful materials or against materials hat are sourced from ecologically or socially
destructive origins or from dubious sources (apartheid companies, etc.) offer unique promise.

Ecological Reclamation and Reconstruction Workers in specific industries will be crucial in
reclamation and reconstruction activities in moving toward ecological futures. This is because
of the unique knowledge they have of specific industries being ended or transformed or
requiring clean up or restoration.

One example is the decommissioning of tar sands developments and the reclamation of
ecologically devastated areas and wastelands that were created by tar sands development.

Organizing is always key. Because workers are uniquely placed to undertake and enact deep
green social transformation does not mean they will, of course. Some workers are conditioned
by capital to tie their supposed interests with the short term aims of the particular company or
industry in which they work. And, under capitalism, when successfully selling your labor on the
capitalist labor market is a prerequisite to survival, the treat of losing your job is a potent
inhibition. And this can be, and is, manipulated toward anti-ecological ends. We have seen
this in logging, tar sands, and pipelines. But we have also seen the opposite – workers allying
with environmentalists and Indigenous activists to engage in eco-defense.

Organizing: A Start So, some activities to get there. If you are in a union, you can make use of
the opportunities and basic protections you have in order to create, expand, or redistribute
organizing resources and spaces. There are some useful ways of doing so.

Flying squads. Flying squads are rapid response networks that can deploy quickly to take
action, whether to assist with workplace pickets or to support community groups in actions like
an eviction defense or squat or welfare office occupation supporting unemployed workers or
Indigenous land defense. Flying squads require little more than phone lists by which
rank-and-file workers can self-mobilize.

Working Groups. Workers can start class-based working groups within their union around
community issues like those mentioned above. Examples from ones I have helped organize
include anti-poverty working groups to support poor and unhoused working-class people and
Indigenous solidarity working groups supporting active land reclamations.

All of these can access union resources to use in broader struggles beyond the workplace or
contract. All while building the strength of less secured workers. One influential example is the
green bans in Australia, strikes undertaken by the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) and
used to protect parkland and low-income housing.

These straightforward examples provide mechanisms to transfer union resources, which are
properly understood as working-class resources, on a class-wide basis to community working
class, including Indigenous and ecological, struggles. They also provide venues for educating
and motivating fellow workers. The absolute joy I have seen among workers following flying
squad actions cannot be properly expressed. It is literally transformative. It is a lighting of what
could be called real class consciousness.

If you are not in a union—organize one. However, that might look. Reach out to other workers.
The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) are always a good option for organizing on a class
struggle rather than a contract management basis. Active flying squads from unionized
workers can help to put pressure on the boss.

Organize an autonomous flying squad bringing together unorganized workers, unemployed
workers, migrant workers, and/or environmentalists. I helped organize an autonomous flying

---

squad along these lines in Toronto and we were often the only outside workers presence at
pickets of migrant workers who were outside traditional union structures.

One IWW example is that of IWW-Earth First! Local 1 in northern California, which brought
together timber workers and environmentalists in a joint organizing effort based on the shared
recognition that clearcut logging destroys vital ecosystems at the same time as it wipes out
prospects for workers’ livelihoods and communities in the long rune. And in the longer run,
threatens planetary survival for all but capital.

Is the author referring to stuff like the NDN Collective’s Landback Campaign, which aims to
return all public lands in the Black Hills “back to Indigenous hands”?1What does the author
mean by “landback for Indigenous peoples”? Is the author not slightly bothered by the fact that
tribal membership, as far as the U. S. is concerned, often involves the verification of one’s
ancestry and the possession of a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood (issuedby the U. S.
government/Bureau of Indian Affairs)? Reservations themselves were invented by the U. S.
government as a means of managing the Indigenous populations and to enable American
Westward expansion. Does the author see reservations and their associated legal
frameworks as something that will carry over into a socialist society? Does the author see the
expansion of reservation lands, along with ancestry verification to ensure one’s “Indigenous
purity,” as something that is compatible with a socialist society based on the common
ownership of lands and resources?

1. They also push for other reformist nonsense like a Green New Deal: “That being said, we
are pleased to support the groundbreaking and critically important Green New Deal
Resolution introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator
Ed Markey of Massachusetts. This legislation comes at an important moment in history–the
political and economic status quo is no longer acceptable” (2).
