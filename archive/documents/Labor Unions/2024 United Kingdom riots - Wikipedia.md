From 30 July to 5 August 2024[,\[a\]](#page-47-0) [far-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom) [anti-immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-immigration) protests and riots occurred in England and Northern Ireland,[\[b\]](#page-47-1) within the United Kingdom[.\[38\]](#page-53-5) This followed a [mass stabbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Southport_stabbing) of girls at a dance class in [Southport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport) on 29 July in which three children were killed. The riots were fuelled by false claims circulated by far-right groups that the perpetrator of the attack was a [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims) and an [asylum seeker,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker) in addition to broader [Islamophobic,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia_in_the_United_Kingdom) racist, and anti-immigrant sentiments that had grown leading up to the protests[.\[39\]](#page-54-0) The disorder included [racist attacks,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime) [arson,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson) and [looting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting) and was the largest incident of social unrest in England [since 2011.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_England_riots) [\[40\]](#page-54-1) By 8 August at least 177 had been imprisoned, to an average sentence of around two years and up to a nine-years, in relation to the unrest. The following month 1,280 arrests and nearly 800 charges had been made[,\[41\]](#page-54-2) and as of July 2025, the number of arrests increased to 1,840 with 1,103 charges[.\[37\]](#page-53-4)

The riots began in Southport, just a few streets away from where the attack took place. A demonstration outside the Southport Mosque quickly turned violent and protesters attacked police officers, injuring over fifty, burned a police van, and attacked the mosque. Over the following days the unrest spread to other towns and cities in England and to [Belfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast) in Northern Ireland. On 31 July, over 100 protesters were arrested in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) and demonstrations occurred in [Manchester,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester) [Hartlepool,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartlepool) and [Aldershot.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldershot) On 2 August, rioting took place in [Sunderland,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunderland) where a [Citizens Advice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Advice) bureau was set on fire and police officers were injured and several people were arrested. The most severe rioting took place over the weekend of 3–4 August, when anti-immigration protesters clashed with police and counter-protesters, attacked homes and businesses owned by immigrants, and attacked hotels housing asylum seekers. From 6 August the unrest began to abate; counterprotests consistently and considerably outnumbered far-right protesters, and were followed by large anti-racist rallies across the country on 7 August. Online forums, the formation of safe spaces and other activities also countered racist sentiment and supported affected communities[.\[42\]](#page-54-3)

The riots had limited formal organisation; instead, rioters assembled around individual far-right social media personalities with the aid of far-right [Telegram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)) group chats affiliated with [Active Club England,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Club_England) the [terrorgram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorgram) network, and [football hooliganism firms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_hooliganism_in_the_United_Kingdom) [\[17\]](#page-50-3) Groups involved in the riots included supporters of the defunct Islamophobic group [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League) [Defence League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League) (EDL), including its former leader [Tommy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)) [Robinson,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)) members of the [neo-Nazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism) hate group [Patriotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic_Alternative) [Alternative,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic_Alternative) and the fascist political party [Britain First.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britain_First) [\[2\]](#page-48-1) The riots were also supported by the neo-Nazi organisation [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Movement) [Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Movement) and the far-right political party [National Front.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(UK)) [\[12\]](#page-49-4) Rioters clashed with local Muslims and [counter-protesters,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-protest) who were mobilised by [Stand Up to Racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_Up_to_Racism) and other [anti-fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fascist) and [anti-racist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racist) groups[.\[31\]](#page-52-0)

### Peaceful protests

## Attacks on hotels housing asylum seekers

On 29 July 2024 a knife attack took place at a [Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift)themed children's yoga and dance workshop. Three children were killed and eight other children were injured, with five of them in critical condition. Two adults at the event were also critically injured[.\[43\]](#page-54-4) When the [prime minister of the United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom) [Kingdom,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom) [Keir Starmer,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer) laid flowers in Southport the following day, he was met with "hostile shouts" from some of the public, with one asking, "How many more, Starmer? When are you going to do something?["\[44\]](#page-54-5)

Following the stabbing, the police said the name being circulated online was not that of the suspected attacker.[\[45\]](#page-55-0) [Misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation) and [disinformation,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation) including false claims about the suspect's identity, nationality, religion and immigration status, were circulated on social media by high-profile [far-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics) accounts[,\[8\]](#page-49-0)[\[46\]](#page-55-1)[\[12\]](#page-49-4)[\[47\]](#page-55-2) including by [Tommy Robinson,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)) a farright activist who founded the now-disbanded anti-Islam [English Defence League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League) (EDL) in 2009. The false claim that the perpetrator was named "Ali Al-Shakati" is believed to have originated from the [X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) (formerly Twitter) account of an anti[lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdown_in_the_United_Kingdom) campaigner and gained a greater audience when repeated by the website [Channel3Now,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel3Now) a [website known for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news_website) [spreading fake news.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news_website) [\[48\]](#page-55-3)[\[49\]](#page-55-4)[\[50\]](#page-55-5) [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) was accused of being behind a deliberate disinformation campaign[,\[51\]](#page-56-0) and as of 5 August 2024, the [National Crime Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Agency) and [Department for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Science,_Innovation_and_Technology) [Science, Innovation and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Science,_Innovation_and_Technology) are investigating such claims[.\[52\]](#page-56-1)

A newly created Southport-themed [Telegram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)) group became inundated with misinformation, including from the far-right [National Front,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(UK)) prior to dissemination on social media platforms[.\[8\]](#page-49-0) The [Institute for Strategic Dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Strategic_Dialogue) stated that the now-deleted "Southport Wake Up" group with 14,000 members on Telegram became integral in organising and promoting the subsequent riots, and inciting hatred and violence[.\[53\]](#page-56-2) Disinformation was also spread on social media by the [neo-Nazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism) group [British Movement,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Movement) [\[12\]](#page-49-4) and [accelerationist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerationist) Telegram channels with links to the proscribed terror groups [Atomwaffen Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomwaffen_Division) and [National Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Action_(UK)) were used to co-ordinate and organise the riots[.\[17\]](#page-50-3)

[Merseyside Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police) attempted to quell speculation by confirming that the name being circulated was not connected to the case and was not the suspect[.\[54\]](#page-56-3) The police initially released the information that the suspect was a male, aged seventeen, from [Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks,_Lancashire) in [Lancashire,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire) though born in [Cardiff.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff) [\[55\]](#page-56-4)[\[56\]](#page-56-5) It was later reported that the suspect was a British citize[n\[57\]](#page-56-6) born to [Rwandan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda) parents, that he had moved to the Southport area in 2013[,\[45\]](#page-55-0)[\[58\]](#page-57-0) and that he had no known links to Islam[.\[59\]](#page-57-1) The spread of misinformation has widely been given as the cause of the Southport riots[.\[51\]](#page-56-0)[\[60\]](#page-57-2)[\[61\]](#page-57-3)[\[62\]](#page-57-4) In a separate event, a woman was stabbed in [Stirling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling) on 3 August 2024[.\[63\]](#page-57-5) Tommy Robinson falsely claimed on social media that an "alleged Muslim" had been involved in an incident in which three women had been stabbed. Other accounts spread the misinformation, contributing to tensions. [\[64\]](#page-57-6)[\[63\]](#page-57-5)[\[65\]](#page-58-0) A man was arrested by the police, who described him as white and local to the area. The release of these details was unusual and done to curb misinformation.[\[63\]](#page-57-5)

### **Timeline**

#### **30 July**

## Southport Mosque, location of the first riot

At approximately 20:05 [BST,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time) hundreds of protesters gathered outside Southport Mosque chanting, "No surrender!" and "English till I die!["\[66\]](#page-58-1) Within several minutes, protesters clashed with police[.\[67\]](#page-58-2) Protesters barricaded themselves and shouted ["Tommy Robinson"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)), a far-right activist who founded the EDL. Robinson had been arrested and then released two days prior[,\[68\]](#page-58-3) before he fled the country, failing to appear at a [High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice) hearing to which he had been summonsed for alleged [contempt of court.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court) [\[69\]](#page-58-4)

A firework was thrown toward the antiracism demonstration. The anti-immigration protesters then attempted to march to the [Belfast Islamic Centre,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Northern_Ireland) but were blocked by police. Instead, they attacked several immigrantowned businesses on Botanic Avenue. Violence continued in the [Sandy Row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Row) area that night, where a supermarket and a café owned by immigrants were burnt out.

In west Belfast, youths racially abused staff at a Middle Eastern shop. Altogether, six people (three men, three teenagers) were arrested over the disorder[.\[161\]](#page-71-1)

One person was arrested and 37 dispersal orders issued in [Durham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_England) over fears of potential unrest as reports of planned disorder circulated online. However, despite these reports, there were no reported incidents of criminal damage or disorder in the city[.\[162\]](#page-71-2)

### **7 August**

On 7 August, over 100 far-right and 30 counter protests were reportedly planned across the country in 41 of 43 [police force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_forces_of_the_United_Kingdom) [areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_forces_of_the_United_Kingdom) in England and Wales, with their main focus being immigration centres and lawyers' offices[.\[163\]](#page-71-3) However, very few far-right protesters turned out.

Parts of London, including [Brentford,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford) [Harrow,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow,_London) [North Finchley,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Finchley) and [Walthamstow,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walthamstow) saw large counter-protests at sites mentioned on the list of targets where far-right protesters were supposedly going to gather, with the latter attracting an estimated 10,000 demonstrators[.\[167\]](#page-72-0)[\[168\]](#page-72-1) In [Lewisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewisham) a rally was held, organised by [Stand Up To Racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_Up_To_Racism) and other local anti-racist groups, to "show solidarity" with communities targeted by the far right, though there was no direct threat to the area. Some local businesses closed early, and market traders were told by the council to close "earlier than usual" ahead of potential protests. This led to some confusion about whether the far-right were also planning to gather in the area, but [Mayor of Lewisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Lewisham) Brenda Dacres confirmed on the day to

[News Shopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Shopper) that there was no intelligence of any planned far-right activity in Lewisham that night[.\[169\]](#page-72-2) A similar situation happened in [Stoke Newington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_Newington) in [Hackney,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney,_London) where SUTR also organised a solidarity rally, although reporting by [Hackney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney_Gazette) [Gazette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney_Gazette) suggests it was because of rumours circulated online that a far-right demonstration had been planned for outside The Old Fire Station on Leswin Road. The [Metropolitan Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police) declined to comment on whether it was aware of any far-right action planned in the area[.\[170\]](#page-72-3)

[183] Smaller gatherings were also present in Accrington and Tamworth, the latter being only a few miles from a hotel which was attacked on 4 August. [184]

Some protests were not as peaceful as others seen across the country, however scenes were still calm compared to the riots seen a few days prior. Chatham saw around 150 anti-immigration protesters outnumbering around 50 counterprotesters; [185] in Aldershot, dozens of police had to separate two groups of protesters. Three people were arrested at a counter-protest in Northampton, [173] and one person was arrested in Bournemouth, [186] Blackpool, Middlesbrough and Portsmouth. [187] The latter was the site of the largest anti-immigration protest of the day, with 200 people gathering and blocking Mile End Road. Two people were arrested in nearby Southampton, where up to 400 counter-protesters outnumbered around 50 far-right protesters. [188]

Australia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Singapore, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates and the United States issued travel advisories and safety warnings to the United Kingdom advising their citizens to exercise caution and avoid areas where protests are taking place.[\[231\]](#page-81-0) Russia called on the British government to "refrain from any unjustified or unproportionate [sic] use of violence against protesters and ensure their right to freedom of assembly".[\[232\]](#page-81-1) The visiting [Sri Lanka national cricket team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_national_cricket_team) raised concerns about England Tests due to the riots. The England and Wales Cricket Board responded by reassuring Sri Lanka Cricket and the team about the security arrangements in place[.\[233\]](#page-81-2) In Pakistan, officials charged a man with [cyberterrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism) after he was linked with the [Channel3Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel3Now) website, which spread false claims about the Southport attacker[.\[234\]](#page-81-3)[\[235\]](#page-81-4) He was later acquitted as local police did not find evidence identifying him as the originator of the false claims[.\[236\]](#page-81-5)

# **Investigations, arrests and prosecutions**

On 3 August, the [Ministry of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)) began discussions about [magistrates' courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates%27_court_(England_and_Wales)) in England and Wales remaining open overnight to preliminary rule on suspects arrested, due to the anticipated increase in people held in custody for riot related offences. This also occurred during the 2011 England riots.[\[237\]](#page-81-6) This proposal was criticised by [Nazir Afzal,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazir_Afzal) a former Chief Crown Prosecutor, saying such a measure would worsen the backlog in British courts[.\[238\]](#page-82-0)

By 5 August, police had arrested 378 people[,\[81\]](#page-60-2) and the first court hearings were held on a range of charges including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and burglary, with some defendants pleading guilty.[\[239\]](#page-82-1)[\[154\]](#page-70-1)

### **Charges and prosecutions**

On 23 December, it was reported that a 40-year-old from Southport, who had been identified as a man seen in a viral video of the 30 July rioting, had been sentenced to two years and six months in jail after pleading guilty to violent disorder at Liverpool Crown Court, which involved throwing bins at officers and punching a police vehicle. In the viral video he can be seen walking up to a line of riot police, putting his hands on his hips, and gyrating in front of them. He is then struck in the chest and head by hurled bricks before turning around and walking back towards the crowd. As he holds his head, another brick hits him in the groin. Later that evening, officers were called to a separate incident at which he was present. They took him to Southport hospital to be treated for the head injury, where the police say he racially abused another patient. The officers recognised him from the already widely shared footage and he was arrested[.\[260\]](#page-84-7)

#### **Lucy Connolly**

On 29 July 2024, Lucy Connolly, then 41, a [childminder,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanny) and the wife of a [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)) [West Northamptonshire Councillor,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Northamptonshire_Council) posted a [tweet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweet_(social_media)) calling for "[m]ass deportation now" and for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire, adding: "If that makes me racist, so be it"[.\[261\]](#page-85-0) X subsequently said the post had not violated their rules[.\[262\]](#page-85-1) Connolly was arrested on 6 August[;\[263\]](#page-85-2) she was charged with "publishing written material which was threatening, abusive or insulting intending thereby to stir up racial hatred or having regard to all the circumstances, whereby racial hatred was likely to be stirred up", she was granted bail[,\[264\]](#page-85-3) and appeared at [Nottingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nottingham_Magistrates_Court&action=edit&redlink=1) [Magistrates Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nottingham_Magistrates_Court&action=edit&redlink=1) on 10 August[.\[265\]](#page-85-4) She appeared by video and did not enter a plea, she was remanded in custody.[\[266\]](#page-85-5) Connolly was remanded in custody to appear at [Northampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton_Crown_Court) [Crown Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton_Crown_Court) on the 12 August[.\[266\]](#page-85-5)

On 22 August 2024, Connolly's lawyer requested bail at the Crown Court, and was refused[.\[267\]](#page-85-6) On 2 September 2024, Connolly pled guilty to distributing material with the intention of stirring up racial hatred, contrary to the [Public Order Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Order_Act_1986) [1986.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Order_Act_1986) [\[268\]](#page-85-7) At a hearing held at [Birmingham Crown Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Crown_Court) on 17 October 2024, Judge Melbourne Inman KC sentenced Connolly to 31 months in prison, with 40% to be served[.\[269\]](#page-85-8)[\[270\]](#page-86-0) On 20 May 2025, Connolly was denied leave to appeal against her sentence[.\[271\]](#page-86-1)[\[272\]](#page-86-2) On 21 August 2025, Connolly was released from [HM Prison Peterborough.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_Peterborough) [\[273\]](#page-86-3) On release, Connolly said she had been a [political prisoner.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner) [\[274\]](#page-86-4)

#### **Telegram groups**

In October 2024, the BBC confronted a 20-year-old man, who was an administrator in the "Southport Wake Up" Telegram messaging group, known as "Mr AG", and revealed him to be Charles-Emmanuel Mikko Rasanen, a neo-Nazi from [Helsinki,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki) Finland who shared online instructions on how to commit arson with the UK rioters[.\[277\]](#page-86-7) The channel had been set up within hours of the stabbing and soon amassed a huge following. It shared details about local protests but quickly descended into making violent threats against named individuals and locations. On 5 August Telegram appeared to remove the channel, which at that time had almost 15,000 members. It was unclear if Telegram made this decision itself or if it was at the direction of the authorities in the UK[.\[278\]](#page-87-0) Andrew Mc Intyre, a 39-year-old taxi driver, who started the group was jailed for seven and a half years in January 2025 for his role in instigating violence[.\[279\]](#page-87-1)

### **Peter Lynch**

Lynch was at the riot outside a [Holiday Inn Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn_Express) hotel housing asylum seekers in [Manvers,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manvers) [Rotherham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham) on 4 August 2024. He was recorded yelling "scum", "child killers", "protect my children", "we are on the streets now to protect our kids" and "you are protecting people who are killing our kids and raping them" at police during the riot[.\[280\]](#page-87-2) He was pictured holding a placard asserting the corruption of [MPs,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_parliament) police chiefs, TV media, and judges and the judiciary[.\[281\]](#page-87-3)

He was arrested and charged with violent disorder for which he pleaded guilty and was jailed for 2 years and 8 months.[\[282\]](#page-87-4) In sentencing Lynch on 22 August[,\[283\]](#page-87-5) Judge Jeremy Richardson KC said that Lynch's sign and protest were not unlawful, but his verbal abuse towards police officers during the "racist incident" crossed the line[.\[284\]](#page-87-6)

Lynch hanged himself at [HMP Moorland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_Moorland) two months into his sentence on 19 October 2024, aged 61[.\[280\]](#page-87-2) Respects were paid to Lynch at the 'Unite the Kingdom' march in London a week later[.\[285\]](#page-87-7)

# **Reactions**

The Labour MP for Southport, [Patrick Hurley,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Hurley_(British_politician)) said on [BBC Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)) [4's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)) [Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(BBC_Radio_4)) on 31 July, that the rioters were not local residents, but were "thugs who'd got the train in" and were "utterly disrespecting the families of the dead and injured children, and [...] the town"[.\[286\]](#page-88-0) The rioters had broken windows of Southport Mosque; Hurley told Today that people "were using the horrific incident on Monday, the deaths of three little kiddies, for their own political purposes"[.\[287\]](#page-88-1) The Liverpool Region Mosque Network and the [Muslim Association of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Association_of_Britain) released statements condemning the riot[.\[45\]](#page-55-0)

The [Reform UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK) leader, [Nigel Farage,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage) condemned the violence, stating: "The levels of intimidation and threat to life have no place in a functioning democracy". He called for Parliament to be recalled over the riots and suggested there was a widespread impression of "two-tier policing" as a result of "soft policing" during [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) protests, which he said contributed to a "sense of injustice"[.\[288\]](#page-88-2)

[Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)) former Home Secretary [Priti Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priti_Patel) called Farage's comments deeply misleading and "simply not relevant right now". She told [Times Radio:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Radio) "There's a clear difference between effectively blocking streets or roads being closed to burning down libraries, hotels, food banks and attacking places of worship. What we have seen is thuggery, violence, racism." Patel also wrote to the Prime Minister and Home Secretary, asking them to recall parliament[.\[289\]](#page-88-3)

Farage was criticised by the former head of [UK counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_Terrorism_Policing)[terrorism,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_Terrorism_Policing) [Neil Basu,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Basu) for questioning whether the truth was being withheld from the public, with Basu accusing Farage of inciting violence and creating [conspiracy theories.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theories) Farage was also accused of giving legitimacy to acts of violence by [Steve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rotheram) [Rotheram,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rotheram) the [Mayor of Liverpool City Region,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Liverpool_City_Region) after releasing a video in which he said he did not support violence, but the protests were "nothing to what could happen over the course of the next few weeks"[.\[290\]](#page-88-4)

On 2 August, ahead of anticipated protests the following weekend, the [Muslim Council of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Council_of_Britain) recommended that mosques "review and strengthen their security protocols",[\[291\]](#page-88-5) [\[292\]](#page-88-6) and counter-protests by anti-racists were organised under the banner of "Stop the far right: Don't let the racists divide us", predominantly by [Stand Up to Racism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_Up_to_Racism) [\[293\]](#page-88-7) Church leaders in Northern Ireland condemned calls for anti-Islamic protests in the province at the weekend[.\[294\]](#page-89-0) Leaders from [Jewish,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) [Sikh,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs) and [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus) religious communities also released statements condemning the anti-Islamic rioting[.\[295\]](#page-89-1)[\[296\]](#page-89-2)[\[297\]](#page-89-3)

Hampshire's [police and crime commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_and_crime_commissioner) and Conservative politician [Donna Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Jones_(British_politician)) released a controversial statement that was widely criticised, in which she said that arresting people was "treating the symptom and not the cause" and otherwise appeared to agree with the protesters[.\[298\]](#page-89-4)[\[299\]](#page-89-5) The media release was later removed from the Police and Crime Commission's website[.\[298\]](#page-89-4) Susan Scott, a Conservative Party councillor on [Stockton-on-Tees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockton-on-Tees) council, resigned after making anti-Muslim remarks[.\[300\]](#page-89-6)[\[301\]](#page-89-7)

Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the "effects of mass migration and open borders", [Elon Musk,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) the owner of Twitter, tweeted on 4 August, "Civil war is inevitable". His comment was condemned by the Prime Minister's official spokesman. Musk had previously restored Tommy Robinson's account (after Robinson had been banned under Twitter's previous owners) and interacted with him on the platform[.\[302\]](#page-90-0)[\[303\]](#page-90-1) After the incident on 5 August in [Yardley, Birmingham,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yardley,_Birmingham) [\[304\]](#page-90-2) Musk went on to refer to the Prime Minister as "two-tier Keir" and ask, "Why aren't all communities protected in Britain?", describing the government as ["woke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke) [stasi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi)[.\[305\]](#page-90-3)[\[306\]](#page-90-4)[\[307\]](#page-90-5) Musk later shared an image promoting a conspiracy theory that claimed "detainment camps" for the rioters were being constructed on the [Falkland Islands.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands) He subsequently deleted the image, which had originally been posted by Ashlea Simon, the co-leader of [Britain First.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britain_First) [\[308\]](#page-90-6)

On 5 August, Neil Basu said that the worst of the far-right violence should be treated as terrorism; "Not only does it fit the definition of terrorism, it is terrorism", in reference to attempting to burn down buildings occupied by Muslims or asylum seekers. He further described actions as a "racial cause designed to intimidate a section of the public".[\[309\]](#page-91-0)

A [You Gov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You Gov) poll of 2,114 people on 5–6 August found that 7% supported the riots, while 34% supported the broader peaceful protests; 21% of [Reform UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK) voters supported the riots, 9% of Conservative voters, 3% of Labour voters, and 1% of Liberal Democrat voters[.\[310\]](#page-91-1)[\[311\]](#page-91-2) Another You Gov poll of 2,163 British adults in the same period saw immigration identified as the number one issue facing the country (51%), above the economy (44%), and crime (39%)[.\[312\]](#page-91-3) In July, the figures were immigration 41%, the economy 53%, and crime 20%. This represented a 10-point rise in importance for immigration, and a 19-point rise for crime. According to You Gov, "It is impossible to unpick how much of the recent shift is because of the stabbings, and how much are as a result of the week-long rioting since then.["\[312\]](#page-91-3) The concern about crime figure is the highest value in polls since 2011, when there were also major national riots[.\[312\]](#page-91-3)

On 7 August, [Wired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)) magazine reported that Telegram had removed a group set up in the wake of the Southport stabbing. [\[278\]](#page-87-0)

On 9 August, [King Charles III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III) spoke by telephone with the Prime Minister and senior police officers. A statement was subsequently released by [Buckingham Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace) describing how "The King shared how he had been greatly encouraged by the many examples of community spirit that had countered the aggression and criminality from a few with the compassion and resilience of the many"[.\[313\]](#page-91-4) Later, on 20 August, the King visited Southport, where he met those affected by the riots and members of the community who had participated in reconciliation efforts[.\[314\]](#page-92-0) The following day, he hosted the victims' families at [Clarence House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House) in London[.\[315\]](#page-92-1)

# **Analysis**

For the Southport riot, [far-right activists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom) had been promoting the demonstration that started in Southport[,\[66\]](#page-58-1) prior to involvement in the riot[.\[316\]](#page-92-2) [Huff Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huff Post_UK) described far-right activists as having "hijacked" the vigil for the victims,[\[317\]](#page-93-0) and the [Manchester Evening News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News) reported "far right thugs, fuelled by lies, sought to exploit the tragedy"[.\[318\]](#page-93-1) Merseyside Police said on the night of the riot that they believed supporters of the EDL were involved in and organised the disturbances.[\[1\]](#page-48-0)[\[319\]](#page-93-2) [\[320\]](#page-93-3) [Hope Not Hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Not_Hate) described them as supporters of Tommy Robinson[.\[321\]](#page-93-4) Robinson denied the EDL were involved, while arguing that the anger in Southport was justified.[\[322\]](#page-93-5) A prominent member of the neo-Nazi group [Patriotic Alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic_Alternative) took part in the riot and another member helped to promote the event[.\[2\]](#page-48-1)[\[323\]](#page-93-6)

The protests and riots were fuelled by wider Islamophobia, concerns over crime, anti-migration sentiment, xenophobia, nationalism and against perceived biases by the police and media[.\[324\]](#page-93-7)[\[325\]](#page-94-0)[\[326\]](#page-94-1) The Independent described the riots as being "sparked by Islamophobic and racist sentiments", with examples of mosques being targeted and several violent racist attacks on [ethnic minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_minorities) by the far-right in Liverpool, Hull and Bristol[.\[39\]](#page-54-0) [Politico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico) described the cause of the violence as "Islamophobic resentment that had long brewed across the United Kingdom" as having surfaced, citing hate crimes associated with [British Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Muslims) as being the highest among any religious group in the country, according to government data[.\[38\]](#page-53-5) According to Hope not Hate, although the stabbing in Southport was the catalyst, "most of these protests and riots are more broadly focused, expressive of a wider hostility to multiculturalism, anti-Muslim and anti-migrant prejudice, as well as a visceral streak of populist anti-Government sentiment"[.\[65\]](#page-58-0)

During the protests, widespread disinformation blaming immigrants and Muslims for crime were shared online.[\[324\]](#page-93-7) [Andrew Chadwick,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Chadwick) a professor of political communication at [Loughborough University,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough_University) described a viral tweet as being "deliberately fabricated to generate hostility toward ethnic minorities and immigrants, and it's a potentially [Islamophobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobic) piece of propaganda"[.\[322\]](#page-93-5) [Matthew Feldman,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Feldman_(historian)) an expert on right-wing extremism, commented "It is difficult to think of a much better example of online harms breaching the real world than a fake story demonising Muslims and people of colour and leading to riots on the streets"[.\[327\]](#page-94-2) Former security minister [Stephen Mc Partland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Mc Partland) accused Russia and [Vladimir Putin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_under_Vladimir_Putin) [regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_under_Vladimir_Putin) of involvement in the campaign of misinformation, describing it as "part of the Russian playbook".[\[77\]](#page-59-6) Days later, [The Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent) reported that misinformation and conspiracy regarding the suspect remained and appeared to be the motivating force behind the protests[.\[57\]](#page-56-6)

Extremism experts attributed the large far-right rally in London, led by Robinson a week prior to the protests as having boosted supporters, with Robinson playing a significant role in inciting outrage. The [Financial Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times) described the evolution of the movement from "more formally organised [white-supremacist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Supremacist) groups into personality-driven splinter groups", while capitalising on social media for outreach and organising.[\[324\]](#page-93-7) Police officials have described organisers as being in distinct far-right groups, organising online under banners such as "enough is enough", "save our kids", and ["stop the boats"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_the_boats) (the latter in reference to [migrant crossings of the English Channel\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel_migrant_crossings_(2018%E2%80%93present)), with Robinson being a central figure in calls to hold riots.[\[326\]](#page-94-1) Writing for [The Observer,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer) [Shabana Mahmood,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabana_Mahmood) the [Secretary of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Justice) [State for Justice,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Justice) suggested the impact of the disorder would be "felt for months and years to come" as the volume of cases linked to the riots going through the courts would affect government plans to address a backlog of cases.[\[328\]](#page-94-3) Data recorded by [ACLED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACLED) shows the riots significantly increased the number of violent demonstrations across the United Kingdom in 2024, exceeding the totals of 2020 and 2021 which were affected by the [Covid-19 pandemic.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covid-19_pandemic) [\[329\]](#page-94-4)

### **Police inspectorate review**

The second part of a review by the [police inspectorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Majesty%27s_Inspectorate_of_Constabulary_and_Fire_%26_Rescue_Services) was published on 7 May 2025. It found that the participants in the riots were mostly locals and that the violence "was mainly unrelated to their ideology or political views". The inspectors did not find any conclusive evidence that any of the activities were co-ordinated by extremist groups, but that they were mostly incited online by "disaffected individuals, influencers or groups" and that "Some of the main reasons for the widespread disorder were social deprivation, austerity and the economic downturn, political policies and decisions on migration and asylum, and decreasing trust and confidence in policing". The chief inspector of constabulary said that misinformation and disinformation that had been posted online had been left up for too long and that helped fuel the disorder. The chief inspector also said that the police needed more powers to be available to make it easier for misinformation and disinformation published on social media to be taken down, and that the police should counter such information by putting the known facts into the public domain sooner.[\[330\]](#page-94-5)

The [National Police Chiefs' Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Chiefs%27_Council) (NPCC) responded to the review saying that it did not accurately assess the police role in countering such online content and that a fully coordinated and cross government approach was required. The NPCC chair said, "While there are lessons to learn, it is crucial to acknowledge that law enforcement does not - and should not regulate online content.", adding, "Responsibility for ensuring information is accurate and does not fuel harm lies with those posting it, platform providers and regulatory bodies" and that the report did not "fully recognise the successes" of the police media strategy, and how "strengthening intelligence alone is not enough to mitigate the risks posed by misinformation".
