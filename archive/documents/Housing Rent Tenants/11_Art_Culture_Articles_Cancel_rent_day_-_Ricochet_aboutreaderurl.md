Shawn Vulliez 5-7 minutes In Canada, COVID-19 has meant that public events and gatherings
are being cancelled. Flights, concerts, and hockey games are getting cancelled across
the board. Restaurants and bars are closing. People’s contracts and work hours are
being lost. Why not cancel rent day too? Already, one in five renters spends more
than 50 per cent of their income on rent in Vancouver. Now COVID-19 has forced many
businesses to close their doors and lay off their staff across the country. Baristas,
servers, bartenders, cooks, barbers, event staff, musicians, hotel workers, and
service workers of all kinds are among those hardest hit. We know that on the first
day of the month, hundreds of thousands of renters who live paycheque to paycheque
are going to fall short on their rent. They need immediate relief, to make sure
nobody loses their housing in this pandemic. Vancouver’s Mayor Kennedy Stewart proposes
an expanded rent bank for struggling tenants to take out loans to make their rent.

landlords have expenses, and the province should help them during the crisis too.
I propose something simple: Provinces should reimburse landlords for maintenance
costs during the pandemic. In order to apply for this relief, landlords would just
need to submit information about their maintenance costs over the last year. In
B. C., for example, the province can boost funding to the Residential Tenancy Branch
Compliance and Enforcement Unit to analyze the data and determine access to reimbursements.
In B. C. alone, cancelling rent day would provide over a billion dollar stimulus
directly to renters and boost the local economy. The data used in refund applications
could discreetly and confidentially be used by the provinces to create new independent
provincial landlord registries, which track the real costs of rental units across
the country. This priceless data would give the provinces information it needs but
can’t usually get to shape policy to better address the housing crisis, keep rents
affordable, and create housing for the homeless. We can use rent day cancellation
as an opportunity to look under the hood of our housing market and fix the problems
based on the evidence. The spread of COVID-19 has shown us the fault lines of our
housing system. People across the country should call on their MLAs and MPs to cancel
rent day and end homelessness before we miss the window to blunt the impacts at
the kitchen table for working people. In B. C. alone, cancelling rent day would provide
