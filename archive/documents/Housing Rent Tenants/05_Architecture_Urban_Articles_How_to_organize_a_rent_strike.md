## Content How to organize a rent strike Background: It is a big risk and escalation
to organize for a rent strike and withhold rent or rent increases that haven’t been
made to your home. We advise that it is only done in larger buildings where most
all of the tenants in almost every apartment unit are participating. There are a
couple of steps that you want to go through before you even think about a rent strike.
Self‐Organizing: One or more of the tenants in the building need to be willing to
go around and talk with their neighbors, knock on doors and hold a meeting where
they talk about the habitability issues with the building or the major rent increases
and what people want to do about it. There may be a staff organizer or other community
group willing to help talk to tenants but the tenants themselves have to be willing
to organize themselves first. If they need help coming up with an agenda or helping
facilitate the meeting than it’s fine to help out, but there has to be a willingness
on the part of the tenants to be a key part of the organizing and outreach. Documents
Repairs and habitability issues: Many times in older buildings there are many issues
that are not taken care of such as: insect infestations (bed bugs, cock roaches)
rodent infestations (rats and mice etc...), mold. Many times they affect many of
the residents homes not just one so when you hear about an issue in one unit ask
about it in the others to look for patterns. Take Pictures: Make sure that you walk
through each apartment unit and take photos of each unit on your cell phone or another
camera to document major habitability issues like I listed above. (Hint) the first
picture you take should be of the address on the front of the building the 2 nd
should be of the front of each apartment door which usually has the apartment number/letter
on it. This is because once you get back to your office or computer to download
the pictures you may have trouble remembering which apartment is which. That’s why
you want to do this ASAP after the visit and organize the pictures into folders
which list the address of the apartment and the apartment number. Make a separate
folder for each apartment unit and put the date in the name of the file for each
photo. This can take a long time so make sure you leave yourself 2‐3 hours to do
all of this and this of course depends on how big the building is. Call or write
Code Enforcement: Chances are tenants have already talked to their property manager
or landlord about getting repairs made and have been ignored. If they haven’t asked
the landlord to make repairs they should do that first. If they have contacted the
landlord and things haven’t been fixed than make sure the tenant calls or writes
(email is fine) code enforcement right away. Some cities have forms that you can
fill out and document all of the habitability issues with the apartment. If your
city doesn’t have a form you can use this form. If the tenants all have a similar
habitability issue like bed bugs than it would be good to send the forms in at the
same time. You can also use it as an organizing opportunity and organize a delegation
to the code enforcement department so they can see how big of deal it is. ``` --
