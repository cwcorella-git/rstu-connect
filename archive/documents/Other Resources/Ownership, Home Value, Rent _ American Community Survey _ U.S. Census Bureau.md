   An oﬃcial website of the United States government Here’s how you know

     BACK TO TOPICS PAGE [/ACS/WWW/ABOUT/WHY-WE-ASK-EAC…



We ask about whether a home is owned or rented to
create statistics about home ownership and renters. We
also ask questions about the monthly rent amount or
how much the home and property are worth to produce
statistics about rent and home value.

These data help determine whether adequate housing
is aﬀordable for residents and provide and fund housing
assistance programs. They also help enforce laws,
regulations, and policies designed to eliminate
discrimination in private-market housing, government
programs, and in society.


Your privacy concerns
We use your conﬁdential survey answers to create statistics like those in the results below and in the full tables
that contain all the data—no one is able to ﬁgure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce. The
Census Bureau is legally bound to strict conﬁdentiality requirements. Individual records are not shared with
anyone, including federal agencies and law enforcement entities. By law, the Census Bureau cannot share
respondents' answers with anyone, including companies, other federal agencies, and law enforcement.


Questions as they appear on the form
We ask three questions about ownership status, monthly rent, and home value to                 VIEW QUESTIONS
better understand the housing market.


Results from these questions
We compile the results from these questions to provide communities with important statistics to measure housing
aﬀordability. You can see some of these published statistics here for the nation, states, and your community.

 Ownership, home value, and rent data help communities:
 Provide Adequate Housing
 We ask about the diﬀerent types of households in a community (single people, couples, families, roommates, etc.)
 and rates of home rental and ownership to help communities understand whether available housing meets the
 needs of residents. Data about owners and renters, in combination with housing costs and the combined income of
 all people in a household, help communities understand whether housing is aﬀordable for residents.

 When housing is not suﬃcient or aﬀordable, statistics about owners, renters, and housing costs help communities:

 • Enroll eligible households in programs designed to assist them.
 • Qualify for grants from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership Program, Emergency Solutions
 Grants (ESG), Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), and other programs.

 When rental housing is not aﬀordable, the Department of Housing and Urban Developments uses rent data to
 determine the amount of tenant subsidies in housing assistance programs. The amount of subsidies is based on the
 rental distribution of housing units (the standard cost of diﬀerent types of housing in diﬀerent areas of the country)
 and Fair Market Rents.
 Plan Community Development
 Knowing how the balance of rented homes, mortgaged homes, and owned homes changes over time helps
 communities:

 • Understand changes in local housing markets.
 • Identify opportunities to improve tax, assistance, and zoning policies.
 • Reduce tax revenue losses from vacant or abandoned properties.
 • Determine housing assistance funding (Fair Market Rents).
 Ensure Equal Opportunity
 We ask about the characteristics of people who rent and people who own homes, such as age, sex, race, Hispanic
 origin, and disability status to help the government and communities enforce laws designed to eliminate
 discrimination in housing, such as the 1968 Fair Housing Act.
 Understand Changing Households
 Statistics about whether older residents are staying in homes as they age or moving into rented homes; and
 whether young people are staying with parents, renting with roommates, or buying homes, help governments and
 communities distribute funds appropriately between home ownership and rental housing programs and services for
 residents.


History of ownership, home value, and rent questions
The ownership question originated with the 1890 Census, while home value and rent questions originated with the
1940 Census. They were added to the ACS in 2005 when it replaced the decennial census long form.
