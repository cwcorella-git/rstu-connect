            Reno Sparks Tenants Oppose
            “Anti-Homeless” Ordinances at
            Reno City Council Meeting
            January 22, 2025 · Jack Woods


            As Reno and Sparks deal with a crippling housing a�ordability crisis, it seems
            that our city council leaders believe criminalizing homelessness is the answer.
            On Wednesday January 22, 2025, the Reno City Council considered Agenda
            items F1-F6 which aim to criminalize si�ing, laying down, and loitering in public
            places.
                                                                          . More on that here.


            In response, RSTU coordinated with other housing groups to organize
            community members in opposition to the proposed ordinances. Since then,
            we’ve seen an outpouring of support for our houseless population. Our
            coalition of concerned citizens submi�ed
                        , which constituted almost
            received. A post by Family Soup Mutual Aid, shared by RSTU on Instagram,
            received over 650 likes and reached far more people.


            One RSTU member, Ben Iness, highlighted how close many Reno renters are
            to losing their homes:

                           Ben Iness giving public comment on January 22, 2025


            “For every $100 increase in rent, we see a 9% increase in the chance of
            becoming unhoused.”


            He cited a recent report by UNLV which shows Nevada renters have the 2nd
            highest cost burden in the nation.
                                                         This meets the HUD deﬁnition for
            “cost burdened” renters. Whether we like to admit it or not,




                “Homelessness is a housing problem, not a personal or moral failing. It
                is devastating and di�icult whenever we punish folks in response.”
                Ben Iness, Reno City Council Public Comment, January 22, 2025
