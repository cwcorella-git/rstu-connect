How to Start a Backyard Community Garden (Mutual Aid Style)

Starting a community garden in your backyard isn’t just about growing food, it’s about growing
trust, connection, and something beautiful together. Whether you’ve got a big yard or just a
sunny patch, you can turn it into a shared space for nourishment and joy. Here’s how to get it
blooming:

🌱 1. Gather Your People
Start with a simple ask: “Hey, wanna grow food together?” Hit up friends, neighbors, coworkers,
or that person down the street with the killer compost pile. Host a chill hangout or a potluck to
dream up what’s possible. This is where the magic starts.

🤝 2. Build It Together
 This isn’t your garden, it’s our garden. Talk through what everyone wants to grow, how to share
the harvest, and what each person can offer (skills, tools, snacks, vibes). Use group texts,
signal chats, or handwritten notes taped to the gate, whatever works to keep everyone in the
loop.

🌻 3. Work with What You’ve Got
No need to go big. A couple raised beds, some salvaged containers, and a patch of soil can
become something amazing. Sunlight? Great. Some shade? That’s where the leafy greens go.
Got an old table? Boom, it's a harvest station. Start simple and grow from there.

🛠 4. Share the Load, Share the Love
 Gardens thrive on shared effort. Rotate watering, weeding, planting, and harvesting. Celebrate
small wins: first sprouts, first tomato, first time someone finally learns how to pronounce
“nasturtium.” Make it fun, not a chore.

🌍 5. Collaborate Beyond the Fence
 Link up with local orgs, schools, churches, or neighbors who might want to swap seeds, lend
tools, or co-host a skillshare. Community is the compost that keeps this whole thing fertile.

🍓 6. Grow More Than Just Food
 Grow basil, sure, but also grow trust, rituals, resilience. Set up a little free produce stand, have
garden movie nights, or host a full moon gathering. The food is the hook, but the real harvest is
solidarity.



A community garden is a tiny revolution in your own backyard. It’s a way to say: “We take care
of each other here.” Ready to plant the first seed?
