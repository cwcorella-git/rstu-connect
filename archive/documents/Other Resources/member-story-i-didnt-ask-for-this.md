# Member Stories: "I Didn't Ask For This"

I didn't ask for this.

I didn't ask to become a tenant organizer. I didn't ask to learn about Nevada housing law. I didn't ask to spend my evenings at city council meetings or my weekends at tenant rights workshops.

I just wanted a safe, affordable place to live.

But when my landlord decided to retaliate against me for asking for basic repairs, I learned something important: the system isn't broken. It worked exactly as designed.

## How It Started

My apartment building was purchased by a large property management company in early 2024. Within months, everything changed.

The new owners raised everyone's rent by the maximum amount allowed. They stopped answering maintenance requests. The laundry room broke and stayed broken for three months. The front gate to our "secure" building was left open permanently.

Meanwhile, they posted notices about "property improvements" and "enhanced amenities" that never materialized.

I tried to be patient. I tried to be understanding. Maybe they were still figuring things out, I thought. Maybe if I just gave them time to get organized, things would improve.

They didn't.

## The Breaking Point

When my kitchen sink started backing up sewage, I knew I had to act. I called the maintenance number repeatedly. I sent emails. I left notes at the management office.

Nothing.

For two weeks, I couldn't use my kitchen sink. I was washing dishes in the bathroom and buying prepared food because I couldn't cook. The smell was overwhelming.

Finally, I did some research online and learned about Nevada's implied warranty of habitability. I sent a certified letter demanding repairs within a reasonable time frame, as required by law.

Three days later, I got an eviction notice.

## The Notice

The notice claimed I was violating my lease by "creating a disturbance" and "interfering with other tenants' quiet enjoyment." It said I had five days to cure the violation or face eviction.

I was confused. What disturbance? What interference? I'm one of the quietest tenants in the building. I work from home and barely make any noise.

Then I realized: the "disturbance" was me asking for repairs. The "interference" was me knowing my rights.

## Learning the System

That's when I found the Reno Sparks Tenants Union.

I went to my first meeting scared and angry. I thought I was the only one dealing with this kind of retaliation. I thought I had done something wrong.

Instead, I found a room full of people with similar stories. Different buildings, different management companies, but the same pattern: tenants asking for basic habitability, landlords responding with threats and retaliation.

I learned that what happened to me wasn't personal. It wasn't because I was a "bad tenant" or because I had approached the situation wrong. It was because landlord retaliation is a business strategy designed to keep tenants quiet and compliant.

## The Legal Reality

With help from RSTU, I connected with Northern Nevada Legal Aid. An attorney explained that while landlord retaliation is illegal in Nevada, proving it in court is difficult and expensive.

Even if I won my case, the process could take months. In the meantime, I might be evicted and struggle to find new housing with an eviction case on my record.

The system is designed to make tenants choose between fighting for their rights and keeping their homes. For most people, it's not really a choice at all.

## Fighting Back

But I decided to fight.

With support from RSTU members and legal guidance, I responded to the eviction notice. I documented everything: the maintenance requests, the sewage backup, the timeline of events. I showed that the eviction notice came immediately after my repair demand.

I also learned I wasn't alone in my building. Other tenants had similar maintenance issues but were afraid to complain after seeing what happened to me.

That's when I understood the real purpose of retaliation: it's not just about punishing one tenant. It's about sending a message to everyone else.

## Building Collective Power

Instead of handling this alone, RSTU helped me organize with my neighbors. We found that nearly every unit had maintenance problems. The management company was clearly trying to squeeze as much profit as possible while providing minimal services.

We started meeting regularly. We shared information about our rights. We documented problems throughout the building. Most importantly, we decided to act together.

When we presented our collective demands for repairs – signed by 80% of tenants – the management company couldn't just threaten one person. They had to respond to all of us.

## The Resolution

It took six months, but we won. The management company dropped the eviction case against me. They made most of the repairs we demanded. They stopped retaliating against tenants who complained about problems.

More importantly, we built something lasting. Our tenants association is still active. We monitor the building for new problems. We support each other when anyone faces harassment or retaliation.

We turned a building full of isolated, scared tenants into a community with collective power.

## What I Learned

This experience taught me several important lessons:

### The System Works as Designed
Landlord retaliation isn't a bug in the housing system – it's a feature. It's designed to keep tenants quiet and maximize profits for property owners.

### Individual Action Has Limits
Fighting retaliation alone is difficult and often unsuccessful. Landlords count on tenants being isolated and afraid.

### Collective Action Changes Everything
When tenants organize together, we have real power to demand change and protect each other from retaliation.

### Knowledge is Power
Understanding your rights is important, but understanding how to exercise those rights collectively is transformative.

### Solidarity is Essential
Other tenants aren't your competition – they're your allies. We all benefit when anyone stands up for better conditions.

## Why I Stay Involved

I could have stopped after resolving my own case. I could have gone back to being a quiet tenant who just pays rent and doesn't cause problems.

But I can't unknow what I learned. I can't unsee how the system works.

Every day, tenants across Reno face the same retaliation and harassment I experienced. Every day, landlords use fear and intimidation to prevent people from advocating for basic habitability.

Staying involved with RSTU means I can help other tenants understand their rights and build collective power. It means I can fight for policy changes that protect all tenants, not just those brave enough to organize.

## To Other Tenants

If you're reading this and facing similar problems, know that you're not alone. What's happening to you isn't your fault, and you don't have to accept it.

Here's what I wish I had known from the beginning:

### Document Everything
Keep records of all maintenance requests, communications with your landlord, and problems in your unit. Take photos and save emails.

### Know Your Rights
Learn about Nevada tenant law, but remember that knowing your rights and being able to exercise them are different things.

### Connect with Other Tenants
Talk to your neighbors. Share information about problems and landlord behavior. You'll likely find others with similar experiences.

### Get Support
Organizations like RSTU exist to help tenants organize and fight back. You don't have to handle this alone.

### Think Collectively
Individual solutions are temporary. Collective action creates lasting change for everyone.

## Looking Forward

My landlord probably hoped that retaliating against me would make me a quiet, compliant tenant. Instead, it made me an organizer.

I learned that I have power – not just as an individual with rights, but as part of a community fighting for justice.

The housing crisis in Reno isn't getting better on its own. Rents keep rising. Corporate landlords keep consolidating ownership. Evictions keep displacing families.

But tenants are organizing. We're building power. We're fighting for policies that prioritize people over profit.

I didn't ask for this fight. But I'm glad I'm in it.
