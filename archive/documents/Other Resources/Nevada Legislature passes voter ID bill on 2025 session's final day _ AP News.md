             LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nevada lawmakers in the Democratic-controlled Legislature ended their
             2025 regular session early Tuesday after a ﬂurry of ﬁnal-day action.

             Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to take action through next week on the
             hundreds of bills that passed. The ﬁrst-term governor vetoed a record 75 bills in 2023.
             Nevada lawmakers meet every other year in odd years.

          Ahead of the session, Lombardo urged the Legislature to put politics aside and come
          together to ﬁnd solutions for such issues as affordable housing and education. Some of his
          major bills failed, including a wide-ranging bill that would have created stiffer penalties for
          certain crimes, but he won in other areas including elections and education.

          “As the session concludes, I’m proud to report that we’ve made signiﬁcant progress in our
          two most critical endeavors this session: combatting the rising cost of housing and
          improving outcomes in our K-12 education system,” Lombardo said in a statement.

          Here is a look at some of the notable bills that passed and failed during this year’s 120-day
          session in Carson City.

          Elections
          — Voter ID and ballot boxes: Signaling a major compromise, lawmakers passed a bill on the
          ﬁnal day of the session that revived Democrats’ vetoed effort to add more mail ballot drop
          boxes around the state ahead of an election in exchange for new voter ID requirements that
          Lombardo supports.

          It marks a signiﬁcant shift for Nevada Democrats, who have long opposed GOP-led efforts to
          require photo identiﬁcation from voters at the polls and comes on the heels of voters in
          November passing a voter ID ballot measure. It would have to pass again in 2026 in order to
          amend the state constitution.

          — Primary elections for nonpartisan voters: A week before the session ended, Democratic
          Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager introduced a bill as an emergency request that would allow
          nonpartisan voters to cast a ballot in Republican or Democratic primary elections, excluding
          presidential primaries. Voters registered as nonpartisan outnumber both major parties in the
          swing state.

          The bill is different from the effort voters rejected in November that would have
          implemented open primaries and ranked choice voting for all voters.




          Education
          — Teacher raises: Lawmakers in both chambers overwhelmingly approved a bill that includes
          pay raises for teachers at charters schools. Lombardo had said he would not approve the
          state’s education budget if it left out raises for charter school teachers, which Yeager then
          added to the bill.

          — Police use of force in schools: The proposal approved by lawmakers would require the
          Clark County School District’s police department to make public its data on ofﬁcer use of
          force, including the use of stun guns, batons and pepper spray. The school district is the
          ﬁfth-largest in the nation and has its own police department.




          Housing
          — “Attainable” housing: Lombardo’s bill aimed at expanding affordable housing, one of his
          top priorities this session, would allocate $133 million in state funds for housing projects for
          what he calls the “missing middle” who can’t afford to buy a home but don’t currently qualify
          for affordable housing. It passed.

          — Renter protections: A handful of bills aimed at expanding protections for renters passed
          on party lines. They include a proposal that would create a pilot program capping rent prices
          for seniors for a year, and another that would allow tenants to quickly ﬁle legal complaints
          against landlords for unsafe living conditions like broken air conditioning or broken locks.

          Public safety
          — Lombardo’s crime bill: The governor, who was a longtime police ofﬁcer and the former
          elected sheriff in Las Vegas, had vowed ahead of the session to crack down on crime. But his
          crime bill failed after last-minute changes were added and lawmakers ran out of time
          Monday night.

          It would have created stiffer penalties for certain crimes, including “smash-and-grab” retail
          thefts and violent crimes against hospitality workers, a newly designated protected class
          under the proposal.




          Other issues
          — Film tax credits: The closely watched bill backed by Sony Pictures and Warner Bros.
          Entertainment failed. It would have given massive tax credits aimed at bringing ﬁlm
          production to southern Nevada, including a 31-acre ﬁlm studio in an afﬂuent neighborhood
          west of the Las Vegas Strip. A similar bill failed in 2023.

          — Deﬁning antisemitism: Lawmakers approved a bill that creates a deﬁnition of antisemitism
          for state-led investigations into discrimination in housing, employment and other
          accommodations. It passed, but sparked a debate because some thought the deﬁnition was
          too broad and could limit free speech criticizing Israel.

          — State lottery: The proposal, backed by the powerful Culinary Workers Union that
          represents 60,000 hotel and casino workers, would have ended Nevada’s longstanding ban
          on lotteries. It failed after the Legislature’s ﬁrst major deadline in April.
