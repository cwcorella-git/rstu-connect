          Live updates: Nevada Legislature’s ﬁrst house passage deadline day
           Tuesday’s deadline is expected to result in the death of only a handful of
           measures, as more than 200 bills have been exempted.

           Government         Legislature




          The Legislature in Carson City on April 11,
          2025. (David Calvert/The Nevada
          Independent)

          Lengthy �oor sessions preceded the days before the Legislature’s �rst house passage deadline on
          Tuesday, prompting impassioned speeches from members of both parties as lawmakers voted out
          dozens of bills and resolutions.

          All non-exempt bills must be voted out of their house of origin — either the Senate or Assembly —
          by the time �oor sessions adjourn Tuesday if they are to continue through the legislative process.

          Unlike the �rst committee passage deadline on April 11, which saw more than 280 bills die from
          inaction, Tuesday’s deadline resulted in the death of just seven bills. More than 200 bills out of the
          more than a thousand introduced so far have been exempted.

          In 2023, only 10 measures died at this juncture of the 120-day session and in 2021, that number was
          just seven, in addition to one resolution.


1 of 12                                                                                                      8/7/25, 1:34 PM

          To view the status of all legislative measures, check out The Nevada Independent’s public bill
          tracker.

          Here’s a look at which bills passed ahead of Tuesday’s deadline and what lawmakers said about them.
          Check back often, as The Nevada Independent reporters will update this story throughout the day.

          Senate adjourns, solidifying bills that died — 8:37 p.m.

          The Senate adjourned at 8:09 p.m. on Tuesday — ending the Legislature’s �rst house passage
          deadline.

          The �nal �oor session solidi�ed which bills met their demise Tuesday (though the provisions of
          these proposals can still be included in other bills or resurrected via a waiver). The bills that died
          were:

              • AB64, brought by the attorney general’s o�ce, would have added certain exemptions to the
                  state’s open meeting law, including instances when a public body is receiving legal counsel or
                  deliberating over only that counsel. The bill would have originally allotted three minutes to
                  public commenters (there is no time currently speci�ed in Nevada law), but that was amended
                  out.
              • AB318, from Assm. Melissa Hardy (R-Henderson), would have allowed captive insurers —
                  insurance companies that are completely owned by its insureds — to provide workers
                  compensation insurance.
              • AB362, brought by Assm. Venicia Considine (D-Las Vegas), which would have imposed a tax on
                  the sale or transfer of a controlling interest in an entity that possesses property exceeding
                  $100.
              • AB437, sponsored by Assm. Jill Dickman (R-Sparks), which would have established a plan to
                  provide property insurance coverage for �res and other disasters that are not otherwise
                  available from an authorized insurer in Nevada.
              • SB152, proposed by Sen. James Ohrenschall (D-Las Vegas), which would have allowed a
                  homeowners association to install an electric vehicle charging station in a common area if a
                  majority of board members approve.
              • SB341, also proposed by Ohrenschall, would have made certain changes to the allowances for
                  witnesses in grand jury proceedings to testify virtually.
              • SB449, a bill from the Committee on Government A�airs, which would have explicitly allowed
                  a participating municipality and a metropolitan police department to establish a cooperative
                  unit of specialized law enforcement.

          Additionally, AJR12, a resolution supporting the prioritization of solar development on previously
          disturbed public lands in Nevada, failed to pass out of the Assembly.

          In the Senate’s �nal evening �oor session, more than 20 bills passed and did meet the deadline.




2 of 12                                                                                                      8/7/25, 1:34 PM

Live updates: Nevada Legislature’s ﬁrst house passage...         https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/live-updates-...


          Those included:

             • SB179, another bill sponsored by Ohrenschall, which requires the Nevada Equal Rights
                Commission to determine if antisemitism was a factor in a case of alleged discrimination in
                housing, employment or public accommodation.
                   ◦ Sen. Ira Hansen (R-Sparks) was the lone vote against the bill, saying these protections
                      already exist in state law. The measure passed on a vote of 20-1.
             • SB305, proposed by Sen. Fabian Doñate, which requires the state’s school sports association to
                provide a process for sanctioning sports, including lacrosse (a winnowed down version of the
                original proposal, which would have explicitly required the sanctioning of lacrosse). The bill
                passed unanimously.

          — Eric Neugeboren and Tabitha Mueller

          Assembly returns with swift votes, gavels out — 6:19 p.m.

          Following a relatively lengthy “�ve minute” recess, members of the Assembly quickly passed dozens
          of bills out of the chamber before adjourning at roughly 4:50 p.m.

          The most lively moment was when Assm. Alexis Hansen (R-Sparks) and a few other Republicans
          supported AB420, a bill that, as amended, would require the trustees of school districts and other
          schools that employ police o�cers to prepare and publish a use of force report outlining the number
          of incidents that involve force with a baton, chemical agent or electronic stun gun.

          Hansen stood in support, noting that “I can stand in support of the bill called 420, is really kind of
          amusing.”

          The Assembly voted 35-7 to approve the bill, with several Republicans in opposition.

          Here are highlights of other bills that passed:

             • AB360, sponsored by Assm. Heather Goulding (D-Reno), aims to address congenital syphilis
                by requiring medical facilities to test a pregnant woman who has not received certain prenatal
                screenings with a rapid test unless the patient refuses.
                   ◦ An amendment notes that consenting individuals will be tested with either a rapid or
                      point-of-care test. The amendment requires the director of Health and Human services
                      to seek federal authority to reimburse hospitals and other quali�ed providers for patients
                      covered by Medicaid. The bill passed unanimously.
             • AB396, from Assm. Shea Backus (D-Las Vegas), would require counties to pass laws that allow
                accessory dwelling units (ADUs) to be built on homeowners’ properties. ADUs are small
                housing units on a single family lot. As amended, it would exclude ADUs being built in the
                Tahoe Area Master Plan area. The bill passed with a party line vote of 27-15, with Republicans
                opposed.




3 of 12                                                                                                    8/7/25, 1:34 PM

             • AB406, brought by Assm. Jovan Jackson (D-North Las Vegas), was nearly gutted, and as
               amended, would prohibit schools from using arti�cial intelligence to perform the duties a
               school counselor, psychologist or social worker otherwise would. The bill initially would have
               required schools to have mental health-related assemblies and publish mental health
               information on websites. It passed unanimously.
             • AB451, brought by Assm. Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas), would make law enforcement o�cers
               and gun dealers largely immune from civil liability related to �rearm hold agreements, which is
               an agreement for a person to give up their �rearm. It passed nearly unanimously, with Assm.
               Jill Dickman (R-Sparks) being the only no vote.
                   ◦ The original bill was entirely removed via an amendment — it initially would have
                     established a process for individuals to voluntarily give up a �rearm.
             • AB464, sponsored by Assm. Brittney Miller (D-Las Vegas) would prohibit educational
               institutions from taking any adverse employment actions against employees based on sex,
               race, ethnicity, religion or political or social a�liation. An amendment to the measure would
               prohibit education o�cials from removing certain academic standards of content and
               performance. It passed on a party line vote of 27-15, with Republicans in opposition.
             • AB523 is the deal struck between Uber and Nevada trial lawyers that states ridesharing
               companies would not be liable for harms imposed by their drivers or passengers as long as they
               provide a minimum of $1 million in insurance coverage to drivers while transporting
               passengers. It represents a truce related to Uber's failed ballot initiative that sought to cap how
               much attorneys receive in settlement costs. It passed unanimously.

          Corrected on 4/22/2025 at 10:30 p.m to re�ect that Assm. Selena Torres-Fossett (D-Las Vegas) voted
          in favor of AB420.

          — Lizzie Ramirez, Tabitha Mueller, Isabella Aldrete and Eric Neugeboren

          GOP senators back gun, sidewalk vendors bills — 5:41 p.m.

          During a Senate �oor session that ended around 5 p.m., lawmakers passed 13 bills, including a
          notable one on �rearms.

          SB347, sponsored by Sen. Melanie Scheible (D-Las Vegas), would authorize police o�cers to
          con�scate �rearms from individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. A last-minute amendment
          would allow the �rearms to be automatically returned after the person undergoes treatment, unless
          they were already not allowed to have a �rearm, or if a police o�cer asks a court to not return the
          �rearm because of alleged high-risk behavior.

          The bill received the support of all Democrats and three Republicans: Sens. John Ellison (R-Elko),
          John Steinbeck (R-Las Vegas) and Je� Stone (R-Henderson). Sen Ira Hansen (R-Sparks) indicated
          that he would have supported the proposal if the amendment was submitted earlier.

Live updates: Nevada Legislature’s ﬁrst house passage...         https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/live-updates-...


          Here are some of the other bills that passed:

             • SB338, dubbed the “Taylor Swift bill” and sponsored by Sen. Julie Pazina (D-Las Vegas),
                requires ticket sellers subject to Nevada’s live entertainment tax to disclose the total price
                (including mandatory fees) at purchase and to issue a full ticket refund if an event is canceled
                within 30 days. It passed unanimously.
             • SB334, which requires the director of the Nevada Department of Corrections to submit a yearly
                report on the employment data of incarcerated individuals, passed on a 14-7 vote, with Hansen
                joining all Democrats in support.
             • SB295, which requires local boards of health in counties with populations more than 100,000 to
                adopt regulations for sidewalk food vendors and would prohibit them from stopping the sale of
                certain kinds of food from those vendors. It passed out of the Senate 17-4, with four
                Republicans opposing the measure.

          Animal cruelty bill still alive although it didn’t get a vote Tuesday — 4:45 p.m.

          Bills on animal cruelty, book bans, speed cameras and �rst-time homebuyer assistance are not set to
          receive votes today, but will survive because they have received an exemption or waiver from
          deadlines. Let’s take a look:

             • AB381: Also known as Reba’s Law, this measure was named after an English bulldog who was
                found taped in a packing container during extreme heat in Las Vegas. Bill sponsor Assm.
                Melissa Hardy (R-Henderson) hopes to increase the amount of prison time a person can face
                for committing animal cruelty. The bill did not get voted on by the �rst committee passage
                deadline day, and advocates took to social media to urge lawmakers to pass the measure. AB381
                received a waiver April 14 after the advocacy.
                    ◦ Miller posted on social media to let Nevadans know that the bill was “still alive.”
             • AB416: This bill, which would prohibit bans on library books unless a court declares them to be
                obscene, received an exemption. Because the bill would create a new crime for intimidating or
                doxxing library personnel over issues of book access, the Department of Public Safety noted
                this bill “could require additional pre-sentence investigation sta� and supervision o�cers.”

             • AB402: Sponsored by Assm. Selena Torres-Fossett (D-Las Vegas), this bill would authorize the
                installation of cameras in temporary construction zones that would capture license plate
                images if the driver exceeds the speed limit by 10 miles per hour or more. It passed out of
                committee but was referred to the Assembly budget committee on Monday.

             • SB193: The bill would address high interest rates and ease access for �rst-time homebuyers.
                Sen. Fabian Donate (D-Las Vegas) is hoping to give Nevadans $10,000 to $15,000 to buy down
                the interest rates on their �rst homes, which would save them anywhere from $50,000 to

               $100,000 over the course of a 30-year loan. The bill was referred to the Senate Finance
               Committee.

          — Lizzie Ramirez

          Price �xing, sex ed bills among dozens of measures passed out of Assembly — 4:34 p.m.

          Despite some Democratic defections, the Assembly passed AB44, the bill from the attorney
          general’s o�ce that prohibits companies from increasing prices of essential services beyond the
          “basic forces of supply and demand.”

          Three Democrats voted against the bill: Assms. Joe Dalia (D-Las Vegas), Venise Karris (D-Las Vegas)
          and Duy Nguyen (D-Las Vegas). It passed on a vote of 24-18, with all Republicans opposed.

          During a hearing last month, the bill received widespread backlash from the business community,
          which said it was unclear what price increases could be subject to the legislation. There are clear
          political stakes with the bill, as Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, is running for governor
          next year.

          Lawmakers also passed Assm. Heather Goulding’s (D-Reno) AB205, which would change Nevada’s
          sex education in schools from an opt-in to opt-out system. Schools would be mandated to issue a
          written notice to parents and guardians each school year when sex education is o�ered. This would
          automatically enroll all students in the course unless parents or guardians complete an opt-out form
          provided on the school district’s website. It passed along party lines.

          See below for highlights of the dozens of bills passed by the Assembly on Tuesday afternoon:

          Housing

             • AB121, sponsored by Assm. Venicia Considine (D-Las Vegas), would require landlords to
               disclose the total cost of rent without any hidden fees. The total must include �xed fees such as
               utility and parking charges, so tenants are aware of the exact amount they owe each month.
               Landlords also cannot overcharge or add additional fees. It passed along party lines, 27-15 with
               Republicans in opposition.
             • AB223, also from Considine, would allow tenants to withhold rent payments if the home does
               not comply with habitability laws. It passed along party lines.
             • AB280, sponsored by Assm. Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas), would cap rent increases to no
               more than 5 percent for Nevadans 62 years or older and for those who rely on Social Security
               payments. Additionally, it would require written rental agreements to disclose fees, tenants
               rights and landlords to refund application fees for a tenant not selected for the rental unit. The
               bill passed along party lines.

             • It’s similar to a measure Jauregui proposed during the 2023 legislative session, which was
               vetoed by Gov. Joe Lombardo.



6 of 12                                                                                                    8/7/25, 1:34 PM

             • AB283, from Assm. Max Carter (D-Las Vegas) would restructure the summary eviction process
               to require landlords to �le �rst, rather than the tenant. The measure passed along party lines.

          Health care

             • AB282, sponsored by Assm. David Orentlicher (D-Las Vegas), as amended would require health
               care providers who receive an overpayment from a patient to refund the overpaid amount
               within 60 days — there’s currently no timeline in state law for processing refunds. It passed on
               a 26-16 vote, with all Republicans and Nguyen, a Democrat, in opposition.
             • AB343, a hospital transparency measure sponsored by Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las
               Vegas) that would codify federal hospital price transparency regulations into state law and
               require hospitals to publish an annual report listing charges for items and services. Assm. Jill
               Dickman (R-Sparks) joined Democrats in supporting the bill, which passed on a 28-14 vote.

          Elections

             • AB73, on behalf of the secretary of state’s o�ce, would require the disclosure of arti�cial
               intelligence in campaign materials. It passed unanimously.

             • AB79, the secretary of state’s wide-ranging campaign �nance bill, passed along mostly party

               incurred in connection” with their position. It also changes the penalty process related to

               Nevadans 21 and younger from owning semi-automatic ri�es and semi-automatic shotguns. It
               would also prohibit children 14 and older from handling these guns as well. It passed along
               party lines with Republicans in opposition.

          low chance of meeting Tuesday’s deadline. The bills were:

              • AB64, brought by the attorney general’s o�ce, which would add certain exemptions to the
                state’s open meeting law, including instances when a public body is receiving legal counsel or
                deliberating over only that counsel. The bill would have originally allotted three minutes to
                public commenters (there is currently no time speci�ed in Nevada law), but that was amended
                out of the proposal.
              • AB362, brought by Assm. Venicia Considine (D-Las Vegas), which would impose a tax on the
                sale or transfer of a controlling interest in an entity that possesses property worth at least
                $100.
              • AB437, sponsored by Assm. Jill Dickman (R-Reno), which would establish a plan to provide
                property insurance coverage for �res and other disasters that are not otherwise available from
                an authorized insurer in Nevada.

          Senate gets heated over trucker liability insurance — 2:46 p.m.

          So far, the most contentious Senate �oor debate of the day stemmed from SB180, a bill that would
          raise minimum liability insurance requirements for truckers in Nevada.

          Speci�cally, it would require fully regulated freight carriers to carry proof of liability insurance of at
          least $1 million by 2026, gradually rising to $1.5 million by 2030. The current liability insurance policy
          limit is $750,000.

          Sen. Edgar Flores (D-Las Vegas), who sponsored the bill, said on the Senate �oor that the last time
          liability requirements for freight carriers was changed was in 1980. He said medical expenses “have
          exploded,” the state must ensure individuals are adequately covered, and small businesses
          transporting equipment already carry a million-dollar policy.

          Sen. Ira Hansen (R-Sparks) pushed back against Flores, saying that the current policy limit of
          $750,000 is aligned with 49 other states. He warned that the additional liability cost would create an
          undue burden on trucking companies in Nevada.

          “You’re creating a huge competitive disadvantage and you’re only basically punishing Nevada-based
          companies,” Hansen said.

          The measure passed on an 11-10 vote, with Sens. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) and Angie Taylor (D-
          Reno) joining Republicans in opposition.

          — Tabitha Mueller

          Democrats, Republicans cross party lines on AI, animal testing bills — 2:38 p.m.

          The Senate passed more than a dozen bills out of the chamber Tuesday, before recessing until 3:30


8 of 12                                                                                                       8/7/25, 1:34 PM

Live updates: Nevada Legislature’s ﬁrst house passage...           https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/live-updates-...


          p.m.

          Here’s a summary:

             • Sens. John Steinbeck (R-Las Vegas) and Lori Rogich (R-Las Vegas) crossed party lines to
                 support SB128, a bill that would ban certain health insurers from using arti�cial intelligence or
                 automated decision tools to deny or reduce requests for medical coverage approval. The
                 measure passed out of the Senate on a 15-6 vote. There were no statements made on the �oor
                 regarding the bill.
             • Members of the Senate voted to pass two of Sen. Melanie Scheible’s (D-Las Vegas) proposed
                 bills aimed at protecting animals and easing burdens on pet owners.
                     ◦ SB166 would ban insurers from refusing to issue, cancel or renew an insurance policy
                       based solely on whether someone owns a speci�c dog breed. The bill also requires
                       recipients of supportive housing grants to allow tenants to keep at least one pet. The
                       measure passed on a 14-7 vote, with Sen. John Ellison (R-Elko) the lone Republican in
                       support.
                     ◦ SB167 would ban the importation and sale of household cleaning products that have been
                       tested on animals. The ban would not apply to products that underwent animal testing
                       before Jan. 1, 2030. The measure passed on a vote of 17-4, with GOP Sens. Ellison,
                       Steinbeck, Rogich and Lisa Krasner (R-Reno) joining Democrats in support. There were
                       no speeches on the �oor.
             • SB113, a bill sponsored by Steinbeck that would make occupational therapists and physical
                 therapists eligible to provide a disability parking placard or license, in addition to physicians
                 and nurses, passed out of the Senate unanimously.
             • SB171, which would protect licensed health care providers in Nevada who o�er gender-
                 a�rming care to patients (including via telemedicine) from sanctions, prosecution or
                 investigation by other states. The bill passed out of the Senate along a party-line vote of 13-8,
                 with all Republicans opposed.
                     ◦ Sen. James Ohrenschall (D-Las Vegas) sponsored a similar bill in 2023 that was vetoed by
                       Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who said it would “inhibit the Executive Branch's ability
                       to be certain that all gender-a�rming care related to minors comports with State law.”
                     ◦ Ohrenschall said he narrowed the bill’s language this session to more closely align with a
                       reproductive rights shield law that Lombardo signed in 2023.

          Contraception access passes out of Assembly unanimously — 1:30 p.m.

          Assm. Selena Torres-Fossett’s (D-Las Vegas) AB176, which would generally ban the state or any of its
          agencies from limiting access to reproductive health care with some limited exceptions, passed out
          of the Assembly with unanimous support from Democrats and Republicans.




9 of 12                                                                                                      8/7/25, 1:34 PM

Live updates: Nevada Legislature’s ﬁrst house passage...            https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/live-updates-...


           The bill, also called the Right to Contraception and Family Planning Services Act, would protect
           services related to pregnancy, contraception, miscarriage, or in vitro fertilization. Notably, the bill
           does not apply to abortion-related laws or certain education-related policies — such as sex education
           — at public schools.

           Advocates said in a March hearing that the bill would help create more uniform policy across local
           agencies and that it could help protect access to contraception and IVF. It comes amid concerns that
           those services could be rolled back in other states, such as through proposals to require parental
           consent for minors getting contraception.

           The bill would make it so that if an individual does have their access to health care challenged, they
           can sue in court and seek appropriate relief, including attorney’s fees if they win.

           A similar bill was vetoed in 2023 by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who said that it “would
           e�ectively place any control over decisions related to reproductive care, �nancing, and education in
           the hands of today's state policy-makers instead of tomorrow's local o�cials.”

           The exemption of educational groups in the bill was added in response to the governor’s concern,
           according to Gabby Detrick, an intern who testi�ed with Torres-Fossett during the hearing.

           It was the only bill passed before the Assembly recessed until 1 p.m today.

           — Isabella Aldrete

           Few bills at risk of death — 1:20 p.m.

           Don’t expect the mass bill die-o� of the �rst deadline day, but a handful of measures appear at risk
           of meeting their demise on Tuesday.

           There are six bills that have been placed on the Senate secretary’s desk (a kind of bill purgatory) that
           will die if they are not voted out by the end of the day, including four that were originally set for a
           vote on Tuesday. The bills are:

               • SB24, brought by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health, which would recognize
                 emergency medical responders as prehospital medical providers to comply with federal law.
               • SB41, sponsored on behalf of the Department of Taxation, which requires that businesses
                 wishing to sell cannabis must apply for a cannabis tax permit and register for a sellers permit.
               • SB80, a proposal from the Department of Motor Vehicles to expand the responsibilities of
                 certain DMV employees to let them inspect vehicle characteristics to locate a stolen vehicle and
                 obtain a court order to use a trap and trace device, which identi�es phone numbers of incoming
                 messages. It requires a two-thirds majority vote.
               • SB152, proposed by Sen. James Ohrenschall (D-Las Vegas), which would allow a homeowners
                 association to install an electric vehicle charging station in a common area if a majority of
                 board members approve.



10 of 12                                                                                                      8/7/25, 1:34 PM

Live updates: Nevada Legislature’s ﬁrst house passage...            https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/live-updates-...


              • SB179, another bill from Ohrenschall, which would require the Nevada Equal Rights
                Commission to determine if antisemitism was a factor in a case of alleged discrimination in
                housing, employment or public accommodation.
              • SB191, sponsored by Sen. Skip Daly (D-Reno), which would add certain requirements to record
                and videotape court proceedings.

           Additionally, AJR12, a resolution supporting the prioritization of solar development on previously
           disturbed public lands in Nevada, is sitting idle on the Assembly clerk’s desk.

           But as the saying goes — it’s never over ‘til it’s over. The bills could be amended and passed out, or
           still receive a waiver or exemption from deadlines, the plans could change to vote on the proposals or
           their language could eventually be added to other bills.

           However, there might be more bills that do not receive a vote Tuesday. Stay tuned.

           — Eric Neugeboren

           Agendas show roughly 180 measures set for a vote — 11:31 a.m.

           About 180 measures across both chambers are on the list of what lawmakers will vote on today.

           More than 100 of those measures are in the Assembly, featuring bills that address topics including
           health care, housing and public safety. Though the Senate’s list is relatively shorter, that may not
           correlate with an earlier adjournment, as �oor speeches on bills can prolong the time.

           Here are some measures up for a vote in the Senate and Assembly that caught our attention:

              • AB44 - Sponsored by Attorney General Aaron Ford, this measure aims to implement a ban on
                price �xing for essential goods and services. The bill has received strong opposition from
                various businesses.
              • AB73 - Brought on behalf of Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, this measure would require
                political communications to disclose to the public if it was created using arti�cial intelligence
                to manipulate an image, video or audio.
              • AB280 - Assm. Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) introduced this measure that would require
                written rental agreements to disclose fees and tenants' rights. It also prohibits a landlord from
                collecting an application fee for running a credit report or background check, refund a
                prospective tenant’s application fee if the landlord rents to a di�erent tenant and cap rent
                increases at 5 percent annually for tenants who are 62 and older, or who rely on Social Security
                payments, for a year and a half starting in July.
              • AB205 - Sponsored by Assm. Heather Goulding (D-Reno), this measure would �ip Nevada’s
                long-standing policy requiring parents to consent or opt in for their children to receive sex
                education curriculum to instead opt out.
              • AB245 - Sponsored by Jauregui, this measure would ban Nevadans 21 and younger from owning

                semi-automatic shotguns and semi-automatic ri�es. Similarly, it prohibits children 14 and
                older from handling these guns as well.
              • AB283 - This measure from Assm. Max Carter (D-Las Vegas) would restructure the summary
                eviction process to require landlords to �le �rst rather than the tenant. It also requires more
                transparent noti�cation processes among other changes.
              • SB128 - Sponsored by Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) the bill would prohibit certain health
                insurers, including Medicaid, from using arti�cial intelligence or other automated decision
                tools to deny, modify or reduce prior authorization requests, or requests for medical approval.
              • SB171 - Proposed by Sen. James Ohrenschall (D-Las Vegas) this measure would protect health
                care providers licensed in Nevada who o�er gender-a�rming care to patients, including via
                telemedicine. Speci�cally, it would prevent another state from sanctioning or prosecuting a
                provider in Nevada who o�ers legal, ethical and medically necessary gender-a�rming care to
                patients.
              • SB305 - Brought by Sen. Fabian Doñate (D-Las Vegas), this bill as amended would allow the
                Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association to adopt and post regulations that provide a
                process for establishing lacrosse as a sanctioned sport.

           There are also at least three measures from this session whose fate is unclear, as they have been
           relegated to either the chief clerk’s desk in the Assembly or the secretary’s desk in the Senate.
