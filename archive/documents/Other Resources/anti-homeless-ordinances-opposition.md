# Reno Sparks Tenants Oppose 'Anti-Homeless' Ordinances at Reno City Council Meeting

On August 26th, members of the Reno Sparks Tenants Union joined dozens of community advocates at a packed Reno City Council meeting to oppose a package of ordinances targeting people experiencing homelessness.

## The Proposed Ordinances

The city council considered several punitive measures that would:

### Expand "No Camping" Zones
- Broaden areas where unsheltered people cannot rest or sleep
- Include all public property within 1,000 feet of schools and parks
- Create moving violations with fines up to $1,000
- Allow immediate confiscation of personal belongings

### Restrict "Loitering" in Business Districts
- Make it illegal to sit or lie down in downtown areas
- Prohibit asking for assistance or donations
- Create subjective enforcement based on "intent to solicit"
- Impose escalating fines and potential jail time

### Increase Enforcement Powers
- Expand police authority to conduct searches and seizures
- Allow immediate removal of tents and temporary shelters
- Create fast-track court proceedings for violations
- Authorize destruction of confiscated property after 30 days

## Why RSTU Opposes These Measures

As a tenants union, RSTU recognizes that homelessness and housing insecurity are part of the same crisis. Today's homeless population includes yesterday's renters who were displaced by:

### Evictions and Displacement
- No-cause evictions that push families onto the streets
- Rent increases that force impossible choices
- Discrimination against tenants with past evictions
- Destruction of affordable housing for luxury development

### Systemic Housing Failures
- Inadequate affordable housing supply
- Waiting lists for assistance programs
- Insufficient mental health and addiction services
- Lack of transitional and supportive housing

### Economic Inequality
- Wages that haven't kept pace with housing costs
- Medical debt that destroys family finances
- Job loss due to illness or injury
- Domestic violence that forces people to flee unsafe housing

## Our Testimony at City Council

RSTU member Maria Santos addressed the council:

> "I'm here as someone who was almost homeless myself. Three years ago, my landlord raised my rent by $400 in one month. I had to choose between paying rent and buying medication for my daughter's asthma. We stayed in my car for two weeks while I found a new place we could afford.
>
> These ordinances would have made our situation even worse. Instead of helping people get housed, you're making it illegal to exist without housing. That's not a solution – that's cruelty."

RSTU organizer David Chen testified:

> "Housing is a human right, not a privilege. Every person sleeping outside tonight represents a failure of our housing system, not a personal moral failure. If you want to address homelessness, invest in affordable housing, tenant protections, and social services – not in criminalizing poverty."

## The Broader Context

### National Trend of Criminalization
Reno's proposed ordinances are part of a national trend of cities criminalizing homelessness rather than addressing root causes:
- **Over 200 cities** have passed "camping bans" since 2020
- **Fines and jail time** trap people in cycles of poverty
- **Property confiscation** destroys what little people have
- **Criminal records** make it harder to find housing and employment

### Local Housing Crisis Connections
The same forces driving Reno's housing crisis contribute to homelessness:
- **Corporate speculation** in housing markets
- **Luxury development** without affordable requirements
- **Weak tenant protections** allowing easy evictions
- **Insufficient public investment** in housing and services

### False Solutions
Criminalization doesn't reduce homelessness – it just moves people around and makes their lives harder:
- **Studies show** camping bans don't reduce unsheltered populations
- **Arrests and fines** waste taxpayer money without solving problems
- **Property confiscation** destroys identification, medication, and survival supplies
- **Criminal records** create additional barriers to housing

## Community Coalition Response

RSTU joined a broad coalition opposing the ordinances:

### Coalition Partners
- **Northern Nevada Legal Aid** providing legal representation
- **Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada (PLAN)** organizing community response
- **Washoe County Democratic Party** opposing criminalization
- **Faith communities** calling for compassionate solutions
- **Social service providers** warning of increased harm

### Unified Message
- Housing and social services, not criminalization
- Investment in root causes, not punishment of symptoms
- Dignity and human rights for all community members
- Evidence-based solutions that actually work

## Alternative Solutions RSTU Supports

Instead of criminalizing homelessness, we advocate for:

### Housing-First Approaches
- **Rapid rehousing** programs that get people into permanent housing quickly
- **Supportive housing** with wraparound services
- **Tiny home villages** as transitional solutions
- **Conversion** of vacant buildings to emergency housing

### Tenant Protection Policies
- **Just cause eviction** requirements to prevent displacement
- **Rent stabilization** to keep housing affordable
- **Right to counsel** in eviction proceedings
- **Emergency rental assistance** for families in crisis

### Public Investment
- **Affordable housing development** at scale
- **Mental health and addiction services** 
- **Job training and placement** programs
- **Childcare and family support** services

### Systemic Changes
- **Living wage** requirements for all workers
- **Healthcare access** including mental health coverage
- **Criminal justice reform** to reduce barriers to housing
- **Anti-speculation** measures to cool housing markets

## Council Meeting Outcome

Despite strong community opposition, the council voted 4-3 to advance the ordinances to a second reading. However, the organized community response achieved important victories:

### Amendments Secured
- **Reduced fine amounts** from $1,000 to $500 maximum
- **30-day notice** before property destruction (up from 10 days)
- **Exception process** for people waiting for services
- **Requirement for city staff** to offer services before citing

### Ongoing Organizing
- **Community organizing** continues for second reading
- **Legal challenges** being prepared by advocates
- **Media attention** highlighting opposition
- **Voter engagement** around council elections

## The Connection to Tenant Organizing

RSTU's involvement in opposing anti-homeless ordinances reflects our understanding that:

### Housing Justice is Indivisible
We can't fight for tenant rights while ignoring the rights of unhoused community members. The same systems that exploit tenants abandon people experiencing homelessness.

### Today's Tenants, Tomorrow's Unhoused
Without strong tenant protections, any renter is just one rent increase, job loss, or medical emergency away from homelessness.

### Community Solidarity
Building a movement for housing justice requires standing with all people affected by the housing crisis, regardless of their current housing status.

### Systemic Solutions
Real solutions to homelessness and housing insecurity require changing the systems that prioritize profit over people.

## Looking Forward

The fight against these ordinances is part of a broader struggle for housing justice in Reno. RSTU will continue to:

- **Oppose criminalization** of poverty and homelessness
- **Advocate for systemic solutions** to housing insecurity
- **Build coalitions** across affected communities
- **Organize tenants** to prevent displacement and homelessness
- **Push for policies** that create affordable housing at scale
