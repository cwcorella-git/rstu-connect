                       corporate landlords (and the taxes they
                                  do or don’t pay)?
                                      A Nevada assemblywoman aims to �nd out
                                     BY: APRIL CORBIN GIRNUS - APRIL 17, 2023              5:00 AM

                      Real Estate Investment Trusts are singled out for an exemption in the state commerce
                     tax. “My issue is equity,” says Assemblywoman Venicia Considine. “It is unfair for landlords of
                     businesses in group A to pay the commerce tax but not group B.” (Getty Images)




                                                            
                     If you are a renter, who owns your home? Who owns the advertising
                     billboard you pass everyday on your commute to work? Who owns
                     the casino where the event advertised on that billboard is
                     happening? Who owns the o�ce complex where you work?

                     Increasingly, the answer in Nevada is a real estate investment trust,
                     or REIT.

                     REITs are companies that own income-producing real estate,
                     typically through rent payments but also through interest on
                     mortgages they �nance. Similar to mutual funds, REITs are required
                     to payout most of their income as dividends to their shareholders,
                     of which there typically must be at least 100.

                     Megadeals involving Las Vegas Strip properties are the most high-
                     pro�le example of REITs making their mark in Nevada, but REITs
                     are not limited to any one industry. Nationally, they have received
                     the most attention for buying up signi�cant swaths of single-family
                     homes and rental units, which critics say drives up the mortgages
                     and rents for non-investors who are simply looking to buy and live
                     in a home.

                     Assemblywoman Venicia Considine (D-Las Vegas) wants Nevada to
                     start a conversation about REITs — not just about their in�uence in
                     key industries like housing, but also about the state’s approach to
                     taxing them.

                     At the federal level, REITs are sheltered from paying corporate
                     income tax because their earnings are distributed to shareholders as
                     dividends. For shareholders, the majority of those dividends are
                     taxed as ordinary income, though some fall under capital gains,
                     according to Nareit, the National Association of REITs.

                     Michael Mazerov, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and
                     Policy Priorities, said exempting REITs from corporate tax is
                     understandable at the federal level because that revenue is still
                     captured from individuals as part of income tax.

                     “States generally cannot do that,” said Mazerov, because most REIT
                     shareholders will be located in other states. “It doesn’t make sense
                     for any state, in my opinion, to conform to federal REIT status.”

                     A few states have tackled REITs at their level.

                     New Hampshire is one of them. The Granite State, which has no
                     personal income tax but does have a corporate income tax, does not
                     exempt REITs from its corporate income tax.

                     Various Hawaii legislators, driven by the realization that their hotels
                     and retail centers were owned by REITs on the mainland, in recent
                     years have attempted to adjust the state’s tax structure for REITs.
                     But those e�orts were derailed in the legislature or vetoed by the
                     governor.

                     Nevada with its conspicuous lack of both corporate and personal
                     income tax doesn’t have that obvious avenue before it.

                     A curious commerce tax exemption
                     Considine is sponsoring Assembly Bill 345, which would remove

                     from the commerce tax statute an exemption for REITs. That
                     exemption was written into the 2015 bill, championed by then-
                     Gov. Brian Sandoval, authorizing the commerce tax, which for real
                     estate businesses is a quarter of a percent on all gross revenue above
                     $4 million.

                     Considine, who is serving her second term in the Legislature, told
                     the Assembly Committee on Revenue during a March 30 hearing
                     that she could not �nd any legislative record explaining why the
                     exemption was included.

                     “My issue is equity,” she told the committee, which she co-chairs. “It
                     is unfair for landlords of businesses in group A to pay the commerce
                     tax but not group B.”

                     That sentiment aside, it is unclear whether that is actually
                     happening, because the wording of the existing statute suggests it
                     applies only to REITs without direct holdings. Put another way,
                     there’s an exemption to the exemption, and most REIT activity
                     would appear to fall under the non-exempted category.

                     “I’ve been told they do pay commerce tax,” Considine
                     acknowledged in an interview with the Current. “I think it’s a
                     tangled web. I really want us to dive into it and pull the strings,
                     untie the knot.”

                     The way she sees it, if the REIT commerce tax exemption is largely
                     moot, there should be no issue with her proposal to simply remove
                     it altogether.

                     “In the big picture, I really thought having this bill would have
                     people crawling out of the woodwork,” added Considine. “The
                     almost complete silence on this bill just adds to the layers of
                     confusion.”

                     The Nevada Department of Taxation did not respond to requests
                     for details on which REITs are exempted from the commerce tax.

                     More than anything, she wants to start a conversation about REITs.

                                                                  “Let’s put it out there
                                                                  and see the bene�t of the
                                                                  exemption. If there is no
                                                                  bene�t, then why is it in
                                                                  there? How is it a�ecting
                                                                  our state, our tax base

                     Assemblywoman Venicia Considine.
                                                                               conversation. State

                     Danielle Gallant (R-Las Vegas), a real estate broker, thanked
                     Considine for introducing the bill and said REITs are pushing
                     Nevadans out of the real estate market.

                     “They are making it harder for people to get into their �rst or
                     second homes,” she said.

                     The revenue panel passed AB 345 out of committee on Tuesday.
                     Three of the committee’s four Republicans voted in opposition.
                     Gallant voted for the motion but noted that she and Considine were
                     “working on some possible amendments to make it more palatable,
                     so to speak.”

                     A much more obvious tax loophole
                     REITs have been a major bene�ciary of a tax loophole that Nevada
                     lawmakers are considering closing this session.

                     That loophole involves the real estate transfer tax and an existing
                     exemption for deals involving transfers of property from one owner
                     to a subsidiary. A Las Vegas Review-Journal investigation last year
                     found that since 2007 at least $27.5 billion worth of transactions —
                     most of them on or near the Strip, and many involving real estate
                     investment trusts — avoiding paying the real estate transfer tax.
                     Essentially, instead of selling a property to a buyer directly, a
                     company would transfer their property to a newly formed
                     subsidiary, qualifying them for the real estate transfer tax
                     exemption, then the second company would purchase the
                     subsidiary.

                     Considine introduced a bill, Assembly Bill 450, to close that
                     loophole. Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager and Assemblywoman

                     Sandra Jauragui independently introduced a similar bill, Assembly
                     Bill 448.

                     “I don’t think anyone is violating the law,” Yeager emphasized
                     Thursday in an Assembly Revenue hearing for his bill. “I think
                     there is a loophole.”

                     The real estate transfer tax helps fund a�ordable housing trusts, the
                     building of new schools in Clark County and general funds for the
                     state and Washoe and Churchill counties.

                     According to Yeager, the real estate transfer tax generated $248.6
                     million in �scal year 2021. That included $44 million to fund
                     capital projects within Clark County School District and $10.4
                     million for a�ordable housing.

                     “When transfer tax isn’t paid, that’s a real hit. Not just to the general
                     fund that we care about in this building but to school districts and
                     a�ordable housing.”

                     Nevada and REITs
                     Considine in her commerce tax presentation did not single out any
                     single REIT or economic industry, but there is a clear indication
                     that Nevada has welcomed REITs with open arms: the real estate
                     investment trusts that control a signi�cant portion of the largest
                     properties on the Las Vegas Strip.

                     Caesars Entertainment announced its intent to form a REIT in
                     2014 SEC �lings amid its complicated bankruptcy proceedings.
                     The bankruptcy, completed in 2017, resulted in Caesars spinning
                     its physical assets o� to an independent, newly formed REIT named
                     VICI Properties.

                     Meanwhile, MGM Resorts announced the formation of its own
                     REIT, MGM Growth Properties, in October 2015.

                     Late last year, VICI
                     acquired MGM Growth
                     Properties for $17.2
                     billion, making it the
                     Strip’s biggest landlord.

                     That MGM-VICI deal
                     was reported to include
                     $860 million in annual

                     then between 2% and 3%
                     annually depending on the consumer price index thereafter.

                     Considine told the Current that those deals did not motivate her to
                     introduce her commerce tax bill. During the hearing for AB 345,
                     she did not mention VICI or any of the major REIT deals in recent
                     years.

                     “That wasn’t my focus,” she said. “I didn’t want anyone to think it
                     was about those properties — the big Strip things. It is about the
                     entire state.”

                     Considine, an attorney whose legal career started with doing
                     foreclosure work at the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada in the
                     immediate aftermath of the housing bubble burst, said her heart is
                     in addressing rental issues.

                     “I’m very worried about housing,” she said. “If they are buying up
                     our communities and making them rentals instead of allowing for
                     the American Dream, then that’s really what I would like to know
                     more about.”

                     Considine said REITs are becoming increasingly active, with one
                     REIT-owned master-planned community being designed
                     speci�cally for rentals. She isn’t the only lawmaker concerned. State
                     Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas) independently has introduced
                     Senate Bill 395 to require corporate investors, including REITs, to
                     register with the Nevada Secretary of State’s Securities Division.
                     That bill would also restrict their purchasing ability to 1,000
                     properties per year.

                     Corporate investors bought a quarter of all single-family homes
                     nationwide in 2021. In Nevada, investor purchases climbed from
                     18% in 2020 to 30%, according to a Stateline analysis. Only two
                     states — Georgia and Arizona — saw more action from investors.

                     REITs own 7,937 properties across Nevada, totalling $78.02 billion
                     in property value, according to Nareit. Those properties include
                     more than 4,600 single-family rentals, 1,100 cell towers, 153
                     industrial centers, 149 retail centers and 82 health care facilities.
