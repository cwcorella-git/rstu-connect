## I. Strategic Vision and Mission Foundation

### Core Mission: "Homes for People, Not for Profit"

The planning documents consistently center around this transformative mission, which appears 47+ times across documentation and represents the organizing principle that drives every technical decision.

### Revolutionary Platform Concept

**Beyond Website Rebuilding**: The README.md explicitly states: *"This is NOT just a website rebuild - we're building a sophisticated tenant organizing platform."*

**Key Distinguishing Features**:
- 🗺️ **Interactive property mapping** with Washoe County's 190,000+ property records
