# RSTU Partners with Nevada Housing Justice Alliance to Lobby for Housing Reform

The Reno Sparks Tenants Union is proud to announce our partnership with the Nevada Housing Justice Alliance (NHJA), a statewide coalition working to address Nevada's housing crisis through policy reform and grassroots organizing.

## About the Nevada Housing Justice Alliance

The NHJA brings together tenant organizations, housing advocates, legal aid providers, and community groups from across Nevada to fight for housing justice at the state level. Founded in 2024, the alliance recognizes that local organizing must be connected to statewide policy change to create lasting solutions.

### Coalition Members Include:
- Reno Sparks Tenants Union
- Las Vegas Tenants Union  
- Nevada Legal Aid
- Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada (PLAN)
- Make the Road Nevada
- Faith Organizing Alliance
- Culinary Workers Union Local 226

## Why Statewide Action Matters

While local organizing builds power in our communities, many of the barriers to housing justice exist at the state level:

### Preemption Laws
Nevada state law currently prevents local governments from enacting many tenant protections, including:
- Rent stabilization policies
- Just cause eviction requirements
- Stronger security deposit protections
- Mobile home park tenant rights

### State Housing Policy
Key decisions about housing funding, tenant rights, and development policy happen in Carson City, affecting all Nevada communities.

### Corporate Influence
Large landlord and developer interests lobby heavily at the state level to prevent tenant protections and affordable housing requirements.

## 2025 Legislative Priorities

The NHJA is pushing for comprehensive housing reform in the upcoming legislative session:

### Tenant Protection Bills

**Just Cause Eviction Protection**
- Require legitimate reasons for evictions
- End arbitrary and retaliatory evictions
- Provide due process protections

**Rent Stabilization Authorization**

- Maintain housing stability in communities

**Security Deposit Reform**
