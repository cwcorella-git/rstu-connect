The Honorable Nicole Cannizzaro
Majority Leader of the Nevada State Senate
Nevada Legislature
401 South Carson Street
Carson City, Nevada 89701

       Re:    Senate Bill 171 of the 82nd Legislative Session

Dear Leader Cannizzaro:

I am forwarding to you, for filing within the time limit set forth in the Nevada Constitution
and without my approval, Senate Bill 171 (SB 171), which is titled as follows:

              AN ACT relating to crimes; prohibiting the purchase,
              possession or ownership of a firearm by a person who has
              been convicted of committing or attempting to commit a crime
              motivated by certain characteristics of the victim; and
              providing other matters properly relating thereto.


SB 171 purportedly furthers the important objective of decreasing gun violence among
those convicted of hate crimes. Certainly, those who have committed a violent or property
crime motivated by a hateful animus based on their victim’s race, sex, religion, gender
identity, or other protected characteristic should face heightened scrutiny relating to their
gun ownership. In fact, under existing law, even low level misdemeanor crimes such as
simple theft are prosecuted as gross misdemeanors when the crimes are committed in
furtherance of hate. Upon conviction, jail time and/or fines are effectively doubled as a
result of the enhancement.

When it comes to these types of misdemeanor crimes, SB 171 would go much further
than existing law by depriving individuals of their Second Amendment right to bear arms.
Moreover, the limited nexus between certain misdemeanor offenses and gun violence
makes it untenable to pass a law that immediately puts the defendant’s Second

Amendment rights in jeopardy. This would effectively open the door to more laws
restricting others convicted of gross misdemeanors from owning firearms to protect their
homes and families. Many of the more violent and egregious offenses under Nevada law
that are commonly associated with hate crimes can and should be prosecuted as felonies
in the first place, especially when there is a connection between the underlying crime and
the use of guns. It is a better solution to make these types of hate crimes felonies than
to further penalize low-level offenders – especially when existing law sufficiently
addresses the issue.


For these reasons, I veto this bill and return it without my signature or approval.


                                          Respectfully submitted,



                                          Joe Lombardo
                                          Governor

Enclosure
