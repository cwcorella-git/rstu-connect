# Northern Nevada Legal Aid: Supporting Housing Security in Reno

Legal aid organizations play a crucial role in protecting tenant rights and ensuring housing security for our community members. Northern Nevada Legal Aid (NNLA) stands as one of our most important allies in the fight for housing justice.

## What Northern Nevada Legal Aid Does

NNLA provides **free legal services** to low-income residents of Northern Nevada, with housing issues being one of their primary focus areas. Their services include:

### Direct Legal Representation
- **Eviction defense** in Justice Court
- **Habitability cases** against negligent landlords
- **Security deposit recovery** assistance
- **Discrimination complaints** under fair housing laws

### Education and Prevention
- **Know Your Rights** workshops (offered in English and Spanish)
- **Legal clinics** for quick consultations
- **Resource materials** explaining Nevada tenant law
- **Community presentations** at apartment complexes and community centers

## Success Stories

### The Meadowbrook Victory
Last year, NNLA represented 23 families at Meadowbrook Apartments when the corporate owner tried to evict everyone for "renovations" – really gentrification. Through legal action and community organizing, **all families were able to stay** and the landlord was required to make actual improvements to the property.

### Stopping Illegal Rent Increases
NNLA has helped hundreds of tenants challenge illegal rent increases. In Nevada, landlords must provide proper notice and cannot increase rent during the lease term without tenant agreement. Many corporate landlords count on tenants not knowing these rights.

## How NNLA and RSTU Work Together

Our partnership with Northern Nevada Legal Aid creates a powerful combination:

### RSTU Provides:
- **Community organizing** to build tenant power
- **Education** about rights and resources
- **Mutual aid** for immediate needs
- **Collective action** on housing policy

### NNLA Provides:
- **Legal expertise** on tenant rights
- **Court representation** for members
- **Policy analysis** on proposed legislation
- **Training** for RSTU organizers on legal issues

## Getting Help from NNLA

### Who Qualifies
NNLA serves residents whose income is at or below **125% of Federal Poverty Guidelines**. For 2025, this means:
- Individual: $18,900 annually
- Family of 2: $25,500 annually  
- Family of 4: $38,750 annually

### How to Apply
**Call their intake line: (775) 284-3491**

Best times to call:
- Monday-Friday, 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- Monday-Friday, 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM

### What to Bring
When you meet with NNLA, bring:
- **Lease agreement** (or any rental paperwork you have)
- **Notice to quit** or eviction papers (if applicable)
- **Photos** of housing problems
- **Communication** with your landlord (texts, emails, letters)
- **Proof of income** and household size
- **Payment records** (receipts, bank statements showing rent payments)

## Emergency Situations

If you receive an **eviction notice** or **notice to quit**, contact NNLA immediately. You typically have **only 7 days** to respond to formal eviction proceedings.

**Don't wait** – even if you think you might not qualify for services, call anyway. NNLA can often provide brief advice or referrals even when they can't take your full case.

## Beyond Individual Cases: Policy Impact

NNLA doesn't just help individual tenants – they work on **systemic change**:

- **Legislative advocacy** for stronger tenant protections
- **Policy research** on housing issues
- **Coalition building** with organizations like RSTU
- **Training** other advocates and organizers

## Language Access

All NNLA services are available in **Spanish**, and they can arrange interpretation in other languages as needed. Don't let language barriers prevent you from getting help.

## The Bigger Picture

Legal aid is essential, but it's not enough alone. **Individual legal cases** help people keep their homes, but **collective organizing** changes the systems that create housing insecurity in the first place.

That's why NNLA and RSTU work so well together – we're fighting the same fight from different angles:
- **Legal aid** keeps families housed today
- **Tenant organizing** builds power to prevent displacement tomorrow

## How You Can Support

Even if you don't need NNLA's services right now, you can support their work:

### Spread the Word
- Share NNLA's contact information with neighbors who need help
- Attend their community education events
- Follow them on social media and share their resources

### Volunteer
NNLA uses community volunteers for:
- **Court support** (accompanying tenants to hearings)
- **Translation** at community events
- **Outreach** at apartment complexes
- **Administrative support** 

### Advocate
Support increased funding for legal aid:
- Contact county commissioners about funding
- Support state legislation that increases access to justice
- Vote for candidates who prioritize tenant rights

## Working Together for Housing Justice

The partnership between Northern Nevada Legal Aid and RSTU shows what's possible when legal advocacy and community organizing work together. 

**Individual rights + collective power = lasting change**

Whether you need immediate legal help or want to join the broader fight for housing justice, our community has the resources and the power to win.
