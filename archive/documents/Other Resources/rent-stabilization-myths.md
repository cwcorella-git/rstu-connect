# Rent Stabilization MYTHS Nevada Realtors Want YOU to Believe

As housing costs skyrocket in Reno and across Nevada, more tenants are calling for rent stabilization policies to protect them from devastating rent increases. But real estate interests and their allies are spreading myths to prevent these common-sense protections.

Let's set the record straight.

## Myth #1: "Rent Control Reduces Housing Supply"

**The Reality**: Well-designed rent stabilization policies don't reduce housing supply. Studies show that moderate rent increase limits (like 5-7% annually) have minimal impact on new construction while providing crucial stability for existing tenants.

**What they don't tell you**: 
- Most rent stabilization proposals include exemptions for new construction
- The real barrier to housing supply is restrictive zoning, not tenant protections
- Corporate landlords artificially restrict supply to drive up rents

## Myth #2: "Rent Control Hurts Low-Income Tenants"

**The Reality**: Rent stabilization helps low-income tenants the most by preventing displacement and providing housing stability. Without protections, low-income families are the first to be priced out of their communities.

**What they don't tell you**:
- Displacement destroys communities and forces families to move far from jobs and schools
- "Market rate" housing is increasingly unaffordable for working families
- Rent stabilization can be combined with other policies to increase affordable housing

## Myth #3: "Rent Control Creates Housing Shortages"

**The Reality**: Housing shortages in Nevada are caused by decades of under-investment in affordable housing, not tenant protections. Cities with rent stabilization often have robust rental markets.

**What they don't tell you**:
- Corporate ownership and speculation drive artificial scarcity
- Luxury development doesn't address workforce housing needs
- Many cities with rent stabilization have healthy rental markets

## Myth #4: "Property Owners Can't Maintain Buildings with Rent Control"

**The Reality**: Rent stabilization policies typically allow for additional increases for capital improvements and necessary maintenance. Property owners can still make reasonable profits while providing safe, habitable housing.

**What they don't tell you**:
- Landlords are already required by law to maintain habitable conditions
- Many rent stabilization policies include provisions for improvement costs
- Corporate landlords often defer maintenance to maximize profits regardless of rent levels

## Myth #5: "Free Market Solutions Work Better"

**The Reality**: The "free market" in housing is heavily subsidized and regulated to benefit property owners. True free market solutions would eliminate:
- Mortgage interest deductions for investors
- Depreciation allowances for rental properties  
- Zoning restrictions that limit housing types
- Corporate ownership of single-family homes

**What they don't tell you**:
- Real estate markets are already heavily regulated in favor of property owners
- "Market rate" often means whatever landlords can get away with charging
- Other countries successfully use rent stabilization as part of comprehensive housing policy

## The Truth About Rent Stabilization

Effective rent stabilization policies:

### Provide Stability
- Families can budget and plan for the future
- Children can stay in the same schools
- Communities remain intact

### Allow Reasonable Returns
- Property owners can still increase rents annually
- Additional increases allowed for improvements
- Properties remain profitable investments

### Can Be Part of Comprehensive Solutions
- Combined with affordable housing development
- Paired with anti-speculation measures
- Integrated with tenant protection policies

## Real Solutions Nevada Needs

Instead of spreading myths, we should focus on real solutions:

### Immediate Protections
- Reasonable annual rent increase limits (5-7%)
- Just cause eviction protections
- Stronger anti-retaliation enforcement
- Right to organize without interference

### Long-term Housing Strategy
- Massive investment in public and social housing
- Community land trusts and cooperative ownership
- Speculation taxes on corporate ownership
- Inclusionary zoning requirements

### Support for Both Tenants and Small Landlords
- Rental assistance and mediation programs
- Property tax relief for small property owners who follow rent guidelines
- Support for tenant-owned cooperative conversions

## Who Benefits from the Status Quo?

The loudest opponents of rent stabilization are:
- **Corporate landlords** who profit from displacement and gentrification
- **Real estate investors** who speculate on housing price increases
- **Property management companies** who charge fees based on rent levels
- **Realtors** who earn commissions on high-priced sales

They spend millions on lobbying and misleading campaigns because tenant protections threaten their profits, not because they care about housing supply or tenant welfare.

## What You Can Do

### Educate Yourself
- Research successful rent stabilization policies in other cities
- Attend city council and county commission meetings
- Learn about your current tenant rights

### Get Organized
- Join the Reno Sparks Tenants Union
- Talk to your neighbors about housing issues
- Form a tenants association in your building

### Advocate for Change
- Contact elected officials about rent stabilization
- Support candidates who prioritize tenant protections
- Participate in public comment at government meetings

### Build Power
- Connect tenant organizing to broader housing justice movements
- Support policies that address root causes of housing crisis
- Challenge corporate control of housing policy

## The Bottom Line

Rent stabilization works when it's part of a comprehensive approach to housing justice. The myths spread by real estate interests are designed to protect their profits at the expense of working families.

Don't let them fool you. Housing is a human right, not a commodity for speculation.
