                Federal land policy involves the ownership and
                management of land owned by the federal government. As of
                2012, the federal government owned between 635 million to
                640 million acres, or 28 percent, of the 2.27 billion acres of land
                in the United States. Federal land is managed for many
                purposes, such as the conservation and development of
                natural resources, grazing and recreation. As of 2012, the
                federal government owned 81.07 percent of Nevada's
                total land, 56,961,778 acres out of 70,264,320 total
                acres.

                 Nevada ranked second in the nation in federal land ownership
                                                  as of 2012.

                million acres of land in 2012 (about 28 percent) of the 2.27
                billion acres of land in the United States. Around 52 percent of
                federally owned acres were in 12 Western states—including
                Alaska, 61 percent of which was federally owned. In contrast,
                the federal government owned 4 percent of land in the other
                38 states. Federal land policy is designed to manage minerals,
                oil and gas resources, timber, wildlife and fish, and other
                natural resources found on federal land. Land management
                policies are highly debated for their economic, environmental
                and social impacts. Additionally, the size of the federal estate
                and the acquisition of more federal land are major issues.[1][2]

                According to the Congressional Research Service, Nevada
                spans 70.2 million acres. Of that total, 81.1 percent, or 56.9
                million acres, belonged to the federal government as of 2012.
                More than 13 million acres in Nevada are not owned by the
                federal government, or 4.82 non-federal acres per capita. From
                1990 to 2010, the federal government's land ownership in
                Nevada decreased by 3.05 million acres.[1]

                The table below shows federal land ownership in Nevada
                compared to a neighboring state, Utah, and a New England
                state, Connecticut.

                National parks in Nevada




                Federal lands and Indian reservations in the state of Nevada by
                government agency (click the image to enlarge).

                Nevada has three National Park Service units, 372 national
                historic sites, three national historic trails, one national forest,
                and one national recreation area. There are 23 state parks in
                Nevada managed by the Nevada Division of State Parks, a
                division of the Department of Conservation and Natural
                Resources.[3][4] A study by the U.S. National Park Service found
                that 4.8 million visitors attended Nevada's national parks and
                monuments and generated $200.3 million in visitor spending
                in 2013.[5]

                Economic activity on federal lands

                Oil and gas permits

                            See also: BLM oil and gas leases by state

                Private mining companies, including oil and natural gas
                companies, can apply for leases from the U.S. Bureau of Land
                Management (BLM) to explore and produce energy on federal
                land. The company seeking a lease must nominate the land for
                oil and gas exploration to the BLM, which evaluates and
                approves the lease. The BLM State Offices make leasing
                decisions based on its land use plans, which contain
                information on the land's resources and the potential
                environmental impact of oil or gas exploration. If federal lands
                are approved for leasing, the BLM requires an application from
                the company containing information on how the exploration,
                drilling and production will be conducted. Afterward, the BLM
                will produce an environmental analysis and a list of
                requirements before work on the land can begin. The agency
                also inspects the companies' drilling and producing on the
                leased lands.[6]

                In 2013, the total number of active leases on federal lands was
                47,427, which covers 36.09 million acres of land. Of that total,
                1,881 leases (3.9 percent of all leases), covering 3.732 million
                acres (10.3 percent of all leased land in 2013), were in Nevada.
                In 2013, out of 3,770 new drilling leases approved nationwide
                by the BLM for oil and gas exploration, 7 leases (0.01 percent)
                were in Nevada.[7][8][9][10][11]

                The table below shows how Nevada compared to neighboring
                states in oil and gas permits on BLM-managed lands in 2013.
                Nevada had more active leases and acres under lease than
                Arizona and California but fewer than Utah.

                Sheep grazing on BLM lands in Worland, Wyoming in 1940

                The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requires grazing
                permits for any animals grazing on their lands. Grazing occurs
                on different kinds of land. One kind is "base property," which
                the BLM identifies as a "preferred" property for grazing. This
                base property can be private or public property. For grazing on
                public property, applicants must receive a state land lease.
                Holding a grazing permit requires the applicant to own or
                control the property used for grazing. The applicant may also
                offer other privately owned property used for grazing by
                submitting a separate application. The terms and conditions in
                a grazing permit control how livestock must be used on BLM
                lands. The BLM processes the applications and will provide a
                grazing permit if BLM requirements are met.[12]

                Below is a table breaking down BLM grazing activity in Nevada.

                            See also: Payments in lieu of taxes

                Federal payments to local governments are called "Payments
                in Lieu of Taxes" (PILTs), which are annual payments that offset
                property tax losses because federal lands within the state are
                non-taxable. PILTs go to local governments to fund local
                services like fire departments, police protection, school
                construction and roads. These federal lands include lands
                managed by the Bureau of Land Management, the National
                Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and others.[14]

                The table below shows PILTs for Nevada compared to
                neighboring states. In 2013, Nevada received the fewest PILTs
                compared to neighboring states.
