Abolish Rent
“Rent is a fundamental engine of inequality and injustice, a transfer of wealth from
the poorest to the richest, the most vulnerable to the least, which drives millions
into debt and despair and onto the streets. From the perspective of tenants, the
answer to the housing crisis is as simple as it is revolutionary: a world without
landlords and a world without rent.” p.29




Sylvia Rivera quotes


“Marsha and I fought a lot for the liberation of our people. We did a lot
back then. Marsha and I had a building on Second Street, which is called
STAR House… And now we were taking care of kids that were younger than
us. I mean, Marsha and I were young and we were taking care of them… I
mean, we took a building that was, I mean, a slum building. We tried. We
really did. We went out and made that money off the streets to keep these
kids off the street.”
 — Sylvia Rivera, in an interview

“Marsha and I had always sneaked people into our hotel rooms. Marsha and
I decided to get a building. We were trying to get away from the Mafia’s
control at the bars. We got a building at 213 East 2nd Street. Marsha and I
just decided it was time to help each other and help our other kids. We fed
people and clothed people. We kept the building going. We went out and
hustled the streets. We paid the rent. We didn’t want the kids out in the
streets hustling. They would go out and rip off food. There was always food
in the house and everyone had fun. It lasted for two or three years.”
 — Sylvia Rivera, in an interview

Black Panther Party 10 point plan
4. We want decent housing, fit for the shelter of human beings.

We believe that if the landlords will not give decent housing to our Black and
oppressed communities, then the housing and the land should be made into
cooperatives so that the people in our communities, with government aid, can
build and make decent housing for the people.

10 point plan program, 50 years later
In 1966, Newton stated in a speech: “It’s a simple human need, to have a roof
over your head when the hard rain fall.” Newton’s lawyer, Paul Harris, attended the
anniversary conference, and he said housing is one of the Black Panther Party’s
most important points, even today.

“I think the more important rights that need to be worked on now for people of
color and for working people are the right to a job and the right to housing. And
both of those are in the ten-point program,” Harris said.

“That’s not because of discrimination as we know it. That’s not because of covert
discrimination,” he continued, referring to the fact that the Black population of
Oakland has shrunk since 1966.

He said the housing issue for Blacks living in Oakland today is different than it
was in 1966, because people aren’t being pushed out because of the way they
look. Now, he said, they’re pushed out according to their income. The cost of living

has increased for everyone, but the economic gap between Blacks and whites
remains just as high as it was in 1966, with unemployment rates of Blacks double
that of whites.

“It’s because of capitalism. It’s because of economics. Economics have made it
impossible for families, working families and lower-economic families to live in
San Francisco and I think the same thing’s happening in Oakland,” Harris said.




White Panther Party 10 point plan
6 - We want to free all structures from corporate rule and turn the buildings over
to the people at once!

10 - We want free land, free food, free shelter, free clothing, free music, free
medical care, free education, free media, EVERYTHING FREE FOR EVERYBODY!

1 and 3 also seem somewhat relevant
