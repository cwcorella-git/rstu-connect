Abstract

  The impact of federal land ownership and management is a particularly contentious issue in the Western United States. Perhaps
most signicantly impacted is the State of Nevada, which is 87 percent federally owned. Over the last two decades, there has been
some movement towards state-centered federalism. Former President Clinton was an advocate of ‘‘reinventing government’’, which
in part entailed a larger role for state and local governments in the policy-making and implementation process. Presidential
Executive Order 12132, issued by Clinton in 1999, required federal agencies to develop ‘‘federalism summary impact statements’’
when creating new policies or altering existing rules. Our analysis is a bottom-up look at the impacts of federalism in Nevada
counties. County ofcials report that they are not adequately consulted by federal land managers and that a lack of consultation
impacts on the local planning process and represents a cost to local businesses and individual taxpayers. An analysis of Payments in
Lieu of Taxes indicates that with limited—yet notable—exceptions, the federal government pays a larger sum to counties than would
be collected if the federal lands were privatized.
