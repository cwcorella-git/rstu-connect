1/13/25 Meeting Notes:
Hi @Everyone!
We had our monthly meeting last night. Although the group was small, we had a
lively discussion.


#1 - Increase Monthly Meeting Participation
I committed to doing a better job posting on the Discord channel to remind folks of
our upcoming meetings, meeting notes and meeting agendas. This will be a stretch
for me since I am a Boomer who lives mostly off-line. I don’t have Facebook,
Instagram, Tik Tok, X, or any other social media account.
Also, does anyone know who controls the Strong Towns Instagram account? We
discussed making this account more active and posting more Strong Town
information could help the group stay more connected. Please let me know if
anyone has information on the Strong Towns account holder. Who wants to be our
Social Media poster? Any takers?


Does anyone have any other suggestions on increasing group participation? I’d love
to hear them.


#2 – Reno Draft ADU Ordinance is Out for comment
City of Reno Planning staff is beginning the review process for the creation of an
Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) ordinance. In 2023, Reno City Council initiated a text
amendment to Reno Municipal Code to create an ordinance on ADUs. In 2024, staff
conducted a survey, held multiple public meetings, and went to Council for specific
direction on what information should be included in the ordinance. Staff is now
starting the public input process to discuss the potential ordinance language and
seek stakeholder feedback. If you have any questions, please reach out to Grace
Mackedon at MackedonG@reno.gov.
You can read the draft ADU ordinance here.
To provide feedback on the proposed ordinance please click here
Below is a list of opportunities to provide feedback and ask questions to staff. The
same information will be provided at each meeting. Multiple dates/times have been
scheduled to provide more opportunities for the public to participate.
      February 4th at 5:30 pm - Ward 3 NAB
      February 10th at 5:30 pm - Ward 1 NAB
      February 18th at 5:30 pm - Ward 2 NAB
