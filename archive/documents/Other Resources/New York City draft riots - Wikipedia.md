                referred to as the Manhattan draft riots and known at the
                time as Draft Week,[3] were violent disturbances in Lower
                Manhattan, widely regarded as the culmination of working-
                class discontent with new laws passed by Congress that year
                to draft men to fight in the ongoing American Civil War. The
                riots remain the largest civil urban disturbance in American
                history.[4] According to Toby Joyce, the riot represented a "civil
                war" within the city's Irish community, in that "mostly Irish
                American rioters confronted police, [while] soldiers, and pro-
                war politicians ... were also to a considerable extent from the
                local Irish immigrant community."[5]

                President Abraham Lincoln diverted several regiments of
                militia and volunteer troops after the Battle of Gettysburg to
                control the city.

                The protests turned into a race riot against African-Americans
                by Irish rioters. The official death toll was listed at either 119 or
                120 individuals. Conditions in the city were such that Major
                General John E. Wool, commander of the Department of the
                East, said on July 16 that "Martial law ought to be proclaimed,
                but I have not a sufficient force to enforce it."[6]

                The military did not reach the city until the second day of
                rioting, by which time the mobs had ransacked or destroyed
                numerous public buildings, two Protestant churches, the
                homes of various abolitionists or sympathizers, many black
                homes, and the Colored Orphan Asylum at 44th Street and
                Fifth Avenue, which was burned to the ground.[7] The area's
                demographics changed as a result of the riot. Many black
                residents left Manhattan permanently with many moving to

                Brooklyn. By 1865, the black population had fallen below
                11,000 for the first time since 1820.[7]

                New York's economy was tied to the South; by 1822, nearly half
                of its exports were cotton shipments.[8] In addition, upstate
                textile mills processed cotton in manufacturing. New York had
                such strong business connections to the South that on January
                7, 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood, a Democrat, called on the
                city's Board of Aldermen to "declare the city's independence
                from Albany and from Washington"; he said it "would have the
                whole and united support of the Southern States."[9] When the
                Union entered the war, New York City had many sympathizers
                with the South.[10]

                The city was also a continuing destination of immigrants. Since
                the 1840s, most were from Ireland and Germany. In 1860,
                nearly 25 percent of the New York City population was German-
                born, and many did not speak English. During the 1840s and
                1850s, journalists had published sensational accounts,
                directed at the white working class, dramatizing the evils of
                interracial socializing, relationships, and marriages. Reformers
                joined the effort.[7]

                The Democratic Party's Tammany Hall political machine had
                been working to enroll immigrants as U.S. citizens so they
                could vote in local elections and had strongly recruited Irish. In
                March 1863, with the war continuing, Congress passed the
                Enrollment Act to establish a draft for the first time, as more
                troops were needed. In New York City and other locations, new
                citizens learned they were expected to register for the draft to
                fight for their new country. Black men were excluded from the

                draft as they were largely not considered citizens, and
                wealthier white men could pay for substitutes.[7]

                New York political offices, including the mayor, were historically
                held by Democrats before the war, but the election of Abraham
                Lincoln as president had demonstrated the rise in Republican
                political power nationally. Newly elected New York City
                Republican Mayor George Opdyke was mired in profiteering
                scandals in the months leading up to the riots. The
                Emancipation Proclamation of January 1863 alarmed much of
                the white working class in New York, who feared that freed
                slaves would migrate to the city and add further competition to
                the labor market. There had already been tensions between
                black and white workers since the 1850s, particularly at the
                docks, with free black people and immigrants competing for
                low-wage jobs in the city. In March 1863, white longshoremen
                refused to work with black laborers and rioted, attacking 200
                black men.[7]

                1863—occurred peaceably in Manhattan. The second drawing
                was held on Monday, July 13, 1863, ten days after the Union
                victory at Gettysburg. At 10 am, a furious crowd of around 500,
                led by the volunteer firemen of Engine Company 33 (known as
                the "Black Joke"), attacked the assistant Ninth District provost
                marshal's office, at Third Avenue and 47th Street, where the
                draft was taking place.[11]

                The crowd threw large paving stones through windows, burst
                through the doors, and set the building ablaze.[12] When the
                fire department responded, rioters broke up their vehicles.
                Others killed horses that were pulling streetcars and smashed
                the cars. To prevent other parts of the city being notified of the
                riot, rioters cut telegraph lines.[11]

                Since the New York State Militia had been sent to assist Union
                troops at Gettysburg, the local New York Metropolitan Police
                Department was the only force on hand to try to suppress the
                riots.[12] Police Superintendent John Kennedy arrived at the site
                on Monday to check on the situation. An Irish-American
                himself, Kennedy was a steadfast unionist. Although he was
                not in uniform, people in the mob recognized him and attacked
                him. Kennedy was left nearly unconscious, his face bruised and
                cut, his eye injured, his lips swollen, and his hand cut with a
                knife. He had been beaten to a mass of bruises and blood all
                over his body. Physicians later counted over 70 knife wounds
                alone. He would never fully recover. [3]

                Police drew their clubs and revolvers and charged the crowd
                but were overpowered.[13] The police were badly outnumbered

                and unable to quell the riots, but they kept the rioting out of
                Lower Manhattan below Union Square.[3] Inhabitants of the
                "Bloody Sixth" Ward, around the South Street Seaport and Five
                Points areas, refrained from involvement in the rioting.[14] The
                19th Company/1st Battalion US Army Invalid Corps which was
                part of the Provost Guard tried to disperse the mob with a
                volley of gunfire but were overwhelmed and suffered over 14
                injured with 1 soldier missing (believed killed).[citation needed]




                Bull's Head Hotel, depicted in 1830, was burned after it refused
                to serve alcohol to the rioters.

                The Bull's Head hotel on 44th Street, which refused to provide
                alcohol to the rioters, was burned. The mayor's residence on
                Fifth Avenue was spared by words of Judge George Gardner
                Barnard, and the crowd of about 500 turned to another location
                of pillage.[15] The Eighth and Fifth District police stations, and
                other buildings were attacked and set on fire. Other targets
                included the office of the New York Times. The mob was turned
                back at the Times office by staff manning Gatling guns,
                including Times founder Henry Jarvis Raymond.[16] Fire engine
                companies responded, but some firefighters were sympathetic
                to the rioters because they had also been drafted on Saturday.

                The New York Tribune was attacked, being looted and burned;
                not until police arrived and extinguished the flames was the
                crowd dispersed.[15][13] Later in the afternoon, authorities shot
                and killed a man as a crowd attacked the armory at Second
                Avenue and 21st Street. The mob broke all the windows with
                paving stones ripped from the street.[11] The mob beat,
                tortured and/or killed numerous black civilians, including one
                man who was attacked by a crowd of 400 with clubs and
                paving stones, then lynched, hanged from a tree and set alight.
                [11]

                The Colored Orphan Asylum at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue, a
                "symbol of white charity to blacks and of black upward
                mobility"[7] that provided shelter for 233 children, was
                attacked by a mob at around 4 pm. A mob of several thousand,
                including many women and children, looted the building of its
                food and supplies. However, the police were able to secure the
                orphanage for enough time to allow the orphans to escape
                before the building burned down.[13] Throughout the areas of
                rioting, mobs attacked and killed numerous black civilians and
                destroyed their known homes and businesses, such as James
                McCune Smith's pharmacy at 93 West Broadway, believed to
                be the first owned by a black man in the United States.[7]

                Near the midtown docks, tensions brewing since the
                mid-1850s boiled over. As recently as March 1863, white
                employers had hired black longshoremen, with whom many
                White men refused to work. Rioters went into the streets in
                search of "all the negro porters, cartmen and laborers" to
                attempt to remove all evidence of a black and interracial social

                life from the area near the docks. White dockworkers attacked
                and destroyed brothels, dance halls, boarding houses, and
                tenements that catered to black people. Mobs stripped the
                clothing off the white owners of these businesses.[7]

                Heavy rain fell on Monday night, helping to abate the fires and
                sending rioters home, but the crowds returned the next day.
                Rioters burned down the home of Abby Gibbons, a prison
                reformer and the daughter of abolitionist Isaac Hopper. They
                also attacked white "amalgamationists", such as Ann
                Derrickson and Ann Martin, two white women who were
                married to black men, and Mary Burke, a white prostitute who
                catered to black men.[7][17]

                Governor Horatio Seymour arrived on Tuesday and spoke at
                City Hall, where he attempted to assuage the crowd by
                proclaiming that the Conscription Act was unconstitutional.
                General John E. Wool, commander of the Eastern District,
                brought approximately 800 soldiers and Marines in from forts
                in New York Harbor, West Point, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He
                ordered the militias to return to New York.[13]

                The situation improved July 15 when assistant provost-
                marshal-general Robert Nugent received word from his
                superior officer, Colonel James Barnet Fry, to postpone the
                draft. As this news appeared in newspapers, some rioters
                stayed home. But some of the militias began to return and
                used harsh measures against the remaining rioters.[13] The
                rioting spread to Brooklyn and Staten Island.[18]

                Order began to be restored on July 16. The New York State

                Militia and some federal troops were returned to New York,
                including the 152nd New York Volunteers, the 26th Michigan
                Volunteers, the 27th Indiana Volunteers and the 7th Regiment
                New York State Militia from Frederick, Maryland, after a forced
                march. In addition, the governor sent in the 74th and 65th
                regiments of the New York State Militia, which had not been in
                federal service, and a section of the 20th Independent Battery,
                New York Volunteer Artillery from Fort Schuyler in Throggs
                Neck. The New York State Militia units were the first to arrive.
                There were several thousand militia and Federal troops in the
                city.[6]

                A final confrontation occurred in the evening near Gramercy
                Park. According to Adrian Cook, twelve people died on this last
                day of the riots in skirmishes between rioters, the police, and
                the Army.[19]

                The New York Times reported on Thursday that Plug Uglies and
                Blood Tubs gang members from Baltimore, as well as "Scuykill
                Rangers [sic] and other rowdies of Philadelphia", had come to
                New York during the unrest to participate in the riots alongside
                the Dead Rabbits and "Mackerelvillers". The Times editorialized
                that "the scoundrels cannot afford to miss this golden
                opportunity of indulging their brutal natures, and at the same
                time serving their colleagues the Copperheads and secesh
                [secessionist] sympathizers."[20]

                The exact death toll during the New York draft riots is unknown,
                but according to historian James M. McPherson, 119 or 120
                people were killed,[21] although other estimates list the death
                toll as high as 1,200.[22] Violence by longshoremen against

                black men was especially fierce in the docks area:[7]

                West of Broadway, below Twenty-sixth, all was quiet at 9
                o'clock last night. A crowd was at the corner of Seventh avenue
                and Twenty-seventh Street at that time. This was the scene of
                the hanging of a negro in the morning, and another at 6 o'clock
                in the evening. The body of the one hung in the morning
                presented a shocking appearance at the Station-House. His
                fingers and toes had been sliced off, and there was scarcely an
                inch of his flesh which was not gashed. Late in the afternoon, a
                negro was dragged out of his house in West Twenty-seventh
                street, beaten down on the sidewalk, pounded in a horrible
                manner, and then hanged to a tree.[23]

                In all, eleven black men and boys were hanged over five days.
                [24] Among the murdered black people was the seven-year-old

                nephew of Bermudian First Sergeant Robert John Simmons of
                the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, whose account of
                fighting in South Carolina, written on the approach to Fort
                Wagner July 18, 1863, was to be published in the New York
                Tribune on December 23, 1863 (Simmons having died in
                August of wounds received in the attack on Fort Wagner).
                [citation needed]

                The most reliable estimates indicate at least 2,000 people
                were injured. Herbert Asbury, the author of the 1928 book
                Gangs of New York, upon which the 2002 film was based, puts
                the figure much higher, at 2,000 killed and 8,000 wounded,[25]
                a number that some dispute.[26] Total property damage was
                about $1–5 million (equivalent to $19.4 million – $97.2 million

                in 2023[27]).[25][28] The city treasury later indemnified one-
                quarter of the amount.[citation needed]

                Historian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that the riots were
                "equivalent to a Confederate victory".[28] Fifty buildings,
                including two Protestant churches and the Colored Orphan
                Asylum, were burned to the ground. The orphans at the asylum
                were first put under siege, then the building was set on fire,
                before all those who attempted to escape were forced to walk
                through a "beating line" of white rioters holding clubs. To
                escape, they would need to run through the gauntlet as the
                rioters viciously attacked them. Many did not manage the
                escape. 4,000 federal troops had to be pulled out of the
                Gettysburg Campaign to suppress the riots, troops that could
                have aided in pursuing the battered Army of Northern Virginia
                as it retreated out of Union territory.[18] During the riots,
                landlords, fearing that the mob would destroy their buildings,
                drove black residents from their homes. As a result of the
                violence against them, hundreds of black people left New York,
                including physician James McCune Smith and his family,
                moving to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or New Jersey.[7]

                The white elite in New York organized to provide relief to black
                riot victims, helping them find new work and homes. The Union
                League Club and the Committee of Merchants for the Relief of
                Colored People provided nearly $40,000 to 2,500 victims of the
                riots. By 1865 the black population in the city had dropped to
                under 10,000, the lowest since 1820. The white working-class
                riots had changed the demographics of the city, and white
                residents exerted their control in the workplace; they became

                "unequivocally divided" from the black population.[7]

                On August 19, the government resumed the draft in New York.
                It was completed within 10 days without further incident.
                Fewer men were drafted than had been feared by the white
                working class: of the 750,000 selected nationwide for
                conscription, only about 45,000 were sent into active duty.[29]

                While the rioting mainly involved the white working class,
                middle and upper-class New Yorkers had split sentiments on
                the draft and use of federal power or martial law to enforce it.
                Many wealthy Democratic businessmen sought to have the
                draft declared unconstitutional. Tammany Democrats did not
                seek to have the draft declared unconstitutional, but they
                helped pay the commutation fees for those who were drafted.
                [30]

                In December 1863, the Union League Club recruited more than
                2,000 black soldiers, outfitted and trained them, honoring and
                sending men off with a parade through the city to the Hudson
                River docks in March 1864. A crowd of 100,000 watched the
                procession, which was led by police and members of the Union
                League Club.[7][31][32]

                New York's support for the Union cause continued, however
                grudgingly, and gradually Southern sympathies declined in the
                city. New York banks eventually financed the Civil War, and the
                state's industries were more productive than those of the
                entire Confederacy. By the end of the war, more than 450,000
                soldiers, sailors, and militia had enlisted from New York State,
                which was the most populous state at the time. A total of

                46,000 military men from New York State died during the war,
                more from disease than wounds—as was typical during the
                war.[9]
