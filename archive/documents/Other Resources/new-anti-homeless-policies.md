# New Anti-Homeless Policies Proposed in Reno and Washoe County

Local governments across the Reno-Sparks area are considering a wave of ordinances that would further criminalize homelessness and make it harder for people experiencing housing instability to survive and find stable housing.

## The Regional Push

### Coordination Between Jurisdictions
Recent proposals show coordination between Reno, Sparks, and Washoe County to create region-wide policies:
- **Shared enforcement** protocols between agencies
- **Coordinated court systems** for processing violations
- **Joint funding** for expanded enforcement
- **Regional mapping** of "exclusion zones"

### Similar Language Across Proposals
The ordinances use nearly identical language, suggesting they were developed by the same legal or consulting firms:
- **Model legislation** from national organizations
- **Corporate consulting** from specialized firms
- **Industry lobbying** groups providing templates
- **Coordination** through regional government associations

## Reno's Proposed Ordinances

### Expanded "No Camping" Zones
**Current Proposal**: Prohibit camping, sleeping, or storing belongings on any public property within:
- **1,000 feet of any school** (K-12 or higher education)
- **500 feet of any park or playground**
- **Downtown core business district** (roughly Virginia to Wells, 1st to 6th Streets)
- **All transit stops and stations** including RTC facilities
- **500 feet of any library or community center**

**Impact**: Would make it illegal to rest or sleep on approximately **60% of public land** in Reno.

### "Quality of Life" Enforcement
**Proposed measures**:
- **Public urination/defecation** fines up to $1,000 (even when no public restrooms available)
- **Aggressive panhandling** with broad definitions that could include any request for help
- **Loitering** in business districts with subjective enforcement standards
- **Shopping cart possession** restrictions that criminalize carrying belongings

### Property Seizure Expansion
**New powers for city officials**:
- **Immediate confiscation** of tents, tarps, and temporary shelters
- **Personal property seizure** after 24-hour notice (down from current 72 hours)
- **Storage fees** charged to reclaim belongings
- **Destruction authorization** after 30 days regardless of value

## Washoe County Proposals

### Rural Area Restrictions
**County-specific measures**:
- **Prohibition on camping** on all county property including parks and open space
- **Vehicle habitation bans** preventing people from sleeping in cars on county property
- **Fire restriction enforcement** that criminalizes warming fires even in designated areas
- **Water access limits** restricting use of public water sources

### Coordination with Cities
**Regional enforcement**:
- **Shared violation database** tracking individuals across jurisdictions
- **Joint court calendar** for processing homeless-related citations
- **Cross-jurisdiction enforcement** allowing county deputies to enforce city ordinances
- **Coordinated sweeps** of encampments across municipal boundaries

## Sparks Considerations

### Similar Framework
Sparks city council is considering ordinances that would:
- **Mirror Reno's camping prohibitions** with similar geographic restrictions
- **Expand business district protections** covering downtown and major commercial areas
- **Increase penalty structures** with escalating fines for repeat violations
- **Coordinate enforcement** with regional partners

### Timeline for Implementation
- **First reading** scheduled for September 2025
- **Public comment period** through October 2025
- **Final vote** expected November 2025
- **Implementation** beginning January 2026

## The Human Impact

### Who Gets Targeted

These ordinances will primarily affect:
- **Families living in cars** due to eviction or inability to afford rent
- **People with disabilities** unable to access inadequate shelter systems
- **Veterans experiencing PTSD** who cannot tolerate congregate shelters
- **LGBTQ+ youth** rejected by family and unsafe in traditional shelters
- **Elderly individuals** on fixed incomes priced out of housing
- **Formerly incarcerated people** facing housing discrimination

### Real-Life Consequences

**James, Army veteran**: "I can't sleep in the shelter because of my PTSD, but now I can't sleep anywhere else either. They want me to just disappear."

**Maria, single mother**: "We've been living in our car since our landlord raised the rent $600. Now they want to make that illegal too. Where are we supposed to go?"

**David, disabled senior**: "I'm on the waiting list for housing assistance, but it's three years long. These laws make it illegal to exist while I wait."

## Why These Policies Don't Work

### Research on Criminalization

**Academic studies consistently show**:
- **Camping bans don't reduce** unsheltered populations
- **Fines and arrests** trap people in cycles of poverty and criminalization
- **Property confiscation** destroys survival equipment and important documents
- **Criminal records** create additional barriers to housing and employment

### Cost to Taxpayers

**Enforcement expenses**:
- **Police overtime** for sweeps and enforcement
- **Court processing** costs for violations
- **Jail bookings** and incarceration expenses
- **Property storage** and disposal costs
- **Legal challenges** and civil rights lawsuits

**Conservative estimates**: Each person cycled through arrest, court, and jail for homeless-related violations costs taxpayers **$5,000-$10,000 annually**.

### Alternative Uses of Resources

The same money could fund:
- **Rapid rehousing** for 3-5 people per enforcement dollar
- **Outreach services** connecting people to benefits and housing
- **Mental health and addiction treatment** addressing root causes
- **Emergency shelter** with dignity and safety standards

## What's Really Driving These Proposals

### Business District Pressure
- **Downtown business associations** claiming homeless presence hurts commerce
- **Property management companies** wanting to increase property values
- **Tourism industry** concerned about visitor perceptions
- **Retail chains** demanding "clean" streetscapes

### Political Motivations
- **Appearing "tough"** on visible social problems
- **Deflecting attention** from failed housing policies
- **Avoiding investment** in real solutions that require public spending
- **Responding to complaints** from wealthy constituents

### Consultant Influence
- **Private consulting firms** selling "best practices" packages to cities
- **Law enforcement consultants** promoting enforcement-heavy approaches
- **Legal firms** specializing in constitutional workarounds for criminalization
- **Security companies** positioning for enforcement contracts

## Constitutional and Legal Challenges

### Federal Court Precedents

**Martin v. Boise (2018)**: Established that criminalizing sleeping or camping when adequate shelter is unavailable violates the 8th Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

**Key requirements**:
- **Adequate shelter** must be available before camping can be prohibited
- **"Adequate"** means accessible, safe, and actually available
- **Low-barrier access** without requirements that exclude many people
- **Sufficient capacity** for the unsheltered population

### Potential Legal Vulnerabilities

**Constitutional problems with local proposals**:
- **Inadequate shelter capacity**: Current shelters serve fewer than 40% of estimated unsheltered population
- **High-barrier requirements**: Many shelters exclude people with pets, couples, or those with criminal records
- **Lack of accessible facilities**: Insufficient accommodations for people with disabilities
- **Geographical displacement**: Pushing people to areas without services or support

### Ongoing Litigation

Legal challenges are already being prepared:
- **Nevada Legal Aid** preparing federal civil rights lawsuit
- **ACLU of Nevada** reviewing constitutional violations
- **Homeless advocacy groups** documenting enforcement patterns
- **Civil rights attorneys** gathering client testimonies

## Alternative Approaches That Work

### Housing First Models

**Evidence-based approaches**:
- **Rapid rehousing** with minimal barriers gets people housed quickly
- **Supportive services** provided after housing placement
- **Client choice** in services and housing options
- **Cost effectiveness** significantly lower than criminalization

### Successful Examples

**Houston, Texas**: Reduced homelessness by 60% since 2011 through:
- **Massive investment** in rapid rehousing
- **Coordinated entry system** connecting people to housing quickly
- **Prevention services** keeping people housed
- **Data-driven approach** tracking outcomes

**Finland**: Virtually eliminated homelessness through:
- **Housing First** as national policy
- **Social housing investment** at scale
- **Wraparound services** integrated with housing
- **Long-term commitment** spanning multiple political cycles

### Local Solutions for Nevada

**Immediate actions**:
- **Rapid rehousing programs** with rental assistance
- **Navigation centers** providing services without requiring shelter stays
- **Tiny home villages** as transitional housing
- **Safe parking programs** for people living in vehicles

**Long-term investments**:
- **Affordable housing development** at scale
- **Mental health and addiction services** expansion
- **Permanent supportive housing** for chronically homeless individuals
- **Prevention programs** keeping people housed

## Community Response

- **Reno Sparks Tenants Union** connecting housing and homelessness issues
- **Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada (PLAN)** providing organizing support
- **Nevada Legal Aid** offering legal representation
- **Faith communities** calling for compassionate responses
- **Social service providers** warning of increased harm

### Public Education Campaign

**Messaging strategy**:
- **Humanize** people experiencing homelessness

## The Bigger Picture

### Housing as a Continuum

RSTU recognizes that homelessness and housing insecurity exist on a continuum:
- **Doubled up** with friends or family
- **Living in cars** or other vehicles
- **Staying in motels** week to week
- **Sleeping outside** with or without shelter
- **Cycling between** temporary arrangements

### System Failures Affect Everyone

The same forces that create homelessness threaten all renters:
- **Inadequate affordable housing** supply
- **Wage stagnation** while housing costs rise
- **Weak tenant protections** allowing easy displacement
- **Medical bankruptcy** destroying family finances
- **Criminal justice involvement** creating barriers to housing

### Solidarity, Not Division

Building a movement for housing justice requires:
- **Standing with** all people affected by housing instability
- **Rejecting** attempts to divide housed and unhoused people
- **Understanding** that today's tenants could be tomorrow's homeless population
- **Fighting** for systemic solutions that address root causes
