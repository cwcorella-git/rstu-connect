🌱 Want to Support a Community Garden? Here's How to
Plug In 🌻
Because growing food together is radical mutual aid.

Community gardens are more than green spaces, they’re places where we care for the land and
each other. When you show up for a garden, you’re showing up for your community. Here's how
to be part of the work in a way that lifts everyone up:

1. 🤝 Learn the Collective Vision
Every garden exists for a reason. Maybe it feeds neighbors, builds skills, creates safer spaces,
or reclaims land. Take time to understand the goals and values of the group before jumping in.
Shared purpose = shared power.

2. 🔧 Take On a Role and Really Hold It
Mutual aid works when we each bring what we can. Find something that fits your skills or
interests: watering, organizing events, mending tools, making signs, etc. and take responsibility
for it. Reliable folks make the work lighter for everyone.

3. 🕰 Respect the Rhythm
There’s usually a set flow: planting days, harvest times, meetings, or even just checking in.
Make note of the schedule and honor it. If you can’t make it, no stress, just let someone know.
Accountability is care.

4. 📢 Communicate with Care
We’re building trust as much as we’re growing food. Check in, ask questions, offer feedback,
and support each other. Clear, kind communication helps the garden stay welcoming and
effective.

5. ✨ Be Present, Be Real
Mutual aid isn’t about perfection, it’s about showing up. Whether you're there to work, learn,
listen, or rest, your presence matters. Bring your full self and remember: it’s okay to ask for help,
too. We’ve all got each other.



🌻 This is how we grow a garden and a movement, together. Your energy, your care, and
your commitment make all the difference.
