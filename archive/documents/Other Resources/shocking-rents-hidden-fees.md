# Exposed: Shocking Reasons Rents and Hidden Fees Are Too High

We were inspired by a post in r/Reno by user u/EmotionalBaby9423 that highlighted the shocking reality of rent prices and hidden fees in our community. Their frustration echoes what we hear from tenants across Reno and Sparks every single day.

## The Corporate Takeover of Our Housing

Over the past five years, corporate landlords have systematically bought up properties across Washoe County. Our research shows that **over 50 corporate entities now control thousands of rental units**, treating housing as a commodity rather than a human right.

### The Numbers Don't Lie

- **GAGE VILLAGE COMMERCIAL DEV LLC**: 3,335 units, $103M portfolio
- **CCR NEWCO LLC**: 2,485 units, $34M portfolio  
- **PEPPERMILL CASINOS INC**: 1,765 units, $143M portfolio

These corporations aren't just raising rents – they're engineering a housing crisis for profit.

## Hidden Fees: The New Profit Strategy

Beyond astronomical rent increases, corporate landlords are implementing fee structures that would make a casino blush:

- **"Convenience fees"** for paying rent online (often the only payment method allowed)
- **"Amenity fees"** for facilities that are broken or unusable
- **"Pet rent"** in addition to pet deposits (often $50+ per month per pet)
- **"Trash valet fees"** for services that used to be included
- **"Technology fees"** for basic online account access

These fees can add **$200-400 per month** to your actual housing costs, but they don't count toward your "rent" for legal purposes – making it harder to challenge excessive increases.

## The Human Cost

Behind every statistic is a family forced to choose between rent and groceries, between medication and housing, between staying in their community and becoming homeless.

Maria, a single mother of two from Sparks, told us: *"I work two jobs and still can't afford the rent increase. Where are we supposed to go? My kids shouldn't have to change schools because some corporation in California wants more profit."*

## What We Can Do Together

The good news? **We have power when we organize together.**

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Document everything** – keep records of all fees and rent increases
2. **Know your rights** – attend our Know Your Rights workshops
3. **Connect with neighbors** – individual tenants are powerless, but organized tenants win
4. **Join RSTU** – collective action is our strongest tool

### Legislative Solutions:
We're working with allied organizations to push for:
- **Rent stabilization** policies that limit excessive increases
- **Fee transparency** requirements that force landlords to justify all charges
- **Corporate accountability** measures that hold out-of-state landlords responsible to our community

## The Path Forward

Housing is a human right, not a commodity. Every person deserves a safe, affordable home in the community they choose.

The corporate landlords counting their profits while families struggle? **They're counting on us staying divided, staying silent, staying powerless.**

But when we organize together – tenant to tenant, building to building, neighborhood to neighborhood – we build the power to win.

**Join us.** Come to our next community meeting. Bring your neighbors. Together, we can make housing affordable again.
