               Reno-Sparks apartment rent
               reaches another record. How high
               will it go?
               Jason Hidalgo

               6–8 minutes



               Reno-Sparks’ apartment sector closed the first half of the year
               with record numbers yet again, posting the highest average
               rent ever seen for the area, according to two separate reports.

               Real estate appraisal and consulting firm Johnson Perkins
               Griffin reported an average rent of $1,680 for the second
               quarter, beating the record set during the previous quarter of
               $1,633. Rents have increased in 12 of the last 14 quarters
               since 2019 — 10 of which were record highs.

               A second report from the Nevada State Apartment Association,
               meanwhile, saw average rent in Reno-Sparks reach $1,550 for
               the same period. The rent is also the highest ever reported by
               the apartment association for Reno-Sparks, although still lower
               than the national average of $1,640. Both reports cover the
               quarter from April to June.

               The higher rent is bad news for people such as service industry
               workers, whose incomes have failed to keep pace with the
               rising cost of housing. As recently as early 2015, the average

               rent in Reno-Sparks was below $900, according to Johnson
               Perkins Griffin. Since then, rents have jumped by 89%. The
               median household income in the greater Reno metro area,
               however, has gone up by 18% during the same time frame,
               according to census data.

               The housing situation in Reno reflects an income divide
               between the residents who work in traditional industries that
               once served as the backbone of the area economy and the
               new, higher-paying sectors that have attracted people from
               outside the state.

               “There is a large demographic in Reno-Sparks that is struggling
               … and people are saying that it’s hard to find a place that’s
               affordable,” said Susy Vazquez, executive director of the
               Nevada State Apartment Association. “You have the population
               that can afford the rents and then the other half that can’t.”

               Reno-Sparks apartment rents see signs of
               stabilization

               Although apartment rents are at record highs, they are
               increasing at a slower clip in the last year — a sign of
               moderating rents, according to Vazquez.

               The Nevada State Apartment Association was initially
               forecasting rents to increase by 7% year-over-year before
               reducing its forecast down to 5%. In the last 12 months, rent
               growth also stood at 4.1%. The number is significantly down
               from the all-time high rent increase of 13.3% seen in mid-2021.

               Another potential factor is the demand for single-family
               homes, which can impact the apartment market. Reno recently
               topped a Realtor.com analysis for cities with the highest
               number of home listing price reductions as rising interest rates
               have priced potential buyers out of the market and led to a
               decrease in demand.

               Reno-Sparks is also in the middle of an apartment construction
               boom, which will add much-needed supply to the market. The
               NVSAA has identified 4,500 new apartment units under
               construction, which would represent an 11% increase in overall
               supply, according to the association.

               Johnson Perkins Griffin, meanwhile, is reporting more than
               5,500 apartment units currently under construction and just
               under 5,100 units in the planning stages in Reno-Sparks.

               “We’re back to where we were (with the rate of increase for
               rent) pre-pandemic and supply is coming in a little hotter than
               demand so that’s good news because we’ll see some

               stabilization in the market,” Vazquez said.

               “Will (rent) go backwards? Probably not. I think most landlords
               will rather push move-in specials or offer a free month of rent,
               which essentially reduces rents, even if it’s not at face value.”

               Whether or not the Reno-Sparks apartment market will see
               more concessions largely depends on the vacancy rate. The
               NVSAA is reporting a vacancy rate of 6%, up slightly from 5.8%
               in the first quarter and 5.2% during the second quarter last
               year.

               “A vacancy rate of 5% to 6% is normal and 7% to 8% is when
               landlords start to worry and start offering more move-in
               specials,” Vazquez said.

               The Johnson Perkins Griffin report, meanwhile, typically reports
               a lower vacancy rate compared to the apartment association,
               even though overall trends in both reports are similar.

               After hitting near-zero multiple times in recent years, including
               1.17% during the second quarter of 2017, the vacancy rate has
               bounced up and down — even nearly reaching 4% in late 2019
               — before settling at 2.66% for the last two quarters.

               The number of apartments offering concessions also fell in the
               second quarter, according to the Johnson Perkins Griffin report.

               Just under 6% of apartments surveyed offered concessions,
               down from just under 18% in the first quarter and more than
               19% in the fourth quarter of last year when vacancies
               exceeded 3%. Apartments in the Johnson Perkins Griffin report
               typically start offering more concessions once vacancies reach
               3%.

               The most common concessions involve either a free month of
               rent or reduced rent with a 12-month lease. Some apartments
               are also actively wooing employees working at the Gigafactory.

               “A majority of the properties now offering concessions are
               offering a discount to Tesla and other Tahoe Reno Industrial
               Center employees,” according to Johnson Perkins Griffin.
