            Budget Negotiations Continue as
            Legislature Prepares for Special
            Session
            May 27, 2025
            Conference committees shi�ed to working groups as state leaders push to ﬁnalize budget
            agreements.

            On May 19, the House and Senate adjourned the 2025 regular legislative session without
            passing several key budget bills needed to prevent a partial state government shutdown. A�er
            adjournment, expectations shi�ed toward holding a special session in the near future to ﬁnish
            the unresolved budget areas.


            Conference committees transition to
            working groups
            While lawmakers passed some budget bill during the regular session, many remain unﬁnished.
            Conference committees that were unable to reach agreements before the deadline have now
            transitioned into working groups. Several of these groups have begun meeting publicly and are
            making progress toward ﬁnal agreements before a special session is convened.

            Environment and Natural Resources Working Group
            update
            The Environment and Natural Resources Working Group has reached a budget agreement, but
            must still agree to what policy provisions will be included in their ﬁnal package.

            View the environment and natural resources budget spreadsheet (pdf).

            This budget covers several state agencies and organizations, including the Minnesota Pollution
            Control Agency, Department of Natural Resources, Board of Water and Soil Resources,
            Minnesota Zoo, and the Science Museum of Minnesota. Based on recommendations of the
            Legislative‐Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR), it also includes
            environmental funding administered through the Metropolitan Council and project funding
            through the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund.

            Taxes Working Group update
            The Taxes Working Group met four days during the week of May 19. Meetings will continue
            during the week of May 26 as members work toward a deal.

            Under the joint budget targets reached by legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz, the group must
            raise taxes or cut spending by $118 million in ﬁscal years 2025‐2027 and $190 million in ﬁscal
            years 2028‐2029. As a part of the joint target agreement, the bill must raise revenue through

            narrowing a current tax exemption for data centers, repealing the local cannabis aid account,
            and increasing the cannabis gross receipts tax from 10% to 15%.

            The group has adopted some provisions for the ﬁnal bill, including:

            • All special tax increment ﬁnancing (TIF) provisions from the Senateʼs bill.

            • New TIF authority for St. Cloud.

            • Amendments to the Bloomington TIF.

            • An extension of the temporary ﬂexibility provisions until 2026.

            The Senate proposal includes a $4.25 million reduction to local government aid (LGA)
            beginning in 2026. It would also reduce county program aid (CPA), Local Homeless Prevention
            Aid, and Local and Statewide Local Housing Aid by $4.25 million each. In contract, the House
            proposes reducing aid to soil and water conservation districts by $2 million and aquatic
            invasive species prevention aid by $2.94 million.

            • View the House omnibus taxes bill budget spreadsheet (pdf).

            The two chambers also diﬀer on local sales tax authority. The Senate plan would allow cities
            and counties to adopt a general sales tax with voter approval, while the House proposal would
            extend the current moratorium on sales tax proposals through June 30, 2026, and calls for
            forming another working group to study the issue.

            Workforce, Labor, and Economic Development
            Working Group update
            The Workforce, Labor, and Economic Development Working Group met on May 22 to review
            areas of agreement on both the jobs and labor budget spreadsheets, and adopt most of the
            agreed‐upon policy provisions that were le� unresolved at the end of session.

            • View the jobs budget spreadsheet (pdf).

            • View the labor budget spreadsheet (pdf).

            • View the workforce, labor, and economic development policy provisions (pdf).

            The global budget deal reached in the ﬁnal days of session includes the following changes:

            • A $28 million reduction to the jobs budget for ﬁscal years 2025‐2027 and $38 million
              reduction for ﬁscal years 2028‐2029.

            • A $2 million increase to the labor budget in ﬁscal years 2025‐2027 and a $1.2 million increase
              in ﬁscal years 2028‐2029.

            The only remaining point of contention in the working group involves a 2023 law that prohibits
            employers from requiring employees to sign nondisclosure agreements.

            No major policy changes were made to either the Minnesota Paid Leave program or earned sick
            and safe time law enacted in 2023. The only adjustment is a slight reduction to the maximum
            premium rate for Paid Leave from 1.2% to 1.1%. The rate is currently set at 0.88%.

            The following budget areas still need to be passed by both chambers:

            • Capital investment

            • Commerce

            • Energy

            • Health/children and families

            • Higher education

            • Human services

            • K‐12 education

            • Transportation


            What’s next?
            Legislative leaders and Gov. Walz remain optimistic that the state budget can be ﬁnalized in a
            one‐day special session in the coming weeks. Originally, they aimed to hold the session before
            Memorial Day and complete the budget before June 1, which is the date that layoﬀ notices
            would need to be sent to aﬀected state employees.

            Only the governor can call a special session. Once convened, the Legislature determines what
            to pass and when to adjourn. The expectation is that Gov. Walz will call a special session once
            agreements are reached on all outstanding budget items.
