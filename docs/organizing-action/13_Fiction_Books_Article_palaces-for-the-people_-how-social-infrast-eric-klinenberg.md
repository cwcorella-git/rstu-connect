Praise for
## Palaces for the People

“[A] sweeping work…[Eric Klinenberg] posits that a community’s
resilience correlates strongly with the robustness of its social
infrastructure.”
## —The New Yorker

“A calm, lucid exposition of a centuries-old idea, which is really a furious
call to action.”
## —New Statesman

“Eric Klinenberg combines a Jane Jacobs–eye on city life with knowledge
of the latest research and practical ideas to address the crucial issues of the
day—class division, crime, and climate change. This is a brilliant and
important book.”
—Arlie Russell Hochschild, author of Strangers in Their Own Land

“One of my favorite books of 2018…Klinenberg is echoing what librarians
and library patrons have been saying for years: that libraries are equalizers
and absolutely universal.”
## —Carla Hayden, Librarian of Congress

“An illuminating examination…Klinenberg’s observations are effortlessly
discursive and always cogent, whether covering the ways playgrounds
instill youth with civic values or a Chicago architect’s plans to transform a
police station into a community center.”
## —Publishers Weekly (starred review)

---

“This fantastic book…[is] both idealistic and, in its myriad examples,
pragmatic and delightfully readable.”
—Rebecca Solnit, author of Men Explain Things to Me and A Field Guide
## to Getting Lost

“This is an engrossing, timely, hopeful read, nothing less than a new lens
through which to view the world and its current conflicts.”
## —Booklist (starred review)

“Reading Palaces for the People is an amazing experience. To create good
places for people is essential, and this is what I share with Klinenberg: We
both believe that beauty, this kind of beauty, can save the world.”
## —Renzo Piano

“Wow. A comprehensive, entertaining, and compelling argument for how
rebuilding social infrastructure can help heal divisions in our society and
move us forward. I can’t wait for people in my ideological bubble to ignore
it!”
## —Jon Stewart

“A great example of research made accessible to non-experts…Klinenberg
draws on loads of published scholarship as well as his own, weaving it
together into a powerful argument.”
## —Inside Higher Ed

“At a time when polarization is weakening our democracy, Eric Klinenberg
takes us on a tour of the physical spaces that bind us together. This
wonderful book shows us how democracies thrive.”
—Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, authors of How Democracies Die

“[Palaces for the People] is full of hope, which is all the more striking
because Klinenberg is a realist. He is a major social thinker, and this is a

---

beautifully written, major book.”
—Richard Sennett, professor of sociology, London School of Economics

“Fine reading for community activists seeking to expand the social
infrastructure of their own home places.”
## —Kirkus Reviews

“This is an important book for our difficult age.”
—Kate Pickett, co-author of The Spirit Level and The Inner Level

“The author’s paean to public libraries will strongly appeal to those who
support them as well as interested sociologists and urbanists.”

## INTRODUCTION

## The Social Infrastructure

On July 12, 1995, a tropical air mass with searing heat and high humidity
settled over Chicago, making it feel like Jakarta or Kuala Lumpur. On
July 13, the temperature hit 106 degrees and the heat index, which measures
how a typical person experiences the weather, reached 126. Local
newspapers and television stations announced that the heat wave could be
dangerous, but they didn’t recognize its severity. Along with basic health
warnings and meteorological reports, they also ran humorous stories about
how to “ward off wardrobe wilt and makeup meltdown” and shop for air
conditioners. “This is the kind of weather we pray for,” said a spokesperson
for one regional supplier. The Chicago Tribune advised readers to “slow
down” and “think cool thoughts.”

---

Chicago broke its record for energy consumption that day, and the surge
in demand overwhelmed the electrical grid, causing outages in more than
two hundred thousand homes, some lasting for days. Water pumps failed,
leaving units on high floors dry. Across the city, buildings baked like ovens,
roads and railways buckled, thousands of cars and buses overheated.
Children riding school buses to camp got stuck in gridlocked traffic and had
to be hosed off by public health crews to avoid heat stroke. Despite the
mounting problems, Chicago’s city government neglected to declare a state
of emergency. The mayor, along with leaders of several key city agencies,
was out of the city, vacationing in a cooler spot. But millions of residents
were stuck in the heat.
Like all cities, Chicago is a heat island, with paved roads and metallic
buildings that attract the sun’s warmth and heavy pollution that traps it.
While the verdant suburbs surrounding Chicago cooled down at night,
urban neighborhoods continued to broil. So many people called 911 that
paramedics had to put some of them on hold. Thousands rushed to
emergency rooms with heat-related illnesses, and nearly half of the city’s
hospitals refused to admit new patients because they had no more space. A
line of trucks formed outside the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office,
waiting to unload dead bodies. There were 222 bays at the morgue, all of
them filled. The owner of a meatpacking company offered to bring a forty-
eight-foot-long refrigerated truck. When it was fully loaded, he brought
another, and another, until nine trucks holding hundreds of bodies were
jammed into the parking lot. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,”
said the medical examiner. “We’re overwhelmed.”
During the week between July 14 and July 20, 739 people in excess of
the norm died in Chicago, roughly seven times the toll from Superstorm
Sandy and more than twice as many as in the Great Chicago Fire. Before all
the bodies had been buried, scientists began to look for patterns behind the
deaths. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sent a
team of researchers from Atlanta and recruited dozens more in Chicago to
investigate. Interviewers visited the homes of more than 700 people,
creating “matched pairs” of victims and surviving neighbors and compiling
demographic information that they used for comparison. Some of the results
were unsurprising: Having a working air conditioner reduced the risk of

---

death by 80 percent. Social isolation increased the risk. Living alone was
particularly dangerous, because people often fail to recognize the symptoms
and the severity of heat-related illnesses. A close connection to another
person, even to a pet, made people far more likely to survive.
But fascinating patterns did emerge. Women fared far better than men,
because they have stronger ties to friends and family. Despite high levels of
poverty, Latinos had an easier time than other ethnic groups in Chicago,
simply because in Chicago they tend to live in crowded apartments and
densely packed neighborhoods, places where dying alone is nearly
impossible.
For the most part, heat wave mortality was strongly correlated with
segregation and inequality: eight of the ten community areas with the
highest death rates were virtually all African American, with pockets of
concentrated poverty and violent crime. These were places where old or
sick people were at risk of hunkering down at home and dying alone during
the heat wave. At the same time, three of the ten neighborhoods with the
lowest heat wave death rates were also poor, violent, and predominantly
African American, while another was poor, violent, and predominantly
Latino. On paper, these neighborhoods looked like they should have fared
badly in the heat wave. In fact, they were more resilient than Chicago’s
most affluent areas. Why?
I grew up in Chicago, and when the heat wave hit I was about to move
to California for graduate school. I had no plans to return to my home city. I
hadn’t thought much about neighborhoods, natural disasters, or the climate.
But I couldn’t stop thinking about the heat wave, and the puzzle of why
some people and places that seemed fated for disaster managed to avoid it.
Although I did move to California, I scrapped my plan to study the drug
business and started digging into the disaster. I came back to Chicago
whenever I could and eventually moved there to conduct fieldwork, turning
my family’s basement into an operations center and making the heat wave
the subject of my dissertation.
Like the CDC, I conducted my own comparison of “matched pairs,”
only I was looking at how the heat wave affected entire neighborhoods, not
just individuals. To get oriented, I found a map of heat deaths and laid it
over various maps of poverty, violence, segregation, and aging in Chicago

---

neighborhoods. I identified adjacent communities that had similar
demographic profiles yet sharply different rates of heat wave mortality. I
ran the numbers, analyzing all the neighborhood data that social scientists
ordinarily use, but none of the standard variables could explain the
divergent outcomes. So I turned off my computer and hit the streets.
At ground level, I could observe certain neighborhood conditions that
aren’t visible in quantitative data. Statistics do not convey the differences
between poor, minority neighborhoods that are cursed with empty lots,
broken sidewalks, abandoned homes, and shuttered storefronts, and those
that are densely peopled, busy with foot traffic, enlivened by commercial
activity and well-maintained parks, and supported by strong community
organizations. As I got to know the rhythms of life in various Chicago
neighborhoods, I learned how much these local conditions mattered, both
every day and during the disaster.
Consider Englewood and Auburn Gresham, two adjacent neighborhoods
on the hypersegregated South Side of Chicago. In 1995, they were both
99 percent African American, with similar proportions of elderly residents.
Both had high rates of poverty, unemployment, and violent crime.
Englewood was one of the most perilous places during the disaster, with 33
deaths per 100,000 residents. But Auburn Gresham’s death rate was 3
deaths per 100,000 residents, making it one of the most resilient places in
the city—safer, even, than tony Lincoln Park and the Near North Side.
By the end of my research, I’d discovered that the key difference
between neighborhoods like Auburn Gresham and others that are
demographically similar turned out to be what I call social infrastructure:
the physical places and organizations that shape the way people interact.
Social infrastructure is not “social capital”—a concept commonly used
to measure people’s relationships and interpersonal networks—but the
physical conditions that determine whether social capital develops. When
social infrastructure is robust, it fosters contact, mutual support, and
collaboration among friends and neighbors; when degraded, it inhibits
social activity, leaving families and individuals to fend for themselves.
Social infrastructure is crucially important, because local, face-to-face
interactions—at the school, the playground, and the corner diner—are the
building blocks of all public life. People forge bonds in places that have

---

healthy social infrastructures—not because they set out to build community,
but because when people engage in sustained, recurrent interaction,
particularly while doing things they enjoy, relationships inevitably grow.
During the heat wave, the people of Englewood were vulnerable not just
because they were black and poor but also because their neighborhood had
been abandoned. The residential blocks looked and felt “bombed out,” and
the social infrastructure that had once supported collective life had
deteriorated. Between 1960 and 1990, Englewood lost 50 percent of its
residents and most of its commercial outlets, as well as its social cohesion.
“We used to be much closer, more tight-knit,” says Hal Baskin, who has
lived in Englewood for fifty-two years and currently leads a campaign
against neighborhood violence. “Now we don’t know who lives across the
street or around the corner. And old folks are apprehensive about leaving
their homes.”
Epidemiologists have firmly established the relationship between social
connections, health, and longevity. In the past few decades, leading health
journals have published dozens of articles documenting the physical and
mental benefits of social ties. But there’s a prior question that scientists
have not explored as thoroughly: What conditions in the places we inhabit
make it more likely that people will develop strong or supportive
relationships, and what conditions make it more likely that people will grow
isolated and alone?
After the heat wave, prominent Chicago officials publicly declared that
the socially isolated people who died had effectively chosen their own fate,
and that the communities they lived in had sealed that fate. The mayor,
Richard M. Daley, criticized people for not looking after their neighbors,
and the human services commissioner, Daniel Alvarez, complained to the
press about “people that die because they neglect themselves.” But when I
spent time in Chicago’s most vulnerable neighborhoods, I observed
something different. Those who lived there expressed the same values
endorsed by residents of more resilient places, and they made genuine
efforts to help one another, in both ordinary and difficult times. The
difference was not cultural. It was not about how much people cared about
one another or their community. It was that in places like Englewood, the
shoddy social infrastructure discouraged interaction and impeded mutual

---

support, whereas in places like Auburn Gresham the social infrastructure
encouraged those things.
During the decades that residents fled neighborhoods like Englewood,
Chicago’s most resilient places experienced little or no population loss. In
1995, residents of Auburn Gresham walked to diners, parks, barbershops,
and grocery stores. They participated in block clubs and church groups.
They knew their neighbors—not because they made special efforts to meet
them, but because they lived in a place where casual interaction was a
feature of everyday life. During the heat wave, these ordinary routines made
it easy for people to check in on one another and knock on the doors of
elderly, vulnerable neighbors. “It’s what we always do when it’s very hot or
very cold here,” says Betty Swanson, who has lived in Auburn Gresham for
nearly fifty years. It’s what they always do, period, no matter the weather.
And with heat waves becoming more frequent and more severe, living in a
neighborhood with a social infrastructure like Auburn Gresham’s is the
rough equivalent of having a working air conditioner in every home.
I first reported my findings about the significance of the social
infrastructure during the Chicago disaster in my dissertation, and then in a
book called Heat Wave. When I finished, I began thinking beyond that
particular catastrophic event and investigating the ways that local resources
such as libraries, barbershops, and community organizations affect people
during ordinary times too. I took a closer look at the neighborhoods that
proved so resilient during the heat wave, and I noticed something
extraordinary: they were always significantly safer and healthier than other
places that are demographically similar, and by margins that were
startlingly large. A half decade before the disaster, for instance, life
expectancy in Auburn Gresham was more than five years higher than it was
in Englewood. The disparity was even greater—ten years—in another
matched pair of adjacent neighborhoods that I’d compared extensively:
longevity in South Lawndale (also known as Little Village) was
significantly higher than in North Lawndale.
These differences were so dramatic, and so pervasive, that they made
me wonder whether social infrastructure was even more important than I’d
realized. I needed to explore the hidden networks and taken-for-granted

---

---

systems that support—or, in some cases, undermine—all variety of
collective life.

This time, I really did leave Chicago. After all, my hometown’s depleted
neighborhoods are not the only places that suffer from social disconnection,
and the problems affected by social infrastructure transcend heat and health.
I moved to New York City, where I began teaching at New York University,
and I spent two years at Stanford University. I conducted research in many
American cities as well as Argentina, England, France, the Netherlands,
Japan, and Singapore. While each of the places I’ve studied has distinctive
ecological challenges, political systems, and cultural orientations, their
residents share similar concerns. Today, societies around the world are
becoming more fragmented, divided, and conflicted. The social glue has
come undone.
According to Canada’s Global News, “We all live in a bubble.” The
BBC warns that “class segregation” is “on the rise,” in England. Today
Online reports that “India is regressing in the happiness rankings primarily
due to abysmal social capital and a lack of interpersonal trust.” Distrust and
fear stemming from extreme inequality have fueled a spike in gated
communities and armed private security across Latin America. The
Associated Press reports that “private guards outnumber public officers” by
four to one in Brazil, five to one in Guatemala, and nearly seven to one in
Honduras. Foreign Policy notes that in China, “stratification has emerged in
a society that had hitherto tried to eradicate the very concept…. Social class
has become increasingly entrenched, opportunities for upward mobility
increasingly limited.” Even the Internet, which was supposed to deliver
unprecedented cultural diversity and democratic communication, has
become an echo chamber where people see and hear what they already
believe.
In the United States, the presidential election of 2016 was an especially
disturbing example of political polarization, and the long campaign exposed

---

social chasms far deeper than even the most worried experts had
recognized. The language of red and blue states seems too weak to describe
America’s splintered cultural and political geography.
The oppositions are not merely ideological, and the divisions run deeper
than Trump vs. Clinton, Black Lives Matter vs. Blue Lives Matter, Save the
Planet vs. Drill, Baby, Drill. Across America, people complain that their
communities feel weaker, that they spend more time on their devices and
less time with one another, that schools and sports teams and workplaces
have become unbearably competitive, that insecurity is rampant, that the
future is uncertain and in some places bleak. Worrying about the decline of
communities is a hallmark of modern societies and a trope among public
intellectuals. Although I’ve written extensively about social isolation, I’ve
long been a skeptic of claims that we’re lonelier and more disconnected
than we were in some mythical golden age. But even I am forced to
acknowledge that, in the United States, as in other parts of the world, the
social order now feels precarious. Authoritarian leaders threaten to undo
entrenched democratic systems. Nations break away from political
alliances. Cable news tells its viewers only what they want to hear.
These fissures are expanding at an inopportune moment. The United
States, like most developed nations, faces profound challenges—including
climate change, an aging population, runaway inequality, and explosive
ethnic divisions—that we can address only if we establish stronger bonds
with one another and develop some shared interests too. After all, in a
deeply divided society each group fends for itself above all others: The rich
may make philanthropic contributions, but their own interests are
paramount. The young neglect the old. Industries pollute without regard for
those downwind or downstream.
Few seem happy about these divisions—oddly, not even the winners.
For much of the twentieth century, business leaders and wealthy families
believed that they too would benefit from a social pact with blue-collar
workers and middle-class professionals; after the Depression, they even
supported housing and unemployment insurance for the poor. The system
that the United States created was hardly perfect, and entire social programs
(for housing, health, and education, among others) said to benefit “the
public” actually excluded African Americans and Latinos, who were

---

forcibly relegated into separate social worlds. But by sharing the wealth,
investing in vital infrastructure, and promoting an ever-expanding vision of
the common good, the nation achieved unprecedented levels of not only
social stability but social security too.
Today, this collective project is in shambles. In recent decades, the
1 percent has taken home an outsize share of the nation’s economic gains,
while the bottom 80 percent of workers have seen their wages stagnate or
decline. When millions lost their homes in the foreclosure crisis, the most
affluent Americans locked up their spoils, buying “safe deposit boxes in the
sky” in soaring urban condominium towers. Those who could afford it went
one step further, building survivalist retreats in New Zealand or the wooded
Pacific Northwest, secluded places where they can prepare for civilization’s
end. Meanwhile, the quality of public services deteriorated badly, as did the
nation’s critical infrastructure. A small number of extraordinarily wealthy
people built parallel private systems for air travel, personal security, even
electricity; the merely well-off got fast-tracked (in airports, on special toll
roads, and even in amusement park lines). The result is apparent
everywhere: the great majority endures systems that are crumbling from
overuse and underinvestment. Public transit lines are shoddy and
overcrowded. Parks and playgrounds are poorly maintained. Public schools
are underperforming. Branch libraries have reduced their hours, and in
some cases closed for good. Heat, rain, fire, and wind wreak havoc on
places that could once withstand them. Vulnerability is in the air.
None of this is sustainable.
American voters said as much in 2016, electing (albeit through the
Electoral College rather than by a majority at the polls) a president who
promised to blow up the system. But America’s divisions have only
deepened since President Trump took office. Today, the specter of social
unrest haunts cities, communities, and college campuses across the country.
We fear one another, and everyone wants protection from the other side.
As a sociologist, I have grave concerns about the powerful trembling of
these social fault lines. As a citizen, I can’t help asking how we can rebuild
the foundations of civil society in the kinds of diverse, democratic nations
we find throughout the world today. As a student of history, I wonder how
we can move beyond violent opposition to a perceived nemesis and develop

---

---

a sense of shared purpose based on commitments to justice and decency. As
a parent of young children, I wonder whether we can repair things so that
they will have a chance to flourish and not spend their lives cleaning up our
mess.
But how will we do this? Economic development is certainly one
solution, though increasing national prosperity helps a society become more
cohesive only if everyone—not just the most successful—shares in the
gains. Besides economic growth, two ideas about how to rebuild society
have dominated the conversation: One is technocratic, and involves
engineering physical systems that enhance security and facilitate the
circulation of people and goods. The other is civic, and involves promoting
voluntary associations—the Masons, the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, block clubs, gardening groups, and
bowling leagues—that bind people into communities. Both ideas are
important, but they’re only partial solutions. Social infrastructure is the
missing piece of the puzzle, and building places where all kinds of people
can gather is the best way to repair the fractured societies we live in today.

It’s long been understood that social cohesion develops through repeated
human interaction and joint participation in shared projects, not merely
from a principled commitment to abstract values and beliefs. Alexis de
Tocqueville admired the laws that formally established America’s
democratic order, but he argued that voluntary organizations were the real
source of the nation’s robust civic life. John Dewey claimed that social
connection is predicated on “the vitality and depth of close and direct
intercourse and attachment.” “Democracy must begin at home,” he
famously wrote, “and its home is the neighborly community.”
Contemporary students of civil society have made similar observations.
In Bowling Alone, the Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam attributes
declines in health, happiness, education, economic productivity, and trust to
the collapse of community and diminished participation in civic

---

organizations. In Coming Apart, the conservative pundit Charles Murray
argues that the “American project” has always been based on human beings
“coming together voluntarily to solve their joint problems.” This “civic
culture” was once “so widely shared among Americans that it amounted to
a civil religion,” Murray writes, echoing Tocqueville. But recently—and
here is the source of his title—the “new upper class” has effectively
abandoned the collective project, forming a separate society based on
“spatial, economic, educational, cultural, and, to some degree, political
isolation.” Unless the nation renews its sense of solidarity across class lines,
Murray warns, “Everything that makes America exceptional will have
disappeared.”
Both Putnam and Murray advocate changing our cultural attitudes
toward civic life and community building, and recommitting to the common
good. For nearly two decades, Putnam’s magisterial account of declining
social capital and his clarion call for more public engagement have
influenced political officials, religious leaders, activists, journalists, and
scholars alike. Yet the problems that made Putnam anxious when he
published Bowling Alone are just as prevalent today, and in some ways
more extreme.
In the late 1990s, when the book was written, one of Putnam’s principal
concerns was that families had retreated from public life—the world of
sports leagues and community groups—in favor of the private living room,
where parents and children gathered together to watch TV. Today, of course,
an evening when an entire family watches the same program in a common
room is something like a utopian fantasy. Maybe on a special occasion: the
Super Bowl, the Oscars, a presidential election, or a session of collective
video gaming. But on typical nights it’s everyone on their own device.
Drawing on the best available data on American social behavior, the
Harvard sociologist Peter Marsden shows that, surprisingly, trends in social
activity have been fairly steady since the 1970s. Americans spend a bit
more time with friends and a bit less time with neighbors than they used to,
and, to no one’s surprise, they’re more likely to socialize on the Internet
than in a restaurant or bar. Membership in traditional voluntary
organizations hasn’t changed much either. But Americans are also more
likely than they used to be to say that they cannot trust “most people.” The

---

---

most recent numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show a modest but
steady decline in rates of volunteering, with participation going down
“across persons of all levels of educational attainment.” Immersion in their
private worlds, writes the Berkeley sociologist Claude Fischer, probably
goes hand in hand with alienation from public life.
Moral suasion has failed to increase our level of engagement in local
institutions, where democracy takes root. But cultural values, and
exhortations to change them, are not the only influences on our everyday
social routines. As proponents of the New Urbanism movement have
demonstrated, people with the same interest in social connection,
community building, and civic participation have varying opportunities to
achieve those things depending on the conditions in the places where they
spend time. The social and physical environment shapes our behavior in
ways we’ve failed to recognize; it helps make us who we are and
determines how we live.

This book argues that social infrastructure plays a critical but
underappreciated role in modern societies. It influences seemingly mundane
but actually consequential patterns, from the way we move about our cities
and suburbs to the opportunities we have to casually interact with strangers,
friends, and neighbors. It is especially important for children, the elderly,
and other people whose limited mobility or lack of autonomy binds them to
the places where they live. But social infrastructure affects everyone. And
while social infrastructure alone isn’t sufficient to unite polarized societies,
protect vulnerable communities, or connect alienated individuals, we can’t
address these challenges without it. In this book, I’ll explain how and why.
Infrastructure is a relatively new and entirely modern concept. It is “a
collective term for the subordinate parts of an undertaking, substructure,
foundation,” says the Oxford English Dictionary, and the higher-order
projects it supports could be economic, military, or social. “It is by
definition invisible, part of the background for other kinds of work,” writes

---

Susan Leigh Star, the late scholar of science and technology, in a classic
article, “The Ethnography of Infrastructure.” It is embedded, “sunk into and
inside of other structures, social arrangements, and technologies,” she adds.
It is “transparent to use, in the sense that it does not have to be reinvented
each time or assembled for each task, but invisibly supports those tasks.” Its
scope, in time and in space, is large. It is “fixed in modular increments, not
all at once or globally.” It is taken for granted by members of the group that
use it most often. And, crucially, it becomes most visible when it breaks
down.
The Vanderbilt University anthropologist Ashley Carse writes that the
word “infrastructure” first came to the English language in the late
nineteenth century, from France, where it was used to refer to the
engineering work required for new railways, such as building
embankments, bridges, and tunnels. After World War II, infrastructure
became a buzzword in military and economic development circles.
“Infrastructure was more than a word,” Carse claims. “It was world-
making,” because it justified “specific visions and theories of political and
socioeconomic organization” that Cold War planners advocated. The
infrastructure concept catapulted from policy jargon into popular American
discourse in the 1980s, when, perhaps surprisingly, President Ronald
Reagan said his foreign policy objective was to help developing countries
foster “the infrastructure of democracy, the system of a free press, unions,
political parties, universities, which allows a people to choose their own
way.”
Today, the word “infrastructure” usually makes us think of what
engineers and policy makers refer to as hard or physical infrastructure:
large-scale systems for transit, electricity, gas, oil, food, finance, sewage,
water, heat, communications, and storm protection. Sometimes experts call
these systems the “critical infrastructure,” because policy makers perceive
them to be essential for functioning societies.
When the levees break, cities and coastal areas flood, sometimes
catastrophically. When the power goes out, most businesses, health care
providers, and schools cannot operate, and many transit and
communications networks stop running too. Breakdowns in the fuel supply
can be even more consequential, since oil generates most of our heat and

---

gas powers the trucks that deliver nearly all the food and medications
consumed in large cities and suburbs as well as the automobiles that most
people depend on to travel. No one needs a lengthy description of the
problems that occur when the sewage system stops working. But the real
problems come when several or all of these systems collapse
simultaneously, as they do during extreme weather events or terrorist
attacks. Unfortunately, history shows that such things are impossible to
prevent, no matter how sophisticated our technology or design. And, as
most policy makers and engineers see it, when hard infrastructure fails, as it
did in the great Chicago heat wave, it’s the softer, social infrastructure that
determines our fate.
“Infrastructure” is not a term conventionally used to describe the
underpinnings of social life. But this is a consequential oversight, because
the built environment—and not just cultural preferences or the existence of
voluntary organizations—influences the breadth and depth of our
associations. If states and societies do not recognize social infrastructure
and how it works, they will fail to see a powerful way to promote civic
engagement and social interaction, both within communities and across
group lines.
What counts as social infrastructure? I define it capaciously. Public
institutions, such as libraries, schools, playgrounds, parks, athletic fields,
and swimming pools, are vital parts of the social infrastructure. So too are
sidewalks, courtyards, community gardens, and other green spaces that
invite people into the public realm. Community organizations, including
churches and civic associations, act as social infrastructures when they have
an established physical space where people can assemble, as do regularly
scheduled markets for food, furniture, clothing, art, and other consumer
goods. Commercial establishments can also be important parts of the social
infrastructure, particularly when they operate as what the sociologist Ray
Oldenburg called “third spaces,” places (like cafés, diners, barbershops, and
bookstores) where people are welcome to congregate and linger regardless
of what they’ve purchased. Entrepreneurs typically start these kinds of
businesses because they want to generate income. But in the process, as
close observers of the city such as Jane Jacobs and the Yale ethnographer

---

Elijah Anderson have discovered, they help produce the material
foundations for social life.
What doesn’t qualify as social infrastructure? Transit networks
determine where we live, work, and play, and how long it takes to move
between places. But whether they’re social infrastructure depends on how
they’re organized, since a system designed for private vehicles will likely
keep people separate as they travel (and consume enormous amounts of
energy), whereas public systems that use buses and trains can enhance civic
life. Although they have obvious social impacts, waterworks, waste
treatment facilities, sewage systems, fuel supply lines, and electric grids are
usually not social infrastructures. (We don’t congregate in these places.) But
conventional hard infrastructure can be engineered to double as social
infrastructure.
Take the case of levees. A simple levee is an artificial embankment that
people build to prevent water from going into places they don’t want it to
be. “A levee,” write Marshall Brain and Robert Lamb, on the popular
How Stuff Works website, “is typically little more than a mound of less
permeable soil, like clay, wider at the base and narrower at the top. These
mounds run in a long strip, sometimes for many miles, along a river, lake or
ocean.” This kind of levee is physical infrastructure that protects social life
on the dry side, not a robust social infrastructure. But levees can be
designed differently. In the late 1930s, for instance, engineers needed to
protect Washington, DC’s Federal Triangle neighborhood after a spell of
heavy rains led to massive urban flooding. They could have put up a narrow
mound of soil, but instead they built the Potomac Park Levee, a sloped
walking path capped by a curved stone wall. In subsequent years the dual-
purpose levee and parkland became one of the most popular public spaces
in the city, a place where thousands of people go daily without even
knowing that they’re on top of a critical infrastructure. Today, a growing
number of architects and engineers are designing hard infrastructure, such
as seawalls and bridges, so that it also functions as social infrastructure by
incorporating parks, walking trails, and community centers. These projects,
which already exist in places like Istanbul, Singapore, Rotterdam, and New
Orleans, provide multiple benefits, from protecting against storm surges to
promoting participation in public life.

---

Different kinds of social infrastructure play different roles in the local
environment, and support different kinds of social ties. Some places, such
as libraries, YMCAs, and schools, provide space for recurring interaction,
often programmed, and tend to encourage more durable relationships.
Others, such as playgrounds and street markets, tend to support looser
connections—but of course these ties can, and sometimes do, grow more
substantial if the interactions become more frequent or the parties establish
a deeper bond. Countless close friendships between mothers, and then
entire families, begin because two toddlers visit the same swing set.
Basketball players who participate in regular pickup games often befriend
people with different political preferences, or with a different ethnic,
religious, or class status, and wind up exposed to ideas they wouldn’t likely
encounter off the court.
Social infrastructures that promote efficiency tend to discourage
interaction and the formation of strong ties. One recent study, for instance,
shows that a day care center that encourages caregivers and parents to walk
in and wait for their children, often inside the classroom and generally at
the same time, fosters more social connections and supportive relationships
than one where managers allow parents to come in on their own schedules
and hurry through drop-off and pickup so they can quickly return to their
private lives. Because much of our hard infrastructure—highways, airports,
food supply chains, and the like—is designed to promote efficient
circulation of people or vital resources, it can accelerate the trend of social
atomization. Think, for example, about the contrast between a village where
everyone gets their water from the same well and a city where everyone
gets their water from faucets in their private homes.
Not all hard infrastructure leads to isolation. A recent ethnographic
study of the New York City subway system, for instance, shows that people
forge “transient communities” as they ride through the metropolis. The
daily experience of spending time on crowded train cars rarely leads to
long-term relationships, but it helps passengers learn to deal with
difference, density, diversity, and other people’s needs. It fosters
cooperation and trust. It exposes people to unexpected behavior and
challenges stereotypes about group identity. The subway is not only New

---

York City’s main social artery but also its largest and most heterogeneous
public space.
While the subway is a form of social infrastructure that, like public
athletic fields and childcare centers, promotes interaction across group
lines, some social infrastructures encourage bonds among people who
already have a great deal in common. In elite American communities,
private country clubs, some of which forbid female members and
informally exclude certain ethnic or racial minorities, help build strong
social ties and business networks that ultimately deepen the nation’s
divisions and inequities. Border walls, including the one that currently
separates parts of Israel and Palestine as well as the one that President
Trump promises to build on the border of Mexico and the United States, are
quintessentially antisocial infrastructures. Paradoxically, zones around
border walls, including checkpoints and access gates, often attract a diverse
set of people, including members of the very groups that the structure is
meant to separate, and occasionally they become sites for political
engagement and protest. But their net impact is unmistakable: on good
days, they segregate, discriminate, and entrench inequalities; on bad days,
they incite violence.
Given the world’s cultural diversity, it’s no surprise that there is great
variety in the kinds of social infrastructure that people find essential. In
rural areas, for instance, hunting clubs, town halls, and fairgrounds are key
sites for gathering, and community suppers are a staple of local life.
Watering holes are hubs of social activity in societies across the planet, and
some are especially important. “Of all the social institutions that mold
men’s lives between home and work in an industrial town,” writes the
Mass Observation collective, in a classic ethnographic study of British
industrial culture, the pub is more prevalent, “holds more people, takes
more of their time and money, than church, cinema, dance-hall, and
political organizations put together.” In other public places, ordinary people
are “the audiences, watchers of political, religious, dramatic, cinematic,
instructional or athletic spectacles,” but in the pub, things are different.
“Once a man has bought or been bought his glass of beer, he has entered an
environment in which he [is] participator rather than spectator.” Drinking
grounds serve as sites of civic activity in other societies, of course. The

---

Germans have their beer gardens, the French their cafés, the Japanese their
izakayas and karaoke bars. They are vivid examples of those “third places,”
the small, warm, intimate settings where people in public can feel like
they’re at home.
I’ve observed all kinds of collective life made possible by strong social
infrastructures in foreign settings. For several years my family and I spent
part of the winter living and working in Buenos Aires, and some of our
most rewarding encounters with local residents happened around a soccer
field (which in fact was a playground that children informally converted for
their purposes every afternoon) where my son became a regular. In Doha
and Jerusalem, as in so many Middle Eastern and African cities, I was
continually pulled into the magnetic cultural activity at the souk. I never
joined the early morning Tai Chi or group dance sessions in the parks near
the places I stayed in Shanghai or Beijing, but undoubtedly millions of
older Chinese people participate in them regularly for the social as well as
physical benefits. In Iceland, geothermal swimming pools called “hot pots”
are vital civic spaces, where people regularly cross class and generational
lines. The Mexican zócalo, the Spanish plaza (or plaça, in Barcelona), and
the Italian piazza serve the same function. I’ve never been to Rio de
Janeiro, the Seychelles, Kingston, Jamaica, or Cape Town, but I’ve spent
enough time in other coastal areas and lakefronts to know that nearly
everyone appreciates the social opportunities created by a well-maintained
beach.
Few modern social infrastructures are natural, however, and in densely
populated areas even beaches and forests require careful engineering and
management to meet human needs. This means that all social infrastructure
requires investment, whether for development or upkeep, and when we fail
to build and maintain it, the material foundations of our social and civic life
erode.
The components of social infrastructure rarely crash as completely or as
visibly as a fallen bridge or a downed electrical line, and their breakdowns
don’t result in immediate systemic failures. But when the social
infrastructure gets degraded, the consequences are unmistakable. People
reduce the time they spend in public settings and hunker down in their safe
houses. Social networks weaken. Crime rises. Older and sick people grow

---

---

isolated. Younger people get addicted to drugs and become more vulnerable
to lethal overdoses. Distrust rises and civic participation wanes.

Robust social infrastructure doesn’t just protect our democracy; it
contributes to economic growth. One of the most influential trends in urban
and regional planning involves converting old hard infrastructure, like
discontinued rail lines and shipping docks, into vibrant social
infrastructures for pedestrian activities. The High Line, which has driven
billions of dollars of real estate and commercial development in Lower
Manhattan, generated explosive social activity—and, alas, fueled runaway
gentrification and displacement—is the most prominent model of this
emerging urban form. But many other recent or current projects are reviving
dead infrastructure with social infrastructure networks that attract residents,
tourists, and businesses. The Belt Line in Atlanta is developing slowly, but
will ultimately repurpose a twenty-two-mile rail corridor circling the city
into thirty-three miles of trails, as well as a string of parks, public artworks,
and affordable housing projects, that help connect some forty-five
neighborhoods. In New Orleans, the Lafitte Greenway is a bicycle and
pedestrian trail that’s designed to connect people and neighborhoods that
might otherwise remain divided. The 606 Trail in Chicago, the Philadelphia
Viaduct Rail Park, the Los Angeles River Revitalization, and the Petite
Ceinture in Paris are being designed to do similar work. After burying the
highway, Boston built a greenway on top of the Big Dig. Today, the Toronto
City Council is trying to develop an urban park in the underpass of the
Gardiner Expressway. A coalition in Sydney, Australia, is pushing to
convert the Anzac Bridge into a massive pedestrian green space. The garden
and walking path that Rotterdam developed on an abandoned elevated train
track has environmental as well as social benefits. The designer, Doepel
Strijkers, engineered a system that uses industrial waste to heat buildings
along rails, dramatically reducing their carbon emissions and making the air
that pedestrians breathe a little cleaner.

---

Across the planet, projects like these evince the value of social
infrastructure, and the rising demand for it as well. Not long ago, Jane
Jacobs and other prominent advocates for improving urban life argued that
entrepreneurs, not governments, should build the spaces that support our
social interactions. But places like the High Line have not emerged from the
free market. They required thoughtful design, careful planning, and,
crucially, enlightened leadership from the public sector. Often they
advanced through partnerships, with nonprofit organizations and civic
coalitions supporting initiatives that cities and states couldn’t undertake on
their own.
Today, the United States, like most other nations, is primed to make a
historic investment in infrastructure, the kind we haven’t made in
generations. Despite their many disagreements, American voters are
undivided in their support for such public works projects. The need for
significant infrastructure spending, if not necessarily the way to pay for it,
was one of the few things that both Trump and Clinton agreed on in the
2016 presidential campaign. In coming decades, perhaps even in the next
few years, we will invest hundreds of billions of dollars in critical
infrastructure across the country, trillions around the world. Given the
extraordinary stresses that are coming from our growing population, rising
consumption, and global warming, and the sorry state of the systems that
Americans rely on for electricity, transit, food, water, communications, and
climate protection, we have no choice.
What we must decide, however, is whether rebuilding our social
infrastructure will be part of this project. Most current debates about
infrastructure investment in the United States focus exclusively on
conventional hardline systems, as if the material underpinning of our social
and civic life were an unrelated concern. To be fair, one reason for that
omission, in this country at least, is that social infrastructure is not yet a
familiar concept. Other nations treat infrastructure more expansively,
though, and we should too, lest we squander a historic opportunity to
strengthen the places where we live and work.
To that end, this book will identify the elementary forms of social
infrastructure and show how they shape conditions in different kinds of
places, urban and suburban, rich and poor, in the United States and around

---

the world. When possible, I’ll use the same comparative method I used to
study the fate of Chicago neighborhoods, since looking closely at positive
and negative cases is a powerful way to illustrate what works and what
doesn’t, and sometimes even why. Most of the evidence I’ll marshal to
support my claims comes from my own research and experiences. But I will
also draw heavily on pioneering studies by colleagues across the social
sciences and design fields that show how places shape human interaction
and determine our fate. Although they rarely use the term, the body of
research they’ve produced helped me understand the value of social
infrastructure and its potential role in rebuilding civic life.
In the chapters ahead, I’ll show how social infrastructure can alleviate—
or, when neglected, exacerbate—contemporary problems that we spend a
great deal of time, money, and energy trying to solve: social isolation,
crime, education, health, polarization, and climate change.
As we explore these global challenges, we’ll see that in every case the
social infrastructure is just as important as the critical networks we’ve
always prioritized, and that each depends on the other in ways we’ve yet to
fully appreciate. My argument is neither that social infrastructure matters
more than conventional hard infrastructure, nor that investing in social
infrastructure is sufficient to solve the underlying problems of economic
inequality and environmental degradation that make this moment so
dangerous. It’s that building new social infrastructure is just as urgent as
repairing our levees, airports, and bridges. Often, as we will see, we can
strengthen both simultaneously, building lifeline systems that are also, to
borrow the phrase that Andrew Carnegie used to describe the twenty-eight
hundred or so grand libraries that he built across the world, “palaces for the
people.” But first we need to recognize the opportunity.

## CHAPTER ONE

## A Place to Gather

It’s a balmy Thursday morning in the New Lots neighborhood of East New
York, Brooklyn, 70 degrees and sunny on the last day of March. The
sidewalks have awakened. Small groups of middle-aged men banter outside
bodegas and on stoops of the small, semidetached brick houses that are
common in the area. Mothers and grandmothers push strollers and watch
over preschool children who hop and skip and revel in the unseasonable
warmth. It seems early for recess, but the schoolyards are buzzing. Traffic is
light on the narrow residential streets, but occasionally someone honks, a
motorcycle engine fires, a truck roars past.
Street life in East New York is busy, but not always congenial. The
district is one of the poorest in New York City, with about half the residents

---

living below the poverty line. It’s also one of the most segregated. Nearly
95 percent of residents are black or Latino, and only 1 percent are white.
Social scientists sometimes call East New York socially isolated, because its
peripheral location and limited public transit options restrict access to
opportunities in other parts of the city, while people who don’t live there
have little reason to visit and strong incentives to stay away.
The area is among the most violent neighborhoods in New York City,
with especially high levels of homicide, felony assault, and sexual assault.
Conditions like these are bad for everyone, but research shows that they’re
particularly treacherous for older, sick, and frail people, who are prone to
hunkering down in their apartments and growing dangerously isolated when
they live in inhospitable physical environments. That’s not only what I
observed in the Chicago heat wave; it’s what social scientists who conduct
large-scale studies of isolation have found as well.
Living in a place like East New York requires developing coping
strategies, and for many residents, the more vulnerable older and younger
ones in particular, the key is to find safe havens. As on every other
Thursday morning this spring, today nine middle-aged and elderly residents
who might otherwise stay home alone will gather in the basement of the
neighborhood’s most heavily used public amenity, the New Lots branch
library.
At first glance, it’s an uninviting facility. The run-down, two-story
brown brick building is set back behind a wide sidewalk and bus stop, with
a beige stone facade at the entry, a broken chain-link fence on one side and
a small asphalt parking lot on the other. In recent years the city designated
the library site “African Burial Ground Square,” because it sits atop a
cemetery used to inter slaves and soldiers during the Revolutionary War.
The library is small, and it’s already crowded despite the early hour and
the good weather. There are two banks of computer terminals with Internet
access on the first floor, and patrons, sometimes more than one, at every
machine. There’s a small display case holding photographs and short
biographies of Nobel Prize winners; tall wooden bookshelves with new
releases, atlases, and encyclopedias; an information desk with flyers
promoting library events for toddlers, young readers, teens, parents,

---

English-language students, and older patrons. One librarian asks if I need
anything. Another stacks books.
I ask to see the second floor, and Edwin, a sweet and soft-spoken
information supervisor, takes me upstairs. Here there are three separate
universes. A designated children’s space, which is worn but, Edwin says,
about to get renovated; a set of tables for English-language courses, which
are always oversubscribed; and, in the back, a classroom that serves as the
library’s Learning Center, a place where anyone over age seventeen who’s
reading below GED level can get special instruction, individually and in
groups.
Everyone is welcome at the library, regardless of whether they’re a
citizen, a permanent resident, or even a convicted felon. And all of it, Edwin
reminds me, is free.
I tell Edwin that I’m here for the event in the basement community
room, and it turns out he’s heading there too. We walk downstairs together
and he points out the building’s deterioration. The shelves, ceilings,
stairwells, and wall panels are wearing out. Wires are exposed. There are
rusted toilets and sinks in the bathroom. The doors don’t close properly. In
the community room there’s an aging, cream-colored linoleum floor, glaring
fluorescent lights, wood paneling, and a small stage strewn with plastic
stacking chairs. I think about the burial ground that was here and I realize
we can’t be far from the bones.
The community room serves many purposes: theater, classroom, art
studio, civic hall. But this morning two staff members, Terry and Christine,
will transform it into something unusual: a virtual bowling alley. They’ve
arrived early to set up a flat screen television, link an Xbox to the Internet,
clear out a play space, and assemble two rows of portable chairs. It’s
opening day of the Library Lanes Bowling League, a new program that
encourages older patrons in twelve libraries in Brooklyn to join local teams
and compete against neighboring branches. Nine people at New Lots signed
up to play, and after weeks of practice, they’re about to take on Brownsville
and Cypress Hills.
Branch libraries offer something for everyone, but the extra services and
programming that they provide for older people are particularly important.
As of 2016, more than twelve million Americans aged sixty-five and above

---

live by themselves, and the ranks of those who are aging alone is growing
steadily in much of the world. Although most people in this situation are
socially active, the risk of isolation is formidable. A fall, an illness, or the
inevitable advance toward frailty can render them homebound. If older
friends and neighbors move away or die, their social networks can quickly
unravel. If they get depressed, their interest in being out in the world can
diminish. Street crime discourages everyone from going outdoors and
socializing in public, but it’s particularly intimidating for the old. In
neighborhoods where crime is high or the social infrastructure is depleted,
old people are more likely to stay home, alone, simply because they lack
compelling places to go.
New Lots has its library, though, and today the doors open at 10 a.m.
Soon after, ten patrons, eight women and two men (one who’s here to
watch) ranging in age from fifty to nearly ninety, walk downstairs. Among
them are Miss Jonny, who sports wraparound sunglasses, tall red boots, a
black-and-red polka-dot scarf, and a gray newsboy cap. There’s Suhir, in a
seafoam sweat suit and a white hijab. Santon, a soft-spoken man from
Guyana, dons a blue baseball cap and loose-fitting green trousers. Una,
Bern, Salima, Miba, Daisy, and Jesse round out the crew. They greet one
another warmly. Some women hug. A few clasp hands. Daisy gives Una a
gentle high five that turns into a longer touch and a smile.
Terry, an ebullient library information specialist with big eyes and a
dazzlingly bright smile, hands each player a royal blue bowling shirt with a
white public library logo on the front pocket and TEAM NEW LOTS in yellow
on the sleeve. Terry is the team’s coach and cheerleader, and she’s trying to
pump them up for the match. Christine, a veteran librarian who wears
rectangular glasses and holds a pencil and a phone in her shirt pocket, is the
main organizer, having recruited participants from the computer classes and
book clubs she leads at the library. Terry and Christine walk around the
room and help the participants get into their uniforms, buttoning and pulling
them down so they won’t snag when it’s time to bowl.
When everyone is outfitted the players take their seats, making small
talk and tapping their toes in anticipation. Christine tries to link the Xbox to
the machine in the basement at the Brownsville Library, where their
opponents, invisible to us but no doubt similarly composed, have put on

---

their own uniforms and settled in for the match. It worked perfectly in
practice, but this time there’s something wrong with the connection.
Christine calls Brownsville. Yes, they’re there, just working on the Wi-Fi.
In a few minutes, the machines are in sync and the game is on.
Brownsville goes first and the team watches the ball roll up the side of
the alley, taking out a few pins but leaving most upright. There’s some
rumbling and a bit of nervous laughter coming from the seats. It grows
louder when the next roll leaves the opponents’ frame open. Everyone
knows they can win.
Jesse bowls first for New Lots, and she’s not fooling around. “Come on,
Jesse!” Terry shouts. Her teammates clap enthusiastically. “Let’s do this
now!” Terry calls out again. Jesse approaches the screen and stops at the
designated spot about fifteen feet in front of it. She seizes the hand control,
raises her right arm to the sky until the Xbox registers her presence, and
reaches out 90 degrees to take the ball. On screen, the ball rises to show that
she’s ready. Jesse reaches back and sweeps her arm forward, as if she were
rolling a ball up the alley. It’s a powerful roll, and at first it seems on target
but it winds up too true to center and three pins stay standing. Some in the
group applaud. Some sigh in exasperation. Jesse looks incredulous. “You
got this!” Terry yells. “You good.” Jesse approaches the ball again, looking
determined. She lifts, rolls, nails the spare. The room erupts.
The New Lots bowlers kill it, extending their lead frame after frame.
They are old, and some are enfeebled, probably too weak to hold an actual
ball. Only one player had ever participated in an old-fashioned bowling
league, the kind that requires gutters, slick shoes, and a shiny wood floor.
Robert Putnam famously lamented the demise of these leagues during the
late twentieth century. Their disappearance, he argued, signaled a
worrisome decline in social bonds. But here a group of people who could
easily be at home, cut off from friends and neighbors, is involved in
something greater than deep play. They’re participating, fully and
viscerally, in collective life. The mood is electric. Turn by turn, the players
stand, boosted by their teammates’ applause and the librarians’ exhortations,
salute the screen, and demolish their digital targets. “I’m feelin’ for
Brownsville right now,” Terry exclaims. “But not too much!”

---

The team’s confidence is soaring when the second match gets going, but
it doesn’t take long to see that Cypress Hills is for real. The opponents go
first and it’s a strike. Jesse responds with a strike of her own. Then Cypress
Hills rolls another, and Terry makes fish lips, popping her eyes in disbelief.
Suhir makes a spare. New Lots is in it. But then Cypress gets a turkey, three
strikes in a row, and Terry is incredulous. “There’s some funny business
going on here!” she insists. “That’s Walter,” the Cypress Hills librarian. “I
know that’s Walter. I’ma call him out.”
She doesn’t, though, and the Cypress Hills team gradually pulls away
despite strong performances from most of the New Lots players. The game
goes by quickly and the mood, naturally, is more subdued. When it ends
there’s a short pause and a little confusion about what will happen. “We
should ask them for a rematch,” Christine says. “I think we can beat ’em.”
Christine jumps on the phone, a landline attached to the wall, and
reaches Walter at the other library. She ribs him a little: “That wasn’t you
bowling, was it?” She smiles for a beat. “Uh-huh. Right. Well, hey, it’s still
early, you guys want to do another?” They did, and in a few moments
they’re back at it again.
This time New Lots takes nothing for granted. Terry, who’s decided that
if Walter is playing then she is also, jumps in and knocks down everything.
Santon hits a spare. “It’s all you, Miss Jonny!” Terry shouts, and Miss
Jonny makes her first strike of the morning. Bern follows with another
perfect roll, then Una does the same, and now New Lots has its own turkey
and a sizable lead. Terry is ecstatic. She screams out encouragement and
struts around the room in circles with each strike or spare. When Jesse seals
the victory with a strike in the tenth frame, the entire group is joyous, like
Yankee Stadium after a play-off win.
There are team photos, high fives, and hugs all around. Christine tells
the players that there will be trophies for the top teams and a giant trophy
for the library that wins everything. Miba, feeling bold and full of swagger,
suggests that they just engrave New Lots on it now and bring the trophy
over. Her teammates are in hysterics, their smiles as deep as a lifetime.
The celebration lasts just a few minutes. It’s noon, the players are
hungry, and there are hours of sunshine ahead. I congratulate the team and

---

---

wish them good luck on the season. “Thanks,” Terry says. “We gonna be
fine.”
I leave feeling uplifted by the cheering, the camaraderie, the joy of
watching people who hardly know one another turn their neighborhood into
a community. It was a rare moment of what the great French sociologist
Émile Durkheim called “collective effervescence,” and I hadn’t expected it,
not at the library.
Today, we may have every reason to feel atomized and alienated,
distrustful and afraid—and the demographics are as challenging as the
politics. There are more people living alone than at any point in history,
including more than a quarter of Americans over the age of sixty-five, who
are at particular risk of becoming isolated. That’s worrisome, because, as a
large body of scientific research now shows, social isolation and loneliness
can be as dangerous as more publicized health hazards, including obesity
and smoking. But some places have the power to bring us together, and the
kind of social bonding I witnessed that morning in Brooklyn happens in
thousands of libraries throughout the year.

Libraries are not the kinds of institutions that most social scientists, policy
makers, and community leaders usually bring up when they discuss social
capital and how to build it. Since Tocqueville, most leading thinkers about
social and civic life have extolled the value of voluntary associations like
bowling leagues and gardening clubs without looking closely at the
physical and material conditions that make people more or less likely to
associate. But social infrastructure provides the setting and context for
social participation, and the library is among the most critical forms of
social infrastructure that we have.
It’s also one of the most undervalued. In recent years, modest declines
in the circulation of bound books in some parts of the country have led
some critics to argue that the library is no longer serving its historic
function as a place for public education and social uplift. Elected officials

---

with other spending priorities argue that twenty-first-century libraries no
longer need the resources they once commanded, because on the Internet
most content is free. Architects and designers eager to erect new temples of
knowledge say that libraries should be repurposed for a world where books
are digitized and so much public culture is online.
Many public libraries do need renovations, particularly the
neighborhood branches. But the problem libraries face isn’t that people no
longer visit them or take out books. On the contrary: so many people are
using them, for such a wide variety of purposes, that library systems and
their employees are overwhelmed. According to a 2016 survey conducted
by the Pew Research Center, about half of all Americans aged sixteen and
over used a public library in the past year, and two-thirds say that closing
their local branch would have a “major impact on their community.” In
many neighborhoods the risk of such closures is palpable, because both
local library buildings and the systems that sustain them are underfunded
and overrun.
In New York City, where I live, library circulation is up, program
attendance is up, program sessions are up, and the average number of hours
that people spend in libraries is up too. But New York City doesn’t have an
exceptionally busy library culture, nor is it a national leader. The
distinctions belong to other places: Seattle leads the nation in annual
circulation per capita, followed by Columbus, Indianapolis, San Jose, San
Francisco, Jacksonville, and Phoenix. Columbus has the highest level of
program attendance: five of every ten thousand residents participate in
library activities there each year. San Francisco and Philadelphia are close
behind, as are Boston, Detroit, and Charlotte. New York City trails them all.
New York City also ranks low in per capita government spending for the
system. The New York Public Library receives $32 for every resident, on
par with Austin and Chicago but less than one-third of the San Francisco
Public Library, which gets $101 per resident.
Urban library systems in the United States have long been public-
private partnerships, and city governments have long relied on
philanthropists to fund much of the library’s work. Still, it’s hard to
understand why most cities give so little public support to their libraries.
According to recent reports from the Pew Research Center, more than

---

---

90 percent of Americans see their library as “very” or “somewhat”
important to their community, and in the past decade “every other major
institution (government, churches, banks, corporations) has fallen in public
esteem except libraries, the military, and first responders.” Despite this
support, in recent years cities and suburbs across the United States have cut
funding for libraries, and in some cases closed them altogether, because
political officials often view them as luxuries, not necessities. When hard
times come, their budgets get trimmed first.

Doing research in New York City, I learned that libraries and the social
infrastructure are essential not only for a neighborhood’s vitality but also
for buffering all kinds of personal problems—including isolation and
loneliness. And while these problems may be particularly acute in
struggling neighborhoods like East New York, they’re hardly confined to
them. Consider Denise, a fashion photographer in her late thirties whom I
met in the Seward Park Library children’s floor on a chilly April morning.
She’s wearing jeans, a long black coat, and large tortoiseshell glasses. As
she sits, she scans the room and quickly decompresses. The children’s floor
might not be a second home anymore, not since her daughter started
preschool, but during her first few years of being a mother Denise was here
almost every day.
“I live close,” she tells me. “We moved here six years ago. I didn’t think
about what it would mean to live by a library, not at all. But this place has
become very dear to me. So many good things have happened because we
come here.” Denise stopped working when her daughter was born, but her
husband, an attorney, didn’t. On the contrary, the demands on his time
increased, and he worked well into the evening, leaving her in a small
Manhattan apartment with a baby she loved intensely but also with a feeling
of loneliness beyond anything she’d experienced before. “I had a pretty bad
case of postpartum depression,” she tells me. “There were days when
getting out of the apartment was just a huge struggle. I suddenly went from

---

working in this job I loved to spending all my time at home trying to take
care of things that really matter but that I didn’t know how to do. I felt like I
was in the trenches, you know? You can go crazy like that. I had to get out,
but it was hard. And I didn’t know where to go.”
At first Denise tried taking the baby to coffee shops, hoping she’d nap
or rest quietly while she went online or read. That didn’t happen. “I’d go to
Starbucks and there would be all these people there working or having
meetings. It’s a place for grown-ups, right? When the baby starts crying
everyone turns around and stares at you. It’s like: ‘What are you doing
here? Can’t you take her away?’ It’s definitely not kid-friendly.”
Denise had spent time in libraries as a child in California but hadn’t
used the system much since moving to Manhattan. On one especially
stressful day, though, she put her daughter in the stroller and brought her
into the Seward Park Library, just to see what was there. “An entire world
opened up that day,” she remembers. “There were the books, of course. You
can’t have a lot of them when you live in a small apartment, but here there
are more than we could ever read. And then I discovered that there’s a
whole social scene going on between everyone who comes here. The
parents, the nannies, the children, people in the neighborhood. The
librarians! They are so kind here.”
Immediately, Denise found herself surrounded by other first-time
mothers who shared her struggles but could enjoy the fun parts of parenting
too. She saw that her baby wasn’t the only one crying when everything
seemed fine, refusing to eat or nap. She realized that she wasn’t alone.
Denise also found more experienced mothers and babysitters who could
answer most of her questions. “You just kind of start chatting,” she
explains, “and it’s amazing but you wind up having these really personal,
really intense conversations.” I ask if something similar happens in parks
and playgrounds, and Denise says that it does, to some extent, but that it’s
easier here in the library, especially on the children’s floor. The room is
warm and open, the children are protected, and there’s an ethos that makes
it easy for parents to connect with one another. “It’s like you become part of
the mommy tribe here,” Denise explains, “and that makes parenting a lot
less lonely.” The tribe endures, even when the kids go to school and
mothers spend less time in the local branch. Some of the people Denise and

---

her daughter met during those early years in the library remain close
friends.
The accessible physical space of the library is not the only factor that
makes it work well as social infrastructure. The institution’s extensive
programming, organized by a professional staff that upholds a principled
commitment to openness and inclusivity, fosters social cohesion among
clients who might otherwise keep to themselves. Friendships develop
quickly in the library in part because the place sponsors so many shared
activities for children and, by extension, for caretakers too. Denise and her
daughter did lap-sit classes for early literacy, bilingual song and story hours,
magic shows, and classes for music and art. “In those first years there’s a lot
of unstructured time that you’re just looking to fill,” Denise tells me. “You
can pay to take classes in some places, but it’s expensive, and sometimes
you just can’t get there, the schedule that day doesn’t work out. The library
is great because you can pop over and there’s always something happening.
You just check out the calendar and make it part of your week, or just show
up and jump in.”
Librarians, Denise discovered, play an important role helping parents
and children feel comfortable in the library. Sometimes, she says, they
provide even greater service. “At one point, you know, our cat was not
doing very well. I was thinking, ‘Oh my God, my daughter is so attached to
this cat. What happens if it dies?’ Our librarian had recommended a lot of
children’s books to me, so I asked her for a book that would help my kid
understand death. And you know what? She actually had a few books about
pets who die. She knew what I needed! She knew!” In the end Denise’s cat
recovered. “She really does have nine lives,” she says, laughing. “But I
learned about the kind of resource I have in the library. And I felt lucky to
have that help.”
The help at the library made a difference in the way Denise felt about
herself as a mother, and eventually she gained enough confidence to return
to work. That meant hiring a nanny, and entrusting her daughter to a
stranger wasn’t easy. “That’s such a big emotional hurdle,” she says, “but
there was this one nanny I saw at the library a lot, and I loved the way she
was caring for this little girl. She was really involved and really sweet and
really loving. I knew that’s what I needed for my daughter too. I told the

---

---

nanny I was going back to work and she referred me to the woman who
became, like, not only my nanny, but my favorite person in the world.”
Denise now calls the library “a lifesaver,” and though that may be an
exaggeration, there’s no question that the institution proved valuable in
ways she’d never imagined.

Why have so many public officials and civic leaders failed to recognize the
value of libraries and their role in our social infrastructure? Perhaps it’s
because the founding principle behind the library—that all people deserve
free, open access to our shared culture and heritage, which they can use to
any end they see fit—is out of sync with the market logic that dominates
our time. (If, today, the library didn’t already exist, it’s hard to imagine our
society’s leaders inventing it.) But perhaps it’s because so few influential
people understand the role that libraries already play in modern
communities, or the many roles they could play if they had more support.
In New York, as in cities across the United States and around the world,
neighborhood libraries and librarians do all kinds of unexpected things for
surprisingly large numbers of people. Their core mission is to help people
elevate themselves and improve their situation. Libraries do this,
principally, by providing free access to the widest possible variety of
cultural materials to people of all ages, from all ethnicities and groups.
For older people, especially widows, widowers, and those who live
alone, libraries are places for culture and companionship, through book
clubs, movie nights, sewing circles, and classes in art, music, current
events, and computing. When Library Lanes scales up to the city level, no
old person in the five boroughs need bowl alone again. The elderly can also
participate in some of these activities in senior centers, but there they can
do them only with other old people, and often that makes them feel
stigmatized, as if old is all they are. For many seniors, the library is the
main place they interact with people from other generations. It’s a place
where they can volunteer and feel useful. It’s where they can be part of a

---

---

diverse and robust community, not a homogeneous one where everyone
fears decline.
Libraries provide different benefits to young people. They expose
infants and toddlers to books and stories that would otherwise be
inaccessible. They help youths inch toward independence, giving them
library cards and letting them choose how to use them. Libraries offer
refuge and safe space to teenagers who’d rather study or socialize than hang
out in the streets. Librarians help students with homework and offer after-
school programs in art, science, music, language, and math. They
recommend books, authors, even entire genres to young people who are
searching for something different but can’t yet name it. Libraries help
children and teenagers feel responsible, to themselves and to their
neighbors, by teaching them what it means to borrow and take care of
something public, and to return it so others can have it too.
By doing all this, libraries also help families and caretakers. They
provide a social space and shared activities for new parents, grandparents,
and nannies who feel lonely, disconnected, or overwhelmed when watching
an infant or a toddler by themselves. They help build friendships and
support networks among neighbors who’d never met before taking a library
class. They teach parenting skills to people who want or need them. They
watch children, sometimes very young ones, whose parents work late or on
weekends and who can’t afford childcare. They give families confidence
that their kids are in good hands.

Libraries may be the textbook example of social infrastructure in action, but
other places and institutions do similarly vital work connecting people who
need a hand. The Harvard sociologist Mario Small has looked at how the
organization of different childcare centers shapes relationships among
parents, particularly single mothers. In centers that encourage parental
involvement, even if only at drop-off and pickup, mothers build friendships
even when they’re not looking for companions. These institutions, he

---

writes, “are also spaces for interaction, buildings with halls, stairs, and
lobbies where mothers certainly have an opportunity not only to make
friends but also, when friends do not emerge, to see each other and each
other’s children repeatedly, becoming part of the daily marches from home
to center to work to center to home that organize the habits of many
working mothers.” Through repeated encounters, mothers whose children
attend these institutions develop high levels of trust in one another, and that
quickly yields bonds of friendship and mutual support. The centers become
critical sites of social activity, yielding play dates that give one mother a
few extra hours to work or rest, information about schools and scholarships,
tips about available jobs, and the kind of last-minute emergency help that
every parent occasionally needs.
Not all childcare centers promote this level of support and solidarity.
Donna, one of the mothers whom Small interviews, recounts her experience
at a day care center in a downtown financial district, one that’s set up to
serve a busy corporate clientele. The center has a rolling drop-off and
pickup schedule, designed to match the parents’ long and erratic workdays,
and as a consequence the parents didn’t interact regularly or get to know
one another’s children well. The schedule is not the only issue. The space is
compact and the environment is professional, in keeping with the
neighborhood. There’s not much room for parents to relax and hang out. For
their part, the teachers make little effort to get parents to linger and play
with the kids when they are in the building. The result, Donna says, is that
there are “no parents sitting down and chatting or anything like that.” The
center offered reliable childcare when her son was in the building, but it
didn’t help her develop the relationships she needed in the rest of her life.
Most debates about education focus on the relationship between school
quality and individual student achievement. That’s sensible, since schools
play such an important role in determining people’s fate in modern
societies, even in those where inherited privilege matters more for success
than merit or hard work. But educational institutions do far more than teach
individual students. From childcare centers to research universities, schools
create social worlds that shape and sustain entire communities. They’re our
primary public institutions for establishing democratic ideals and instilling

---

---

civic skills. Schools are our modern agoras, gathering places where we
make and remake ourselves and develop a sense of where we belong.
Schools are organizations, but they’re also social infrastructures. The
way they’re planned, designed, and programmed shapes the interactions
that develop in and around them. For students, teachers, parents, and entire
communities, schools can either foster or inhibit trust, solidarity, and a
shared commitment to the common good. They can also set boundaries that
define who is part of the community and who is excluded. They can
integrate or segregate, create opportunities or keep people in their place.

Schools, of course, are particularly important social spaces for children.
They’re the physical places where students make the friendships that shape
who they become. In fact, there’s a considerable body of psychological
research showing that peer groups and school social environments affect
child development far more than parents do. Since the advent of social
media, however, the Internet and the mobile phone have challenged the
primacy of schools—and not just schools, but all other physical places
where people meet for face-to-face interaction, from pubs to playgrounds,
churches to community groups. Whether and how this affects social
isolation and human connection are two of the most difficult questions of
our time.
The Internet and social media have unquestionably made it easier to
meet new people and maintain contact with friends and family. They allow
us to share all kinds of information, from the most mundane to the most
intimate, with huge numbers of people, in real time. (After all, there are
more than two billion monthly Facebook users alone.) Today, as Aziz
Ansari and I learned when we were doing research for Modern Romance,
the Internet is where Americans are most likely to search for and find their
spouse. It’s where people go when they want to find out where to protest or
rally. And, of course, it’s where they go to post photographs of their
children, their family vacation, their breakfast, themselves.

---

It’s common, these days, to hear that the Internet, and particularly social
media, is making us lonelier and more isolated than ever. These claims may
well feel true to those who long for simpler, happier times—but there’s no
good evidence that they’re accurate. Indeed, research by the Berkeley
sociologist Claude Fischer suggests the opposite: drawing on forty years of
social surveys, Fischer’s work shows that the quality and quantity of
Americans’ relationships are about the same today as they were before the
Internet existed. The most reliable behavioral data available show that using
mobile phones, the Internet, and social media has a positive effect on both
the size and the diversity of people’s personal networks. For most of us,
Facebook friends and Instagram followers are supplements to—not
surrogates for—our social lives. As meaningful as the friendships we
establish online can be, most of us are unsatisfied with virtual ties that
never develop into face-to-face relationships. Building real connections
requires a shared physical environment—a social infrastructure.
Sherry Turkle, an eminent psychologist and scholar of science and
technology at MIT, is particularly interested in the way social media affect
the quality of our interactions. According to her research, the incessant
electronic messaging that’s so common among young people is crowding
out time for face-to-face conversation. That matters, she writes, because
conversation is “the most human—and humanizing—thing we do…. It’s
where we develop the capacity for empathy. It’s where we experience the
joy of being heard, of being understood. And conversation advances self-
reflection, the conversations with ourselves that are the cornerstone of early
development and continue throughout life.”
If in-person conversation is humanizing, online discourse can too often
be the opposite. Apps like Tinder and Ok Cupid allow people to start
electronic conversations with large numbers of strangers, but as Aziz and I
found in our research for Modern Romance, these exchanges often devolve
quickly, with people treating one another more rudely and crudely than they
would in face-to-face interactions. In interviews, even well-meaning people
confessed to feeling that the people they meet online sometimes seem more
“like bubbles on a screen” than flesh-and-bone human beings. What’s
striking about this behavior is that it happens in forums where people are

---

looking for love and intimacy. On other parts of the Internet, from Twitter to
Reddit, the discourse can be even more venomous.
Making social life work well with the Internet isn’t easy, and, as Turkle
recognizes, people throughout the world are growing frustrated with the
excesses of Internet culture. Turkle calls for us to turn away from our
screens and “reclaim conversation,” focusing on the people and places in
front of us. Doing so requires searching for commonalities in those who are
different and for humanity in those who disagree with us. It requires
recognizing that communications technologies work best, and fulfill us
most, when they direct us to physical places that everyone can access.
Consider, for instance, the social group that’s most often accused of
shunning face-to-face interactions in favor of electronic communication:
teenagers.
According to research by danah boyd, director of the research institute
Data & Society, young people spend so much of their social time online
because adults—from helicopter parents to hypervigilant school
administrators and security guards—give them few other options. Despite
higher crime rates, teens in previous generations had more freedom to roam
around their neighborhoods and local public spaces than today’s youths.
They had more unstructured time after school and on weekends; they even
had more free time during school, and far less surveillance. “Increasing
regulation means that there aren’t as many public spaces for teens to
gather,” boyd writes. “Facebook, Twitter, and My Space are not only new
public spaces: they are in many cases the only ‘public’ spaces in which
teens can easily congregate with large groups of their peers. More
significantly, teens can gather in them while still physically stuck at home.”
The teens whom boyd interviewed insisted that they prefer hanging out
in person to messaging on smartphones, but adults have restricted their
mobility so thoroughly that they have few alternatives. The Internet has
become young people’s core social infrastructure because we’ve unfairly
deprived them of access to other sites for meaningful connection. If we fail
to build physical places where people can enjoy one another’s company,
regardless of age, class, race, or ethnicity, we will all be similarly confined.

Libraries are precisely these kinds of places, and in many neighborhoods,
particularly those where young people aren’t hyperscheduled in formal
after-school programs, they’re as popular among adolescents and teenagers
who want to spend time with other kids their age as they are among older
people and new parents. That’s a claim that should be easy to verify: simply
go into the branch library closest to you a few minutes before the school
day is out, and watch as a steady stream of students pours in and settles
down for the afternoon.
Why are libraries such popular places for young people? One reason is
that, as public institutions, they’re open, accessible, and free. Another is that
the library staff welcomes them; in many branches, they even create special
places where teenagers can be with one another. To appreciate why this
matters, compare the social space of the library with the social space of
popular commercial establishments, such as Starbucks or Mc Donald’s.
Commercial entities are valuable parts of the social infrastructure, and
there’s no doubt that classic “third places,” including cafés, bars, and
restaurants, have helped revitalize cities and suburbs. But not everyone can
afford to frequent them, and not all paying customers are welcome to stay
for long. Spending time in a market-driven social setting—even a relatively
inexpensive fast-food restaurant or pastry shop—requires paying for the
privilege. Inside almost every Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, or Mc Donald’s,
particularly those in neighborhoods where there are teenagers, poor people,
or old people around, there’s usually at least one sign that says No
Loitering. And it’s not just a suggestion.
Some New York City Mc Donald’s franchises impose time limits of
twenty or thirty minutes “while consuming food” that, depending on the
client, management may or may not enforce. Race matters, but so too do
class and age. Groups of teenagers are routinely asked to leave commercial
establishments, even after they make their purchases. In 2014, a group of
elderly Korean Americans in New York City publicly challenged a
Mc Donald’s franchise whose managers began to kick them out of the

---

restaurant less than an hour after they’d ordered, charging them with
colonizing the seats and quashing business.
Older and poor people will often avoid Starbucks altogether, because
the fare is too expensive and they feel like they don’t belong. The elderly
library patrons I got to know in New York City told me that they feel even
less welcome in the trendy new coffee shops, cocktail bars, and restaurants
that are so common in gentrifying neighborhoods. Poor and homeless
library patrons don’t even consider entering these places. They know, from
experience, that simply standing outside a high-end eatery or watering hole
can prompt managers to call in the police.
You rarely see a police officer in a library, but libraries are places where
people attend to one another, regardless of what else they are doing. In a
world where we spend ever more of our time staring at screens, blocking
out even our most intimate and proximate human contacts, public
institutions with open-door policies compel us to pay close attention to the
people nearby. After all, places like libraries are saturated with strangers,
people whose bodies are different, whose styles are different, who make
different sounds, speak different languages, give off different, sometimes
noxious, smells. Spending time in public social infrastructures requires
learning to deal with these differences in a civil manner.
This is not to say that public spaces are always peaceful and serene.
During the time I spent in branch libraries, for instance, I witnessed a
variety of conflicts: destitute men arguing over access to the bathroom;
unattended children fistfighting during a special event; an unemployed man
shouting that teenagers were playing video games on computers that should
be for adults only; a mentally ill homeless person disrupting an entire
section of patrons by muttering violent threats. According to a security
guard at a branch I frequented, one day a heroin addict collapsed of an
overdose at a table and had to be rescued by paramedics, and another day
someone defecated on the floor.
These problems are inevitable in a public institution that’s dedicated to
open access, especially when other institutions, from methadone clinics to
homeless shelters and food banks, routinely turn away—and often refer to
the library!—the very people who most need help. But what’s remarkable is
how rarely these disruptions happen, how civilly they are managed, and

---

---

how quickly the library regains its rhythm afterward. Even in the roughest
neighborhoods, branch libraries are not heavily guarded, nor are they
staffed with social workers and counselors. Instead, they establish and
informally enforce their own norms and codes of conduct, trusting patrons
to honor them and getting compliance 99 percent of the time. “You have to
try very, very hard to get kicked out of this library,” one branch manager
told me. “And we’re going to do everything possible to find you a place.”
Everyday life in libraries is a democratic experiment, and people cram
into libraries to participate in it whenever the doors are open.

The openness and diversity that flourishes in neighborhood libraries was
once a hallmark of urban culture; in fact, the most influential theories about
what makes city life culturally distinctive emphasize the pleasures as well
as the challenges of dealing with difference on a daily basis.
In some ways, American cities are growing more diverse. Immigration
is booming, especially in New York City. Today, there are more than three
million immigrants in New York, about one-third of whom have arrived
since 2000. In cities across the country, you can hear languages, eat food,
and find or partake in cultural activities that weren’t much a part of America
a few generations ago. The United States remains an open society that, as
always, incorporates new people and reinvents itself.
In other ways, though, American cities remain divided and unequal,
with some neighborhoods cutting themselves off from difference,
particularly when it comes to race and social class. Some communities do
this by building walls and gates, some by aggressively policing those who
look like they don’t belong. Others, including some enclaves of affluence in
New York City, do it more subtly, perhaps without intent. The real estate
gets so expensive that only the wealthy can afford to live there. Shops and
restaurants go upscale, attracting a certain clientele. The neighborhood
becomes homogeneous and insular, not open and diverse. The social

---

environment grows less hospitable. The architecture becomes forbidding
and severe.
The Seward Park Library, a stately red brick and limestone Italian
Renaissance building at the edge of the nation’s first municipal playground,
Seward Park, might look elite and exclusive. It’s a gorgeous structure, built
from the opulence of a previous gilded age. But the library, which sits at the
point of convergence for Chinatown, a mass of public housing projects, and
a rapidly developing urban glamour zone for young professionals, has long
been the heart of the Lower East Side community. Its doors are open to
everyone, and everyone comes.
For the past 170 years, the Lower East Side has been a popular
neighborhood for poor immigrants, in part because its location, on low-
lying land near the river, made it unattractive for those who could afford a
nicer setting, but mostly because—to this day—it has thousands of
apartment buildings where enormous numbers of people squeeze into units
that look a lot like the tenements that zoning codes no longer allow. In the
mid-nineteenth century, Irish immigrants rushed into the area, pioneers
whom the established New Yorkers blamed for turning a prosperous
neighborhood into an ethnic slum. Then came the Germans, followed by
Eastern European Jews, who stayed in the neighborhood for much of the
twentieth century. A few thousand older Jews as well as a handful of small
synagogues remain there today. But today’s Lower East Side is primarily
Puerto Rican and Chinese and, with a 31 percent child poverty rate, is
disproportionately poor.
In the past decade, the area around Seward Park has begun to gentrify.
Next door, co-op apartments that were originally built for blue-collar union
workers now sell for more than $1 million. Across the street, the former
headquarters for The Forward, the leading newspaper for American Jews,
was recently converted into a luxury condo building. Down the block
there’s Mission Chinese Food, the Manhattan outpost of a San Francisco
culinary sensation whose chef won a Rising Star award from the James
Beard Foundation, an upscale cocktail bar, and, of course, a juice bar. But
for now the neighborhood remains an immigrant enclave, and the landmark
library, one of the original sixty-five libraries in New York City funded by
Andrew Carnegie’s $5.2 million donation in 1901, serves its aspiring

---

residents in more or less the same ways that it has since opening in 1909.
It’s also sustained its level of activity: Seward Park circulates more than
five hundred thousand items annually (about fourteen hundred books and a
handful of DVDs each day) and attracts more than twenty thousand people
into its programs, making it one of the busiest branches in the system.
I first visited the Seward Park Library on a gray January morning. I took
the F train from West Fourth Street to East Broadway, the last stop in
Manhattan, walked past a small encampment where a homeless man was
getting himself together, and went up the stairway to Rutgers Street. The
first thing I noticed was the long string of high-rise red brick public housing
projects clustered around the FDR Drive, near the East River. A few years
before, I’d toured those buildings with the Rebuild by Design competitors
to observe flood damage from Sandy. They’d been inundated with seawater.
The first floors were uninhabitable; the elevators were malfunctioning; the
power, phone, and cable lines in the basement were a tangled, corroded
mess. The common areas outside were ugly and neglected, with cracked
asphalt, uncomfortable benches, small patches of unkempt grass. At the
time I hadn’t thought much about where the thousands of people who lived
in these buildings could go to escape the dreary environment. Visiting the
library, it became clear.
When I entered the gates to Seward Park I immediately saw a group of
twenty old people, mainly women, all Chinese, dancing for exercise despite
the winter weather. A few preschool children were swinging. Small groups
of old men walked circles around the path. A homeless man was asleep near
the public restrooms, which were locked down and closed until spring.
The library itself, a regal, four-story structure with high arched windows
and an imposing, rusticated limestone base, is at the northeast corner of the
park, and there’s a large public space with long stone benches in front of the
entrance. I arrived there a few minutes before 10 a.m., when the library
opens, and found fourteen people scattered around the area, some hovering
by the door or on the short stone staircase leading up to it, others standing
on the asphalt below. There was a young professional couple: he held a
paper coffee cup from the gourmet café across the street; she held two
DVDs. There was an old Jewish woman, hair wrapped in a kerchief,
carrying a small book bag and talking to a gray-haired man in jeans and a

---

---

parka about Donald Trump. Two heavyset Latinas in their thirties or forties
rested against the rail on the stairway, arms folded, occasionally reaching
for a phone. An old Chinese man in a gray hat and a tan overcoat sat on the
cold bench. A few college-age students with heavy backpacks stood alone,
and four ragged-looking men, homeless or maybe coming from a shelter,
clustered by the entrance. One kept checking the time.
At ten o’clock sharp a librarian in an oversize suit jacket unlocked the
front door and held it open. “Good morning,” he said, with a warm smile
and a nod of recognition for each familiar face, and a kind, welcoming one
for mine.
The disheveled men rushed inside. One beelined for the first-floor
bathroom, the only one that’s officially open to all patrons, even though
there are two more in the basement and another for children only on the
second floor. One raced up the stairs, and the others dropped their bags on
the tables by the big front windows and began to browse through the new
books. Most patrons gave the men some leeway, trying to avoid the smell,
and then everyone went to their spot. The couple returned their DVDs,
grabbed another from reserve, and left. The old woman in the kerchief went
right to the desktop computers and started checking her e-mail. The Chinese
man took the stairs to the third floor, where, I soon learned, he and two
friends spend every morning reading Mandarin newspapers. The Latina
women walked around the circulation desk to the lounge area, which is
open until it becomes part of the designated teen space at 2 p.m., and
immediately pulled out their phones.
Once the first wave of patrons settled in I walked over to the library
worker who’d greeted us at the entrance and introduced myself. “I’m
Andrew,” he replied, extending a bony hand that emerged from the long
sleeves on his vintage black jacket, and clasped mine in a gentle grip. “How
## can I help?”

---

For branch librarians, helping people find more than they’re looking for is
the essence of the job. “There are few jobs that exist today where you’re
really just doing good things as a public servant,” Andrew told me one day.
“You’re not screwing anyone over. You’re not taking advantage of anybody.
You’re just offering a free service.”
Andrew grew up in Los Angeles. He has a twin brother, and often on
weekends their mother, a British immigrant who didn’t drive, would take
them on long bus rides to either the main branch of the Los Angeles Public
Library or the Beverly Hills Public Library. “They were nowhere near
where we lived,” he recounted. “But the buildings were so beautiful, and
she wanted to expose us to that inspiring architecture. To this very day I
think about how different it was to visit a library as opposed to everywhere
else. Being in them just felt different. That’s stuck with me to this very day.
“My father wasn’t around much, and the library was a place where my
mother could just relax while my brother and I would look through books.
The one book that I associate with our trips there most of all is No Fighting,
No Biting! I think it’s by Else Holmelund Minarik, and it’s illustrated by
Maurice Sendak. We must have checked that book out more than, oh God, I
don’t know, more than any other. There were two siblings involved in it.
And my mother would just sort of drolly look at the two of us as she was
reading about these bickering siblings. That will be with me forever.”
Andrew moved to New York City, where his brother lived, and applied
for an entry-level job as an “information specialist” in the library system. It
didn’t pay well: the starting salary for librarians in the New York Public
Library system is around $48,500, and pay for information specialists, who
generally lack a graduate degree in library sciences, is considerably lower.
But it was better than Starbucks, where he worked for a while, and it would
put him on a career path that felt meaningful, and full of purpose. When he
started working, he quickly knew he’d made the right choice.
“Here’s something I realized once I got here,” Andrew explained “At
Starbucks, and at most businesses, really, the assumption is that you, the
customer, are better for having this thing that you purchase. Right? At the
library, the assumption is you are better. You have it in you already. You just
sort of need to be exposed to these things and provide yourself an
education. The library assumes the best out of people. The services it

---

provides are founded upon the assumption that if given the chance, people
will improve themselves.” And, as I observed during my time in libraries,
social interactions—with librarians and with other patrons—are one of the
crucial ways that this self-improvement happens.
Both children and adults benefit from the relationships they build in
branch libraries. “Children,” Andrew said, “are still growing and they’re
still absorbing things. Hopefully adults are doing that too. But a lot of adults
who use the library aren’t just people who are trying to improve themselves
in terms of, say, intellectual capacity. They’re trying to improve themselves
because they need an environment that’s not like every other environment
they’ve ever known, that judges them, that takes advantage of them, that
doesn’t want anything to do with them, doesn’t understand their role in
society. They want to be in a place where they can feel this generous
assumption of human nature, and they should always get that here.” The
library is where they feel cared for and connected. It sustains them,
especially during lonely times.
The library staff has more autonomy to develop new programming than
I’d expected from an established public institution. Managers, it seems,
assume the best of their librarians, and their information specialists too. The
first thing Andrew introduced at Seward Park was Tea Time, which he held
in the corner of the third-floor reference and reading room. “I noticed a lot
of people come in early in the morning and never go to programs,” he told
me. “They’re just using the library as a resting place. And I thought, maybe
because my parents are British, ‘What’s more relaxing than a good cup of
tea and a newspaper or book?’ ”
Tea Time quickly became one of the library’s more popular programs,
attracting a regular group of older patrons and a steady stream of
newcomers who were happy to get a free hot drink and biscuits in the
morning. It also became a reliable source of social activity: as they sat
together, sipping tea, participants also shared newspapers, and then stories,
until over time a small and unlikely community of Chinese, Turkish, Latino,
Jewish, and African American patrons had formed. “I like the way the
program brings people together,” Andrew explained. “But that’s not all. The
other reason I like it is because Tea Time is one of the best ways that the
library can express faith in people. There’s a term you don’t hear these

---

days, one you used to hear all the time when the Carnegie branches opened:
Palaces for the People. The library really is a palace. It bestows nobility on
people who can’t otherwise afford a shred of it. People need to have
nobility and dignity in their lives. And, you know, they need other people to
recognize it in them too. Serving tea doesn’t seem like that big a deal, but
the truth is it’s one of the most important things I do.”

## CHAPTER TWO

## Safe Spaces

The Pruitt-Igoe housing project, a complex of thirty-three eleven-story
buildings that opened in North St. Louis between 1954 and 1956, is perhaps
the most famous failure in the history of American public housing. The
initial design, by the highly regarded architect Minoru Yamasaki (who went
on to design the World Trade Center), called for a mixed-rise set of towers
connected by walking paths and “a river of trees,” but the Public Housing
Administration forced a revision to bring down costs. The housing agency
standardized the plan and substituted cheaper construction materials than
those Yamasaki wanted. Ultimately, each of the thirty-three identical
buildings featured an open first floor for community activity; a corridor
with common rooms, laundry facilities, and a garbage room on several

---

“anchor floors”; and elevators and stairwells shared by all of the roughly
one hundred families residing in the tower. Families rushed into the new
apartments, which were in great demand. In 1957, more than 90 percent of
all units were occupied.
A few architecture critics initially praised the high modernist project for
its spatial efficiency and abundance of green space. But major problems
soon emerged. In the 1960s, Oscar Newman, a young professor of
architecture and urban planning from Washington University in St. Louis,
initiated a study to determine what was wrong. Newman had read about the
conditions at Pruitt-Igoe, but that hadn’t prepared him for what he saw in
person. Vandals had destroyed the laundry and garbage facilities. Graffiti
covered the common areas wherever he went. There was garbage all over
the public areas, both inside and outside the buildings, and the sidewalks
were coated with broken glass. Residents complained about the spike in
prostitution, drug dealing, burglary, and violent crime. Families with
children had grown fearful and began hunkering down in their private
residences. “The corridors, lobbies, elevators, and stairs were dangerous
places to walk,” Newman writes. “Women had to get together in groups to
take their children to school and to go shopping.” People began moving out,
and soon there was an exodus. By 1971, about half the units in the complex
had been shuttered and the occupancy rate was 35 percent.
Newman acknowledges that his first reaction was to blame the residents
for ruining what could have been a beautiful, modern housing development.
“Walking through Pruitt-Igoe in its heyday of pervasive crime and
vandalism, one could only ask: What kind of people live here?” he says.
That’s not surprising, since prevailing theories about the causes of crime
have long focused on the characteristics of people who break the law. When
criminologists examine the factors that lead to high levels of lawlessness,
they typically consider “background” factors like a person’s race, gender,
income, family situation, and education level, or, in some cases, their moral
values and capacity for self-regulation. Initially, Newman did the same, and
he observed what most government officials did: a community with a high
concentration of poor, black, single mothers and their children. It appeared
as if no one was able to exert control.

---

But as Newman spent more time at Pruitt-Igoe, he realized that the
situation was more complex. Most residents, for instance, kept their own
apartments “neat and well maintained—modestly furnished perhaps, but
with great pride.” Moreover, Newman visited the small balconies shared by
two families, and found them to be “pockets that were clean, safe, and well-
tended.” He wanted to know what accounted for the differences between the
project’s private and public spaces, and he began searching for answers.
The well-kept apartments and semiprivate landings offered Newman
one clue; but what he observed in the housing project adjacent to Pruitt-
Igoe taught him even more. “Across the street from Pruitt-Igoe was an
older, smaller, row-house complex, Carr Square Village, occupied by an
identical population,” he writes. “It had remained fully occupied and
trouble-free throughout the construction, occupancy, and decline of Pruitt-
Igoe.” People made good use of their semiprivate gardens and public areas,
which meant that there were plenty of what Jane Jacobs, whose ideas
greatly influenced Newman, called informal surveillance through “eyes on
street.” Families felt safe and relatively comfortable, and with good reason:
the crime level was three times lower than it was in Pruitt-Igoe. Newman
was fascinated. “With social variables constant in the two developments,”
he explains, the underlying reasons “that enabled one to survive while the
other was destroyed” had to involve “physical differences,” not the
characteristics of the residents.
Newman compared the physical features of the two projects, and the
differences were stark. In Carr Square Village, each row house contained
just a few families, all of whom could identify one another as neighbors, if
not friends. They shared a compact entryway and a semiprivate outdoor
area, and it was relatively easy to establish standards for using and
maintaining the space since only a few neighbors would be sharing it. In
Pruitt-Igoe, however, the design and management of the buildings made it
impossible for residents to regulate behavior in and around them. So many
people shared the same public areas that no one person could manage or
maintain them, and, unlike high-rise buildings in middle-class areas, there
were no doormen or resident superintendents who were paid to do that job.
What’s more, the population of the thirty-three-building complex was so
large that it was “impossible to tell resident from intruder.” For Newman,

---

the lesson was straightforward. The dire situation at Pruitt-Igoe was not due
to the characteristics of the people who lived there, but to the project’s
physical infrastructure. Building and landscape design “play an important
role in reducing crime and in assisting residents in controlling behavior in
their housing environments,” he concludes. “Residents maintained and
controlled those areas that were clearly defined as their own,” but the larger,
shared public spaces “evoked no feelings of identity or control [and]…
made it impossible for even neighboring residents to develop an accord
about acceptable behavior.”
Newman included an account of the physical factors that made Pruitt-
Igoe so much more dangerous than Carr Square Village in his 1972 report,
Defensible Space. That same year, the government began to demolish the
Pruitt-Igoe complex, a process that would go on until 1976, when the last
doomed building came down. Newman’s theory of defensible space gained
considerable influence among urban planners and criminologists and helped
shape the design of new housing projects throughout the world. (Newman
even became a character in the 2015 HBO miniseries Show Me a Hero.)
Subsequent research has questioned whether all of Newman’s findings are
generalizable. In some cities, we know, poor neighborhoods with high-rise
public housing are safer than poor neighborhoods without it, and Newman
failed to identify which conditions make some projects more successful
than others. He was wrong to conclude that, in the case of crime and
housing, “the apartment tower itself…is the real and final villain.” But
Newman’s main point, that the built environment helps determine local
crime levels, is widely accepted. In fact, the evidence for it is now stronger
than ever.
Some of that evidence comes from a school of crime prevention that
emerged around the same time as Newman’s defensible space theory. Crime
Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) begins with the
insight that a person who is likely to commit a crime in a certain
environment would never consider doing so in another. As C. Ray Jeffery,
the criminologist who conceived CPTED, puts it, “There are no criminals,
only environmental circumstances which result in criminal behavior. Given
the proper environmental structure, anyone will be a criminal or a
noncriminal.” It follows, then, that crime control measures are unlikely to

---

---

work if they are designed to target individual offenders. Instead, crime is
best managed “through the manipulation of the environment where crimes
occur.”
To this day, however, most policies that aim to reduce crime focus on
punishing people rather than improving places. The president has called for
a national “stop and frisk” police program; the attorney general wants more
severe sentencing; advocates of “law and order” are resurgent. We invest
little in housing and far less in safe sidewalks and neighborhood amenities
like libraries, senior centers, and community gardens, which draw people
into the public realm and put more eyes on the street. We spend even less to
address criminal “hot spots”: specific places, such as empty lots, abandoned
buildings, and liquor stores, that are known to foster illegal activities. Funds
for improving community and street-level conditions in the places most
likely to suffer from crime and violence are in short supply.
Government officials may have political reasons to crack down on
potentially dangerous people rather than on demonstrably dangerous places,
but the scientific grounds are shaky.
We have other more effective and less expensive ways to reduce crime
today. And a growing body of scientific research shows that some of the
best options involve investing in social infrastructure.

In the nineteenth century, British researchers began studying the variation in
crime rates between and within cities. While some of this work offered
relatively simple accounts in which concentrated poverty led to higher
crime, others pushed to another level, asking why there was so much
variation in crime rates among poor neighborhoods. “Most of this work was
descriptive and offered theories,” writes the University of Pennsylvania
criminologist John Mac Donald, “but did not attempt to provide guidance on
how to curb crime.” He compares this tradition, unfavorably, with the work
of British health scholars, most notably John Snow, whose research on
cholera “noted the importance of the spatial environment in shaping human

---

health and suggested the separation of sewers and drinking water wells to
prevent water-borne diseases.” Reducing crime is more difficult than
preventing cholera, but Mac Donald, who’s done pioneering experimental
research on how places influence crime rates, is one of many contemporary
environmental criminologists with something new and significant to offer.
Social scientists have long played a major role in shaping crime
policies. Consider the “broken windows” theory, which the Harvard
political scientist James Q. Wilson and the Rutgers criminologist George
Kelling introduced in the Atlantic in 1982. According to Wilson and
Kelling, criminals perceive broken windows and other forms of
neighborhood disorder as signals of weak social control and, in turn, as
evidence that crimes committed there are unlikely to be checked. “Though
it is not inevitable,” they argue, “it is more likely that here, rather than in
places where people are confident they can regulate public behavior by
informal controls, drugs will change hands, prostitutes will solicit, and cars
will be stripped. That the drunks will be robbed by boys who do it as a lark,
and the prostitutes’ customers will be robbed by men who do it purposefully
and perhaps violently. That muggings will occur.”
“Broken Windows” is not only one of the most cited articles in the
history of criminology, it’s also one of the most influential works of public
policy research, sometimes referred to as “the bible of policing” and “the
blueprint for community policing.” Since the 1980s, cities throughout the
world have used Wilson and Kelling’s ideas as motivation for “zero
tolerance” policing, wherein officers carefully monitor petty crimes such as
graffiti, loitering, public intoxication, even panhandling, and courts severely
punish those convicted of committing them. “If you take care of the little
things, then you can prevent a lot of the big things,” said the former Los
Angeles and New York City police chief William J. Bratton, who used
broken windows theory not only as a guide in both places but also in his
global consulting work. In practice, this meant stopping, frisking, and
arresting more people, particularly those who live in high-crime areas. It
also meant a spike in reports that police were unfairly targeting minorities,
particularly black men.
Despite some relatively recent experimental evidence supporting
elements of the theory, broken windows always worked better as an idea

---

than as a work of empirical science. As the Columbia University law
professor Bernard Harcourt writes, “the famous broken windows theory has
never been verified,” and “the existing social-scientific data suggest that the
theory is probably not right.” The problems, which include the fact that
perceptions of disorder generally have more to do with the racial
composition of a neighborhood than with the amount of broken windows or
graffiti, are numerous and well documented. A veritable A-list of renowned
scholars, including the Harvard sociologist Robert Sampson, the University
of Chicago sociologist Stephen Raudenbush, and the Berkeley criminologist
Franklin Zimring, have identified flaws at all levels of the broken windows
argument, and with the policies it inspired.
For present purposes, though, I’m less interested in the validity of the
broken windows theory than in the way it was framed and interpreted. The
authors, Wilson and Kelling, encouraged policy makers to crack down on
the petty crimes that lead to things like broken windows, which meant more
aggressive street-level policing. Had they been more interested in the
influence of social infrastructure, however, they might have taken another
tack.
Consider the famous scenario in which the authors propose how spirals
of disorder and decay get started. “A piece of property is abandoned, weeds
grow up, a window is smashed,” they write. “Adults stop scolding rowdy
children; the children, emboldened, become more rowdy. Families move
out, unattached adults move in. Teenagers gather in front of the corner
store. The merchant asks them to move; they refuse. Fights occur. Litter
accumulates. People start drinking in front of the grocery; in time, an
inebriate slumps to the sidewalk and is allowed to sleep it off. Pedestrians
are approached by panhandlers.” From there it gets worse.
What’s curious, I think, is that the first two steps of this vicious cycle
—“A piece of property is abandoned, weeds grow up”—have disappeared
in the public debate about why some neighborhoods have such high crime
rates. The third step—“a window is smashed”—inspired the article’s catchy
title and took center stage. In academic circles, scholars had long been
concerned about the security risks posed by abandoned properties and
empty lots. But the popular and policy debates about Wilson and Kelling’s
theory ignored the two problems at the root of their story and jumped

---

---

straight to the criminal behavior. We get “Broken Windows,” not
“Abandoned Property,” and a very different policy response ensues.
Imagine what might have happened if Wilson and Kelling had pushed
their readers—many of whom were mayors and police chiefs—to think
more carefully about the social infrastructure. What if vacant buildings and
empty lots had gotten the attention that was showered on petty criminals
instead? What if neighborhood crime prevention efforts focused on
inspecting and remediating dangerous properties rather than stopping and
frisking suspected people?
This is not a rhetorical question; it’s a puzzle that drove John
Mac Donald, the Penn criminologist, and his collaborator, the
epidemiologist Charles Branas, to start one of the most exciting research
experiments in contemporary social science.

Branas, who’s now the chair of epidemiology at Columbia University, is a
leading scholar of gun violence, a topic he got to know viscerally while
working as a paramedic. Branas often found himself responding to calls for
victims of gunshot wounds. On a typical day, more than ninety Americans
die from gun violence, and two hundred more are injured. And although
gun violence has decreased dramatically in recent decades, it remains far
higher in the United States than in other affluent nations—the US gun
homicide rate is about twenty-five times greater than the average among
other high-income societies. It is stubbornly high in particular cities, some
midsize (New Orleans, St. Louis, Buffalo) and some large (Detroit,
Philadelphia, Chicago); and, within these cities, it’s especially high in very
specific places—not just neighborhoods, but blocks. Branas and
Mac Donald wanted to understand why certain places were so dangerous.
It’s unusual for epidemiologists and criminologists to collaborate, but
Branas and Mac Donald met in the 2000s when they were working at the
University of Pennsylvania, first in a seminar on gun violence at the
medical school’s Trauma Center, and then, once the conversation got

---

started, on the campus grounds. Both were frustrated by the science that
linked crime to neighborhood disorder. “A lot of it, from ‘Broken Windows’
on, was just descriptive,” Branas told me. “You didn’t know exactly what
counted as disorder. And it wasn’t actionable. Outside of policing, which
was obviously complicated, there wasn’t much you could do about it.” One
day, Branas read an article in Science based on experimental research done
by Kees Keizer in the Netherlands. “These researchers somehow got
permission to create disorder in certain neighborhoods. They actually added
graffiti and litter to some places and not others, and they could measure the
effects.” The paper showed a strong relationship between disorder and
incivility—some, though by no means full, validation for the broken
windows theory. But Branas was less interested in the findings than in the
method. They knew that no institutional review board or community
organization would ever let them add graffiti and litter to an American
neighborhood, but perhaps they could design another experiment to test
place-based crime reduction techniques.
While they were brainstorming, Branas was invited to discuss his
research on guns and alcohol at a conference sponsored by the Federal
Reserve Bank in Philadelphia. During his presentation, he briefly
mentioned his interest in running an experiment on the physical factors
related to gun violence. “When I finished, someone from the Pennsylvania
Horticultural Society [PHS] approached me,” Branas recalled. They were
convinced that vacant properties were driving up violent crime in poor
neighborhoods. Philadelphia had passed an ordinance that required owners
of abandoned buildings to install working doors and windows, but there
were thousands of buildings out of compliance, and tens of thousands of
empty lots that were violating the anti-blight ordinance too. The
horticultural society had incredible data, and they offered to help.
Branas and Mac Donald were excited about the idea. There is, after all,
an established literature showing a relationship between abandoned
properties and crime. In 1993, the criminologist William Spelman published
a paper showing that, in Austin, Texas, “crime rates on blocks with open
abandoned buildings were twice as high as rates on matched blocks without
open buildings.” And, in 2005, the sociologist Lance Hannon showed that
the number of abandoned houses in a given census tract was correlated with

---

homicide levels in New York City’s high-poverty and extreme-poverty
areas. Branas, who had taken the lead on the project, invited more scientists
to join them: a health economist, a professor from the Department of
Emergency Medicine, and a medical anthropologist. There was an
enormous amount of data to collect and analyze.
The team’s first major research project involved assessing the impact of
two natural experiments in Philadelphia. In one, the Penn group examined
violent crime around 2,356 abandoned buildings that had been in violation
of Philadelphia’s anti-blight ordinance. A set of 676 buildings had been
remediated by the owners, which meant they had been “treated” with
replacement doors and windows; the rest had not. Every month, for a three-
year period between 2010 and 2013, the researchers compared violent crime
levels around the treated buildings with violent crime levels around a
randomly selected, geographically matched group of buildings that
remained in disrepair.
The team did something similar in the second project, which compared
violent crime around vacant lots. There were 49,690 “abandoned parcels of
open land with no buildings on them” in Philadelphia, the researchers
report. PHS had remediated 4,436 of them, which meant they had cleared
trash and debris, graded the land, planted grass and trees to create a parklike
setting, and installed low wooden post and rail fences with walk-in
openings to facilitate recreational use and deter illegal dumping. Again,
Branas and his colleagues compared the treated sites with a set of randomly
selected, geographically matched properties. In this study, they measured
crime annually, over a full decade, from 1999 to 2008.
On a warm and windy day in September, I visited Philadelphia to
observe the sites in their experiments, including empty lots and abandoned
houses that PHS had remediated and the untreated properties that they used
as controls. Keith Green, a bald, large-set African American man with a
salt-and-pepper beard, picked me up in his blue Ford pickup truck, and told
me that we’d begin by driving to West Philadelphia, where PHS maintains
2.3 million square feet of vacant land. Green, who grew up in a part of
Philadelphia that’s so gray they called it “the concrete city,” started working
at PHS twenty-one years ago, first as an intern and then on community
garden projects. “I never thought I’d be doing this for so long,” he told me,

---

“but I found my niche when we started fixing up abandoned property. I
remember one of the first jobs: The city asked us to clean up a two-block
area in North Philadelphia where there was a flea infestation. We got there
and it was like the entire area had turned into a jungle. Weeds, tall grass,
messed-up trees. People were using it as a dumping ground. There were
junk piles. Old cars. Broken bottles. Mattresses. Just a mess. We wound up
treating 125 empty lots on four city blocks. I’m not kidding: 125! It was a
horrible job, but when we finished you could tell that the neighborhood was
going to be different. And people were so happy. I’d have kids running up
to my truck yelling, ‘Mr. Keith! Mr. Keith! Can you come back tomorrow?’
They treated me like I was Mister Softee!” He laughed at the memory. “I
kept thinking, ‘You know, this is something we have to do all over
Philadelphia.’ And that’s basically what we did.”
Green drove slowly up Fortieth Street in West Philly. “You’re gonna
want to keep your eyes open,” he instructed. “You won’t believe what
you’re gonna see.” In fact, the area looked a lot like the depleted
neighborhoods I’d studied in Chicago, like Englewood and North
Lawndale, places where row houses and apartment buildings, some empty,
some well kept, sat adjacent to large open lots that were thick with weeds,
debris, and six-foot-high grass. “See that?” He pulled over at a corner lot
with a low-lying wooden fence, two benches, trimmed trees, and a neatly
cut lawn. “That’s one of our treated sites. You can tell because it’s so well
maintained.” We got out, walked through the pocket park and over to a
vacant house and large lot a few steps away. There, the grass had grown
both high and wide, so that it now came through the sidewalk and out to the
curb. “Now this, this is a disaster,” Green said. “It’s probably got an owner
who wouldn’t let us work here, or someone we couldn’t track down. If you
live here, you’ve got to deal with all the problems this attracts into the
neighborhood: Pests. Insects. Garbage. Crime. And you know it’s gonna
make it hard for new development to work here. People see that and they
want to run.”
We crossed the narrow street to look at another property, and when we
got there Loretta, an African American woman in her late twenties who was
out for some exercise, was walking briskly in our direction. I paused and

---

asked her if she lived here. “No,” she replied. “But I walk around this
neighborhood all the time.”
“Have you noticed all the little parks with small fences?” I inquired.
“Not really.” She looked around, took them in. “They’re nice, though.”
“What about the abandoned lots with all the weeds and garbage?”
“Um, yeah,” Loretta answered, cracking a little smile. “Why do you
think I’m walking on the other side of the street!” She paused for a beat,
then looked over at the lot and started explaining. “Those places are scary.
You don’t know what’s going on in that mess, who’s around. There’s a lot
of places like that around here, and I just try to keep away.”
Loretta returned to her exercise and Green and I headed up the road
again before turning onto Westminster Street. He pointed to a large
remediated lot that residents had converted into a community park, with
picnic tables and a small garden. “A guy who owns a store a few blocks
away helped fix up this block,” Green explained. “He just wanted the
neighborhood to look nice, to get more people out on the sidewalks and
gardens. We see a lot of that. If we maintain things, residents go a little
further, and put in what they like.”
We crossed over to a set of three row houses that had pocket parks, one
large, one small, on either side. Micky, who had gray hair, sunglasses, a
wooden cane, and a few missing teeth, was sitting on a picnic table and
talking on a flip phone. He stood up and nodded when he saw me approach.
I asked if he came to the park often. “I sure do,” he responded. “It’s a
popular place. The Muslims had an event this past weekend. There was a
health fair not long ago too. I’m seventy-three years old and I walk around
here every day. This is a nice spot to stop.”
Green asked if the park made the neighborhood better. “Oh, you know it
does,” Micky replied. He pointed to the front porch of the row house next
door, where Joyce, in sandals and a white T-shirt, was relaxing on a rocking
chair. “Ask her, she knows.”
Joyce was nodding. “I’ve been staying here ten, twelve years now.
Those lots were bad when I first got here. Drugs and all that. Kids up to no
good. People would let their dogs run all around them too, and oh, did it
smell!” She grimaced and shivered a little from the memory. “But they

---

fixed it up pretty soon after I got here. Put them tables in, big umbrellas too.
Kids started coming around. We got the garden going. Before, everybody
would avoid this block. It was ugly, and dangerous, ’cause you didn’t know
who was gonna jump out of those bushes. Now it’s a lot better. We’ve got
the park, we’ve got shade. It’s a pretty good place to be.”
Green and his colleagues at the horticultural society suspected that
fixing up the empty lots and buildings was improving Philadelphia’s poor
neighborhoods, but they weren’t certain. Branas and Mac Donald had a
more specific hypothesis: they thought that remediation would reduce gun-
related crime around them. “It’s not simply that they are signs of disorder,”
Branas told me. “It’s that the places themselves create opportunities for gun
violence; they take what might just be a poor neighborhood and make it
poor and dangerous.” The reasons are straightforward. Abandoned houses
are good places for people involved in criminal activities to hide when they
are on the run. They’re also good places to store firearms. Untended empty
lots are notoriously good places for drug dealing—in part because most
law-abiding residents avoid them, and in part because dealers can hide their
products in the weeds and tall grass if the police drive by. For communities,
and for the police, they are hard places to monitor and control.
But compelling theories, as critics of broken windows know all too
well, are often betrayed by evidence that discredits them. That’s why
Branas was so surprised by the dramatic findings from their first
experimental study on blighted environments and violence: There was a
39 percent reduction in gun violence in and around abandoned buildings
that had been remediated. There was a smaller but still meaningful
5 percent reduction in gun violence in and around vacant lots that had been
remediated as well. These are extraordinary numbers, at a level of impact
one rarely sees in a social science experiment. But they weren’t the only
ones that impressed Branas and his team. Equally powerful, he said, is that
there was no evidence that the violence had simply shifted to nearby places:
the declines were real. Moreover, these reductions lasted from one to nearly
four years, making the benefit far more sustainable than those in other
crime reduction programs. “Honestly,” he confessed, “it was a bigger effect
than we’d expected to find.”

---

According to Branas, “the main goal of the two projects was to find a
way of making inexpensive, place-based changes that can be scaled to
entire cities and that are relatively straightforward to sustain.” He’d failed
to do this earlier in his career, he acknowledged, when he was doing more
conventional antiviolence research and advocacy, the kind that focused on
the people who are most likely to commit crimes. “When I started at Penn,
we had been working hard to reduce gun crime in Philadelphia. We had the
interrupters, the social workers, the community leaders. Some of them were
amazing, and we had some successes. But they were always short-lived.
They lasted only as long as we could keep the people there in the hood. We
spent a considerable amount of money on that project, and in the end it
wound up helping only, I don’t know, about fifty kids, just the ones who
were there at the time. We wanted to have a bigger impact, one that would
continue even after we left.”
The Philadelphia studies suggest that place-based interventions are far
more likely to succeed than people-based projects. “Tens of millions of
vacant and abandoned properties exist in the United States,” write Branas
and his team. Remediation programs “make structural improvements to the
very context within which city residents are exposed on a daily basis.” They
are simple, cheap, and easily reproducible, so they can be implemented on a
large scale. What’s more, they impose few demands on local residents, and
the programs appear to pay for themselves. “Simple treatments of
abandoned buildings and vacant lots returned conservative estimates of
between $5.00 and $26.00 in net benefits to taxpayers and between $79.00
and $333.00 to society at large, for every dollar invested,” their paper in the
American Journal of Public Health reports. It’s not only more dangerous to
leave the properties untended; it’s also more expensive.
That’s why, once Branas began publishing and presenting his findings
on the impact of fixing up abandoned properties, cities and universities
throughout the United States were eager to enroll in the experiment. “In the
last few years we’ve had people here from so many cities,” Keith Green
told me. “Detroit, Chicago, Trenton, and Seoul. When the guy from
Chicago was here, he kept saying, ‘This is incredible! This is incredible!
We need this in Chicago. I don’t know why we don’t do this there!’ ”

By 2016, the team had raised millions of dollars in federal grants and
launched blight remediation projects in New Orleans, Louisiana; Newark
and Camden, New Jersey; Flint, Michigan; and Youngstown, Ohio. Each
experiment included local academic partners and, at Branas’s insistence, the
frontline researchers were community residents who were trained and paid
for their contributions. “We’re proud that we’ve been able to employ people
in these neighborhoods,” Branas said. “But the bigger, more sustainable
effect will come from fixing places.”

Policing will always be a key component of crime reduction, and there’s no
question that some policing strategies are better and more humane than
others. But in recent years, small-scale, place-based policies in some of the
world’s most dangerous cities—including Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and
Johannesburg—have yielded substantial declines in violent crime. In some
cases, they’ve improved the quality of everyday life too.
In São Paulo, for instance, the local government has supplemented
policing programs with policies that reduce opportunities for crime in
specific “hot spots,” while incentivizing young people to spend more time
in safe places, particularly schools. Social scientists have long observed that
the presence of bars and liquor stores tends to increase local levels of
violence, especially in high-crime areas. History shows that prohibition is
not a wise response to this problem, not only because it generates more
crime but also because it fails to reduce overall consumption and often
shifts consumption to more dangerous substances. But there’s good
evidence that reducing the hours when bars and liquor stores operate helps.
Between 2001 and 2004, for instance, sixteen of the thirty-nine São Paulo
municipalities implemented a “dry law,” which forced bars and liquor stores
to close between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. When the Brazilian economist Ciro
Biderman examined the impact on violent behavior, he discovered that the
dry laws caused “a 10% reduction in homicides” and had similar effects “on
battery and deaths by car accidents.” Although the restrictions were

---

suspended after the crime rate began to drop, they showed that subtly
tweaking the social environment can dramatically increase safety.
While one of São Paulo’s crime-fighting techniques involved reducing
access to dangerous places, another aimed to increase access to a cherished
safe spot that generates multiple benefits for children and communities:
schools. The government had good reason to focus on the one place where
young people have regular interactions with responsible adults. According
to a World Bank report on crime prevention in Brazil: “In São Paulo, among
those crimes for which the age of the suspected offender is known, between
20 and 25 percent of robberies, thefts and motor vehicle crimes are
committed by individuals under the age of 18.” In 2003, São Paulo initiated
the Family School policy, which opened 5,306 public schools on the
weekends and provided extensive programming for children. Drawing on
models from Mexico and Colombia, the government also started CCT Bolsa
Família, a policy that offered modest but meaningful cash transfers to poor
families, on the condition that their children complete secondary schools.
Both programs, the World Bank claims, made important contributions to
São Paulo’s great crime drop.
Not all environmental designs to reduce crime produce widespread
benefits. Consider the gated community, an architectural form that has
emerged throughout the world to assuage anxieties about crime and
violence, and which some critics see as an extreme expression of CPTED’s
underlying principles. After all, gated communities facilitate local control of
shared territory and establish clear lines between public and private space.
They sponsor and, through signage, call attention to active surveillance by
security guards and cameras. They often encourage the kind of informal
social interaction among residents that allows for eyes on the street. They
maintain all public areas, which sends a clear signal that residents monitor
and care about the physical environment. Wherever possible, they reduce
opportunities for crime.
In City of Walls, the Berkeley anthropologist and urban planning scholar
Teresa Caldeira documents the fortification of urban space in São Paulo
during the 1980s and 1990s. “In the last two decades, in cities as distinct as
São Paulo, Los Angeles, Johannesburg, Buenos Aires, Budapest, Mexico
City, and Miami, different social groups, especially from the upper classes,

---

have used the fear of violence and crime to justify new techniques of
exclusion and their withdrawal from traditional quarters of the cities,” she
writes. Caldeira attributes the rise of gated communities and private security
in Brazil not only to high crime but also to anxieties about the end of
military governance and emerging democratic politics in an unequal society.
She calls attention to the pervasive “talk of crime,” which “simplistically
divides the world into good and evil and criminalizes certain social
categories,” while also legitimating the use of gates and private security “to
ensure isolation, enclosure, and distancing from those considered
dangerous.” Caldeira grants that these systems protect those who can afford
them, but worries, quite rightly, that they weaken democracy, deepen social
divisions, and endanger as well as infuriate the people whom they exclude.
Urban critics raised similar objections to the rise of gated communities
in postapartheid South Africa. Some, including the architect Karina
Landman, blamed advocates of CPTED for not recognizing how their ideas
could be used to justify new forms of social exclusion. In the late 1990s and
early 2000s, Landman observed two distinct kinds of gated communities in
South Africa: “Enclosed Neighborhoods,” where white residents of
formerly open residential communities put up gates, fences, and booms to
reduce and control access points, and “Security Villages,” which were
larger places with mixed-use facilities, including office parks, retail outlets,
and luxurious residential developments.
Landman reports that both types of gated community successfully
maintained low crime levels inside their protected environments. But the
segregated social infrastructures they supported created countless other
problems and directly undermined the urgent project of rebuilding
democratic order in postapartheid South Africa. “Many people object to a
restriction of access to public roads. It is also prohibited by the South
African Constitution,” she observes. Moreover, “the question of access
often leads to resentment,” particularly among city dwellers who had
previously been able to visit or travel through the enclosed neighborhoods
without scrutiny. Landman does not explicitly condemn gated communities,
but there’s no question about the message written between the lines. She’s
essentially saying that in South Africa, fear of crime is doing the work that
fear of blacks did during apartheid: justifying the creation of an unequal

---

---

society sustained by segregated social infrastructure, in which one group
can take extralegal measures to protect itself and the others can only fume.
Intriguingly, there is at least one well-documented case of an
impoverished, crime-ridden community taking control of their own territory
and using unauthorized security devices to monitor violence perpetrated
against them by police. But their low status and lack of political power
made the project short-lived. In 2001, while the University of Texas
anthropologist João Costa Vargas was conducting fieldwork in Rio de
Janeiro, a neighborhood association in the city’s second largest favela,
Jacarezinho, installed large gates and cameras at several access points. On a
popular political website, leaders of the association demanded “their right”
to “more and better social programs focusing on health, education, and job
training, and public transportation. In short, they demanded full
citizenship,” Vargas writes. Gating themselves into a protected community
was a political tactic that local leaders used to publicize both their social
problems and their struggles with violently abusive police.
The Brazilian media was fascinated by the story. But, as Vargas reports,
the stigma around Jacarezinho and the low status of its poor, dark-skinned
community made journalists skeptical of the neighborhood association’s
claims that police, not residents, were the main perpetrators of violence.
The news media consistently denied the legitimacy of the residents’
demands and, in turn, of the gates. Officials insisted that drug dealers were
using gates and cameras to create a zone of lawlessness where police
couldn’t operate. Whereas the white neighborhoods in South Africa had
managed to defend their neighborhood enclaves, the poor, mostly black
slum dwellers of Rio did not have that privilege. Their gates came down
quickly, and the militarized police force reasserted control.

Battles to control the social infrastructure are usually not so dramatic. In the
United States and Europe, disputes over safety and the social infrastructure
are more likely to unfold slowly and quietly, and they’re often centered in

---

gentrifying neighborhoods where new commercial and residential
developments change street-level conditions in ways that can either protect
or—if they lead to displacement or heightened racial discrimination—
imperil local residents. Gentrification is one of the most controversial issues
in affluent urban areas, so it’s no surprise that there’s a burgeoning literature
on how it affects crime rates. Unfortunately, there is not yet a clear answer.
Some studies show an increase, likely because new commercial
development creates new targets and opportunities for crime, while others
show a decrease, often attributed to more eyes on the street. The variation
suggests that gentrification plays out differently depending on the local
context, and also that groups are likely to be affected by gentrification in
divergent ways.
In all neighborhoods, though, commercial establishments are important
parts of the social infrastructure. As Jane Jacobs and Ray Oldenburg
famously argued, grocery stores, diners, cafés, bookstores, and barbershops
draw people out of their homes and into the streets and sidewalks, where
they create cultural vitality and contribute to the passive surveillance of
shared public space. When I did research in Chicago, I discovered that poor
neighborhoods with active retail corridors were surprisingly resilient during
the devastating heat wave, because people who lived in them could easily
go out and get air-conditioning or support from neighbors. Remarkably, the
social activity generated by street-level commerce protected both the
majority and the minority populations in Chicago neighborhoods: it wasn’t
the products that made residents safer, it was the people who came out to
shop and socialize. Yet Chicagoans who lived in depopulated and
commercially depleted neighborhoods didn’t have the same opportunities
for casual interaction, and as a result they were more likely to remain in
their broiling homes.
But, as the story of São Paulo’s successful dry laws illustrates, some
commercial outlets are more likely to foster crime than to inhibit it. Bars
and liquor stores are obvious examples; banks, currency exchanges, and
automatic teller machines can have similarly deleterious effects on
vulnerable neighborhoods, for the simple reason that they create new targets
for robbery and assault. In the 1960s, the urban planning scholar Shlomo
Angel examined patterns of illicit behavior in Oakland, which, like many

---

cities at the time, was experiencing a worrisome spike in street crime. Angel
found that retail corridors were hot spots, particularly after hours, when
most consumers were at home and informal surveillance was weak.
Although he shared Jane Jacobs’s enthusiasm for the protective value of
eyes on the street, Angel warned that commercial outlets were the wrong
way to attract them, and urged cities to restrict their development.
Recently, though, social scientists have taken a closer look at these
patterns, and they’ve discovered that most retail outlets and commercial
corridors are more protective than Angel realized. This is especially true in
gentrifying neighborhoods, where new retail businesses, such as coffee
shops and restaurants, symbolize an “invasion” of white, affluent residents
and often spark public debates about displacement. In one intriguing paper,
“More Coffee, Less Crime?,” a team of sociologists led by the Yale
professor Andrew Papachristos examined the relationship between
gentrification and crime rates, using the annual number of neighborhood
coffee shops that opened as a proxy measure for new local retail
development. The article is agnostic on the general question of whether
gentrification is good or bad for residents and cities more broadly. But it
makes a compelling case that retail outlets like coffee shops help keep a
neighborhood safe.
After analyzing data from the Chicago Police Department, the US
Census, and the Chicago business directories, Papachristos and his team
make some striking observations. First, even after controlling for other
factors, an increase in the number of neighborhood coffee shops is
associated with a decrease in the number of murders. They report that this
pattern holds regardless of whether the neighborhood is primarily white,
black, or Latino. Second, and not surprisingly, not every group benefits
equally. Street robberies, for instance, tend to go down when new coffee
shops open in gentrifying neighborhoods that are primarily white or Latino.
But they tend to go up in gentrifying neighborhoods that are primarily
black, quite likely for the reasons that Angel proposed: they have fewer
commercial outlets to attract a steady stream of consumers, and
consequently they lack enough informal surveillance to deter crime.
Third, and importantly, business owners are less likely to open coffee
shops in gentrifying black neighborhoods than in those that are white or

---

Latino. When they do, it’s often a sign that developers are planning a large-
scale transformation of the area, one that will likely result in significant
displacement of established African American residents. In 2017, this threat
helped fuel a small-scale uprising in Denver’s Five Points neighborhood,
one of countless gentrifying urban areas around the United States. The
flame came from Keith Herbert, the proprietor of a local Denver coffee
chain, ink!, who allowed his staff to post signs saying “Nothing says
gentrification like being able to order a cortado” and “Happily gentrifying
the neighborhood since 2014” outside the company’s new shop in Five
Points. Herbert thought the signs would be funny, but residents and
community organizations concerned about their fate found them offensive.
Some responded by vandalizing the establishment; others organized protests
against both ink! and the gentrification process it represented. “I am
embarrassed to say that I did not fully appreciate the very real and troubling
issue of gentrification, and I want to sincerely apologize to those who
understand firsthand the hardship and cultural consequences that
gentrification has caused,” said Herbert in a Facebook post after the protests
began. But this hardly satisfied his critics, who have continued pressing for
their neighborhood to preserve places where everyone, not only affluent
young professionals, feels at home.
Residents of the Cabrini-Green housing projects in Chicago organized a
similar protest movement in the late 1990s, when the city announced that it
would soon demolish, privatize, and revitalize the public housing stock, and
civic groups accused officials of pushing poor African Americans off what
had become valuable urban real estate. As protesters marched in front of
City Hall, developers built a shopping center with a Starbucks across the
street from Cabrini. The coffee shop, Papachristos and his team write,
became a driver and a symbol of neighborhood transition, one that would
“ensure this area will soon experience rapid gentrification.” The housing
project did experience a decline in homicide, but it remained far more
dangerous than the areas around it. “Here, we might see a ‘positive’ effect
of gentrification in the form of long-term neighborhood crime reduction,”
Papachristos and his coauthors write, “but at the severe expense of the
displacement of Cabrini residents.” For this reason, they are adamant that
although local retail outlets may well make neighborhoods safer,

---

---

gentrification imposes formidable social costs to impoverished and
vulnerable people, and is by no means the ideal way to reduce crime.

As it happens, research conducted in another public housing complex in
Chicago points to a more desirable way to reduce crime with social
infrastructure. In a fascinating series of natural experiments, the landscape
architect William Sullivan and the environmental scientist Frances Kuo,
both professors at the University of Illinois, discovered the extraordinary
power of vegetation to reduce crime in a high-poverty residential
development.
Neither Sullivan nor Kuo knew what they would find when they began
their two-year study of crime patterns across ninety-eight apartment
buildings in the Ida B. Wells project on Chicago’s South Side. They were
advocates of greening urban neighborhoods. But it was the 1990s, and at
the time urban planners who had studied places like Pruitt-Igoe were
convinced that trees and grass in poor neighborhoods created opportunities
for criminal behavior, because the green canopy made spaces beneath hard
to monitor and control. Some older research supported this view, but Kuo
and Sullivan noted that several recent studies reported lower levels of fear,
less aggressive and violent behavior, and more civility in green areas. Their
project, the first to use police crime data to measure the impact of green
ecologies on public housing, would help establish a better answer.
Fortunately, the Ida B. Wells project was an ideal place to conduct a
natural experiment. The residents of the buildings were demographically
similar: nearly all were African American and poor enough to qualify for
public housing, and the buildings contained a mix of family types. Kuo and
Sullivan measured the amount of tree and grass cover outside the ninety-
eight buildings, sorted them into categories, and analyzed which areas had
higher or lower levels of crime. The findings were unambiguous: the
greener the immediate surroundings of a building, the lower the rate of total
crime. This pattern held for both violent crimes and property crimes, and it

---

remained even after controlling for the number of apartments per building,
building height, and vacancy rates.
In Ida B. Wells and another massive housing project on the South Side,
the Robert Taylor Homes, Kuo and Sullivan probed to learn more about
how green space helped reduce crime and violence. Part of the answer was
predictable: when the green spaces were well maintained, residents used
them often, and this meant more passive surveillance from eyes on the
street as well as greater feelings of ownership and control. But they also
discovered surprises. Through interviews and observations by public
housing residents whom they trained to do research on their team, they
found that people whose buildings were surrounded by vegetation felt less
aggression and mental fatigue than those who lived amid concrete.
Although the levels of aggression public housing residents reported were
significantly higher than those in the general US population, people who
lived in a green environment said they were involved in less aggression and
violence against their partner and less aggression against their child than
those whose environment was primarily gray.
The research by Sullivan and Kuo made a major impact on the way
designers thought about public housing. Unfortunately, by the 1990s there
was little funding available to build new public housing projects, and in
some American metropolitan areas political leaders condemned those that
existed as failures. Soon after Sullivan and Kuo released their research
findings, Chicago and the federal government announced the “Plan for
Transformation,” which would demolish seventeen thousand public housing
apartments throughout the city, including every building in the Ida B. Wells
and Robert Taylor developments. There was a severe shortage of affordable
housing in Chicago, and tens of thousands of families were stuck on
multiyear waiting lists for public units. No matter. As in St. Louis during
the 1960s and 1970s, local and national political officials believed that
Chicago’s hulking public housing projects were beyond repair.
The shortage of affordable housing is a national crisis today, and violent
crime is once again on the rise in some cities. Public investment in these
matters is inevitable, because the problems they generate are too difficult
for citizens to endure and too serious for political officials to ignore. For
decades, building prisons for the poor has been our main crime reduction

---

policy, and the social costs have been as great as the economic expense. If
we want a better, more equitable, and sustainable solution for the challenges
facing our cities and suburbs, we’d be better off building social
infrastructure instead.

## CHAPTER THREE

## Learning Together

I have young children, and for years taking them to school has been one of
my greatest daily pleasures. We live about a mile from my children’s
school, and the walk, a straight shot down one of the big avenues in
Manhattan, is occasion for conversations about everything from homework
to homelessness, fashion (it’s below Fourteenth Street, after all), family, and
friends. It’s neither bucolic nor relaxing. There’s lots of street traffic and
constant construction in downtown Manhattan. We occasionally encounter
an aggressive panhandler or a trail of spilled garbage. But we all enjoy
participating in the parade of humanity that animates the city’s sidewalks
each morning. We’re together, with all kinds of stimulation around us, in a
place that’s full of strangers but still feels like home.

---

The small, progressive school they attend in Greenwich Village is the
kind of place that strives to create community. There’s lots of cultural
programming and special events in the crowded, tenement-style building
that, for lack of available outdoor space, serves as the school campus. But
the real work of community development happens informally, if also by
design. Parents of students in kindergarten and the early grades are
encouraged to join their children in the classrooms for fifteen or twenty
minutes each morning throughout the year. The official rationale for this
practice is that it helps ease the students’ transition into the school day. But
within a few weeks most new parents figure out that it does something more
important. It gives them time and space to get to know one another, so that
they can build relationships that will help everyone, adult and child, get
through a rewarding but challenging time of life.
The hallways, stairwells, and common areas of the school are comically
cramped and busy, so there’s no place in the building for parents to continue
the conversations they begin in classrooms. By chance, though, there’s an
unusually large patch of open public space just outside the front door, a
place with benches, small trees, and enough room for people to break into
small groups and linger. That’s exactly what parents do there, every
morning, sometimes for just a few minutes but sometimes for much longer,
because the workday starts late in New York City or because the banter is
too good to end. Since it’s Manhattan, it’s no surprise that there’s a coffee
shop across the street from the school. When children get old enough to go
to their classrooms alone, parents drop them at the front door, find their
friends in the public area, and head to the café patio. Countless relationships
evolve in the social space around the school building. Parents schedule play
dates (for themselves as well as their children), learn about school issues,
talk about their marriages and friendships, commiserate about work. For
many parents, the morning drop-off is the most social time of the day.
Recently, my family and I spent a sabbatical year at Stanford University,
and we moved into an idyllic suburb near the campus. We enrolled our
children in the local elementary school, an excellent public institution with
the kind of campus that could never exist in Manhattan. It has large, open
fields for soccer and baseball, several play structures and swing sets,
outdoor basketball courts, a shaded courtyard for lunches and snacks, and a

---

large organic garden maintained by teachers and students. It also has an
active parent-teacher association, which champions diversity (there’s a
growing Latino and Asian presence in the school, and many children with
disabilities) and organizes social and cultural events for the community. The
school could not be a more welcoming place.
But when the academic year began we quickly noticed some major
flaws in the otherwise excellent social infrastructure. The campus, while
beautiful, is mostly off-limits to parents, who are expected to drop off their
children at the entrance and are allowed into classrooms on special
occasions only. There’s some space for casual interaction on the sidewalk in
front of the school, but it’s not designed for socializing, especially not at the
beginning or end of the school day. The reason will likely be familiar to
everyone who’s spent time in large suburban schools: the entryway is
dominated by a long, roundabout driveway, and every day hundreds of
parents drive through it to drop off their children and quickly pull away. It’s
a remarkably efficient system—so efficient, in fact, that parents have little
opportunity to get to know one another on or around the school grounds.
The infrastructure that makes this affluent suburban school less
cohesive than it otherwise might be is probably not cause for serious
concern, since families in the community have access to other well-run
public institutions and marketplaces—swimming pools, libraries, athletic
fields, farmers’ markets, and pleasant commercial corridors—that foster
community ties. But in the many towns and neighborhoods that don’t have
all these resources, educational institutions are essential parts of the social
infrastructure. When they’re set up to promote social connections, they can
strengthen the support networks and dramatically improve the lives of
parents and children. When they’re not, each family is more likely to be on
its own.
Of course, the design and programming of schools also shapes their
core mission: educating children. The physical layout and organizational
structure of a school affects how learning happens—in classrooms, on
campus, and in the neighborhood where it’s situated. This is just as true for
elementary schools as it is for elite universities. Consider, for instance, the
difference between the traditional Oxbridge college model, organized
around small rooms where individual students study with tutors, and the

---

---

latest design trends in contemporary universities, which feature large, open,
multipurpose spaces that encourage serendipitous encounters and promote
collaboration with people from different fields.
Campus landscapes, teaching halls, research centers, and dormitories
are the most visible elements of a school’s social infrastructure. But the
edges and borders matter too, because they shape whether and how students
learn to engage in public culture and interact with people who are not like
them. Some schools—private as well as public—have open, accessible
grounds with amenities for everyone in the area. Others put gates and
security guards on the perimeter to ensure that only a select group comes in.
In recent years, some high schools and universities have discarded the idea
of a physical campus altogether, using the Internet as the main
infrastructure for delivering education and eliminating most of the school’s
social life. But the most notable improvements in academic achievement are
concentrated in schools that have doubled down on the places where face-
to-face interaction between teachers and students happens regularly. Small,
intimate settings where people get to know one another well are not only
ideal places for young people to develop skills for civic engagement and
community building but also ideal places to learn.

In the 1980s, when American political leaders had grown anxious about a
new “urban underclass” and local governments throughout the country
deployed armed security guards to monitor high school campuses, public
schools—particularly those in poor areas—had ceased to be ideal places for
anything. With metal detectors at the gates and pass cards restricting the
circulation of students, educational institutions had come to resemble
prisons. And that’s where a growing number of students were heading, after
failing out of schools that were set up to fail them.
Deborah Meier, a teacher, a principal, and an advocate with nearly three
decades of experience in tough urban districts, belonged to a long tradition
of education reformers who believed that schools worked best when they

---

modeled the best practices of civic and intellectual life, with small
classrooms serving as settings for safe but searching and honest debates.
That’s how the most prestigious urban private schools operated; why
shouldn’t urban public schools do that too? As Meier saw it, the move to
militarize large school campuses represented a dangerous turn in American
education, one that threatened to depersonalize the school experience and
bring out the worst in the nation’s most vulnerable children. Instead of
cracking down on schools, she called for administrators to carve them up
into institutions with about one hundred students per grade and no more
than five hundred total. The goal was to create smaller learning
communities—again, roughly the size of private institutions—where
students and teachers could grow closer, staff could nimbly respond to
emerging issues and needs, and parents could develop deeper local
knowledge and a greater sense of ownership over their child’s school.
“Young people cannot learn democratic values in a setting that does not
value individual achievement, that cannot notice triumphs and defeats, has
no time to celebrate or mourn, or respond with indignation or recognition as
the situation requires,” she wrote in an influential New York Times essay.
“Small schools offer opportunities to solve every one of these critical
issues.”
Meier acknowledged that small schools would not solve all the
problems in American education. Drugs, violence, and vandalism would not
go away simply because students had been moved to a new environment, or
because a giant campus that once held two thousand students had been
transformed into a set of five campuses, each with four hundred students.
But “hugeness,” she believed, “works against lively intellectual
intercourse” and prevents both administrators and parents from improving
conditions at ground level. “In small schools,” on the other hand, “parents
hear about the same teachers, students and families year after year in a
variety of formal and informal ways. Trust builds and issues that arise get
settled handily. Accountability to parents, as well as to the community, is a
less knotty problem. In a small school, strangers and strange behaviors stick
out and can be addressed with dispatch. Trouble-making strangers can be
identified and peer pressure has an inhibiting effect on violence or other
antisocial behavior.”

---

It was a compelling argument—so compelling, in fact, that in the 1990s
and 2000s several large urban school districts began small school
initiatives, and major philanthropies, including the Carnegie Corporation of
New York, the Annenberg Foundation, and the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, poured resources into small school projects. The Gates
Foundation alone invested $650 million, hoping it would yield immediate
results.
The experiments were indeed ambitious. In New York City, for instance,
the Department of Education opened dozens of small high schools,
including specialty schools—for arts, computers and technology, health,
languages, and science, among others—that occupied portions of formerly
large school buildings. Graduation rates at the new small schools quickly
rose high above the city average, and in some failing schools, they spiked.
In Flatbush, a predominantly poor, African American neighborhood in
Brooklyn, the city transformed Erasmus Hall High School into the Erasmus
Hall Educational Complex, with five separate schools. Before the change,
graduation rates at Erasmus were around 40 percent. Within a few years
they topped 90 percent. The change at the Evander Childs High School
building in the Bronx was even more dramatic. In the 1990s and early
2000s, Evander Childs exemplified the problems of large urban school
buildings, with high rates of violence, truancy, and, as of 2002, a four-year
graduation rate of 31 percent. Some students, afraid of conflict, viewed
skipping classes as a survival strategy, if not the best way to get ahead.
Parents had no good options: they could either send their children into the
fire or let their futures burn away slowly without a high school degree.
Reducing the school size resulted in an astoundingly rapid transformation.
Parents and administrators regained control of the campus. Attendance
stabilized. By 2007, the combined graduation rate reached 80 percent.
On a warm spring day in 2016, I joined a librarian from the Seward
Park Library on an outreach visit to the Seward Park Campus, a six-floor,
“vertical campus” in a hulking gray industrial building where five small
schools occupied the space of one old high school. We were there to bring
library programming—that day would be an arts class focused on manga
drawing—into a school system whose budget could hardly cover basic
needs. Fifteen years before, as the Seward Park High School, the institution

---

was overwhelmed by the challenge of educating students from the Lower
East Side’s poor, largely immigrant community. In 2001, its graduation rate
was 32 percent. The small school experiment began there in 2006, and by
2012 the cumulative graduation rate from its five small schools—the High
School for Dual Language and Asian Studies, the New Design High School,
the Essex Street Academy (formerly the High School for History and
Communication), the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy, and the Urban
Assembly Academy of Government and Law—was above 80 percent.
I wasn’t around to observe daily life in the old school, but fortunately
the great journalist Samuel Freedman spent a year there in the late 1980s,
reporting his book Small Victories. Freedman portrays the students,
90 percent of whom were children of immigrants who did not speak
English, as bright and ambitious; at least, the ones who attended were, since
more than 40 percent of entering freshmen dropped out before graduating,
which placed Seward Park High on a list of the ten worst schools in New
York State. The physical campus and organizational structure, however,
created all kinds of obstacles, so many that one boy ran for student
government on the slogan “Are you ashamed to go to Seward?”
Classrooms were impossibly crowded. There was a gaping hole in the
roof and the ceiling of the faculty lounge was crumbling. Some two
hundred windows were broken. The metal fence surrounding the school’s
annex was in disrepair. Basic materials—books, pens, paper, chalk—were
in short supply. Teachers were overloaded and exhausted. Jessica Siegel, the
book’s protagonist, threw herself into teaching and helped the students
accomplish more than seems possible. But she was an anomaly, and,
regardless, the work was so taxing that she quit at year’s end. The principal,
diligent, dedicated, and entirely admirable, was outmatched by the school’s
problems. Most students were too.
The five schools I observed on my visit to the Seward Park Campus
were neat and well organized, and students seemed to have a warm and
familiar relationship with teachers and staff. External reviewers from the
New School’s Center for New York City Affairs found something similar
when they assessed the institution in 2011: “The tone throughout the
building is calm. Hallways don’t get too congested during change of
classes; students were relaxed and well-behaved during the lunchtimes we

---

---

observed in the cafeteria. ‘Like any high school, we have our incidents, but
the kids are good. It’s a safe place,’ a security guard said.” Each institution
controls its own floor, and although their layout is identical, the schools
distinguish themselves through their posters, announcements, fashion, and
culture. They share some common facilities, including a gym and a small
library on the sixth floor. But generally, they operate as separate
institutions, and each is a good place to learn.
Reducing a school’s physical size does not solve all of its problems, but
it has proven to make a tremendous impact on student attention,
achievement, and college matriculation as well as teacher satisfaction and
positive feelings about the school climate. A recent study of twenty-one
thousand New York City students by the independent, nonpartisan research
firm MDRC found that, compared with students in ordinary high schools,
students who attended small schools were 9.4 percentage points more likely
to graduate, 8.4 percentage points more likely to enroll in college, and even
more likely to attend selective universities. These numbers may not sound
high, but—as countless school administrators and academic researchers
know from experience—producing meaningful improvements in
educational outcomes is notoriously difficult; there’s a heated, long-
standing debate, for instance, over whether spending more money on
schools has any impact on performance at all. In this context, gains near
10 percent are extraordinary. There’s no magic bullet for improving school
performance in difficult environments, but designing campuses that
students, teachers, and administrators can collectively control is among the
most effective techniques we’ve found.

Designing campuses that promote learning and community building may be
a relatively new priority in public education circles, where resources are
scarce, but it has always been a central concern of universities, which play
an outsize role in modern societies. The late Richard Dober, a renowned
scholar at Harvard and MIT who designed college campuses throughout the

---

world, estimated that, as of 1992, about 40 percent of the American
population had spent at least one year as a full-time student on one of the
nation’s 3,500 or so college campuses. “Campus design is a civic art that
resonates with meaning and significance for our culture,” he wrote. “The
Greeks had their agora, the Romans their Forum, the Middle Ages their
cathedral and town square, the Renaissance their palaces and enclaves for
the privileged, and the 19th century their centers of commerce,
transportation and government. The campus is uniquely our generation’s
contribution to communal placemaking and placemarking.” When designed
well, it should “promote community, allegiance, and civility, while at the
same time encouraging diversity in discourse and vision.”
The time we spend on college campuses shapes our ideas about what we
want to pursue and who we want to become. It changes our social networks
and work opportunities. It breaks down ethnic and religious divisions,
leading to what we once called “mixed marriages” between people who’d
otherwise never form families together. And even as a growing number of
people on both sides of the political spectrum express concern that colleges
—and particularly partisan student groups—have become inhospitable to
civil debate about controversial topics, there’s no better institution to
prepare us for civic life in democratic societies, giving us the tools we need
to understand difference, evaluate evidence, and engage in reasoned
dialogue with people who don’t share our perspectives or values.
This hasn’t always been the case. Many of the earliest European
universities were designed to solidify social boundaries, not open them. In
Campus: An American Planning Tradition, the Stanford professor Paul
Turner recounts that the first universities, in Bologna and Paris, were part of
the city, and students typically lodged with their families or with
townspeople. As universities developed, local entrepreneurs built halls and
hostels for the students. But many school administrators disliked this
arrangement, as did the aristocratic parents of university students, and
universities began to erect gates and walls to separate their sacred grounds
from the profane communities in which they had been embedded. New
College, at Oxford, built the first enclosed quadrangle that housed all
university functions in 1379. Many schools followed, giving rise to the
model of the college as a segregated residential community as well as an

---

educational institution where students studied, largely in private rooms,
under the direct tutelage of a learned instructor.
Turner identifies several reasons for the use of the enclosed quadrangle
in British colleges, from efficient land use in crowded towns to the
influential tradition of the cloistered monastery. “Simply from an
architectural point of view,” he writes, “the monastic and collegiate
‘programs’ were nearly identical: the housing of a community of unmarried
men and boys, with space for sleeping, eating, instruction, and religious
services.” The walls that divided the college campus from the town served
defensive purposes, protecting students and faculty not only from
occasional wars and local conflicts but also from townspeople. “The early
histories of Oxford and Cambridge abound in incidents of town-gown
antagonism leading to fighting, warfare, and murder on both sides,” Turner
reports. “The ability to close off a college at a few gate-points also gave
college authorities the advantage of greater control over the students, a
concern that was a major factor in the growth of the collegiate system.” By
1410, Oxford required all students to live in colleges rather than in the
town, and that policy remains intact, albeit only for freshmen, today.
Oxford and Cambridge opened up in other ways, however. In the
sixteenth century, when a graduate of Cambridge named Dr. John Caius
raised concerns about the health risks of confining students to stagnant, foul
air, the university built its first three-sided courtyard. (Some attribute the
form to rising fashions in France’s new chateaux.) Whatever its origin,
Turner writes, the new, open campus spaces “suggested a more sympathetic
and less defensive attitude toward the world outside the college.” So too did
the schools’ push to reform admissions policies. During the seventeenth
century, the great British universities made their first efforts to incorporate
local, nonaristocratic children, and a larger proportion of the general
population entered higher education than at any time except the twentieth
century. These trends influenced the first American colleges, which were
more accessible and expansive than anything in the Old World.
Since 1963, when Richard Hofstadter published Anti-intellectualism in
American Life, but especially today, it’s hard not to worry about America’s
weak commitment to intellectual culture. But early American colonists were
interested in the pursuit of ideas, and soon after they settled here they began

---

building colleges to support higher education. “By the time of the
Revolution there were nine degree-granting colleges in the colonies,”
Turner writes. Harvard College was founded in 1636; the College of
William and Mary in 1693; Yale College in 1701; the College of New
Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1746; the College of Rhode Island
(now Brown University) in 1764; Queen’s College (now Rutgers
University) in 1766; and Dartmouth College in 1769. These schools built
grand buildings, the largest in their regions. They tended to be located in
rural, frontier areas rather than distrusted, irreligious cities, and they
encouraged students to spend time in pure, natural environments, “removed
from the distractions of civilizations.”
The campus is an American concept, probably coined around 1770, to
describe the open grounds around the College of New Jersey. Turner
reprints the first recorded use of the term to refer to the area around a
college, from a letter written by a student in 1774: “Last week to show our
patriotism, we gathered all the steward’s winter store of tea, and having
made a fire in the Campus, we there burnt near a dozen pounds, tolled the
bell and made many spirited resolves.” After 1776, the word gained
popularity at colleges throughout the new United States, and by the mid-
nineteenth century it had become the most common term to describe the
grounds around American universities. Eventually it would take on new
meaning for the grounds around corporate offices as well.
There has never been a dominant architectural style for American
college landscapes or buildings. Brown University doesn’t even have a
dominant style on its own campus. But most American schools adopted the
British residential college model and built dormitories to promote a robust
campus culture. Old College, the first building at Harvard, had a spacious
hall on the first floor that served as the hub of most activities. It was, at
various times in the day, a lecture hall, a dining room, and a general living
space. A library and a set of dormitories lined the second floor. Students
shared bedrooms, and even beds, which was not unusual at the time. But,
following the English model, they were each given a private space for
studying, because most educators believed that learning happened when an
individual was alone, memorizing facts and silently contemplating the day’s
lessons.

Yet from the beginning, the architects of America’s universities rejected
the monastic model that influenced European institutions, and designed
them to be deeply social places. The primary motivation was intellectual.
American campus architects wanted to build universities where knowledge
from different fields would circulate freely, across academic domains and
into the world as well. The intellectual life they promoted was never meant
to be contained or disciplined. They aimed for cross-pollination, and the
campus—its classrooms, libraries, dormitories, and dining halls—was an
instrument of convergence.
American campus designers were also intent on building new
communities, and they had novel ideas for fostering social ties. Harvard
was but one of many American schools to organize student life around
colleges, each with its own spaces for dining, studying, and fraternizing.
Princeton developed dining societies, which later became eating clubs, as
the foundation for college social activities. Students played a role in
creating campus culture too. In 1776, five men at the College of William
and Mary started a new student society, Phi Beta Kappa, which eventually
added chapters at universities across the country, becoming the first
intercollegiate fraternity.

Fraternities whose agenda was more social than academic are, of course,
another hallmark of American universities. The first, the Kappa Alpha
Society, was started in 1825 by a group of male students at Union College
in New York who wanted to form an exclusive collegiate organization that
would mirror the social clubs for affluent white men that were prominent at
the time. In 1846, a chapter of Chi Psi at the University of Michigan opened
the first fraternity house in a wooded area off-campus, where they could
operate without official supervision. At the time, most college fraternities
were secret societies, and administrators—at Union, Princeton, and Brown,
among other schools—tried to prohibit them. But fraternities slowly gained
acceptance as legitimate social institutions, in part because they were so

---

popular among elite students, and in part because they offered universities a
free solution to an emerging problem: housing the growing ranks of
enrolled students.
By the late 1890s, fraternities and the women’s equivalent, sororities,
began to open chapter houses on or around university grounds. Eventually
they’d become a staple of the US undergraduate system. Today, there are
more than six thousand fraternity chapters across roughly eight hundred
college campuses; about 10 percent of all male, degree-seeking college
students join a fraternity each fall, and millions of young adults frequent
their parties and social events. The Greek system, as it has become known,
is beloved by students and alumni for whom it defines the collegiate social
experience. Its advocates claim that those who participate in fraternities and
sororities have higher graduation rates than those who shun them. But this
achievement comes at the expense of campus health and safety, and the
system has increasingly come under fire from university administrators
concerned about its effects on campus life.
Fraternities, both as organizations and also as physical places, are an
exemplary form of exclusive social infrastructure. The residential houses
often contain dining facilities, indoor and outdoor recreational areas, bars,
common rooms for entertainment, and ample party space, all of which
encourage members to anchor their lives around them. Since most
fraternities select people with similar backgrounds and interests—ethnicity,
race, religion, class, or often sports (and occasionally academics)—joining
one is an effective way to avoid the diversity and difference a university
offers. Members gain brothers and sisters, but too often lose the chance to
be part of something greater.
Fraternity houses are typically embedded in “rows,” the vibrant social
spaces that sustain a campus’s Greek life, particularly on party nights. They
are also dangerous spaces—sites of rampant discrimination, violent hazing,
excessive drinking, and, too often, sexual assault. The National Study of
Student Hazing, which includes 11,482 surveys with students from fifty-
three American colleges and universities, reports that half of all students
involved in Greek organizations experience hazing, most commonly
involving forced alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep
deprivation, and sex acts. In 2013, Bloomberg News reported that more

---

---

than sixty students had died in fraternity-related activities across US
campuses during the previous eight years, at schools including Penn State,
Baruch, Northern Illinois University, and Fresno State. Studies consistently
find that men who are associated with fraternities are several times more
likely to perpetrate sexual assault than those who are not. And health
scholars have shown that fraternity membership is a significant cause of
binge drinking, even after controlling for background factors. In other
words, the high incidence of trouble at fraternities is not merely due to the
people who join them—it’s also about the places themselves.
In recent years, concerned faculty, students, and the victims of violence
on fraternity rows have called for universities to reform the Greek system.
After completing a massive study of sex on college campuses, however, the
sociologist Lisa Wade concluded that nothing short of abolition would stem
the damage. “Reform is not possible because the old-line, historically white
social fraternities have been synonymous with risk-taking and defiance
from their very inception,” she writes. “They are a brotherhood born in
mutiny and forged in the fire of rebellion. These fraternities have drink,
danger and debauchery in their blood—right alongside secrecy and self-
protection.” It’s difficult to abolish a social institution that has so many
loyal and influential champions, and equally difficult to unbuild a social
infrastructure that shapes so much of university life. But fraternities have
earned an expulsion.

Fraternities are not the only divisive social infrastructures on college
campuses. American universities rarely built the kind of high walls that
protected colleges at Oxford and Cambridge from the communities around
them, but many schools, particularly those in cities, have buttressed their
exclusive admissions standards with elaborate physical and organizational
systems that separate students and faculty from neighboring people and
places perceived as dangerous. Today, large campus security operations

---

reinforce these perceptions at universities throughout the country, and make
the distinction between insiders and outsiders especially sharp.
Conventionally, college administrators and city planners think of
“town/gown” divisions as especially bad for residents, not students, because
they’re the ones excluded from campus amenities and stuck dealing with a
raucous population of young people who haven’t learned to be good
neighbors. But universities that cut themselves off from surrounding
communities also hurt students, giving them a false sense of superiority and
depriving them of opportunities to learn from their neighbors and develop
the civic skills that they—and all of us—urgently need.
In recent years, several schools have begun experimenting with new
models of civic engagement. In 2017, for instance, Colby College
announced that it would lead a collaborative urban revitalization project
that includes business owners, philanthropic organizations, and civic groups
in its struggling hometown of Waterville, Maine. Colby announced that it
would invest $10 million to purchase five properties in the downtown area,
which it would convert into a hotel, a tech hub, and a 100,000-square-foot,
five-story, mixed-use dormitory that would bring about two hundred
students off-campus and into the community. When completed, the complex
will include retail outlets as well as a public meeting space on the ground
level, facilities designed to bridge the historic gap between town and gown.
To bolster the effort, Colby faculty and administrators are developing a new
“civic engagement curriculum,” which will involve partnerships with the
Waterville Public Library and a local homeless shelter, for all students who
live in the downtown dormitory.
Partnering with the local community is more complicated at the
University of Chicago, an affluent and prestigious school with a long
history of excluding its African American neighbors. Despite a rhetorical
commitment to liberalism and tolerance, during the 1950s the university’s
leaders established a fund they could use for “area protection” against what
the former director of community interest called “negro invasion.” The
university president incentivized the board of trustees to support this
initiative by taking members on a bus tour of “typical colored
neighborhoods,” which was designed to provoke anxieties about what
would happen in Hyde Park if the university didn’t acquire more real estate

---

in the area surrounding the school. The scheme worked, as the trustees
donated $4.5 million to a fund that would, as the chancellor, Lawrence
Kimpton, put it, “buy, control, and rebuild our neighborhood.”
Substantial as it was, the fund proved woefully inadequate to secure the
area around campus from the crime that pervaded Chicago’s postindustrial
ghettos in the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, university leaders had largely
given up their efforts to control adjacent real estate. They invested in
policing instead of property, a move made possible by the Illinois Private
College Campus Police Act of 1992, which gave universities in high-crime
areas all the legal powers of a police force but few of the public reporting
obligations. Within a few years the university had built one of the nation’s
largest private security forces, and it made sure all prospective and entering
students knew how well they would be protected once they arrived on
campus.
But only if they stayed on campus: although the university’s officers
had jurisdiction to patrol off-campus, former students report that school
officials advised them not to cross into the black neighborhoods around
them, including Woodlawn, Washington Park, South Shore, Kenwood, and
Oakland, because they’d be targets of crime. As compensation, the
University of Chicago invested heavily in its own, internal social
infrastructure: libraries, bookstores, cafés, art museums, theaters, and
athletic facilities. It assured students that everything they needed was right
on campus—or, if they felt adventurous, in the wealthy neighborhoods far
to the north.
The university’s student body has grown more diverse in recent
decades, but today African Americans constitute less than 10 percent of the
undergraduate population, compared with 85 percent in the adjacent
neighborhood of Woodlawn, 68 percent in Kenwood, and 96 percent in
Washington Park. In the twenty-first century, college leaders have made
serious efforts to pierce the bubble of student culture and help the young
people who study on its South Side campus engage their neighbors. In
2000, it released the Midway Plaisance Master Plan, which revitalized
parks that are heavily used by local African American communities as well
as students. In 2005, it launched the Urban Health Initiative, which
improved access to public health programming and high-quality medical

---

care in underserved areas around campus. It opened an Office of Civic
Engagement, and declared that the school would now act “as an anchor
institution on the mid–South Side.” Leaders promised that they would
“partner within our city and surrounding communities to share talent,
information, and resources to have a positive impact on our city’s well-
being.” They maintained the strong police presence in the area, but they
stopped advising students to avoid neighboring communities.
More recently, they even began building social infrastructure that
bridges the divide.
In the late 2000s, the celebrated local artist and University of Chicago
faculty member Theaster Gates persuaded the university to purchase a
string of abandoned buildings on Garfield Boulevard, a corridor in the
Washington Park neighborhood just west of campus that was once a hub of
commercial activity but had been hollowed out by decades of depopulation
and economic decline. The plan, which the university hatched with the City
of Chicago, Cook County, and several neighborhood organizations, was to
transform the zone into an “Arts Block.” The University of Chicago Arts
Incubator, which would include galleries, studio space, classrooms, a
community room, and a garden, would reside in the largest corner building.
The two adjacent buildings would be leased to Gates for two for-profit,
entrepreneurial projects: the Currency Exchange Café and BING Art Books.
The university promised that the complex would stimulate economic
growth and add cultural vitality to the struggling neighborhood. The Arts
Incubator would offer extensive programming for local children and paid
fellowships for local artists. The businesses would generate new jobs and
attract more people into the community. And, as Gates and other University
of Chicago leaders envisioned, they would bring students off the “safe
space” on campus and into a place where they would interact with people
whose race, class, and status were different from those they had grown up
with at home.
When I first visit the Arts Block, in early 2017, I can’t help but notice
how much the streetscape resembles places like North Lawndale and
Englewood, where the decrepit social infrastructure led to such high death
tolls during the heat wave and degrades the quality of life every day.
Garfield Boulevard is lined with empty lots, shuttered factories, and

---

boarded-up businesses, and the residential blocks stemming from it are
similarly depleted, with large grassy fields where grand homes and
apartment buildings once stood. I park in front of a beat-up hardware store,
one of the few open businesses near the Arts Block, and see two homeless
men salvaging garbage from the lot next door. We nod at each other, I cross
the street, and the men get back to work.
The Arts Incubator, which opened in 2013, is on the west corner of the
complex. There’s a bright, open gallery encased in large glass windows on
the ground floor, but when I pull on the front door it’s locked—a sign that
the management remains on guard. Immediately, though, a young woman
with long, wavy hair and a wide beige scarf pops out from a back room and
motions that she’s coming. She smiles warmly, opens the door, and
introduces herself. Her name is Nadia, and she’d been working there for a
year after leaving her job in a public school. There’s a student art exhibit
there, and Nadia tells me that it was entirely produced and curated by kids
from neighborhood schools. “You should have come last week, for the
opening,” she says. “We had more than 150 people.”
Nadia closes the door behind me, walks me around the exhibit, and
offers a tour of the building. As we leave the gallery a group of middle-aged
women carrying yoga mats comes downstairs. “We have classes two days a
week now,” Nadia explains. “They’re free, so people just pop in from the
neighborhood. I’m jealous!” We walk down a long hallway, past the private
studios and into a backyard that local students and staff are turning into a
rain garden. Next to it there’s a large woodshop, where the staff runs a
design apprenticeship program for teenagers, thirty of whom come each
day. Theaster Gates is involved in the program, and the shelves are full of
his objects and supplies. Nadia points to a set of ceramic teacups. “Theaster
made these,” she says. “And now every design class begins with a tea
ceremony. It’s just a way of marking the time as special, of getting everyone
to truly be here.”
The Arts Block, I can discern, is wholly dedicated to that project. Gates,
renowned for recovering decaying objects from abandoned city buildings
and transforming them into “urban interventions” with aesthetic and
economic benefits, is the creative force behind the initiative. And while he
oversees the university’s community arts programming, on Garfield

---

Boulevard he’s focused on his two small businesses, the Currency
Exchange Café and BING Art Books next door.
After my visit to the Arts Incubator, Nadia points me next door to the
café, which Gates, in signature style, decorated with the original, hand-
painted signage from the down-market neighborhood financial institution
that once occupied the space. Megan Jeyifo, the café manager who joins me
for a lunch of jambalaya and corn bread, explains that “it’s no accident that
the most visible, public-facing places that Theaster has developed used to
be commercial establishments.” The biggest aim of Gates’s project is to
provide stable employment to local residents while also proving that small
businesses on Garfield Boulevard can be successful. “Theaster always says
that this has to work because he has skin in the game!,” Megan tells me.
“It’s not a community organization. It’s not just an art project. We want it to
be a model for entrepreneurs who believe in this neighborhood. And the
first big challenge is getting people here.”
It seems to be working. The café is bustling and there’s a diverse
clientele: students poring over books, freelancers on laptops, retirees
sipping coffee. “The café was more of a formal restaurant when it started,”
Megan explains. “That appealed to some of the older clientele. But most
people were coming in and hoping to stay awhile, and they didn’t need to
be bothered by waiters every few minutes. We switched to counter service
and loosened things up.” They also started to do more special programming,
including a regular Jazz Monday series that has become a popular
neighborhood social event and Story Time, a reading program for local
kids.
Most of the customers are local residents, but Megan has worked hard
to get the university community there as well. “They invited me to do a
panel on community service at the first-year orientation,” she tells me.
“And the fact that they did is a sign of how things have changed. All the
other panelists talked about volunteering, so I just said: ‘The only thing I
ask of you is to come and sit at our communal table. Just visit. Get
something to eat or drink. That will make a difference. And I bet you’ll
come back after that.’
“The next week this kid, blond and baby-faced, came and sat at the
communal table. He sat right next to one of our regulars, someone who’s

---

---

pretty active and entrepreneurial in the neighborhood too. Well, one of our
servers saw the kid and got worried. He thought it was a twelve-year-old
here without a parent and wanted to make sure he was okay. I went over to
say hello, just see what was going on. And the kid said he’d seen me on the
panel and wanted to take me up on the request! And, you know, now the
students are coming. Sometimes too many come and they’re working here
at the wrong time—like on a Saturday, when we actually need the tables!
But they show up. They’re hanging out. And that’s beginning to make a
difference. It’s a long, complicated history, the university and this
neighborhood. We’re not going to change it overnight, but we’re going to
make a start.”

No one thinks that the deeply rooted town and gown conflicts in places like
Chicago’s South Side will be resolved quickly, but there is one set of
higher-education institutions that’s attempting an immediate, radical
transformation of the way that colleges interact with the outside world: new
online universities that rely solely on massive open online courses, or
MOOCs. Rather than building traditional campuses, or any kind of physical
structure embedded in a larger town or city, these schools use the Internet as
the lecture hall and seminar room, and as the core social infrastructure too.
MOOCs first gained public attention in 2011, when a handful of
prominent professors and administrators from elite universities suggested
that they could help reduce costs and expand access to higher education.
Initially, universities opened select courses, free of charge, to anyone with
an Internet connection, and enormous numbers of people signed up. When
the Stanford computer scientist Sebastian Thrun offered his artificial
intelligence class as a MOOC, more than 160,000 people from 190
countries enrolled. Stanford, and several other universities, quickly set up
nonprofit online ventures to supplement their offerings.
The extraordinary enrollment numbers also attracted the attention of
entrepreneurs in the technology industry, who saw MOOCs as a natural way

---

to “disrupt” the roughly $500 billion higher-education market. Silicon
Valley venture capitalists partnered with the first stars of online education,
including Thrun and his Stanford computer science colleagues Andrew Ng
and Daphne Koller. Soon several commercial, for-profit ventures were
competing for student dollars, including Thrun’s start-up, Udacity, and
Coursera, cofounded by Ng and Koller. On the other coast, Harvard and
MIT partnered to start a nonprofit MOOC business, edX. Many of the
world’s leading scholars signed up to record online versions of their lecture
courses, and millions of people around the world registered to take them.
As MOOCs gained press and popularity, college administrators worried
that online education really would disrupt their operations, taking students
—and their tuition dollars—out of the university and into the pockets of
new technology firms. But their anxieties waned as the first waves of data
on student performance went public. Although, according to a Pew
Research Center survey, 16 percent of American adults reported that they’d
taken at least part of an online course in the previous year, the great
majority of them had already completed two- or four-year college
programs. They were taking individual classes to develop new skills and
knowledge on sites like Khan Academy.org, a free online learning platform
created by the entrepreneur Sal Khan, not enrolling in certificate or degree
programs. Moreover, as several studies have concluded, only a small
fraction of the students who enrolled in MOOCs actually completed the
courses. A research team that includes Coursera cofounder Daphne Koller
and the University of Pennsylvania professor Ezekiel Emanuel, for instance,
reports that “just 4% of Coursera users who watch at least one course
lecture go on to complete the course and receive a credential.” The courses
reach millions of people, many of them in the developing world, who
otherwise would not have access to leading professors in the United States
and Europe, but they have not succeeded in their threat to take down brick-
and-mortar colleges, at least not yet.
One reason that online universities have failed to develop long-term,
degree-granting programs is that they lack a strong social infrastructure.
Students who enroll in Coursera or Udacity, which as of 2016 had twenty-
three million and four million registered users, respectively, simply cannot
build the personal relationships and career networks that make a university

---

education so valuable, nor can they participate in the campus activities that
make a college experience so rich. Online universities have tried to address
this deficiency. Some offer online discussion forums, others have virtual
laboratories, and a few—following the model established by the Open
University, Britain’s massively successful distance teaching project—
organize regional meet-ups. None of them come close to reproducing the
social experience of a residential college, nor even the thinner campus life
at commuter schools where flesh-and-blood, part-time students study
together for shorter terms.
In 2012, the tech entrepreneur Ben Nelson assembled a small team of
education experts, including the former Harvard president Lawrence
Summers; Stephen Kosslyn, director of Stanford’s Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences; and Bob Kerrey, former US senator and
president of the New School, to try a different approach. Billing itself
“Higher Education for the 21st Century,” Minerva promised to combine the
best features of online education with a truly global university experience.
Students would take all of their courses online, in small seminars conducted
through an active learning interface that allows faculty—who work from
locations all over the world rather than near the students—to give individual
feedback in real time or after class. Each cohort, 120 at first and then larger
as the program developed, would spend the first year in San Francisco,
where Minerva leased dorm space in a renovated residential hotel. They
would spend each of the following six semesters living in a different city—
Berlin, Buenos Aires, Hyderabad, London, Seoul, and Taipei—where
together, in leased dorms and hostels, they would share an immersive,
collective, flesh-and-bones experience. And the entire four-year education
would cost a fraction of what students pay for a traditional American
college degree, because, as the Minerva website explains: “Instead of
investing in maintaining the expensive buildings, campus facilities, and
amenities found at other top universities, Minerva uses the vast resources of
major world cities as its infrastructure.”
I first visited Minerva’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco in the
spring of 2017, toward the end of its second academic year. Jonathan
Katzman, the chief product officer, told me that his team designed the
school’s infrastructure to match contemporary lifestyles and learning styles.

---

“We had two tenets,” he explains. “First, if we house students in a city, we
should take advantage of the city’s features and amenities. Students should
use the city library for studying, or else local cafés. We don’t need to build a
symphony hall, a theater, or an athletic complex, because the cities where
our students go have all of these things, and we can make sure they know
how to use them. We can do more too. Major cultural institutions here have
staff that do outreach and education. Our students got to learn how to sing
opera…in the San Francisco Opera House! They performed plays…on the
stage of the A. C. T. Theater. They volunteer to work on homelessness,
public health, all kinds of things. They interact with the real city, every
day.” Clearly someone is paying for the social infrastructure being used by
Minerva, but it’s not the students.
Though it’s a new university, Minerva is trying to establish its own
rituals and traditions, which it layers onto the social infrastructure. “There
are a few big things already,” says Capri La Rocca, the city experience
manager. “We have legacy groups, which are kind of like the Sorting Hat
groups in Harry Potter. They’re named for things in San Francisco, like
Ocean, Gate, and Tower. The students meet in special places, and they’ve
been making videos and stories to pass on to the next cohorts. And the big
common thing is the 10:01. Assignments are due every Sunday at ten p.m.,
and so we started a weekly ritual meal that everyone attends. The students
are from all over the world, and each week a group from one of the
countries or regions makes dinner and does some cultural programming.
Usually it ends with their favorite party music, and everyone dancing until
way too late.”
Minerva is serious about the social side of university culture, but school
leaders want the school to become prestigious because of its academic
offerings, and they’ve built an infrastructure to support that. Katzman tells
me that the second tenet of the school design is that the teaching
technology, a portal that his team developed, must deliver an educational
experience that’s at least as good as what students get from an in-person
seminar, possibly better. “We have excellent professors, faculty from all
over the world who can teach for us because of our technology,” he
explains, “and we only do small seminars [live, highly interactive, and

---

usually including only twelve to eighteen students], not lectures, because
that’s the best way for students to learn.”
I’ve spent my career teaching in person, not on the screen, and naturally
I express some skepticism. “Honestly,” Katzman pushes back. “These are
some of the most intense classes you will ever see, and the technology
helps, because you see everyone’s face on the screen, all at once, unless the
instructor wants to do breakout groups or some other layout. Everyone is on
the same level. There is no back row, no place where you can disappear.
And there’s this incredibly rich interaction between students, and between
students and faculty. Also, every class is recorded, which means professors
can literally review what happens when someone is struggling with the
material. They can give the kind of feedback you just don’t get in a
traditional classroom.”
Recently, Minerva released some data that backs this up. In 2016 and
2017, the school administered the Collegiate Learning Assessment, a
standardized test that assesses how much students learn during a single
academic year. In the fall, Minerva freshmen ranked in the 95th percentile
compared with freshmen at other schools, and, because the program is
highly selective and students are quite advanced when they enter, they
ranked at the 78th percentile compared with college seniors as well. After
eight months of intensive instruction at Minerva, the freshmen performed at
the 99th percentile—not only among college freshmen but also when
compared with seniors across the United States. “The average score of our
students at the end of their freshman spring term was higher than the scores
of senior graduating classes at every other university and college that
administered the test,” writes Stephen Kosslyn, the founding dean and chief
academic officer. “Minerva’s performance is unique in [the Collegiate
Learning Assessment] history.” The new school was already ranked number
one in the measure it takes most seriously: helping students learn.
I asked Minerva if I could speak to some of the students, and they
introduced me to three who are finishing up their first year. Each of them
seems older and more mature than the first-year students I’ve taught in
Manhattan, and perhaps that’s not surprising. Although about twenty
thousand people applied for one of the 160 spots in the class of 2022, those

---

---

who get accepted, and then select the school over more conventional
options, are clearly unlike the typical freshman.
In some ways, though, they are just like most university students.
They’re looking to discover things, to build relationships and have
experiences that will shape them forever. “We’re a close-knit community.
Pretty much everyone knows everyone,” says Zane, a precocious eighteen-
year-old from Southern California. “But we’re also incredibly diverse. I
keep thinking that if I’d gone to UCLA, where a lot of my high school
friends are, my life would have been totally predictable. I’d have studied
computational mathematics. I’d have hung out with my old friends, stayed
around California or LA. But this is an adventure. Everything is open and
uncertain. I really believe that where you are shapes who you will be. And I
am going to be all over the world, getting to know these different places and
cultures. I already know that I’m going to be very different because I’m
here. And I can’t believe how much I’m learning.”
When we finish our group conversation, Zane asks if he can walk me to
the garage and get some advice. We leave the Minerva office, head up
Market Street, and cross over toward the San Francisco Civic Center. We
see another student, and he and Zane shout out to each other as they
approach, slap hands, make plans for later. There’s a man drumming on a
plastic bucket, and Zane uses the moment to tell me he wants to spend the
summer in New York City, doing an independent study on drumming
circles. “I can bartend. Couch surf a bit. There are some Minerva students
from there and I’m sure they can help me out when I get there,” he explains.
“Like I told you, we’re all pretty tight.” The advice he wants turns out not
to concern academic research; he wants to know if I have friends or
students who can give him a place to stay.
We stop at a traffic light and scan the plaza in front of us. There are
government types in jackets and ties, European tourists, homeless people
walking toward the library, cyclists whizzing past. Zane breathes out and
his body relaxes, as if he feels at home.

Minerva students, like those at most universities, live close to a library, but
theirs is run by the City of San Francisco rather than the school. It’s a fitting
arrangement, since in San Francisco, as in so many contemporary cities, the
library may well be the single institution that’s most responsible for
inspiring people to learn. When I’d done fieldwork in the Seward Park
branch of New York City’s library system, Andrew, the library worker who
called for more “palaces for the people,” told me that helping children learn
how much there is to learn in the world is the most rewarding thing about
his job. “In three years here I’ve seen a lot of this neighborhood’s children
grow up,” he explained. “I’ve seen kids learn to read. I’ve seen teenagers
become regulars. I’ve seen some get in trouble, then turn things around.
And it’s great to witness growth in people, to watch kids become adults.”
I observed this myself in various branch libraries. In Seward Park, most
days began with groups of children from local day care centers and
elementary schools parading through the building hand in hand, or with
each small person holding on to a common line. They headed directly to the
second-floor children’s space, where a team of librarians and thousands of
books awaited them. In Chinatown, where most parents are immigrants,
often with limited knowledge of English and little money for buying books,
the library is the key site for teaching literacy. The library staff offers
classes for children, parents, and caregivers throughout the day. Among the
programs I attended: story time, bilingual sing-along and reading, arts and
crafts, basic computing, how to do research, homework help, college
preparation. I watched teachers from elementary schools that, due to
funding cuts in the public education system, no longer have their own
libraries bring their entire class to Seward Park for special projects and to
simply borrow books. I spent afternoons in the company of high school
students who hung out, studied, and played computer games in the
dedicated teen space because it was better than being out in the streets. I
saw children’s librarians organize special programs for families with an
incarcerated parent, so that kids whose sense of shame and isolation made it
hard to focus on schoolwork and build solid friendships could meet other
kids in their situation. I met young people who said that outside the library
they faced a world of constraints, whereas inside they saw only abundance,
and permission to take whatever they wanted.

---

I interviewed dozens of people about their memories of growing up in
libraries and learned about all kinds of ways that the experience mattered:
Discovering an interest that they’d never have found without librarians,
open stacks, or a video collection. Feeling liberated, responsible, intelligent.
Forging a new relationship, deepening an old one. Sensing, in some cases
for the first time, that they belong.
Sharon Marcus, for instance, grew up in a working-class family in
Queens where money was tight and everyone was busy. “Home was not
peaceful,” she recalls. “And the park, where I spent a lot of time, was
rambunctious. There was never really any spot that you could just sit and be
by yourself. I was an introvert, and I needed some time when I wasn’t
gonna talk to anyone. I wanted to read for as long as I wanted, to be
completely in charge of my time, my energy, how I was using my attention,
where I was directing it, for how long. And the library was a place I could
go and ignore people, but also know that I wasn’t alone. We didn’t go on
vacations, we didn’t travel. So the library was where I went to escape
everything, and where I could glimpse a better reality.”
Sharon has vivid memories of the books she read in her branch library.
It started with stories about ordinary kids in New York City living lives very
different from hers, and in time she grew interested in books about female
actresses and film stars. “I remember finding a whole bunch of biographies
of women who were queens and saints. Even now, I can physically see
where this section was in the building. I was interested in queens because,
well, why wouldn’t I be? They were like men who had done something. I
got interested in Queen Elizabeth the First because she was Henry VIII’s
daughter. I used the card catalog and found a book, and then next to it there
was some other Elizabeth, some crazy Hungarian Christian saint who got
leprosy deliberately or something, I remember reading that too. I don’t
know how they organized that section but it was basically about women
who had achieved things. I devoured it.”
The library became even more important to Sharon when she entered
adolescence. “I was so excited when I realized you could read old
newspapers on microfilm, and watch old movies at the library too. The
librarians always let me, and they didn’t ask a lot of questions. That was so
important,” Sharon tells me. “I never, ever encountered a librarian who said

---

something like ‘Why would you want to do that?’ or ‘I can’t let you use that
machine, you’re too young.’ I was shy, but they never made me feel weird.
Nobody treated me like I was special or supersmart, either. They were just
neutral. And that, I think, was a real gift. It made the library a space of
permission, not encouragement that pushed you in a certain direction,
where you feel like people are watching you and like giving their approval,
but just freedom to pursue what you want.”
No other place in Sharon’s life worked that way: not home, where her
parents monitored her choices; not synagogue, where she felt intense moral
pressure but no sense of belonging; not school, where teachers and staff
were quick to judge. The library, she learned, could accommodate nearly all
of her interests, especially if she left her neighborhood and visited the main
Queens Library or the stunning central library on Forty-Second Street and
Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. “I remember going there to do a big research
paper in high school,” she explains. “It was before the Internet, and finding
things took so much more effort. I remember feeling really good then. I was
so far beyond the children’s room, and even the collection at my little
branch library. I realized that there were all these things I wanted to
understand about how the world worked, and that here I could find the
answers through books and reading.” She remains a regular, to this day,
though now that she’s the Orlando Harriman Professor of English and
Comparative Literature at Columbia University, finding time for public
library visits isn’t as easy as it was when she was a kid.
Jelani Cobb, who grew up in Hollis, Queens, during the 1970s, also
believes that the most important part of his education happened in his
neighborhood library. His father, who migrated from southern Georgia, was
an electrician who started working at age nine and had only a third-grade
education; his mother, from Alabama, had a high school degree. “This was a
middle-class African American community with a lot of migration-
generation folk who had southern accents,” he says. “They’d found a
foothold in the city and were beginning to make some progress for
themselves. They hadn’t been able to get formal education, but education
was very important to them. They’d take a great deal of pride in reading the
newspaper every single day, going to the library, taking out books and so
on, supplementing what they didn’t get as kids.”

---

Jelani remembers getting his first library card. “I was about nine years
old and going to a new school, and on the way back we stopped at the
public library on 204th Street and Hollis Avenue. We went in and my
mother told me to tell the woman what I wanted. I said that I wanted a
library card and the woman couldn’t quite hear me and so she leaned over
to hear better and my mother said to her, ‘No, sit back up.’ And she told me
to speak loudly so the woman could hear.”
“And so I did. I said I wanted to get a library card. I think if you were
old enough to sign your name you could get a card. And she gave me the
thing! I signed my name and the card was mine!”
One of the first books he took out was about Thomas Edison, and it
reported that as a child Edison read a one-foot stack of books each week. “I
set out to do the same thing, and of course, I don’t think I did it,” Jelani
recalls. “But that sparked a lifelong habit of spending many hours reading,
which is amazing. And I remember being fascinated by the idea that as a
young person, you could go to this place and read anything that you wanted.
All these things were on the shelves! It was almost kind of like, ‘Do people
know about this?’ It was like, ‘Is the jig up?’ I was worried they’d find out
what happens here and shut it down!”
Jelani and his mother spent a lot of time together at the library. As he
got older, she went back to school, getting a bachelor’s degree and then a
master’s at New York University. One time, he remembers, “my mother
took out a small book. It was maybe thirty pages and I couldn’t believe that
this was like a book for grown-ups. I thought that grown-ups read books
that were really big and so I was interested in this book. I wanted to read it
but she was like, ‘No, this book is for grown-ups.’
“And I was like, well, ‘I can read it! I can!’ And so I read it, and it’s
about this man who has this bag of gold and he’s going around with it and
he wants to go swimming but he can’t, and he wants to do something else
but he can’t. And all these times the bag of gold is getting in his way. And
eventually he loses the bag, but then as he was looking for it, he winds up
doing all these things that he couldn’t do while he had it. I was like, ‘Okay,
this is a nice story.’ And my mother was like, ‘Do you get it?’ And I was
like, ‘Yeah, the man lost his bag and then he did this and then he did that.’
And then she said, ‘No, this is what is called a metaphor.’ And I specifically

---

remember that. It was when I learned what a metaphor was and how it
functioned in literature. She explained that the reason the story is so short
and is still for grown-ups is that it’s actually making a deeper point, that a
book is often more than what the story is saying on the surface. That was
quite a thing to learn!”
Jelani also spent a lot of time alone in the library, exploring politics, art,
and literature, and sometimes delving into controversial topics that he’d
grown curious about during conversations at home or in church. “I was
raised Catholic, and when I was fifteen I somehow got interested in
euthanasia and began to form an opinion about it. I had to do a report for
school, and I started by interviewing my priest. He had baptized me,
actually. And he explained that as Catholics, we were opposed to
euthanasia, and I was kind of like, ‘Okay, right.’ But then I went to the
library and started reading these things on my own. And I realized, you
know, I think I disagree with this! People should have the right to choose
when to die. And it wound up being an opinion that I hold to this day. And
honestly, had I not kind of gotten into that topic on my own and actually
just done that reading at the library, I probably would have just said, you
know, this is what we believe as Catholics, and that’s it.” The library, he
says, helped him become his own person, free to question authority and
think for himself. Today, those are skills that he uses often. He’s a staff
writer for the New Yorker and a professor of journalism at Columbia.
Jelani’s mother died in 2011, and he wanted to do something to honor
her love for the library and his memory of the time they spent there
together. “The year she passed away, I purchased a computer at our branch
of the Queens Library, the one where she’d taken me to get my first library
card. I put a little plaque on it that says ‘For Mary Cobb.’ I thought it would
be a contribution to a place that my mother felt was valuable. And I felt like
it was the right thing to do because it was so central for both of us. I mean,
everything I do started from being able to read all those books when I was
nine or ten.”
Today, our communities are full of children whose future, like Jelani’s,
will be formed in the places where they go to learn about themselves and
the world they’ll inherit. They deserve palaces. Whether they get them is up
to us.

## CHAPTER FOUR

## Healthy Bonds

Every four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) issues
grades for the nation’s infrastructure, and if the federal government were a
high school student, it would tear up the report before bringing it home. In
2017, as in 2013, America’s overall infrastructure score was a D+, but it
could have been worse. The rail network, despite high-profile failures of the
Amtrak line in the busy Northeast Corridor and the New York City subway
system, got a B. Seven systems, including hazardous waste, levees, ports,
schools, and wastewater, received modestly better grades than in the
previous assessment. Parks, transit, and solid waste did worse, while others,
such as aviation (D), roads (D), drinking water (D), and energy (D+),
retained their miserably low scores.

---

It’s not surprising that the ASCE does not grade social infrastructure,
which is only now becoming a common concept. But it’s strange that the
ASCE refrains from scoring the nation’s health and food infrastructures,
which are as essential to our well-being as any other vital systems. As
anyone who has been treated in an urban public hospital, visited a fallen
industrial town or destitute rural community, or shopped for fresh produce
in a low-income neighborhood knows, the places that make healthy living
possible are also in disrepair. No one questions the urgent need for
investments in the nation’s outdated systems for transit, electricity, energy,
and storm protection. But are the dire health problems that stem from
shoddy social infrastructure any less pressing or dangerous?
Consider, for instance, the largest American public health crisis since
the HIV/AIDS epidemic: opioid addiction. Since the late 1990s, the United
States has experienced a dramatic increase in the sale, use, and abuse of
prescription pain relievers, such as codeine and hydrocodone, as well as
street drugs like heroin. The results have been devastating. Hundreds of
thousands of people have died and countless communities, particularly in
small towns and rural areas, have been ravaged. The addiction crisis has
taken a financial toll as well. One 2016 study estimated that the opioid
epidemic had already cost the US economy almost $80 billion.
The most serious consequence of the opioid crisis is an alarming rise in
overdose deaths. In 2016, sixty-four thousand Americans were killed by
overdoses—triple the number of 2000—with the vast majority of deaths
linked to opioid abuse. To put this in perspective, it means more Americans
died of overdoses in a single year than during the entirety of the Vietnam
War. And the problem appears only to be getting worse. Health officials
believe it likely that, absent a drastic intervention, five hundred thousand
Americans will die from opioids in the next decade alone.
There is no single cause of the epidemic, but there’s growing evidence
that an important and often overlooked factor is the loss of social cohesion
and social support. In 2015, the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus
Deaton identified a historically unprecedented increase in the number of
white Americans dying in middle age. This was due largely to fatalities
from drug and alcohol abuse as well as suicide, which Case and Deaton
would later term “deaths of despair.” The economists, who had been

---

influenced by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim’s classic account of
suicide as a consequence of profound social disruption, argued that these
fatalities were tied to large-scale economic and social changes. In addition
to facing a decline in job opportunities, white people with little education
were experiencing a loss of traditional rituals and social institutions that had
long served as sources of support. Marriage rates are down. Divorce
remains common. Families are fragmented. Local government agencies are
strapped for resources. Libraries and childcare centers have fewer open
hours. Churches are scrambling to meet new challenges and demands.
“These changes left people with less structure when they came to choose
their careers, their religion, and the nature of their family lives,” they write.
“When such choices succeed, they are liberating; when they fail, the
individual can only hold himself or herself responsible. In the worst cases
of failure, this is a Durkheim-like recipe for suicide.”
How does a loss of community result in more people using painkillers?
Intriguingly, there’s a growing body of neurological research showing that
opioids are, chemically speaking, a good analog for social connection. In
one recent lab study, subjects were given naltrexone, a chemical that blocks
the body’s ability to produce its own, naturally occurring opioids. Without
these chemicals, individuals felt more socially disconnected from other
people. This reminds us that taking synthetic opioids, of the sort currently
wreaking havoc on struggling American communities, can soothe physical
pain, psychological anguish, and the agony of social disconnection as well.
Today, much of the evidence that social isolation and opioid addiction
are linked is anecdotal, based largely on users who say that they turn to
drugs after losing a job or a sense of belonging. One heroin addict in the
Rust Belt city of Mc Keesport, Pennsylvania, told the sociologist Katherine
Mc Lean that the city’s drug problems stemmed directly from a shredded
social fabric. “There is no sense of community here,” she said. “Not one,
not one iota of community here…. So, left to your own devices, somebody
that’s drinking and drugging is gonna continue drinking and drugging.
Nothing else, cause there ain’t shit else to do.”
But anecdotes are not our only evidence. There’s new empirical work
that establishes a clear connection between the strength of a community’s
social ties and its ability to withstand opioid abuse. In 2017, a study by the

---

Harvard graduate student Michael Zoorob found that communities with
strong social capital—as measured by things like the density of civic
organizations and the rates at which citizens voted—were more likely to be
insulated from the opioid crisis than comparatively fragile communities.
This remained true even when Zoorob took into account factors such as
income, education level, and the rate of painkiller prescriptions. Such a
finding may indicate that people in stronger communities are less likely to
become addicted to drugs or, possibly, that socially isolated people who use
drugs are more likely to die from them. One of the most intriguing ideas in
Zoorob’s study is that overdose deaths—not unlike deaths from heat waves
—may be higher among people with weaker social networks. Among the
many reasons: if someone overdoses while they’re alone, there’s no one
there to find them and call 911.
While restoring a broken social infrastructure is a critical long-term
project, many cities and towns in the United States are asking what they can
do right now to reduce the rate of overdose deaths. To answer this question,
it’s worth looking at another country that once faced a similar problem:
Switzerland.
Beginning in the 1970s, Switzerland saw an alarming number of its
citizens become addicted to heroin. Initially, the Swiss responded to this in
the same way the United States has traditionally responded to drug use,
with tougher law enforcement. Courts issued stiffer sentences for drug users
and dealers, while police dispersed people who took drugs in public places.
But the problem only got worse. In addition to seeing more young people
take up the needle, the country also witnessed a frightening increase in
property crime, HIV infection, and overdose deaths.
In 1987, increasingly desperate, authorities in Zurich tried the opposite
approach. Instead of facing harsh penalties, addicts would now be allowed
to use drugs openly, but only in a specific area of the city, Platzspitz Park.
Fans of the television series The Wire will recognize this strategy as similar
to the one deployed in Baltimore’s fictional “Hamsterdam.” As in
Hamsterdam, this approach did little to stem the problem of addiction and
created intense spillover effects, such as increased crime in areas around the
park. Meanwhile, legalization did little to stem the number of overdoses.

---

Switzerland is not an especially progressive country. Swiss women, for
example, only gained the right to vote in 1971. Yet, a country of bankers is
nothing if not pragmatic. Stymied, authorities struck on a plan that was both
radical and full of common sense. What was killing people, authorities
realized, was not heroin use per se, but using heroin alone, under unsafe
conditions. The Swiss government ultimately decided that the best way to
protect users was to give them the drug. However, the heroin would be
administered only in clinics where the addicts could receive proper
supervision, and the drugs would be pharmaceutical-grade, free of any
unknown and potentially fatal additives. Doses were large enough to allow
users to function and not suffer withdrawal, but modest enough to prevent
them from getting high. The program was run like any other medical
facility and the users treated like any other patients. People even had to
purchase health insurance to participate.
The Swiss found that once heroin users didn’t have to worry about how
they’d get their drug, they were often able to take on the larger problems
that had led to their addiction in the first place. Social workers were able to
build trust with users, helping them get jobs and counseling. By reducing
the stigma of heroin, and creating physical places where drug users and
counselors could meet together without the threat of punishment, the Swiss
government was able to reintegrate its users back into society.
In all cases, recovering from substance abuse requires the support of a
community, be it family, friends, therapists, or twelve-step groups.
Addiction experts refer to these kinds of social connections as elements of
“recovery capital.” The heroin maintenance zones that the Swiss
government established were not merely sites for drug injection. They were
social infrastructures, places where addicts, counselors, and medical
providers interacted regularly, under conditions that, though not exactly
salubrious, were as healthy as possible.
Between 1991 and 2004, overdose deaths in Switzerland dropped by
50 percent. While many still overdosed at the supervised injection sites, not
a single person died. Meanwhile, fewer people were choosing to start taking
heroin. The number of new users dropped 80 percent between 1990 and
2002; in turn, HIV rates plummeted. The program also had positive effects
for nonusers. Most notably, the country saw a 90 percent drop in heroin-

---

related property crimes. In a national referendum held in 2008, Swiss
citizens overwhelmingly voted to maintain their public health approach to
opioid addiction. It’s now part of national law.
It’s also an international model of effective, if still controversial, social
infrastructure, and one with a proven record of saving lives. Australia and
the United Kingdom have run successful experiments with safe injection
clinics. In 2014, Vancouver, Canada, an early leader in clean needle
distribution programs, became the first North American city to open a fully
legal heroin and methadone maintenance facility as well. The program
made an immediate impact. Within two years of opening, the rate of fatal
overdoses in the immediate vicinity of the clinic dropped by 35 percent; in
the rest of the city, deaths dropped less than 10 percent. In Vancouver, as
elsewhere, opponents of the legal injection sites predicted that they would
encourage more people to try heroin, yet subsequent studies have shown
that this hasn’t happened. As in Switzerland, cordoning off a safe yet tame
zone for users made the drug less appealing, and there are far fewer new
users there than in comparable places.
US cities have been reluctant to adopt the Swiss model for opioid
maintenance, but some places are inching toward the idea. Boston, which
was one of the first American cities to experience a spike in lethal opioid
overdoses and has been unable to reverse the problem, has allowed a
sparsely populated corridor on the edges of the South End, Roxbury, and
Newmarket neighborhoods to develop into the city’s “Methadone Mile.”
It’s not a legally protected drug safety zone, but the area, which overlooks
Interstate 93 and has little commercial activity, now hosts an open-air drug
market, homeless shelters, addiction clinics, and the Boston Medical
Center, one of New England’s largest safety-net hospitals and trauma
centers. The thick concentration of services has attracted opioid addicts
from all over New England, including some who are looking for treatment
and others who just want a safer place to shoot up.
The city is struggling to keep up with the demand, but recently it
opened what the journalist Susan Zalkind, in an article on the
“infrastructure of the opioid epidemic,” calls a “no questions asked
‘engagement space’ ” that operates like a library, without requiring names
or identification from its patrons. The clinic aims at getting addicts and drug

---

abusers off the streets and into therapeutic programs, as does its neighbor,
the Supportive Place for Observation and Treatment (SPOT), which
monitors drug users to prevent overdoses and protect them, particularly
women, from assault. Both programs achieved early successes. Within a
few months of opening, Zalkind reports, SPOT staff had initiated 3,800
interactions with about five hundred users, 10 percent of whom went on to
seek treatment, and prevented more than one hundred hospital trips. The
addicts Zalkind interviewed told her that they’d made new friendships in
the corridor. “You just know if something happens, you know that you have
certain people that regardless are going to have your back,” one man told
her. There’s a community, and a level of trust that’s unusual among opioid
users on the streets.
Not everyone is enthusiastic about the project, however. There’s little
question that Methadone Mile promotes the health and safety of opioid
addicts, but social infrastructures designed for sick and vulnerable people,
some of whom have criminal records, do not fit neatly into larger residential
or commercial areas. Walk near the corridor, Zalkind writes, and you’ll
notice that “people tend to walk toward the area in a determined march and
away in a foggy stupor. Men with backpacks may whisper ‘brown’ and ‘that
hard’ in your ear as you pass, and you’ll see a large number of people
wearing lanyards with medical IDs hanging around their necks.” It’s easy to
appreciate the benefits of building designated drug use and treatment zones
if you live in another part of the city. Inevitably, though, people who live
and work close to them complain.
Boston officials and leaders of the nonprofits and medical facilities that
are working on Methadone Mile have been trying to do outreach with
residents and small business owners who are worried about problems
spilling over from the drug corridor. They are adding security and
experimenting with designs that separate the therapeutic and medical
facilities from the rest of the city. Fortunately, old industrial cities like
Boston tend to have abandoned or undeveloped land where drug safety
zones will not stretch into anyone’s backyard. If it works, it’s scalable:
across the country, there are hundreds of places where a Methadone Mile
could go. It’s too early to assess the Boston project, but the evidence thus
far suggests that it’s reducing the risk of overdoses and helping people get

---

---

into treatment. It’s sparing the city the cost of managing overdoses in public
hospitals. Most important, it’s saving lives.

As devastating as the opioid crisis is, it’s not the only—or the biggest—
threat to public health in the United States. Indeed, in many poor and
segregated African American neighborhoods, the most urgent problems
stem from the absence of basic goods and services that other Americans
take for granted, including the most fundamental form of market activity:
selling healthy food.
Consider Englewood, the neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago
where so many people died in the heat wave, and where life expectancy is
far below the city average. Abandoned homes, boarded storefronts, and
empty lots with tall grass and weeds the size of trees actively discourage
people from walking around the area, and there are frighteningly high levels
of violent crime on the broken-down, depleted city blocks. “We’ve lost so
many people here that I had to stop counting,” said Cordia Pugh, who has
lived in the neighborhood for nearly five decades. “It was just too much.”
Pugh worries about drugs, gangs, and guns in the neighborhood, and she
still gets rattled by the sounds of conflict in the streets. But for decades, the
most frustrating daily problem she and her neighbors faced was the lack of
fresh meat and produce in the neighborhood’s markets and corner stores.
“I’m a fourth-generation farmer,” Pugh explained. “My father’s father’s
father was a farmer, from Mississippi, and we just kept on doing it. It’s our
heritage. With the Great Migration, which my family did in the 1930s, we
took farming up North. We moved to Chicago when I was six, in 1959,
from the place that’s now Ford Heights. And I’ll tell you, that was as rural
as Mississippi. We had hog farms, cattle farms, all kinds of vegetables. You
wouldn’t have known you were out of the South.” There were plenty of
good food options in Englewood when Pugh’s family first moved there.
“Back then it was still a mixed neighborhood,” Pugh recalled. “We had all
kinds of shops and grocers, and there was a lot going on. I did Girl Scouts

---

and the Boys & Girls Club in the neighborhood. I went to the YMCA after
school. I did the Cadets [a music and marching program]. All right here.
But in the 1970s things started falling apart here. All the white people left.
There were riots after Martin Luther King was killed. The city disinvested,
and all those programs for kids evaporated.” The groceries disappeared too.
By the 1980s, Pugh told me, Englewood had become “the heart of
Chicago’s food desert”—the term that the US Department of Agriculture
uses to describe urban areas where people have limited access to
supermarkets, supercenters, or large grocery stores. The USDA reports that
about 13 percent of low-income census tracts are food deserts, and in these
areas, the absence of healthy food can be just as dangerous as the presence
of gangs and guns. According to the US National Academy of Sciences,
living in a food desert is associated with obesity and a host of chronic, diet-
related diseases. It makes residents, including children, more likely to drink
soda and consume processed foods that are high in salt, sugar, and chemical
preservatives. It’s linked to diabetes and cancer. And, for people like Pugh,
it makes each ordinary meal an occasion for regret about the sorry offerings
on the table instead of joy.
There are not many upsides to living in a place like Englewood, but one
of them, Pugh told me, is that so many lots are empty—there’s at least one
open property on every block, and most have several—that the
neighborhood is ripe for agriculture. “It took some time to see it,” she
explained, “but after a while we realized that Englewood could be farmed
just like Mississippi.” It’s an ideal place not only for developing community
gardens but for urban farming, potentially on a large scale.
She wasn’t the only one to see the possibility. In 1992, Les Brown, who
founded the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, began advocating for an
urban job-training program organized around farming. It was a bold idea,
but a premature one, since the concept of urban farming was not yet
established, and few shared his vision for transforming Chicago’s empty
lots into sites of agricultural production. He persisted, as did one of his
colleagues, Harry Rhodes, and in 1998 their organization, Growing Home,
acquired land for a farm in Marseilles, Illinois, seventy-five miles from
Chicago, which they used to train production assistants. Brown died in
2005, but that year Rhodes worked with an Englewood community

---

organization and persuaded the City of Chicago to let them use a vacant
property for an agricultural site in the neighborhood. The lot turned out to
be located at the crossroads of three distinct gang territories, and it was
polluted with PCBs. But after four years of remediation, which involved
bringing in truckloads of new soil, building good relationships with nearby
residents, and persuading the city to amend a local zoning ordinance,
Growing Home opened the Wood Street Urban Farm in Englewood. It was
Chicago’s first organic urban farm. Two years later, it opened the Honore
Street Farm nearby. “Our goal,” Rhodes told me, “is to turn Englewood
from a food desert to a food destination.”
Rhodes understands that it will be a long, difficult process, and he
vividly recalls how bad things were when the farm project began. “Before
we got to Englewood most people didn’t have access to fresh produce,” he
explained. “They got their food from corner stores, Walgreens, or the gas
stations in the area. People who really wanted fresh food would go to
Whole Foods in the South Loop or the food co-op in Hyde Park, but most
people didn’t have the time or the money to do that. It wasn’t hard to see
why so many people had unhealthy diets. It was just hard to get good food.”
“Englewood was obviously struggling in 2006,” he said. “But a lot of
families were doing okay. They had block clubs. The housing stock was
filling. Things were starting to change.” Then the Great Recession started,
and the wave of foreclosures that swept through Chicago’s African
American neighborhoods hit Englewood especially hard. “It happened so
fast,” Rhodes recounted. “One foreclosure after another. Before we knew it,
every block had at least three or four houses that got boarded up. Even
today, a decade later, there are blocks where half of the houses are empty.
There are more empty lots. And there’s a lot more violence too.”
Today, thanks to a decade of labor by civic organizations like Growing
Home, there are already more than eight hundred identifiable community
gardens and urban farms in Chicago, and they deliver tangible benefits to
the people who are fortunate enough to live near them. According to the
American Public Health Association (APHA), which recently issued a
policy statement and review of the scientific literature on how access to
nature affects health, community gardens do more than provide shade and
reduce the temperature in overheated urban environments. They foster

---

interactions within and across generations, resulting in less social isolation
as well as more cohesion, civic participation, and neighborhood attachment.
They reduce stress levels for people who visit or frequently walk by them.
They help children develop positive feelings about nature and facilitate
scientific learning. And they provide healthy food: more than five hundred
gardens or farms in Chicago produce fruits or vegetables, many in places
where fresh food is hard to find. The city, which has more than twenty
thousand empty lots, most of them concentrated in poor and segregated
areas, could use many more small-scale green spaces. But that won’t
happen without the resources that Chicago’s political and philanthropic
leaders have devoted to other vital infrastructure, including the impressive
green roof on its own City Hall.
The 21,000-square-foot, $2.5 million City Hall roof garden is one of the
grandest and most expensive green roofs in the world. First planted in 2000,
it features about 20,000 plants of more than 150 species, each of which
helps reduce heat and absorb rainwater in storms. Chicago reports that, on
hot days, the roof temperature on City Hall is approximately 30 degrees
lower than on comparable buildings with conventional roofs, and that this
reduces energy costs by thousands of dollars per month. The massive roof is
an impressive piece of green infrastructure, exactly the kind of project that
cities will need to build out at scale as the world confronts climate change.
It’s aesthetically pleasing and ecologically responsible. It’s inspiring not
only to international visitors but also to local developers, dozens of whom
have planted gardens on the roofs of other Chicago buildings. It is not,
however, a work of social infrastructure. It does nothing to help people in
Chicago neighborhoods connect with one another on a regular basis. It
doesn’t give people who are surrounded by asphalt better access to parkland
or clean air. It doesn’t make those who are vulnerable to extreme weather
any safer, nor does it make the places they live healthier. To do all of that
Chicago would have to invest in less glamorous but far more accessible
green spaces: community gardens and urban farms.
Pugh, who had a long career in the private sector before moving into
philanthropy, told me that one motivation for getting so involved in
Englewood’s farm and garden movement is establishing proof that the
concept works. In addition to her own garden, she has developed two urban

---

farms, the Hermitage Community Garden and the Englewood Veterans
Gardens, in partnership with Growing Home. The new green spaces yielded
much more than fresh produce. “The farms and gardens are giving people a
peaceful place to go,” Pugh explained. “Young people. Old people. We even
get people coming from other neighborhoods, because they get so much
pleasure from being outside, working the land with other good people. And
we need that, because you can’t have a community without a community
space.”
The farms and gardens are not just community spaces, Pugh added.
“They’re safe havens. Even the gangbangers respect what we are doing.”
They have parents and grandparents in the neighborhood, after all, and they
appreciate fresh food too. “When there’s a conflict they tell everyone to stay
off our block now. They know we’re doing something good here. And
there’s a good chance that their relatives will be out here too!”
“When we first got to Wood Street there was a turf war among gangs
right there,” Rhodes told me. “And we were building just as everything else
was getting boarded up, so we had some kids vandalize our property,
breaking windows and the like. But we were working closely with
community groups and residents, and after a while people came to see us as
a local resource. They saw that we had something to offer. And since then it
has been pretty peaceful here. The gardens are just beautiful places. We’re
trying to build new ones too, because it’s clear that the neighborhood needs
more.”
Englewood is still far from a food destination, but Growing Home is
helping to end the food desert. Its two farms are producing a steady supply
of fresh produce, and they now run a weekly farmers’ market with cooking
classes. Recently, two other community organizations built farms on empty
lots nearby, and Kusanya, a locally owned nonprofit café, opened there too.
The neighborhood, long stigmatized as a den of urban violence, is slowly
gaining a reputation as a special place for urban agriculture. This change in
its status has already affected local economic development. In
September 2016, a shopping center with a Whole Foods, a Starbucks, and a
Chipotle opened in Englewood, leading journalists to call it a “food desert
no longer.” This was perhaps premature, since not everyone can afford the
fare at these establishments. But Englewood residents waited in long lines

---

---

to shop in the Whole Foods on opening day, lured partly by the high-end
grocer’s pledge to offer reduced prices on staple items, including fresh
produce, and partly by its commitment to hire scores of local residents.
Growing Home has also maintained its original commitment to job
training and economic development. “When we spoke with people in the
community, we learned that helping to break the cycle that led from poverty
to prison and back was incredibly important here,” Rhodes told me. “So we
set up a program for people who’d just left prison, giving them fourteen-
week jobs as production assistants and then helping them get full-time jobs
when they finished.” Once that was set, Growing Home formally added
community development to its mission. “It makes a big difference to have a
place that produces good food and helps to make all these social
connections. We now see a lot of ways that we can help make Englewood a
healthier place.”

It took years, and an enormous amount of hard labor in the long-neglected
urban soil, to persuade public officials that they could use infrastructure
funds to support urban farms and community gardens. “When we first
started the city kind of laughed at us,” Rhodes recalled. “ ‘A farm in
Englewood! Right.’ Now they can see that this is a good idea. We’re about
to get a new site next to the farm on Honore, and for that one the city will
actually do the environmental cleanup, cap it, fence it. That’s a lot more
support than we had a decade ago. It would be nice if the support was more
systematic. But they see the difference we’re making, and maybe we will
get that someday.”
They will if the American Public Health Association has influence in the
emerging space where social infrastructure planning meets urban health.
According to one of the main policy recommendations from the APHA
report on nature: “Community gardens should be considered as a primary
and permanent open space option as part of master planning efforts; gardens

---

should be developed as part of land planning processes rather than as an
afterthought in neighborhood redevelopment projects.”
Policy makers have ignored this recommendation, but should know
better. After all, modern infrastructure—for reliable power, clean water, fast
transit, affordable food, and resilient structures—has done more to improve
public health than any other modern intervention, including scientific
medicine. “The early 20th century saw great changes in health and safety
brought about through collaborations that today would be viewed as odd or
unusual—[between] physicians and city planners, sanitarians and civil
engineers,” write Charles Branas and John Mac Donald, who expanded their
research on mediating urban blight to see if it does more for public health
than reduce violent crime. “Episodically treating small numbers of people,
while ignoring the obviously unhealthy social and environmental
surroundings within which people live, has stunted our treatments and
moved the health of the nation forward at too slow a pace.” Today, as the
world grows more urban and unequal, there’s an urgent need to build
healthier places, and social infrastructure is the key.
Fascinating research by Branas’s team in Philadelphia shows not only
that small green spaces in poor urban neighborhoods improve public health
but also how they do. In a study led by Eugenia South, a professor of
emergency medicine at Penn, the team found twelve people (eight men,
four women, all African American, mostly older, and the majority with
annual incomes under $15,000) who were willing to walk through an area
within two blocks of their home with Garmin monitors measuring their
heart rates continuously. They did two walks, separated by several months.
On the first, the participants walked by untreated empty lots, the kind of
urban blight that, as Branas’s earlier research showed, tends to attract crime.
On the second walk, they walked by empty lots that had been converted
into small, accessible gardens with trees and other vegetation. Heart rate,
the authors note, is a clear and dynamic marker of stress response; tracking
its variations as the study subjects walked by the treated and untreated lots
would show whether being within view of well-maintained green places
affects a crucial element of human health.
The results were unmistakable: When residents walked by the untreated
vacant lot, acute stress caused their average heart rates to increase by 9.5

---

---

beats per minute—this despite the fact that the sites had long been in the
area and were familiar to the study participants. A spike of 9.5 heartbeats
per minute may not sound too dangerous, but to Branas’s team it was a
worrisome number. It suggests that living near blighted urban spaces
generates recurrent surges in stress and, with them, “inflammatory changes
and dysregulation of cardiovascular, neurological, and endocrine systems
over a lifetime for persons repeatedly exposed.” Walking, which in most
cases is precisely what people need to do to improve their health and
fitness, can become instead a source of anxiety.
The effects were reversed when the subjects walked by lots that had
been transformed into green spaces. “Our results indicate that in-view
proximity to a greened vacant lot decreases heart rate, compared with in-
view proximity to a nongreened vacant lot,” South and her colleagues
conclude. “The reduction in heart rate suggests a biological link between
vacant lot greening and reduction in acute stress.” More pragmatically, it
indicates that “improvements to…physical conditions”—even inexpensive
changes, like turning vacant lots into pocket parks—“may lead to
widespread downstream health benefits.” Like the APHA, they urge
governments to consider structural improvements to neighborhoods as
“first-line solutions to difficult urban problems.” In Philadelphia, and
around the world as well, the evidence that vibrant green places promote
health by reducing stress, especially among the most vulnerable, is hard to
ignore.

I’ve been concerned about the fate of one rapidly expanding group of
vulnerable people, the elderly, since I began studying the Chicago heat
wave. There are nearly six hundred million people aged sixty-five and
above around the world today, and the United Nations estimates that
“almost half of women living independently [i.e., not with family or in an
institution] live alone.” These numbers are expected to rise dramatically in
coming decades, as the population ages. According to a joint report by the

---

World Health Organization and the US federal government, the total
number of people aged sixty-five and over will reach 1.5 billion, or about
16 percent of the global population, by 2050.
In another research project, which became the book Going Solo, I
argued that the rise of people living alone is one of the most significant but
least examined demographic changes in modern history. Although the rise
of living alone results from many positive changes (including the increase
in longevity and the rising status of women), it has generated one extremely
worrisome social problem: a spike in the number of old people at risk of
becoming sedentary and isolated, particularly if their mental or physical
health diminishes. Public policies that provide professional caregivers can
help address this problem. But there is another, far more beneficial and
considerably less expensive way to help the elderly maintain their health
and vitality: invest in social infrastructure, and build places that promote
active lifestyles and frequent interaction in the public realm.
In the United States, branch libraries, particularly those that offer
programs like video bowling leagues, book clubs, and karaoke sessions,
play a significant role in helping old people remain active. Designated
senior centers also draw people out of their private homes and into the
social world, albeit a somewhat stigmatized one where they only encounter
people in their age group. Thanks to Social Security and Medicare, the
American elderly receive basic support for managing the financial
challenges of old age, yet the United States does little to promote physical
and social activity among the elderly. Parks, for instance, may occasionally
host programming for older people, but they are rarely designed to meet the
needs of an aging population; the same is true of most libraries and public
housing facilities. Other countries, however, have made larger and more
thoughtful investments in social infrastructure that help the elderly flourish.
These projects get little public attention, but as promoting good health in
the world’s aging population becomes a major social challenge, it’s
important to understand how they work.
I’ve spent years seeking out places that help old people maintain their
physical health and social vitality, and one of the most remarkable examples
is Singapore, where the life expectancy, 83.1, ranks third in the world.
(Japan is first, at 83.7, and Switzerland is second, at 83.4. The United

---

Kingdom ranks twentieth, at 81.2, and the United States is thirty-first, at
79.3.) About 80 percent of Singapore’s citizens, and an even greater
proportion of old people, live in publicly developed housing projects with
privately owned flats, sold to residents with generous state subsidies. Most
of these complexes offer residents easy access to vibrant common areas,
including parks with exercise areas, generous meeting spaces, and
affordable dining options at the outdoor “hawker centers” (or food courts)
that typically occupy the ground level. “These places are busy all the time,”
says Wei Da Lim, my host during a research visit with Singapore’s Centre
for Liveable Cities, as we slurp laksa in a crowded hawker center on the
ground floor of the Toa Payoh development. “Of course there are a lot of
old people, because there are a lot of old people in Singapore”—today
about one of eight people is over age sixty-five; by 2030, it will be one of
five. “A lot of them live alone, and this is a place where they can always
come and find people they know.”
Toa Payoh is a typical Singapore housing estate: a series of high-rise
towers, connected by stone walking paths and sidewalks, with small
gardens scattered around the area and an expansive, open-air shopping
center at the base. I visited five other housing complexes in different
neighborhoods during my time in Singapore, and while their designs varied,
each supported an extraordinary level of social programming, offered
verdant green space for outdoor relaxation, and hosted commercial activity,
from shopping to dining, that attracted people across generational lines. The
common areas were heavily used, but the grounds were always clean and
well maintained. People worried about crime, and a few complexes featured
large signs where officials could report recent offenses. But the crime rates
are low by almost any standard—at Toa Payoh, the “Crime Alert” sign was
blank—and most criminal acts are petty. Old people looked to be at home in
the public areas, whether they were walking, shopping, or, in a sight I saw
often during long and humid afternoons, sleeping on a shaded bench.
The Singapore government engages in strict social planning, and it
allocates units to achieve a mix of ethnicity and income level in each
complex. But it is only beginning to grapple with the problem of what to do
with such a rapidly aging population. I met with several city officials during
my visit: the Centre for Liveable Cities is a research arm of the state, with

---

tight connections to policy makers. Some worry that residents who age in
place will grow isolated and estranged from their children and
grandchildren, because the tight housing market makes it difficult for
multiple generations to live in the same neighborhood. Others are
concerned that large units designed for large families will be occupied by
old couples and singles who won’t use the space, further intensifying the
housing crunch in one of the smallest and most densely populated places on
earth. There are limits to the government’s social planning, and it respects
the rights of home owners to remain in their flats. But the housing agency is
considering new developments that would help reintegrate elderly people
with their children, whether in larger, multigenerational units or in new
complexes that offer a mix of housing types for younger families and older
singletons.
These ideas are not unique to Singapore. In Sweden, where a greater
proportion of people live alone than in any other nation, I observed mixed-
generation residential communities designed to bring people from different
families together in active, socially supportive environments. At
Färdknäppen, a cohousing project for people aged forty and above,
everyone keeps their own private apartment but there are all variety of
common spaces and programs, including a large kitchen and a nightly
dinner that residents can cook and eat together whenever they choose. In the
United States, some developers—and far more individual families acting
alone to solve what feels like a private problem of caring for an elder—are
experimenting with multigenerational housing types that allow younger and
older members of a family to live in separate units on a common property.
These projects, which come primarily from the private and philanthropic
sectors, are hardly common. But they signal an emerging recognition that
more and more people are looking for better places to live as they age.
Visiting Singapore was striking because government officials there are
worrying about problems for the elderly that, thanks to the design and social
order of their estate housing, they’re already solving better than most other
places. Singapore is an unusually affluent and educated society, with an
authoritarian government and norms of social intervention that no
democratic nation shares. Yet the current model of urban planning that
Singapore uses to improve the health and welfare of its older citizens works

---

by promoting the same things governments around the world are beginning
to advocate: busy food corridors, commercial strips with local vendors,
neighborhood parks, and vibrant public spaces. In most societies, creating
healthier places for old people doesn’t involve changing core values or
systems of government. But it does require confronting two major social
developments that few nations have been willing to confront honestly: there
have never been so many old people, and there has never been such a dire
shortage of housing that meets our current needs. Designs for the world’s
rapidly aging, increasingly urban societies will, inevitably, involve the
kinds of large-scale housing and commercial complexes that Singapore is
already developing. In the meantime, however, there are a number of small-
scale improvements to the places where we live that can help keep old
people healthy.
In Placemaking for an Aging Population, the urban planning scholar
Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, along with a team of policy researchers at
UCLA, highlights innovative social infrastructures designed for older
people around the world. The most common projects are for parks and
green spaces, which can easily be rebuilt to encourage more active use by
older residents and more interaction across generations. In China, for
instance, the elderly have long used public parks for collective exercise,
including fast walking, dance, and Tai Chi. But in the late 1990s and 2000s,
as China prepared to host the 2008 Olympic Games, the government began
urging its rising older population to be even more active. It built thousands
of new parks in urban areas, and many feature low-impact exercise
equipment designed for the elderly.
Loukaitou-Sideris and her colleagues report that Spain has built more
specialized recreational areas for old people—they call them “geriatric
parks”—than any other European nation. The province of Málaga has
thirty-two geriatric parks, mostly set within larger green areas. They
typically include balance beams, pedals, stairs, ramps, and turntables, as
well as space for group activities, and they’re complemented by
multigenerational exercise equipment in the adjacent areas. In 2009,
London installed a similarly equipped “playground for seniors” in Hyde
Park, and although middle-aged adults are welcome to share the area,
children under fifteen are prohibited. Residents in Blackley, in Manchester,

---

---

built their own senior park around the same time, but they opted for
proximity to younger users, whose playground is on the nearest lot.
The most ambitious attempt to promote cross-generation interaction
through outdoor play comes from Finland, where the playground
manufacturing company Lappset has been working with local governments
to create “three-generational play spaces.” Lappset’s parks feature
equipment such as crawlers, climbing frames, and swings that are designed
to be accessible regardless of age. They require some risk taking and
cultural adaptation, since middle-aged and old people can feel awkward and
uncomfortable on recreational facilities long associated with early
childhood. According to market research, the French are least inclined to
jump in and use the playgrounds, while the Germans and Scandinavians
show the most enthusiasm for multigenerational play. No matter their
nationality, once older people start using them, the benefits come quickly: A
study by researchers at Rovaniemi Polytechnic, for example, found that
three months of exercising on the playground equipment improved the
balance, speed, and coordination of a group of forty senior citizens between
the ages of sixty-five and eighty-one, reducing their vulnerability to falls.
One sixty-three-year-old told the BBC that when she started using the
playground’s balancing equipment she felt like “an elephant walking on a
narrow beam,” but that after three months she’d cut her time from more
than a minute to seventeen seconds. The real payoff, however, came outside
the playground, on the streets and sidewalks where she could walk with the
power and confidence she’d had when she was young.

Old people, of course, are not the only ones who need easy access to parks
and other recreational facilities for their well-being; we all do. Children’s
need for open-air play spaces is particularly important: their physical health
and social development depend on them. But in recent decades, as research
by the renowned environmental psychologist Roger Hart and the scholars
he has assembled at the City University of New York [CUNY] Children’s

---

Environments Research Group establishes, children throughout the
developed world have been steadily losing their outdoor play spaces. Even
playgrounds, Hart argues, have become excessively constraining for
developing bodies and minds. The CUNY team identifies several reasons
for the decline in accessible spaces for outdoor activities: public divestment
from parks and recreational facilities; rising concerns about violence; new
regimes of continuous adult supervision; parental pressure for academic
achievement; the emergence of professionally managed after-school
programs; and, cutting across all classes and regions, the popularity of
small-screen culture, with video games, apps, and social media as the
dominant sources of youth entertainment. The effects of this loss include
higher levels of child obesity and stress, and, Hart argues, diminished skills
for participating in civic life.
This concern about the loss of civic skills may be surprising, since we
rarely think of spending time on swings and slides or playing in sandboxes
as preparation for democracy. But when Hart and his team go to the
playground, they focus on behavior that most parents treat as secondary:
How does a child decide when it’s time to give up a swing so that another
can have a turn? What happens when the wait feels too long? When do kids
include strangers in their games and projects, and when do they set
boundaries? How do they manage disagreement and conflict? Context
matters. Hart and his colleagues are not only interested in what happens in
the schoolyard or neighborhood playground where children make regular
visits. They believe that social dynamics among children change when they
explore new places and encounter different people and groups. Kids are
especially likely to develop interpersonal skills that will help them in civic
life when they wander into “foreign” places and have to navigate the new
social situation on their own. But that’s the kind of thing that happens less
often now that parents monitor their children so closely, and they get little
opportunity to roam.
One recent paper, by Hart’s colleague Pamela Wridt, draws on oral
histories, childhood autobiographies, and archival research to show how
access to public space varied among three generations of New Yorkers:
those born in the 1930s and 1940s, the 1970s, and the 2000s. For those born
in the 1930s and 1940s, the neighborhood sidewalk was the main play area.

---

Victoria, an Italian American who grew up in the East Harlem/Yorkville
neighborhood in the 1940s, recounts that on her street “the whole block was
full of kids. Almost all the activity was done outdoors…. You went outside
and on the sidewalk you drew [with chalk] a potsie, those little squares
where you used to play jacks, [and] bottle tops.” Mothers allowed their
children to play late into the evening, Wridt explains, “as they knew
neighbors were keeping a watchful eye on their sons and daughters. Parents
could also keep an eye on their children with great ease by peering out their
tenement windows.” There were risks involved in outdoor play, from
benign conflicts with other kids or adults to, more seriously, getting
involved in a gang or being hit by a car, and reform organizations lobbied
for the city to develop contained play spaces, like playgrounds, to better
protect kids. But bad things rarely happened to kids like Victoria. The
sidewalks were their safe haven, the place where they grew up.
Most New Yorkers born in the 1970s had a different experience. By
then, Wridt shows, rising crime made parents reluctant to let their children
roam freely on the streets and sidewalks, and supervised areas, including
playgrounds and athletic fields, had become more popular. But when the
fiscal crisis hit, the city cut funds to parks and playgrounds. Professional
supervisors disappeared. Conditions deteriorated. Gangs and drug dealers
took charge of public spaces. Reggie, an African American who grew up in
East Harlem/Yorkville around that time, tells Wridt that racial conflict was
common, and black and Latino children often found themselves targeted in
places that lacked an adult presence. As a teenager, he still wandered the
area with friends, going to outdoor concerts (“open jams”) in parks and
playgrounds and building friendships through music and dance. But for
younger children, these areas were gradually becoming off-limits,
particularly after dark. A rising number of parents and caretakers were
retreating from outdoor public spaces and forcing their children to hunker
down indoors instead.
By the 2000s, children’s access to outdoor public spaces was even more
restricted. Noel, a thirteen-year-old Italian American who is growing up in
the Isaacs Houses, the same complex where Reggie lived, tells Wridt that as
a young child her parents let her play in the playground within the Isaacs,
but forbid her from going to other local parks. “Noel’s parents are

---

extremely protective of her,” Wridt writes, “and invest an enormous amount
of energy monitoring her everyday life.” Occasionally they let her join
friends for movies or window-shopping on Eighty-Sixth Street, a more
affluent commercial corridor near her neighborhood. And occasionally she
goes to a professionally managed after-school or summer program in one of
the commercial organizations that have become so common in middle-class
and affluent communities today. But Noel says that her mobility is
restricted, and as a result she spends most of her free time going where most
people her age go. “I’m always on the Internet,” she reports, “instant
messaging…not as much email, but instant messaging. The television is
always on, and the computer is always on too. I text message on my cell
phone.” It’s social behavior, to be sure, but it seldom involves physical
activity or spending time in green spaces outdoors. It may well protect Noel
from violence, but it exposes her to risks of other health hazards, from
obesity to stress to attention deficit disorders, that were far less prevalent in
previous generations.
Noel’s parents are choosing to keep her out of their neighborhood’s
degraded public play spaces, but by some measures they and their fellow
New Yorkers are better off than other American families, because at least
they have a local option. In the United States, the United Kingdom, and
most other industrial countries, access to nature and outdoor play areas
varies by social class, sometimes dramatically. In Los Angeles, for instance,
where good weather should entice children outdoors in all seasons, nearly
half of all low-income households lack immediate access to a park or
playground. And, as Billi Gordon, a UCLA neuroscientist who studies the
relationship between obesity and stress reports, many who do live near an
outdoor play space are so close to a freeway that they stay indoors to avoid
the dirty air.
Los Angeles didn’t have to be this way. In 1930, with a commission
from the chamber of commerce, the landscape architect Frederick Law
Olmsted Jr. published Parks, Playgrounds and Beaches for the Los Angeles
Region, an elaborate proposal to build a network of parks, playgrounds,
beaches, and forests for Los Angeles County. According to the City Project,
a civic organization that advocates for equity in access to green space, the
Olmsted Report “recognized that low-income people often live in less

---

desirable areas, have fewer leisure opportunities, and should receive first
consideration in parks and recreation.” Its recommendations included
“doubling public beach access,” “greening the Los Angeles and San Gabriel
Rivers,” and “integrating forests and mountains within the regional park
system.” Although the plan was well received, Los Angeles power brokers
killed each of Olmsted’s key proposals. Worse, in subsequent decades the
city’s growth machine used racially restrictive covenants and constricting
zoning laws to make Los Angeles even more divided and unequal than it
was when Olmsted tried to fix things. Today, the city has some of the most
lavish private estates, beaches, and country clubs in the United States, and
residents of Los Angeles’s affluent neighborhoods live amid some of the
world’s most beautiful natural sites. But in the impoverished
neighborhoods, parks are in short supply.
They’re also financially strapped. Los Angeles’s refusal to invest in
healthy, accessible green spaces did not end in the 1930s. Today, after
decades of massive urbanization, Los Angeles County estimates that the
parks it does support face roughly $12 billion in deferred maintenance
costs, while the system needs some $21.5 billion for improvements. Los
Angeles, like many American cities, is politically fragmented, and dozens
of small municipalities have raised their own funds for parks, playgrounds,
swimming pools, and senior centers because the public resources are
insufficient. But that merely compounds the city’s environmental injustices.
After the Los Angeles city controller conducted a series of audits, it
formally declared what everyone already knows: “that more high quality
recreation programs are available in wealthy communities than in low-
income communities, and the policies and formulas for distributing public
funding exacerbate rather than alleviate inequities.” Local leaders have
been aware of this problem for decades; yet, as the City Project concludes,
“the City has failed and refused to implement the Controller’s
recommendations to improve parks in every neighborhood.”
Recently, however, Los Angeles voters expressed their overwhelming
frustration with the city’s disinvestment from parks, beaches, and open
spaces. In November 2016, they passed Measure A, a 1.5-cents-per-square-
foot parcel tax to help build and maintain city parks, with nearly 75 percent
of voter support. It’s a modest measure, to be sure, with projected returns of

---

---

less than $100 million per year. But it has no expiration date, so it promises
to deliver a steady supply of new resources to the city’s parks and public
spaces. For now, though, whether the funds go to the people and places that
need them most remains an open question, and the history of Los Angeles
suggests that directing public investments in outdoor amenities to poor
minority areas will always require a fight.

The research on environmental inequalities leaves little doubt that race and
class shape who has access to nature. But poor people are not the only ones
who suffer when they live far from green social infrastructure; middle-class
and affluent people also need time in verdant settings, and those who cannot
get it pay a high price. That, at least, is the conclusion of a fascinating paper
by a team of British researchers headed by the geographer Jamie Pearce.
Pearce and his colleagues wanted to know which environmental
characteristics help drive health disparities in the United Kingdom. They
developed a “Multiple Environmental Deprivation Index,” which
incorporates a wide set of ecological “disamenities,” and measured census
wards across the United Kingdom.
At the national level, the new index confirmed what Pearce’s team
expected: on average, impoverished neighborhoods had far fewer ecological
amenities than wealthier ones. The effects are readily apparent. Mortality
records at the census ward level show that environmental deprivation has a
significant effect on health, even after controlling for a ward’s age, sex, and
socioeconomic status. The relationship is straightforward too: the more
physical environmental deprivation, the worse the community’s health. This
finding was important to Pearce and his collaborators, because until
recently some scholars, including Richard Mitchell, an epidemiologist who
was part of Pearce’s team, had wondered about “confounds,” such as social
class, that might better explain why environmentally deprived people fare
worse than those in greener surroundings. Here, using reliable and

---

comprehensive national data, the British researchers showed that
environmental deprivation matters, period.
The real surprise from Pearce’s study, though, concerns the effects of
environmental deprivation on the health and longevity of people in more
affluent districts. In previous studies, mainly conducted in the United
States, epidemiologists had found that the impact of environmental
deprivation on health was “disproportionately detrimental” in low-income
neighborhoods. But in the United Kingdom, Pearce discovered, “the effect
of multiple environmental deprivation was greatest among the least income-
deprived populations.” In London, for instance, affluent people who live in
densely populated neighborhoods, such as Islington and Clerkenwell, that
are coated with asphalt and far from open green spaces face greater health
risks than their peers who live in places like Knightsbridge or Bayswater
and enjoy easy access to all of Hyde Park. In the United Kingdom, at least,
even wealth cannot protect people from the dangers of a poor environment.
To stay healthy, everyone needs some green.

## CHAPTER FIVE

## Common Ground

In 1890, my great-grandfather, Edward Klinenberg, moved from a small
village outside Prague to Chicago, and within a few years he settled down
on the city’s South Side. The University of Chicago was founded nearby
that same year, but Edward didn’t come to the United States to study—that
would be a luxury for future generations. Chicago already had a string of
small Jewish neighborhoods, with tightly knit communities organized
around a synagogue, a school, a kosher market, and all the other
establishments Jews had relied on in the European ghettos. Edward wanted
none of that. He was intent on escaping military service to the Austro-
Hungarian Empire and experiencing the kinds of opportunity America
promised. His first challenge was to make ends meet, which he did by

---

selling small batches of coal on street corners. Soon, Edward found work
steering cattle from agricultural towns south of the city into the sprawling
Chicago stockyards, making him one of the few Jewish cowboys in the
great Midwest. As he rode through the borderlands of Illinois and Indiana,
Edward couldn’t help feeling awe at the massive industrial facilities for
steel and manufacturing that were quickly transforming the landscape. Nor
could he help noticing the streams of migrants—Germans, Irish, Scots,
Serbians, Croatians, Poles, and Italians—who were flocking to the area to
work in the mills or start their own small businesses. South Chicago, as the
area would become known, was exactly the place he’d been hoping to find.
Edward spent most of his life on the far South Side of Chicago, raising
eleven children in an ethnically diverse neighborhood that was
unmistakably American. Although he refused to confine himself to a
religious community, Edward’s “primary group,” the term that the
pioneering University of Chicago sociologist Charles Cooley introduced to
describe the core network of close friends and family with whom one
maintains the deepest and most enduring bonds, consisted mainly of people
with his background, Bohemians and Jews. Such “homophily” was, and still
is, quite typical. Aristotle famously wrote that “people love those who are
like themselves,” and Plato believed that “similarity begets friendship.”
(Although elsewhere both also claimed that opposites attract!) Even in
diverse societies, most people seek out confidants who are, in some
important way or another, like them. Once they find each other, “birds of a
feather” grow closer by engaging in recurrent, shared activities: eating,
drinking, praying, playing, learning, and the like.
Had he stayed in his home village in Europe, Edward would likely have
spent most of his life with members of his primary group. In Chicago,
however, he developed a large “secondary group” of casual friends,
colleagues, and associates, with whom he spent a considerable amount of
time. Many of Edward’s relationships developed through business. Industry
dominated the area, and industrial life—rooted on the shop floor and the
marketplace but extending out into the neighborhood’s clubs, taverns,
restaurants, and political organizations—set the terms for most local social
interaction. Ethnic groups clustered together in certain churches and on
particular residential blocks. People tended to marry their own kind. But

---

South Chicago was not yet racially segregated, and in addition to bonding
with members of their own ethnic communities, the area’s residents built
bridges that transcended group lines. Factory workers of different
ethnicities helped one another out during long, grueling days in steel mills.
They joined unions, picked leaders, and learned to bargain as a collective.
They drank together, competed with one another in sports leagues, and took
their wives dancing in neighborhood music halls. They got to know each
other’s families, and helped each other’s sons get hired when they reached
the right age. They got involved in local political clubs. Often, if not
always, they fought on the same side.
In the 1960s, the sociologist William Kornblum moved into South
Chicago’s “blue collar community,” taking a factory job so that he could
understand how the neighborhood’s social dynamics worked. By then, dark-
skinned, non-European migrant groups—Mexicans and African Americans
—had established themselves in the area, and they’d been subjected to the
kinds of prejudice and discrimination for which Chicago had grown
infamous. The white ethnic industrial workers were willing to accommodate
Mexican Americans when they first came to South Chicago, but for blacks
it was a different story. There were race riots when African Americans
crossed the neighborhood’s unofficial color lines. Whites strictly enforced
the boundaries of racial segregation, and blacks had no choice but to build
residential communities of their own. Kornblum came to South Chicago
expecting to find that these divisions would extend into the factory and its
social environment. Instead, he discovered that members of different groups
shared a surprising level of trust and intimacy. “Men from interracial work
groups routinely share wakes, funerals, retirement parties, weddings, and a
host of family activities over the course of their lives in the mill,”
Kornblum observes. “And out of this interaction between peers of different
races comes the possibility that black men may be treated not only as peers
but as leaders in competition among peers.”
Taverns, athletic fields, and political clubs were especially important
sites of social bonding. Some tended to attract mainly people from one
ethnic group, but many others were places where white ethnics, Mexicans,
and African Americans came together regularly to converse, commune, and
compete. Sometimes talk turned to things that happened on the factory

---

floor. But more often coworkers and neighbors used their social time to take
up other topics: family, sports, travel, politics, and all sorts of personal
matters. Union newsletters and local newspapers helped the residents of
South Chicago imagine their community; the neighborhood social
infrastructure allowed them to build it.
Segregated neighborhoods and workplaces are breeding grounds for
stereotypes and suspicion. But in the factories of industrial South Chicago,
laborers developed intimate, face-to-face, sometimes heated but often jovial
relationships with one another. “The white ethnic steelworker routinely
works next to black men from the South Side ghetto; the Mexican worker
from Millgate shares a locker room with Serbian steelworkers from Slag
Valley,” Kornblum writes. After work, “South Chicago families could
attempt to segregate themselves within ethnic cultural worlds, or they might
associate with diverse groups of neighborhood friends, but in every case
ethnic segregation was limited by the more universalistic experiences of life
on rolling mills, blast furnaces, coke ovens, ore docks, and the switchyards
of the steel industry.” Of course group divisions did not disappear
altogether. Churches, social clubs, and, especially, intimate relationships
were largely insular affairs. Ethnic tensions were always just beneath the
surface, and occasionally they erupted into violent clashes. But in that
social environment, prejudices didn’t hold up well.
Unfortunately, the industrial communities that developed in places like
Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and Kansas
City didn’t hold up well, either. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the
social world that the steel mills had created was already breaking down.
Massive deindustrialization hit American and European cities and continued
through the last decades of the twentieth century. As factories shuttered, so
too did the union halls, taverns, restaurants, and civic organizations that
glued different groups together. Unmoored, unemployed, and unable to find
new opportunities, people moved away. Between 1970 and 1990, nearly six
hundred thousand people left Chicago, and most of them came from
industrial areas like the one my great-grandfather settled in a century ago.
Sociologists have thoroughly documented how deindustrialization
devastated neighborhoods, making cities and suburbs throughout the United
States even more segregated by race and class. But we are only now coming

---

to terms with how much damage deindustrialization and the decline of blue-
collar communities did to the body politic, how fractured and distrustful we
have become.
The presidential campaign and election of 2016 was hardly the first sign
of America’s social and political polarization, and deindustrialization is by
no means its only cause. Until recently, though, leading public opinion
scholars showed that pundits and policy elites were more polarized than
voters. America, claimed the Stanford political scientist Morris Fiorina in
2005, was “closely divided,” not “deeply divided.” Citizens identified
strongly with or against one of the two major parties, but—with exceptions
for issues such as abortion, sexual morality, and capital punishment—they
generally did not have firm or extreme views on most major policy matters.
That’s changed in the last decades, however, as social inequality and
class segregation have deepened, national news programs that transcended
ideological lines have lost viewers, and the Internet has generated the rise of
“filter bubbles,” where everyone can find facts and opinions that confirm
their beliefs. All of this feeds the kind of in-group connection that social
scientists call “bonding social capital,” but starves us of the “bridging social
capital” we need to live together.
Since 2008, Americans have become deeply divided on a wide variety
of issues, and on some, such as climate change, criminal justice, and
immigration, leading political officials and popular media personalities
champion “alternative facts” over mainstream scientific findings. Moreover,
as the sociologist Mike Hout has found, today almost every attitude or
identification has a political edge, and believing in one seemingly
innocuous thing and not another puts people squarely among the reds or
blues. In 2015, research by the political scientists Shanto Iyengar and Sean
Westwood showed that “the polarization of the American electorate has
dramatically increased,” such that today “partisans discriminate against
opposing partisans, doing so to a degree that exceeds discrimination based
on race.” The intensity of partisan disdain was visible during the 2016
election, when 55 percent of Democrats said that the Republican Party
made them “afraid” and 49 percent of Republicans said the same about the
Democratic Party, while more than 40 percent from both parties said their
opponents’ policy ideas “threaten the nation’s well-being.” Polarization is

---

even more evident in collective gatherings. During the 2017 California
Democratic Party Convention, for instance, the chairman stuck out his
middle finger and got the crowd to chant “Fuck Donald Trump!” At the
2016 Republican National Convention, an entire arena chanted “Lock Her
Up!”
Americans have always disagreed about politics and policy, but today
our beliefs have hardened, as have our negative views of the people with
whom we disagree. Sixty years ago, the nation was divided. But back then
roughly one-quarter of employed Americans worked in factories, one-third
of nonagricultural workers belonged to unions, and there were
neighborhoods like South Chicago throughout the United States. Voluntary
organizations were more diverse, write the sociologists Peter Bearman and
Delia Baldassarri, “with respect to social class, race, ethnicity and religious
orientation.” So too were partners in marriage. While today, people in the
United States and Europe are more likely to marry someone from a different
ethnic background, they are also far more likely to marry someone from the
same social class. The United States was segregated and unequal, but the
social infrastructure supported shared experiences and forms of group
mixing that are uncommon today.
“We are living in different political universes,” writes the Harvard
political scientist and legal scholar Cass Sunstein. “Of course mixed groups
are no panacea…. But mixed groups have been shown to have two desirable
effects. First, exposure to competing positions generally increases political
tolerance…. Second, mixing increases the likelihood that people will be
aware of competing rationales and see that their own arguments might be
met with plausible counterarguments.” Sunstein draws on classic studies
and experimental research to show that, as in South Chicago during its
industrial heyday, in-group attachments and prejudices against others
diminish when people interact across the usual social boundaries.
Democratic politics, Sunstein argues, works better when we are regularly
exposed to different people and competing positions. Civil society does too.
Sunstein’s book #Republic focuses on the Internet and social media,
whose “architecture,” he warns, insulates us in echo chambers and shores
up group identity. I’m also concerned about the digital divide, but it’s only
one part of the problem. The architecture of division extends beyond our

---

---

screens and onto the sidewalks, streets, and shared spaces where we make
and unmake our communities every day. It’s encroaching into the entire
social infrastructure, polarizing us at a moment when we need to build
common ground.
But if, in some places, the driving spirit behind new infrastructure
projects is best captured by the refrain “Build a Wall,” in others it remains
“Only Connect!” The integrated blue-collar community may no longer be a
viable model for large-scale development, but there are other exemplary
forms of social infrastructure—some small scale, some large, some old,
some relatively new—that suggest better ways to work and live together.
It’s urgent that we understand them.

Iceland is a small, homogeneous nation, without the fierce racial, religious,
and regional divisions that make civic life so challenging in places like the
United States and the United Kingdom. But it’s not without its share of
social problems and divisions, many of which deepened after the country’s
economic crisis in 2008. For much of the year Iceland is cold and dark, yet
in recent decades the place that has best sustained warmth, intimacy, and
spirited interaction across generational and class lines is the sundlaug, or
public pool. The sundlaug, which often includes large swimming areas,
“hot pots” for adults, and shallow children’s pools, is a relatively recent
invention: one guidebook reports that in 1900 less than 1 percent of
Icelanders knew how to swim. But today, thanks to public investment in a
geothermal heating system that runs throughout the country and social
infrastructure projects that help residents commingle despite the frigid
weather, there are more than 120 public pools in the nation of some 330,000
people, one for every 2,750 residents. Most Icelanders live near a pool, and
they use them day and night, throughout the year, as a social space for
gatherings of friends and family and as a forum for casual banter or more
political debate among strangers. Access is basically universal, since most
hot pots are free and the select swimming complexes that charge ask for

---

only a modest entrance fee. “People from all walks of life go to the pool,”
says the folklorist Valdimar Hafstein. “So you have, mixing in the same hot
tub, people living in the area, whether it’s the professor or the student,
construction worker or the businessman, the billionaire or car salesman—
they all meet up.”
The diversity of users, and the rule that everyone must strip naked and
wash off in a public area before entering the tubs, make the pools an
equalizing force in Icelandic society. So too does the substance of the
conversations. When Dan Kois traveled to Iceland to do a story on its civic
culture, he met immigrants in small towns who told him that the pools were
ideal places to get to know neighbors and learn local customs, and new
parents who recounted going to the hot tubs for tips and advice. Young
women told him that seeing a variety of other female bodies at the pool
helped them feel more comfortable and secure in their own skin. In
Reykjavik, he learned, local council members routinely go to the pools to
speak informally with their constituents, even if it means getting an earful
of complaints. “The pools are more than a humble municipal investment,
more than just a civic perquisite that emerged from an accident of Iceland’s
volcanic geology,” writes Kois, who left the country convinced “that
Icelanders’ remarkable satisfaction is tied inextricably to the experience of
escaping the fierce, freezing air and sinking into warm water among their
countrymen.”
Unfortunately, swimming pools and other social infrastructures with
potential to facilitate sustained, intimate interaction across group lines can
easily be used to segregate instead. Attractive places, after all, are only one
element of good social infrastructure; programming, which can be inclusive
or exclusive, welcoming or forbidding, is also important. The modern
American history of municipal swimming pools, which is elegantly told in
the historian Jeff Wiltse’s Contested Waters, provides an object lesson in
how to turn a community resource into an instrument of division.
Swimming pools, Wiltse argues, have been key sites of cohesion and
conflict “because they are places at which people build community and
define the social boundaries of community life…. Swimming with others in
a pool means accepting them as part of the same community precisely
because the interaction is so intimate and sociable. Conversely, excluding

---

someone or some group from a pool effectively defines them as social
others.”
In the late nineteenth century, northern cities like Boston and
Philadelphia built austere pools, mainly in slums for immigrants and the
poor. They were open to all working-class men and women, albeit on
alternate days. “The facilities lacked showers,” Wiltse writes, “because the
pools themselves were the instruments of cleaning.” But that didn’t reduce
their popular appeal, nor did their policy of ethnic and racial integration. By
the end of the nineteenth century, Philadelphia’s nine municipal pools
attracted about 1,500 swimmers daily, and blacks and whites swam together
in relative peace.
American municipalities built thousands of public pools during the
1920s and 1930s. They transformed from small bathing pools into massive
spaces for communal leisure, often surrounded by lawns, decks, restaurants,
and playing tables where the middle classes could spend an entire day.
Millions of people flocked to these new hubs for social activity, and as
social and sexual mores relaxed, they opened up across gender lines so that
men and women could mix. With gender integration, Wiltse shows, came
rising anxieties about intergroup contact, particularly between blacks and
whites. Pools, after all, are places where large numbers of scantily dressed
people come into close physical contact. Whites expressed concerns about
contamination, sexual assault, and inappropriate relationships. City leaders
responded with a policy tool that’s usually associated with the South. They
created segregated facilities, with racial divisions that were often enforced
informally, but with unmistakable power.
By the 1950s, swimming pools had become flash points for racial
segregation, and occasionally outright violence, throughout the North.
(There were hardly any swimming pools for blacks in the South, and those
that existed were formally segregated with official police enforcement.)
Wiltse recounts the story of a Little League Baseball team in Youngstown,
Ohio, that celebrated its city championship in 1951 at a beautiful municipal
pool in South Side Park. The team had one African American player, Al
Bright, and lifeguards refused to let him past the perimeter fence while the
other players swam. When several parents protested, the supervisor agreed
to let Al “enter” the pool for a few minutes, but only if everyone else got

---

out and Al agreed to sit inside a rubber raft. While everyone watched, a
lifeguard pushed Al around the pool, shouting, “whatever you do, don’t
touch the water!”
This was not an isolated incident, nor was it restricted to certain parts of
the United States. Two years later, in 1953, the great African American film
star Dorothy Dandridge dipped her toes in the swimming pool at the Last
Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas, which welcomed her as a performer but
banned her, and all other blacks, from the water. The hotel responded by
draining the entire pool.
Civil rights attorneys challenged the legality of segregated swimming
pools, but integrating social facilities proved just as difficult as integrating
schools, if not more so. Shortly after Brown v. Board of Education, for
instance, a federal judge in Baltimore ruled against the NAACP’s demand
that the city integrate its public swimming pools, on grounds that “pools
were ‘more sensitive than schools’ because of the visual and physical
intimacy that accompanied their use.” The US Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit overruled this decision, forcing Baltimore to desegregate all
public pools. But the city resisted and didn’t give up its legal challenges
until it lost the last one possible, when the US Supreme Court declined to
review the case.
Baltimore was no outlier. Cities in the North and South responded to the
desegregation orders by abandoning public facilities, building new private
clubs, or closing down municipal pools altogether. Some cities were more
creative. St. Louis reimposed sex segregation, so that black men and white
women could never swim together. In Marshall, Texas, where the court
ordered integration, city officials voted overwhelmingly to sell the city’s
recreational facilities. The public pool was subsequently purchased by the
Lions Club, and operated as a white-only facility. Montgomery, Alabama,
didn’t merely shutter swimming pools. In 1959, local officials closed all
public parks and the municipal zoo to head off a lawsuit. The local YMCA,
however, remained segregated through the 1960s, and opened white-only
swimming pools on the condition that the city provide tax exemptions, free
water for its pools, and free park use. This secret deal went unchecked until
1970, when news of the arrangement leaked and courts forced the YMCA to
end its segregationist practices.

---

In private, however, white families had another way to deal with forced
desegregation: they retreated from public spaces and built pools in their
own backyards. Between 1950 and 1975, the number of residential in-
ground swimming pools in the United States increased from about twenty-
five hundred to more than four million. Racism was obviously not the only
factor in this building boom, but it played an unmistakably important role in
the demise of public social infrastructures that supported collective life.
Today, there are far fewer municipal swimming pools than there were
during the mid-1900s. The resort-style pools, with decks and restaurants
and other recreational facilities, have all but vanished. In the United States,
they exist primarily in private clubs and resorts that are inaccessible to the
middle and lower classes.
African Americans and civil rights activists protested this form of
inequality well past the 1960s. In 1975, for instance, blacks in Pittsburgh
(where in 1962 a sign posted outside one public pool stated “No Dogs or
Niggers Allowed”) fought against an order to close “Sully’s Pool,” a public
pool used primarily by African Americans, arguing that the pool is “a way
of life for us.” In 1971, the Supreme Court had narrowly ruled that closing
swimming pools in response to integration orders was not unconstitutional,
even if the closure had discriminatory intent, because it affected whites and
blacks equally. Perhaps sensing the fallout, the court specified that the
decision would not apply to public schools, because it deemed swimming
pools a “convenience or a luxury,” whereas public schools are a “necessity.”
Of course, no one disputed that schools are necessary, but this reasoning
failed to recognize how segregation in other public facilities would shape
our civic life and culture. To this day, there are wide racial disparities in
swimming ability in the United States, with whites twice as likely to know
how to swim as blacks, and black children being three times more likely to
die from unintentional drowning. Wiltse, the historian, argues that unequal
access to pools meant that swimming never became a significant part of
African American culture.
Pools, however, remain charged sites for discrimination and conflict. In
June 2015, Mc Kinney, Texas, gained the national spotlight after local police
got involved in a conflict at a private community swimming pool. The
interaction between the police and several black teenagers who had been

---

---

attending a party at the pool was caught on phone cameras, and an uploaded
You Tube video capturing a particularly forceful encounter between a police
offer and a young girl amplified the national conversation about police
abuse of African Americans. The swimming pool, while technically only
accessible to members of a gated community, was being used by a
neighborhood resident who was hosting a party. White residents approached
a group of black teenagers who were there, accusing them of trespassing
and telling them to go back to their “Section 8 homes.” After receiving
widespread media attention, the town placed the police officer involved in
the incident on administrative leave. Soon after, residents posted a sign
reading “Thank you Mc Kinney Police for keeping us safe.”

Stories like these help explain the popularity—or perhaps the necessity—of
social infrastructures that serve as safe spaces for members of excluded
groups that are subjected to prejudice, discrimination, and violence.
Oppressed communities often endure extreme social and economic
pressures that inhibit the formation of stable, enduring relationships. In the
United States, as the Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson has argued, the
history of slavery, ghettoization, segregation, and mass incarceration has led
to high levels of instability within the black community. “Afro-Americans
are the most unpartnered and isolated group of people in America,”
Patterson writes, “and quite possibly in the world.” Black Americans, and
all other groups that face severe discrimination, need spaces that foster
support and cohesion.
From ancient times, oppressed people—women, slaves, ethnic
minorities, gays and lesbians, the working classes, and the like—have built
special places and institutions where they can assemble to make sense of
and plan responses to their situation, free from surveillance by the dominant
group. The political theorists Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner call these
social spaces “counterpublics,” and argue that despite—and partly due to—
their insularity they are essential tools for civic engagement in unequal

---

societies, because they give marginalized groups the private forum they
need before engaging other groups.
History offers countless examples of these protected social
infrastructures. Many, from the mikvahs where observant Jewish women
have long convened to provide mutual support to the bathhouses that
anchored gay men’s social life for much of the twentieth century, involve
closed doors that facilitate safe intimacy. But most places that sustain
counterpublics are out in the open, available for everyone to see.
In contemporary America, the black church and the black barbershop
are among the most prominent social infrastructures that support a robust
counterpublic. Black barbershops have been vital parts of African American
culture and commerce since the first Africans arrived in North America, in
part because whites knew little about how to style black hair and showed
little interest in learning. In a context of racial discrimination, segregation,
and inequality, argues Melissa Harris-Lacewell, the protected space of the
black men’s barbershop is a valuable resource that, counterintuitively,
diversifies and enriches American civic life in the long run. “The
barbershop is the black man’s way station, point of contact, and universal
home,” write William Grier and Price Cobbs, in Black Rage. “Here he
always finds a welcome—a friendly audience as he tells his story and a
native to give him the word on local doings.” In Black Metropolis, the
landmark study of African Americans in Chicago, the sociologists St. Clair
Drake and Horace Cayton report that, as of 1938, black hair salons were by
far the most popular form of black-owned business, with 494 enterprises,
compared with 257 groceries, 145 restaurants, and 70 taverns across the
city.
Recent ethnographic studies depict precisely how black barbershops
help to advance the race. Melissa Harris-Lacewell, who hired a male
student to closely observe a Chicago barbershop where managers give
exclusive access to black men, finds that insular salons allow people who
are generally on the defensive to let their guard down, especially in
discussions of racism. They also provide a common meeting ground to
people in different generations, facilitating productive, if often contentious,
exchanges between younger and older men. “The barbershops and beauty
parlors, more than the churches, the schools, or the radio, exist as spaces

---

---

where black people engage each other as peers,” Harris-Lacewell writes,
“where nothing is out of bounds for conversation, and where the serious
work of ‘figuring it out’ goes on.”
In one conversation Harris-Lacewell recounts, a young man blames
police bias for high rates of traffic tickets given to African Americans, only
to be challenged by an older customer, who says the man made himself a
target by riding with the music blasting and the seat leaning way back.
“Although deeply critical of whites and keenly aware of contemporary
racism, [the men] were rarely willing to blame whites exclusively for the
problems facing African Americans,” Harris-Lacewell writes. “Even within
the context of the deeply strained historical and contemporary relationship
between Chicago police and Chicago’s black residents, the men resisted
blanket condemnation of police actions.”
It also exercises the men’s rhetorical muscles. Social exchange in the
barbershop can be brutally honest, leading to heated exchanges between
verbal combatants. It can also be extremely funny, as the blockbuster film
series Barbershop shows. In one memorable scene, Eddie the barber, played
by Cedric the Entertainer, tells his patrons: “Now, I probably wouldn’t say
this in front of white folk, but in front of y’all I’ll speak my mind…. One,
Rodney King shoulda got his ass beat for driving drunk and being grown in
a Hyundai. Two, O. J. did it. And three, Rosa Parks ain’t do nothing but sit
her black ass down.” Eddie, who’s loudly challenged by nearly everyone
around him as he makes these claims, is clearly not speaking on behalf of
the film’s writer or director. It’s not the substance of the lines that matters.
It’s the fact that the barbershop allows patrons to articulate controversial
ideas, and to argue them out until everyone has a better sense of who they
are, why they’re in their situation, and what they believe. When the
barbershop closes, the men who spend time there feel a little less isolated
and vulnerable. The bonds they form provide strength for the social
bridging that comes later, making them better prepared to engage the world
outside.

Bridging divisions in a highly segregated society is notoriously difficult,
but, as we saw in industrial Chicago, some social infrastructures invite us to
cross group lines. In recent years, social scientists have found surprisingly
robust evidence of how community organizations and nonprofits bring
neighbors together, increasing trust and civic engagement, and even
reducing violent crime. Community organizations bolster civic and cultural
life in every neighborhood fortunate enough to have them in abundance.
They are critical parts of the social infrastructure, because they provide
physical places where people can assemble, programs that bring people
together on a regular basis, and local leaders who become advocates for the
community. People usually do not volunteer in a community garden, teach
children to read, attend a church picnic, or participate in a rally for better
local air quality because they’re trying to generate social cohesion. But,
inevitably, the process of doing these activities creates or strengthens social
bonds.
Consider the Elmhurst-Corona neighborhood in Queens, an area that
was 98 percent white in 1960 but transformed dramatically in the following
decades, becoming 45 percent Latin American, 26 percent Asian, and
10 percent black by 1990. The early stages of neighborhood change were
predictably contentious. Both newcomers and old-timers harbored strong
stereotypes and prejudices about their neighbors. During the 1960s and
1970s, distrust divided the community; conflicts and misunderstandings
were common. The neighborhood had real problems to manage: Landlords
started subdividing residential units to increase their profits as migrants
entered the area and demand for housing increased. Blocks and buildings
grew congested, as did local schools. Youth programs were disappearing.
Parking was in short supply. Crime was rising, and the city, mired in a
historic fiscal crisis, was cutting local services. Police response times
slowed.
Most whites fled during this period, but many who remained were
disoriented by the rapid changes in the neighborhood’s commercial and
religious establishments. Some insisted, vocally, that the Latinos and
African Americans who were moving in were welfare recipients, although
few in fact were. Blacks and whites often referred to Latinos as “illegal
aliens,” though most were not. In 1974, the chairman of the neighborhood

---

community board referred to immigrants as “people pollution” during a
public meeting, and said he hoped the INS would root them out. Ethnic
slurs became standard features of the local parlance. Elmhurst-Corona was
bursting at the seams. Many feared that it would explode.
Elmhurst-Corona survived the fiscal crisis of the 1970s, but residents
still faced an abundance of social problems, from outdoor drug dealing and
prostitution to illegal vending, garbage accumulation, and housing code
violations. Some New York City neighborhoods buckled under these
pressures, becoming sites of arson, abandonment, and blight. In Elmhurst-
Corona, however, civic associations brought neighbors together to work on
quality-of-life issues, small and large. Often, ordinary residents with no
background in politics or activism started hyperlocal organizations to
combat problems on their own block, and over time joined with neighbors
on nearby streets to scale up their campaigns. A key to their success was
getting access to the neighborhood’s small public and semipublic places,
including church basements, senior centers, and common rooms in large
apartment buildings, where they hosted meetings and events.
Consider one typical example of a civic association that residents
created to protest an announcement that their neighborhood police station
would be relocated farther away, leaving them more vulnerable. Lucy
Schilero, a freelance beautician who’d initially gotten involved in the
neighborhood because of concerns about parking, took on the warden role,
circulating a petition to keep the station nearby. She quickly learned that
getting more signatures would require translating the document into all the
local languages, and she called meeting after meeting to get the work done.
“All the people on our block helped, 50 people,” she told the anthropologist
Roger Sanjek, who led an ethnographic research project in the
neighborhood for thirteen years. “We had everything in Spanish, Greek,
Italian, Chinese, Korean, [and] French. I met Iranians [and] Turkish
[people], to help translate.”
Schilero was so energized by the experience that she created the
Coalition of United Residents for a Safer Community, an organization that
grew to two thousand members, including residents of surrounding blocks
and small business owners. The process of local collaboration, as
sociologists like Robert Sampson explain, yielded more than a protest; it

---

also changed the way neighbors thought about one another and helped them
establish solidarity across group lines. “Now I have new ethnic friends:
Hindu, Spanish—a lot—Chinese. My Ecuadorian neighbor…is a good
friend, and in touch with Spanish residents. [White] friends in Maspeth and
Middle Village [in southwest Queens] say to me, ‘How can you live here?
It’s like Manhattan.’ I tell them we have to live with one another or we
won’t survive.”
During his extended fieldwork, Sanjek learned about all kinds of
neighborhood organizations that helped the residents of Elmhurst-Corona
live with one another and survive. In 1980, a Puerto Rican migrant named
Haydee Zambrana created Ciudadanos Conscientes de Queens (Concerned
Citizens of Queens) to advocate for better Spanish-language services in the
neighborhood. But during that decade she grew frustrated that Latino
groups in Elmhurst-Corona spent most of their time working on Puerto
Rican national issues and not enough engaging on local problems. “My
priority is to help the Hispanic community become part of the American
political process,” she told a city commission in 1986. The organization
pivoted, promoting civic engagement in both formal and informal forums.
Zambrana joined Community Board 4 (community boards are New York
City’s local political bodies), and within a year she’d recruited three other
Hispanic members, doubling their level of representation.
The largest local campaigns Sanjek observed grew out of threats that
touched everyone in the neighborhood, regardless of age, gender, or
ethnicity. In 1986 and 1987, for instance, residents from different civic
associations joined together to address a problem at the popular Lefrak City
branch library. For years, the branch employed a security guard to oversee
interactions in the building. This was quite standard in New York City,
where young children, teens, the homeless, freelance workers, the mentally
ill, and the elderly, all with their own needs and codes of conduct, packed
into branch libraries, competing for space every day. Inevitably, there were
tensions, and librarians could not manage them while also performing their
other duties. The security guards became important local actors, so the
community was outraged when the city announced that, due to budget cuts,
the guards would be fired.

---

---

At a community board meeting in early 1987, a coalition of concerned
neighborhood groups protested the decision and demanded that the city
retain the guards. A library official responded by blaming “latch key kids”
from black families for the problems, and condemning their families for
failing to supervise their children. A decade before, this argument might
have resonated with white, Asian, and Hispanic residents and deepened the
wedge between them. But after years of working together in neighborhood
associations, Sanjek writes, the people who packed the community board
jumped to the defense of local black families. Thousands of good parents in
Elmhurst-Corona sent their kids to libraries after school, they argued,
precisely because these places promised safe, positive, educational
experiences for everyone. This argument, forcefully articulated by a
community that stood together, proved difficult to counter. Library officials
found the funds they needed to keep the guards on duty.

Although some large-scale social infrastructure projects are expensive, in
general communities do not require massive funding to build places or
institutions that bring diverse sets of people together for sustained
interaction. Consider how, throughout the world, athletic facilities attract
people of different backgrounds into a shared social space, allowing for
competitive, playful, often joyous activity, and sparking relationships that
would never have been formed off the field or court. Athletic fields can be
sacred places, set aside for community purposes, where categories and
hierarchies that matter so much for social and political life often lose their
significance. The great anthropologist Victor Turner referred to such places
as “anti-structural,” because they allow people who might otherwise be
hostile to one another play together in an experience that he calls
communitas: a liminal moment when all participants have the same social
status and forbidden social bonds are suddenly encouraged. In some cases,
these special interactions have lasting significance, helping divided groups

---

recognize their common humanity, and paving the way for more meaningful
relationships off the field.
In Netherland, Joseph O’Neill’s elegant novel about dislocation in New
York City after September 11, a cricket field in Brooklyn plays a starring
role. “Bald Eagle Field” is the place where Hans van den Broek, the Dutch
banker who narrates Netherland, rediscovers the America he’d lost, and
himself as well, after his anxious wife takes their young child to London,
leaving him alone in New York. The field has been leased and carefully
cultivated by Chuck Ramkissoon, a charismatic, entrepreneurial Indian
from Trinidad who insists that cricket is “the first modern team sport in
America…a bona fide American pastime,” and makes himself president of
the New York Cricket Club. Before he meets Chuck, Hans appears
unmoored. He rents an apartment in the Chelsea Hotel and floats around the
boroughs with a flaneur’s eye, taking in the lights, the commerce, the
colorful characters, but always at a distance. The city is not his.
That changes once Chuck invites Hans to join his cricket club. A
wealthy, white European, Hans is an outlier on a field full of brown people
from Asia and the Caribbean who are trying to establish legitimacy in the
United States. For such men, the New Yorker book critic James Wood
writes, cricket is “an immigrant’s imagined community, a game that unites,
in a Brooklyn park, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Indians, West Indians, and so
on, even as the game’s un-Americanness accentuates their singularity.” For
Hans, Bald Eagle Field becomes the sacred ground where he must prove
himself as “a real American,” by which he means an aspiring immigrant
who’s trying to find secure footing. The games he plays test not only
whether he belongs on the field, but whether he belongs. Eventually he
passes, and only then does he find his place.
In real life, the social action on athletic fields is usually less poetic than
it is in good fiction, but it’s no less consequential for our relationships and
sense of identity. Consider how many young people meet their closest
friends—and also get to know themselves a lot better—while playing in a
ballpark. Consider how many parents forge lasting relationships on the
sidelines while their children practice and compete on the diamond, field, or
court.

As a young child in Chicago, I spent countless afternoons on a
makeshift soccer pitch near the Lincoln Park Zoo, where a neighborhood
organization called the Menomonee Club ran practices. In the 1970s, the
Menomonee Club was a meeting place for kids from Old Town, which was
quickly gentrifying, and the housing projects immediately to the south. The
director, a garrulous soccer fanatic named Basil Kane, charged something
like $6 per season, so that everyone could afford to play. As a result, the
experience I had playing “the beautiful game” was unlike most of the other
experiences I had in the grotesquely unequal and segregated city.
My neighborhood public school, for instance, had a playground
basketball court that was popular among kids from Old Town as well as the
housing projects nearby. My friends and I used it often, but one year, when I
was around ten, vandals took the hoops off the backboards so that no one
could play there. When the city installed new ones, the vandals removed
them again. I was furious, and I’d heard so many people complain about
crimes committed by poor African Americans from the projects that I
presumed they were responsible for destroying the basketball courts too.
But one day, when I was visiting a white neighbor who lived in one of the
nicest houses in the area, he asked if I wanted to know a secret. His teenage
brother and his friends had been taking down the hoops, he explained,
because they didn’t want black kids from the projects in our neighborhood.
I’d never considered that possibility.
In retrospect, I probably should have. Nearly everything in Chicago was
segregated: neighborhoods, schools, social clubs, religious institutions. But
on the soccer field, at least, I got to know people whose race and social
class—and therefore homes, cars, and meals—made them different from the
people I met in other circles. And yet, during the season we were on the
same team. Playing together was hardly enough to form deep and lasting
friendships, but it provided an opening, a chance to connect.
Now that I’m a parent, the time I spend on athletic fields—albeit on the
sidelines—is once again shaping my family’s social and community life.
During the week my wife and I shuttle between our offices at the university
and our children’s school, squeezing in an occasional date night, dinner
party, work event, or show. On weekends our schedules are less constricted,
but since our son joined his first soccer team they’ve revolved around his

---

games and tournaments, some of which take us far from home. Friends
whose children don’t play on travel teams are puzzled by our commitment
to this lifestyle and the impositions it poses. To be honest, sometimes I am
too! But then I remember what makes the experience so valuable and
compelling: the relationships we build with the families who share our
commitment, and with our own child as well.
The community we’ve built around the soccer field has been a
significant part of our life since our son was seven, but when my family
moved to Stanford University for a sabbatical in 2016, it proved especially
important. My wife and I knew only a few people there when we arrived,
and they were primarily friends from work. My children had no friends,
and, naturally, they were anxious about the change. But on our first day in
Palo Alto our son was invited to play on the travel team of a large local
soccer club, and his teammates quickly became pals. After a few weekends
of games around the Bay Area, other parents had invited our whole family
to barbecues, beach trips, and holiday meals. Our daughter befriended the
players’ sisters. We got advice about local schools, doctors, grocery stores,
and after-school programs. We formed car pools, so that everyone could
help each other get through the week.
No one would mistake our team for a fully integrated community.
Silicon Valley is astronomically expensive, and—as is too often the case in
modern American youth sports programs—so was participating on the
region’s travel team. But about 20 percent of the players lived in poor or
working-class neighborhoods like East Palo Alto, a primarily minority
community that’s physically separated from prosperous Palo Alto by a large
highway. Because the club offered financial support, the team had more
class and ethnic diversity than other local social groups. There were a few
soccer parents who worked in the tech industry and drove Teslas or
Mercedes, but most had Nissans, Subarus, and more conventional
professional or middle-class jobs. There were families from Canada,
Mexico, Brazil, India, Israel, Tunisia, France, and Germany. There were
Democrats, Republicans, independents, and progressives. Our team formed
during the most heated moments of the 2016 presidential election, and
occasionally we suspended the debate over Messi vs. Ronaldo to argue
Clinton vs. Trump. We didn’t agree or change each other’s minds, but we

---

liked and trusted each other enough to listen to opposing positions. Through
face-to-face interactions, we came to understand where people with
different viewpoints were coming from; on the sidelines, our social distance
narrowed.
It turned out to be a hard year of politics but a sensational year of
soccer, with the boys developing individually and gradually gelling into the
division champion, one of the strongest teams in California. My son, who
might otherwise have struggled with the transition to a new school in a
distant state, had never felt more confident or socially connected. My wife
and I found ourselves looking forward to the long weekend tournaments in
small towns like Manteca and Davis, and to the long afternoons and
evenings that we’d spend with families who were unlike our academic
colleagues and friends. The end of the season was more emotionally
difficult than the end of our dreamy fellowships at Stanford—not because
the games were over, since there are always more games, but because the
team was moving on and we were moving back.
When we returned to New York City in 2017, finding the right soccer
club became a major family project. We knew we weren’t just choosing a
sports team for our child, but a community for our family as well. There’s a
terrific neighborhood soccer program not far from our apartment, and we
had every reason to send our son there—except one. He was invited to try
out for Metropolitan Oval, a legendary club located in Maspeth, Queens, on
a gorgeous field built by German and Hungarian immigrants in the 1920s.
They designed the field to be a community center, and it has remained
exactly that for the past ninety years. Naturally, the club’s composition has
changed along with the city, and today the coaches, players, and families
reflect the diversity of Queens. We fell in love with the organization, and
the fact that they played beautiful soccer didn’t hurt. My son was overjoyed
when he was offered a spot in their academy, but all of us have benefited
from being around the club.
Our experience is typical. Sociologists have consistently found that
participating in organized sports teams increases social capital and leads to
more participation in non-sports-related collective activities as well. A
recent British study, for instance, reports “substantial correlations between
measures of social capital and measures of sporting participation, both at

---

the national level and, within Britain, at the individual level.” Eighty
percent of people who play an organized sport have friends in the
organization, considerably higher than the rate for those who participate in
humanitarian, environmental, or consumer organizations. That’s not
surprising, since the latter groups typically “require a more passive, often
subscription based, involvement” rather than the deeply physical,
interpersonal engagement required by athletics. What is surprising, though,
is the finding that, after people who regularly attend church, people who
play organized sports are more likely than others to volunteer in other civic
and associational projects. The authors argue that learning to lead or work
with teammates on the field helps players develop skills that transfer to
other domains of social life. “This is not only beneficial to the individual,”
they conclude, “it can also make a valuable contribution to the civil renewal
process by providing skills that can also be employed elsewhere in the
community.”
A recent study by the anthropologist Eric Worby shows how this
happens. In the 2000s, Worby conducted ethnographic fieldwork on
neighborhood soccer pitches around Johannesburg. When Worby and his
family moved there, friends and colleagues offered lots of advice on how to
protect and defend themselves, but little on how to build relationships. He
and his daughter discovered that on their own, in pickup soccer matches
played on “dusty, flat soccer pitches…with solitary cement trash bins as
targets for goals.” In postapartheid South Africa, Worby discovered, fields
like these were sites of “urban social freedom,” places where people could
open themselves to encounters that had long been feared or forbidden.
Playing soccer across racial and class lines did not make the entrenched
divisions disappear, of course, but it helped South Africans “rehumanize”
one another, a modest yet necessary step in the nation’s attempt to integrate
and democratize a deeply divided society.
Because, in so many modern societies, athletic fields are quasi-sacred
sites for playful social integration, acts of violence committed on them take
on special symbolic significance. In June 2017, for instance, a lone assailant
shot several people on a baseball diamond where Republican members of
Congress were practicing for their annual ritualistic game against the
Democrats. Mass shootings are always horrific, but commentators noted

---

---

that this one was especially offensive. “Baseball and softball provide
common ground in political Washington,” declared the New York Times. On
National Public Radio, congressional officials attested that the field
provided an important break from everyday life in the Capitol, where too
many partisan members have come to see one another one-dimensionally,
as enemies. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former head of the Democratic
National Committee, cofounded a softball game so that women in Congress
could have that same experience. “I have sponsored and passed laws with
colleagues who I likely wouldn’t have spoken to, let alone gotten to know,
without this team” she said.

Establishing meaningful connections with people we conceive as different
is not only a challenge in historically divided places like South Africa and
politically contentious cities like Washington, DC. Scholars such as Sherry
Turkle, Cass Sunstein, and Jonathan Haidt argue that the rapid rise of the
Internet has changed the ways that people everywhere view and treat one
another, creating vast terrains of social distance, even between friends.
There’s no doubt that parts of the Internet bring out the worst in human
behavior, but does it actually cause polarization? Sunstein and Haidt believe
it does. “As a result of the Internet, we live increasingly in an era of
enclaves and niches—much of it voluntary, much of it produced by those
who think they know, and often do know, what we’re likely to like,”
Sunstein claims. “So long as we are all immersed in a constant stream of
unbelievable outrages perpetrated by the other side,” Haidt writes, “I don’t
see how we can ever trust each other and work together again.” But other
research casts doubt on the causal relationship between political
polarization and use of the Internet or social media. Drawing on data from
the American National Election Studies, one team of economists finds that,
surprisingly, “the increase in polarization is largest among the groups least
likely to use the internet and social media.” For instance, polarization has
risen far more among people over the age of seventy-five, who are avid

---

consumers of cable television news channels such as Fox, than among those
between the ages of eighteen and thirty-nine, who are the heaviest users of
online media. This simple fact “rules out what seem like the most
straightforward accounts linking the growth in polarization to the internet,”
the authors write. Social media may well contribute to our widening
ideological divisions, but if the Internet doesn’t explain changes in the
group that has grown the most polarized, it cannot be entirely to blame.
In some ways it has been a force for good, allowing people to develop
relationships with those they might never have otherwise met. A recent
study shows that Americans and Germans who find their romantic partner
online are significantly more likely than those who search through friends,
family, or school to couple up with a person who has a different education
level, ethnic identity, or religious affiliation. And, following the divisive US
election of 2016, a number of socially engaged entrepreneurs are using the
Internet to help people with opposing political viewpoints start
conversations about the sources of their disagreement. One project,
Living Room Conversations.org, allows anyone who’s interested to join a
civil dialogue on contentious topics with strangers through a group video
chat. Another, Hi From The Other Side.com, matches two individuals with
conflicting perspectives, verifies their identities on Facebook, and sends
them an introductory e-mail—along with links to a conversation guide—so
that they can get to know each other in real life.
In some cases, such as gay and lesbian teenagers who live in small
towns or conservative communities, dissidents who live under repressive
political regimes, and refugees fleeing war zones, the Internet isn’t just a
way to get to know someone, but a lifesaving source of support and
connection. Facebook, for all its problems, helps people see that they’re not
alone in their struggle, and provides a forum where they can exchange ideas
about how to make things better, or even escape. In recent years, thousands
of Syrian refugees in Europe have used Facebook for all kinds of
information, from which gear to purchase before traveling to the names of
affordable hotels on the trail. They’ve also used Facebook to find old
friends or townsmen in their new country, to build communities in foreign
places, and, once they’re settled, to get news from home.

---

At the most mundane level, websites like Nextdoor facilitate
connections between neighbors who lack a convenient way to meet each
other or start group conversations, whether about important civic matters or
parochial concerns. On college campuses, students who are heavy users of
Facebook are more likely than light users to develop weak—but
nonetheless meaningful—social ties with a diverse set of peers. When I did
fieldwork in New York City libraries, I got to know a group of immigrants
—from China, Russia, Mexico, and Poland—who met one another in
English or citizenship classes and formed an active social group on
Whats App. They remain connected, years later, in part because the
technology makes it so easy to stay in touch.
There are countless other instances when people use the Internet to
build more unlikely social bridges. Often, they involve conversations about
issues such as health, music, or sports that have limited or indirect
connections to political or ideological matters. These topics allow people
who might be divided by their convictions to establish common ground.
Recently, for instance, I learned about an anonymous chat room for
people with HIV who are unwilling or unable to attend traditional support
groups. One relationship that developed there involved a trans woman of
color who helped a rural white Trump supporter get through his recovery
from addiction. That’s by no means anomalous. People with difficult health
problems routinely use the Internet to give and get support from others who
are unlike them in every way except the one that is suddenly most relevant.
They know from experience: if we use the Internet wisely, or design it with
our common humanity rather than our differences in mind, the technology
we so often blame for polarizing us can be palliative instead.
Social distance and segregation—in physical space as well as in lines of
communication—breed polarization. Contact and conversation remind us of
our common humanity, particularly when they happen recurrently, and
when they involve shared passions and interests. In recent decades, we’ve
lost the factories and industrial towns where different ethnic groups once
formed blue-collar communities. We’ve made our neighborhoods more
segregated by class. We’ve seen private companies organize competitive,
professionalized sports programs for affluent children, and left most low-
income kids to play in leagues of their own. We’ve watched cable news

---

programs and listened to radio talk shows that tell us what we already
believe.
These conditions facilitate social bonding within certain groups but
make social bridging difficult. They foster polarization, and divided we fall.
There’s no easy way to restore the sense of common purpose and shared
humanity that makes civic life possible. But the hard work that lies before
us will be impossible if we don’t build better social infrastructure. The
future of our democracy is at stake.

## CHAPTER SIX

## Ahead of the Storm

Paul and Shelle Simon have lived in Houston long enough to know that rain
can be dangerous. In a typical year, the nation’s fourth-largest city gets
about fifty inches of rainfall, and it’s prone to torrential downpours and the
occasional hurricane or tornado. Although Houston is not one of the wettest
American cities, its hard infrastructure and physical plan were designed to
facilitate private automobiles and nearly limitless growth, without much
regard for storm water management. The sprawling, six-hundred-square-
mile metropolis has massive amounts of impermeable paved surfaces and
scores of residential communities in the floodplain. When the rain is heavy,
drainage channels, sewers, and detention ponds fill up quickly. Water
courses through the city’s vital arteries, inundating roads and, on occasion,

---

hospitals, homes, and businesses as well. When a major storm hits,
floodwaters can breach the oil refineries and chemical plants that saturate
Houston, turning what might otherwise be a weather disaster into an
uncontrollable toxic event.
In late August 2017, the Simons, a middle-class African American
couple in their late thirties, saw a news story warning that a tropical storm
named Harvey had formed over the Caribbean and was gradually making its
way toward the Gulf of Mexico. It had been an unusually hot summer—
though so many summers have been unusually hot that it was probably just
usual—and the water in the Gulf and the Bay of Campeche was warm.
Harvey picked up energy as it moved toward Texas. On Wednesday,
August 23, scientists at the National Hurricane Center predicted that it
would become a strong tropical storm, or even a Category 1 hurricane, by
the time it made landfall. They were mistaken. Harvey continued to
strengthen as it approached the coastline, and on Thursday meteorologists
forecast that it would likely hit America’s fourth-largest city as a Category 3
or 4 hurricane, with fierce winds topping 115 miles per hour and biblical
precipitation. More ominously, Harvey seemed poised to stall over southern
Texas and stay awhile, possibly for days. Houston officials didn’t order a
mandatory evacuation, but they advised all residents to prepare for a deluge.
The Simons decided to hunker down in the house they own in
Richmond, a working-class, predominantly Hispanic area in the southwest
part of Houston. They live in West Oaks Village, a landscaped community
with a mix of modest single-family homes, small apartment buildings, and
generous collective amenities, including a playground and a large
swimming pool. The Simons have two young sons, an eight-month-old and
a two-year-old, and their extended families live in the area as well. They
remembered 2005, when 2.5 million people tried to flee Houston as
Hurricane Rita approached. Shelle was one of them, and her drive to Austin,
which is ordinarily a two-hour journey, took more than seventeen hours.
Rita wasn’t as bad as everyone feared—not nearly as bad as Katrina, which
had hit New Orleans weeks before—but the highways were jammed and
overheated, and more people died in the botched evacuation than in the city
center. With Harvey, Paul and Shelle figured they’d be better off at home.

---

This time, though, the storm proved even more severe than anyone
anticipated. The rain started on Friday, but on Saturday it became torrential.
In church, a few days later, Shelle told her fellow congregants what
happened: “My sister, Sheraine, she and her [twenty-one-month-old] son
came to stay with us so we could go through the storm together. She didn’t
want to go through it alone.” Once they arrived, the tornado warnings
started. “Paul came up with a plan. We would clear out all the closets, move
the clothes. And Paul kept saying, ‘If this happens we go in this closet, if
that happens we go in that closet.’ We were doing that.”
Ordinarily, hard rain lets up after awhile. The clouds empty, the sky
opens, the sun or the stars reappear. “Everyone knows that Houston floods,”
Paul told me. “But I’ve lived here fifteen years and this neighborhood has
never had any problems. We’ve never had water in this house. Nothing even
close. I figured that we’d be okay.” The Simons listened as the wind howled
and the storm roared. They looked outside and saw that the streets were
drowning. They were stressed, exhausted. And soon there was nothing to do
except go to bed.
But who could sleep in those conditions?
They woke up before dawn and went straight to the windows. “The rain
was up to our driveway,” Shelle said. “And the water was rising, higher and
higher.” Her pulse quickened. The walls weren’t going to save them if the
rain kept coming. The closets weren’t going to, either. They needed another
plan.
“I’m going out there,” Paul said. “I’m gonna drive around and see if we
can get out.”
“Don’t do it,” Shelle shot back. “Because I don’t want you to get
separated from us, not from the kids.”
But the water kept rising through the day, and by early afternoon Paul
and Shelle realized that they couldn’t leave even if they wanted to. The
driveway was a river, the streets running rapids. Their house was about to
be inundated. Their children, Shelle’s family, and everything they owned
was inside.
“I was on the phone with my mother [who’s also in Houston],” Shelle
recalled, when she, Paul, and I spoke a few weeks after the storm hit. “And

---

she asked me to send her a picture of what was happening outside. I went to
the door, and there was so much water I couldn’t believe it. I was just wide-
eyed, in shock. And just then, at that very moment, our neighbors came
walking right by our door. The water was so high that they had to stay close
to the houses. They were carrying plastic garbage bags with their
belongings, and they were with their cousin, TJ, who’d driven there in a
truck. I was just standing there. I had clips in my hair, I had a baby on my
hip, and I was just looking at them, like, ‘What are you guys doing?’ And
they said, ‘We’re getting out of here! Do you want to come with us? Do you
need help?’ And I said yes, yes!”
She screamed for Paul and he rushed over. TJ said he’d parked a few
blocks away because the streets around the Simons’ house were impassable.
He told Paul that he didn’t have room for all of them in his truck, but he
took Paul’s number and promised he’d return soon. Paul, Shelle, and
Sheraine raced through the house to pack up the essentials: diapers,
formula, water, food, clothes for the children. “I’m not really that good with
emergency situations,” Shelle admitted. “I kind of break down. But then TJ
came back for us. And, you know, we walked through that water.”
The Simons made it, children hoisted in their arms. They wanted to go
to Shelle’s father’s place, but the roads leading there were inaccessible.
“God had different plans,” Paul said. “We drove around, and all our access
points were closing or shutting down.” At one point TJ got to a flooded
street where the median looked like a roadway. He tried to drive along it,
but the truck went off the edge and, suddenly, they were stuck. “That was
definitely the scariest moment,” Paul told me. “It was dark. The rain was
just pouring down on us. The radio was broadcasting tornado warnings.
And there we were, with three little kids in the truck, no car seats even,
totally exposed.”
This time Shelle really did break down. “I was bawling in there. I was
scared. My baby was premature and when he was born he’d had trouble
breathing. When I looked at him he was totally still. I didn’t know if
something was wrong. I couldn’t reach my phone so I took my sister’s, got
on her Facebook, and posted that we were stranded. I sent out a message
saying ‘Please pray for us.’ I honestly didn’t know if we’d make it.”

---

Another truck came by, and the driver stopped and used cables to pull
them off the median. TJ found a way out of the flooded area, but now he
was late and needed to help his own family, so they drove to a gas station
where emergency workers had congregated, and the Simons got out. The
baby was fine, just exhausted, but now there was a new problem: they had
nowhere to go. “We thought the EMS workers would be able to help us,”
Paul recalled. “But it turned out they were waiting for emergency calls only.
So we were pretty much stranded.” A group of men had gathered inside the
station, and one of them was explaining that he’d found a safe driving route
to an area that had escaped flooding. “When I heard him,” Paul said, “I
realized that the route went right by the subdivision where my parents live.
He was going to show the others the way, and I asked if I could go with
him. My father was out of town, and I had the keys to his truck with me. I
told Shelle and Sheraine that I could get us out of there.” For a moment, the
Simons couldn’t believe their luck.
The feeling didn’t last long. The floodwater had breached the front door
of Paul and Shelle’s home, probably soon after they left. And it kept
coming, in greater and greater volumes, because Harvey really did settle
over Houston for another three days. By Tuesday, when the storm clouds
finally dispersed, more than fifty-one inches of rain had fallen on parts of
the city—breaking the record for the most precipitation from a single storm
or hurricane on the continental United States. (The National Weather
Service, a cautious scientific organization that typically uses dry,
descriptive language, wrote that the rainfall figures were “simply mind-
blowing.”) For the Simons, and for thousands of other Houston residents,
the numbers were academic. What mattered was that their homes were
underwater, and that they’d lost nearly everything they’d left behind.
The following Sunday, when Shelle and Paul went to the place where
they always go on Sunday mornings, the Wilcrest Baptist Church, they told
everyone assembled that what happened during the storm only deepened
their faith in the community. First there was TJ, the neighbor’s cousin who
suddenly became their “first responder” and risked his life to rescue them.
And then, when the challenge turned to recovery and rebuilding, there was
the community that has always been primary but never before so important,
the one they’d built through the church.

---

Wilcrest Baptist is a small church in Alief, a lower-middle-class area in
Southwest Houston. It has about five hundred active members with roots in
about fifty nations, and they’re a fairly even mix of whites, Latinos, and
African Americans, some urban, some suburban, some rural, and mostly but
not all conservative. Such diversity is unusual in American churches, which
have long been among the nation’s most ethnically and racially segregated
institutions, and it didn’t happen at random. Until recently, Wilcrest was a
mostly white congregation. Michael Emerson, an eminent sociologist of
religion who both joined and wrote about Wilcrest, reports that the church
used to keep a supply of cards with the names and addresses of churches
that served primarily black, Latino, and Asian communities. When someone
from one of those groups came to Wilcrest, church leaders would politely
hand them a card and suggest they find a place where they’d feel more at
home.
That changed in the 1980s, when whites began moving out of the area
and blacks and Latinos moved in. Nearly all of Wilcrest’s leaders wanted to
move the church to the outlying suburbs where their congregants were
going, but the bylaws required a unanimous vote from the board to do that,
and one member insisted that they stay and adapt. Wilcrest began to expand
its community, first slowly and then with a strong, deliberate push. In the
early 1990s, the church hired Rodney Woo to be the new pastor. Woo was
part of a rising religious movement in the American evangelical community
—fueled by multiculturalism and the influx of new Christian immigrants—
to make the congregation a place of cross-racial, multiethnic integration. He
began doing outreach around Southwest Houston, and led congregants on
missionary trips around the world. Paul told me that “the first time I went
there Pastor Woo was preaching the Gospel in a way that just touched me. I
was with my twin sister. We looked around and we just felt welcome. It was
multicultural, which was big for us. There were flags in the sanctuary, each
one representing a country where a member is from or where the church has
done work. We felt like we belonged.”
The Simons are active churchgoers. Paul, who first joined in 2007, is a
deacon and the head usher. Shelle, who joined when they got married, in
2012, hosts home groups and sings in the choir. But they never imagined
that their family, and their home, would one day get so much help. Wilcrest

canceled services on the Sunday of the storm, but church leaders began
organizing a relief effort before the rain stopped. Jonathan Williams, the
energetic young pastor who replaced Woo in 2011, posted a video prayer
and message of hope on Facebook and offered thanks that the congregation
was looking after one another. Several families, including the Simons, had
suffered severe flood damage and were displaced from their homes. Church
members had volunteered to house them, kids and all.
On Thursday, August 31, Wilcrest used social media to post a list of the
supplies that its families needed: “Boys clothes, sizes 9–12 months, 2T, 3T.
Baby wipes and diapers sizes 4 and 5 and formula. Car seats. Tee-shirts.
Men’s jeans. Socks.” Jonathan requested that congregants bring these items
to the church as soon as possible. On Friday, five of Paul’s friends from
church met him at his house and scoped out the situation. About four feet of
water had covered the first floor, and almost everything it touched—
floorboards, cabinets, sheet rock, tiles and laminate—had to be ripped out
and replaced. Paul’s friends told Jonathan, who called for everyone in the
congregation who could get to church to come back on Saturday morning.
They’d transform the religious center into a relief operation for anyone,
member or not, with hot food, fresh clothing, cleaning supplies, and prayer.
It would also be a staging ground, from which teams of congregants would
carpool to flooded neighborhoods and help clean out damaged homes.
They’d start at the Simons. If time permitted, they’d extend outward and
help other families, even those who didn’t belong to the church.
Despite the widespread flood damage, on Saturday morning more than
eighty people arrived at Wilcrest for the relief effort. Some got there early
to prepare a hot breakfast, and the day began with a shared meal and a
prayer. Jonathan told everyone that the hurricane was a reminder that our
lives on earth were temporary, as was our hold on our material possessions.
He urged congregants to recognize that they were part of a church body, and
part of the body of Christ. He promised that the church would be there to
help anyone who needed assistance, physical, emotional, or spiritual. Today,
and for the hard months to come, their most immediate challenge would be
to attend to one another here on earth.
After breakfast, most people, including nearly all of the men, went to
the Simons’ house, parking in a nearby elementary school and walking over

because the streets were still coated in dirty water and there was no place
for cars. Others formed small groups to help with other projects at the
church: preparing food in the cafeteria, organizing supplies in the donation
center, delivering relief packages to congregants who’d requested specific
items, taking care of children whose parents were out taking care of
neighbors and friends. Repairing the Simons’ house required grueling
manual labor, but with more than forty people pitching in the work went
quickly. Once they’d finished, everyone stuck around for group photos and
a prayer. And then nearly all of them went to help the Simons’ next-door
neighbors, an elderly couple, as well as Laverne and Brittney, who lived
across the street. The two women had been thinking of joining a church but
hadn’t yet decided on one. Their choice soon became clear.
On Sunday, Laverne and Brittney joined the Simons and the Ayalas, a
family with four children that had also been flooded out of their home, for
services at Wilcrest. It was an emotional day for everyone in the
congregation, but especially for the Ayalas. They’d been anxious because
their relatives, with whom they’d been staying since the storm hit, had other
displaced family members to house and couldn’t fit everyone much longer.
But Leasa and Guy Cantwell, two longtime Wilcrest members whom they
barely knew, had invited the Ayalas to move in with them for as long as
they needed. The Cantwells were white empty nesters with a large home
and a swimming pool, and although the Ayalas’ young children were
nervous about staying with strangers, they were also excited, for the first
time in days. The chapel was crowded, and Jonathan opened the service by
acknowledging what the community had accomplished: “I’ll tell you what a
joy it is to look at the group that was there yesterday and know that if it was
my house, they would be there. If it was your house, they would be there. I
know. I know if my house was flooded, Paul would be there. Shelle would
be there. Laverne and Brittney better be there. I will call you. I know where
## you live. That’s my prayer.”

In the following days, as people and communities throughout Houston
prayed for their own miraculous recoveries, scientists announced that,
according to current weather models, Harvey was a “500-year flood.” In
other words, there is a one in five hundred chance of a storm that strong
happening each year. Of course, that didn’t mean that citizens,
governments, or relief agencies could rest easy. The United States had
already experienced twenty-four five-hundred-year storms since 2010, and
with climate change, it could expect many more. What no one anticipated,
though, is that the next monstrous hurricane, Irma, would arrive on the US
mainland about ten days later, and yet another, Maria, would cause
catastrophic destruction in Puerto Rico, including months of disrupted
power and water service to millions of people and more than one thousand
deaths, about ten days after that.
Irma, which tore through the Caribbean, the Florida Keys, and the
western side of Florida, was a Category 5 hurricane with sustained wind
speeds of 185 miles per hour at its peak, and a Category 4 storm when it hit
the mainland. In Florida, as in Texas, runaway development on low-lying
land meant that millions of people were living in places that are likely to
flood often and be uninhabitable by the end of the twenty-first century. Irma
knocked out power to 6.7 million households across two-thirds of the state,
caused between $42.5 and $65 billion of property damage, and took at least
seventy-five lives, including twelve residents of a nursing home that
overheated when the power went out. That’s actually a lower toll than
experts expected, because the hurricane’s path changed and weakened at the
last minute. But 2017 wound up setting an American record for costs from
extreme weather events, with $306 billion in total damage. And it’s only a
matter of time before the next wave of hurricanes and superstorms arrives.
Today, cities and nations throughout the world are beginning to face up
to the existential security challenges posed by global warming: rising seas,
stronger storms, hotter and longer heat waves, droughts, migration, and
conflicts over basic resources like water, food, and land. We have a narrow
window to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the climate
from changing so dramatically that countless species, including our own,
will no longer be able to live in places where they currently flourish. For
that reason, there’s no environmental project more urgent than climate

---

mitigation, which means radically reducing our use of fossil fuels,
converting to renewable sources of energy, and building new infrastructures
to support these systems and sustain new ways of life much sooner than
most governments are currently planning.
But much of the carbon dioxide we’ve already emitted will remain in
the atmosphere for centuries, heating the oceans and raising the seas. If,
through some unfathomable invention, scientists managed to stop all
greenhouse gas emissions tomorrow, the process of global warming would
continue for centuries, and sea levels would keep rising for thousands of
years. We must mitigate, but we also have no choice but to adapt.
In coming decades, the world’s most affluent societies will invest
trillions of dollars on new infrastructure—seawalls, smart grids, basins for
capturing rainwater—that can withstand twenty-first-century challenges,
including megastorms like Harvey and Irma. But no investment in hard
infrastructure will be sufficient to “climate-proof” the densely populated
cities and suburbs that modern societies have built in coastal areas, river
deltas, deserts, and plains. Engineered systems can be more or less
responsive to the emerging climate, but history shows that they are never
infallible. Breakdowns often occur for unanticipated reasons. Social
infrastructure is always critical during and after disasters, but it’s in these
moments that it can truly mean the difference between life and death.
Social infrastructure can be built into traditional megaprojects, so that
expensive climate security systems like seawalls and water basins function
as parks or public plazas where people congregate on a regular basis and
develop the informal support networks that we need during crises. It can
also come from community organizations and religious groups, whose
physical facilities and programs are staging grounds for all variety of
collective life, regardless of the weather.
In the United States, religious organizations like Wilcrest play a vital
role in helping their communities get through extreme weather. One reason
that sites of worship are such important social infrastructures is that they are
ubiquitous. Today, there are more than three hundred thousand religious
congregations in the United States. “To put that number in context,” writes
one group of sociologists, “religious congregations are more common than
Subways, Mc Donald’s, Burger Kings, Wendy’s, Starbucks, Pizza Huts,

---

KFCs, Taco Bells, Domino’s Pizzas, Dunkin’ Donuts, Quiznos, and Dairy
Queens combined and multiplied by three.”
Another reason religious organizations are so important is that they are
not merely houses of worship but key sites for community building.
Religious institutions are driven by moral and spiritual concerns and are
deeply engaged in the lives of their congregants. Although they vary
dramatically by size and resources, churches, mosques, and synagogues
tend to offer all kinds of social programs in their facilities: education and
study groups, athletic leagues, childcare, elder support, and the like. Some
engage people outside their congregation and try to build bridges; others are
self-segregating and focus on the needs of the group. But in either case,
their significance as social infrastructure is beyond dispute.
Not everyone belongs to a religious organization, however, and not
every religious organization has the capacity to provide the kind of disaster
relief that places like Wilcrest offer. There are, fortunately, many other
places and organizations that serve as social infrastructures for secular or
religiously unaffiliated people, including libraries, schools, and community
groups. But most need resources to thrive.
Increasingly, governments and disaster planners are recognizing the
importance of social infrastructure as part of climate security. Nicole Lurie,
a scholar at Rand who previously served as President Obama’s assistant
secretary for preparedness and response, told me that when she was in the
federal government her team understood “how much better people do in
disasters, how much longer they live, when they have good social networks
and connections. And we’ve had a pretty big evolution in our thinking, so
promoting community resilience is now front and center in our approach.”
Barack Obama worked as a community organizer during the late 1980s,
learning firsthand why social ties matter. He must have been thinking of the
impoverished communities he’d gotten to know so well in Chicago when,
as a US senator in 2005, he connected the effects of Hurricane Katrina to
the slow-motion disaster that New Orleans’s vulnerable neighborhoods
endured every day. “I hope we realize that the people of New Orleans
weren’t just abandoned during the hurricane,” he said. “They were
abandoned long ago.” Katrina, Obama continued, should “awaken us to the

---

---

great divide that continues to fester in our midst” and inspire us to “prevent
such a failure from ever occurring again.”
During his first term, President Obama introduced a new National
Health Security Strategy that emphasized preparedness and resilience,
calling for the participation of the “whole community”—government
agencies, civic organizations, corporations, and citizens—in all aspects of
the security plan. After March 2011, when Obama issued a directive on
national preparedness, FEMA began to embrace a similar approach to
community resilience. “Community-engagement” programs funded by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been launched in Los
Angeles, Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. “There’s always
been a big focus on classic infrastructure in mitigation,” Alonzo Plough, a
former director of emergency preparedness and response for the County of
Los Angeles, says. “But it’s not just engineering that matters. It’s social
capital. And what this movement is bringing to the fore is that the social
infrastructure matters, too.”

Today, a growing network of policy makers and designers recognize the
advantages of building social infrastructure into larger vital system
upgrades. Their goal is to carry out “multipurpose projects” so that public
investments in security don’t just mitigate disaster damage but also
strengthen the networks that promote health and prosperity during ordinary
times.
Hurricane Sandy marked a turning point in the way government and
civic groups think about climate security. The “superstorm” of 2012
covered an area more than one thousand miles in diameter, making it one of
the largest hurricanes in American history. Its winds were both punishingly
severe and painfully slow, and like Harvey, Sandy seemed to pause so that it
could inflict extra damage on nearly everything in its path. Sandy hit the
Atlantic coast on October 29—the worst possible moment. Not only was
there a full moon with high tides, there was also an early winter storm with

---

arctic air moving into the Northeast from the other direction, and the two
systems collided to form what journalists called a hybrid “Frankenstorm.”
As the primary target of the attacks on September 11, New York City
had spent billions of dollars, over the course of a decade, shoring up its
security systems and preparing for a catastrophe. Terrorism was not its only
concern. Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the city also became a leader in
planning for climate change, issuing high-profile reports about adaptation
and mitigation and beginning the process of making the city more weather-
resistant. In August 2011, New York City braced itself for the arrival of
another severe storm system, Hurricane Irene, but was largely spared when
the storm spun off to the north and west. The experience was something like
a dress rehearsal for city officials and emergency managers, but it also gave
residents a false sense of security, and only bolstered the collective
confidence that has historically served Gotham so well.
Sandy laid waste to New York City’s spirit of invulnerability, and to
much of the city’s vital infrastructure as well. The storm surge, which
reached fourteen feet, toppled the city’s flood protection systems. Subway
tunnels filled up like bathtubs. The sewage system flooded and eleven
billion gallons of soiled water overflowed into rivers and streets. The
communications system broke down, leaving more than one million
residents and businesses without phone or Internet service. The power grid
failed, massively, with outages lasting nearly a week in Lower Manhattan
and much longer in parts of Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Queens. Several
hospitals and nursing homes were evacuated. Tens of thousands of residents
were displaced from their homes, some permanently. Officials estimated the
economic toll at around $60 billion. Miraculously, only around 150 people
died in the United States, and fewer than 100 died across the Caribbean.
Sandy was neither the most deadly nor the most expensive storm in
recent US history, and in global terms, its impact was far less severe than
other twenty-first-century disasters, from the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004
(which killed more than two hundred thousand people) to the pan-European
heat wave of 2003 (which killed around seventy thousand people). But
Sandy was important for other reasons: Not only did it reveal the
surprisingly fragile physical and social infrastructure of one of the world’s
wealthiest and best-protected metropolitan areas, but it also directly affected

---

the political, economic, and media elite of the United States. The fossil fuel
industry has had great success promoting climate change denial and policy
stagnation on all variety of environmental matters, but Sandy forced many
of America’s most powerful institutions to begin reckoning with global
warming. A wide range of people and institutions that have the capacity to
shape public opinion, social policy, and urban planning see the world
differently today than they did before Sandy hit. They are looking for new
ideas—about how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, how to protect
vulnerable people and places, how to rebuild cities, communities, and
critical infrastructures so that the systems we depend upon don’t fall apart
when we need them most.
Sandy revealed serious flaws in all forms of infrastructure in the New
York area. When I visited Rockaway Beach and Staten Island in mid-
November 2012, residents complained about the slow pace of recovery. The
power was out. The gas was off. Phone service was spotty. Trains weren’t
running. Sewage water from the flooding covered the streets.
Still, there were some surprising reserves of strength. Consider Staten
Island, which suffered more fatalities than any other borough in New York
City, and endured flooding so destructive that the state helped relocate
residents in several coastal neighborhoods to higher ground. In the New
Dorp neighborhood, a branch library housed in a modest building escaped
major damage, but homes nearby took in as much as sixteen feet of water
and residents needed all kinds of assistance. There are schools and senior
centers in the area, but when people are in serious trouble they want to go to
a place that’s familiar and comfortable, where they are likely to find
neighbors and friends. In New Dorp, as in so many New York City
neighborhoods, that place was the local library. Old and young, they came
in droves.
At first the library offered basic resources: food, hot water, clean
bathrooms, phones, power, cleaning supplies, companionship. Within days
it was doing much more: helping residents apply for FEMA funds online,
connecting them with the Red Cross, and hosting volunteers from civic
organizations that were mounting their own relief efforts. In New Dorp, the
library staff worked like the religious leaders in Houston. They knew their
patrons well enough to do their own emergency outreach, checking in with

---

regulars whom no one had heard from and making sure someone visited
those who were alone or vulnerable and in need of extra support.
Something similar happened at the Rockaway Beach Surf Club in
Queens, which had opened in a converted auto-repair shop beneath the El
on Beach Eighty-Seventh Street a few months before Sandy hit. The club
transformed itself into a temporary relief agency when two of its founders
returned there after the storm, posted Facebook updates inviting friends to
join them, and watched more than five thousand volunteers come to help.
Along with some local churches that, as in Houston, quickly transformed
their chapels into relief centers, the surf club became one of the
Rockaways’ main community organizations, providing food, cleaning
supplies, camaraderie, and manual labor for nearby residents. The club’s
neighbors, including blue-collar families and poor African Americans who,
months before, had worried about how the club would fit into the
community, joined in and benefited from the organization.
Unfortunately, thousands of people whose homes were damaged by
Sandy live in neighborhoods that lack strong support networks or
community organizations capable of mounting a large relief effort. They
tend to be poorer and less educated than typical New Yorkers, with weaker
ties to their neighbors as well as political power brokers.
After Sandy, Michael Mc Donald, who heads Global Health Initiatives in
Washington, DC, and worked in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake,
coordinated relief efforts by volunteer groups, government agencies,
corporate consultants, health workers, and residents in vulnerable areas,
particularly in the Rockaways. Mc Donald calls the network the New York
Resilience System, and he’s convinced that civil society will ultimately
determine which people and places withstand the emerging threats from
climate change. “What’s actually happening on the ground is not under an
incident command system,” he told me. “It’s the fragile, agile networks that
make a difference in situations like these. It’s the horizontal relationships
like the ones we’re building that create security on the ground, not the
hierarchical institutions. We’re here to unify the effort.”

The island nation of Singapore—where 5.6 million people are packed into
277 square miles of land, much of which is perilously close to sea level—
has combined physical and social infrastructure in several exemplary
projects. Singapore began adapting to dangerous weather thirty-five years
ago, after a series of heavy rains during monsoon seasons caused repeated
flooding in the low-lying city center. The country has always had a difficult
relationship with water: its geography makes it vulnerable to heavy
seasonal rains and frequent flooding, but there is never a sufficient supply
of potable water, and in recent years Singapore’s dependency on Malaysian
resources has led to political conflict. Climate change, with its rising sea
levels and increase in heavy rains, threatens the city-state’s stability. But
Singapore’s government also sees this moment as an opportunity.
The Marina Barrage and Reservoir, which opened in 2008, is at the
heart of Singapore’s $2 billion campaign to improve drainage infrastructure,
reduce the size of flood-prone areas, and—through better social
infrastructure—enhance the quality of city life. It consists of nine operable
crest gates, a series of enormous pumps, and a ten-thousand-hectare
catchment area that is roughly one-seventh the size of the country. The
system not only protects low-lying urban neighborhoods from flooding
during heavy rains but also eliminates the tidal influence of the surrounding
seawater, creating a rain-fed supply of freshwater that currently meets
10 percent of Singapore’s demand. Moreover, by stabilizing water levels in
the Marina basin, the barriers have produced better conditions for water
sports. The Marina’s public areas, which include a sculpture garden, a
water-play space, a green roof with dramatic skyline vistas, and the
Sustainable Singapore Gallery, bolster the city’s tourist economy. They’ve
become vital parts of the social environment, and models for other cities
that want their investment in climate security to pay off every day.
Rotterdam, which has a long history of flooding, is another model for
climate planning that incorporates social infrastructure. After enduring a
devastating storm surge in 1953, Rotterdam began building a series of
dams, barriers, and seawalls as part of a national project called Delta Works,

---

and in the early 2000s, when the United States was investing so many
resources in homeland security, the Dutch government provided funds for
an upgrade, the Rotterdam Climate Proof Program. Arnoud Molenaar, who
manages it, said his team realized that they could convert the water that
comes into the city from the skies and the sea into “blue gold.” “Before, we
saw the water as a problem,” Molenaar told me. “In the Netherlands, we
focused on how to prevent it from coming in. New York City focused on
evacuation, how to get people out of the way. The most interesting thing is
figuring out what’s between these approaches: what to do with the water
once it’s there.”
In 2005, Rotterdam hosted the Second International Architecture
Biennale. The theme was “The Flood.” Designers from around the world
presented plans for how cities could cope with water in the future, and
when the exhibition ended Molenaar’s team set out to implement those that
would have immediate practical value. Rotterdam is now a global leader in
what climate designers consider the architecture of accommodation: Rather
than simply attempting to block out heavy precipitation, the city is creating
attractive, usable physical places that let the water in. There’s a floating
pavilion in the city center made of three silver half spheres with an
exhibition space that’s equivalent to four tennis courts; a floodable terrace
and sculpture garden along the city’s canal; and buildings whose facades,
garages, and ground-level spaces have been engineered to be waterproof.
The most exciting social infrastructure that Rotterdam has built for
climate security is Waterplein Benthemplein (the Benthemplein Water
Square), designed by the Dutch architectural group De Urbanisten. The
square, near the city’s Central Station, in a formerly drab open space
surrounded by large buildings, consists of three basins—two shallow, one
deep—whose primary ecological purpose is to collect rainwater during the
city’s heavy storms. Ordinarily, flood management projects like these are
buried underground as invisible infrastructure, so that the water disappears
from view without anyone knowing how much there is, where it’s going, or
how the urban system works. Waterplein Benthemplein takes the opposite
approach: the basins are not merely exposed; they are the most prominent
architectural features of the plaza, places that attract different groups of
people and offer a wide range of social and recreational activities.

---

On dry days, the deep basin doubles as a sport court, and people of all
ages sit around the tiered seating area that surrounds it, taking in the action.
The two shallow basins have different everyday functions. One contains an
island with materials resembling a dance floor; the other is designed for
skaters and the people who watch them. The square has other amenities.
The site had long been a healthy habitat for trees, but the designers filled in
open areas with wild flowers, tall grass, and small benches, which together
create a series of pocket sanctuaries for rest and conversation. There’s a
large fountain, a dramatic water wall, and a rain well that feeds into an
oversize, stainless steel gutter. There’s always a pleasant flow of water in
the square, but when there’s precipitation, the full system rushes into
operation. It sounds like a powerful waterfall, and looks exactly like what
its designers intended: a dramatic work of urban art that doubles as critical
infrastructure for a city where rain can be deadly.
Projects like Waterplein Benthemplein and the Singapore Marina
Barrage and Reservoir are not inexpensive; but as storms mount and their
costs, both human and financial, add up, governments will have no choice
but to dedicate the kinds of resources to climate change that we’ve devoted
to the war on terror. Unfortunately, governments in the world’s poorest and
most vulnerable nations do not have the kinds of resources that are
necessary to build high-tech infrastructure systems that protect people from
extreme weather while also improving the quality of everyday life. They’ve
lobbied for adaptation funds during negotiations for every major
international climate treaty, and although they’ve gained some concessions
from the affluent societies whose carbon emissions are responsible for most
global warming, the pool of money available to help developing nations
fend off ecological ruin is a fraction of what they need.
Consider Bangladesh, a geographically small nation of 165 million
people densely packed onto a delta formed by the confluence of several
large rivers, and one of the most ecologically vulnerable places on earth.
Bangladesh has a long history of catastrophic flooding that predates global
warming: tsunamis, cyclones, and rainstorms arrive with frightening
regularity, and each storm surge sends salinated water into the agricultural
regions, ruining the crops that residents rely on for income and
nourishment. In 1991, a tropical cyclone killed roughly 138,000

---

Bangladeshis, including a disproportionate number of women, old people,
and children, who were trapped in the water and didn’t know how to swim.
In 1998, monsoon rains flooded two-thirds of the country, destroying some
three hundred thousand houses, killing livestock, contaminating drinking
water, and devastating local farms. In some nations, dealing with global
warming remains a low priority, but in Bangladesh it’s already a matter of
grave national significance, part of every major policy debate.
In Bangladesh, as in most of the world’s poor nations, international
development agencies tend to dictate the terms of new infrastructure
investments. Malcolm Araos, an NYU graduate student and one of my
research assistants, did fieldwork in Dhaka to examine how adaptation
projects unfold on the ground. He found, predictably, that hard
infrastructure like embankments, sluice gates, and drainage systems were
often placed around command centers where the nation’s elites clustered
rather than in the crowded, low-income neighborhoods where residents are
most at risk. Not only did most climate security projects neglect social
infrastructure; in some cases, they required demolishing the informal
settlements and busy marketplaces where poor people gathered.
But Araos also discovered exciting projects where communities unable
to secure conventional flood protection developed new ideas for staying
above water. Throughout the country, grassroots organizations have been
collaborating with nonprofits and local governments on social infrastructure
projects that enhance resilience during weather disasters and dramatically
improve residents’ everyday lives too.
One particularly effective initiative is the “floating schools and
libraries” program, led by Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha, a nonprofit that’s
addressing climate change, access to education, human rights, health care,
and the digital divide with buoyant social infrastructure—in this case, boats.
Shidhulai operates a fleet of fifty-four vessels in flood-prone areas in
northwest Bangladesh, where recurrent flooding, even from routine rain
events, regularly renders schools, hospitals, and libraries inaccessible. The
boats, which are tethered to particular places and function as local
institutions, are large and steady enough to host classrooms and health
clinics during all but the stormiest weather. Children are not their only
beneficiaries. The boats are staging grounds for all kinds of adult education,

---

including courses for literacy, sustainable agriculture, and, more urgently,
disaster survival. They’re places where women build closer ties to one
another, learn when and where to evacuate with their children, and even
how to swim. Traditional security experts don’t always appreciate the value
of these programs, but scholars and international relief agencies believe
they’re among the most effective ways to help women and children survive
the region’s dangerous monsoons and floods.
Poor, developing nations are not the only places experimenting with
“floating infrastructure.” In 2017, several leading international design firms
proposed building floating work and residential space in the bay water that
runs along Silicon Valley. That same year, the New York Times reported on
the rise of “seasteading” in areas threatened by rising sea levels—“Floating
Cities, No Longer Science Fiction, Begin to Take Shape,” teased one
headline—and high-profile investors including Pay Pal founder Peter Thiel
are betting on the concept.
Leaders in the international development field may not yet appreciate
the importance of these climate-driven programs, but Bangladeshi leaders
credit grassroots education projects like floating schools with dramatically
reducing mortality during extreme weather crises. Social infrastructure is
not a substitute for well-designed hard infrastructure, but it’s just as
important. In Bangladesh, as in so many low-lying, developing nations
facing dire threats from climate change, it’s the best way for communities to
protect themselves.

In recent years, as ferocious hurricanes, searing heat waves, and raging
wildfires have threatened life and destroyed valuable property in the
world’s most affluent societies, governments that long denied or delayed
action on global warming have begun to act more like Bangladesh. It was
easy to ignore remote and abstract ecological transformations like sea-level
rise and warmer temperatures. But today, climate change is coming to mean
something specific, and scary. “Even on a clear day a hundred years from

---

now, the water will be where it is today under storm-surge conditions,” says
Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist at Columbia University whose 2009 report on
climate risks to New York City contains eerily accurate predictions about
what would happen to the city’s infrastructure during a major storm surge.
Sandy, for instance, seemed to be following Jacob’s script. “We can’t just
rebuild after every disaster,” Jacob told me. “We need to pro-build, with a
future of climate change in mind.”
After Sandy, President Barack Obama created a special initiative to
support such pro-building in new infrastructure projects, an international
design competition called Rebuild by Design. The competition was
managed by then–HUD secretary Shaun Donovan and funded with more
than $1 billion from a federal disaster relief bill. It attracted applications
from 148 multidisciplinary teams from around the world, 10 of which were
selected to participate in an intensive nine-month process of research,
outreach, and design. I served as the research director for the competition,
and by doing this job I came to appreciate both the inadequacy of our
current infrastructure systems and the social benefits that rebuilding them
could create.
I also got to work closely with leaders in an emerging field of practice
that links climate science, social science, urban planning, engineering, and
design, all in service of mitigating climate hazards and protecting
vulnerable people in an ever-warming world. These individuals are not just
changing the conversation about climate change; they’re changing the
systems we need to become more resilient to all variety of threats.
Of all Sandy’s targets, none was more densely packed with human,
economic, and cultural activity than Lower Manhattan, and none had such
vulnerable infrastructure either. The compact but crowded area below
Forty-Second Street includes some of New York City’s most impoverished
and most affluent neighborhoods, headquarters for several of the world’s
largest corporations, thousands of public housing units, and scores of
community organizations that serve those in need. It hosts global financial
institutions near the Battery, large hospitals near the East River, prestigious
art galleries in Chelsea and the West Village, and thousands of small
businesses throughout. It also has dozens of subway stops and an electrical
substation in the East Village that supplies power to most of downtown.

---

All of this flooded during Sandy, when fourteen-foot storm surges
topped the river’s edges in southern Manhattan, inundating the Lower East
and Lower West Sides. There was damage everywhere, but the East Side,
where there are thick concentrations of poor people in aging public housing
projects, and a cluster of large medical institutions, proved especially
vulnerable. Water from the East River poured into the lobbies and
basements of major hospitals, destroying years of research materials,
forcing emergency evacuations, and, after the storm, disrupting the region’s
chronic care network for more than a year. The surge destroyed systems that
provide power and communications to housing projects up and down the
Lower East Side, and it left thousands of vulnerable people stranded,
without water, electricity, or elevator service, on high floors of apartment
buildings. And, for good measure, the surge dumped wastewater and debris
onto the beaten-down asphalt that dominates the area’s public spaces,
including the South Street Seaport and the East River Greenway.
Safeguarding Lower Manhattan from future hurricanes and sea-level
rise is a major priority for New York City, but so too is improving the
quality of everyday life on the Lower East Side. The Rebuild by Design
competition yielded an extraordinary, multibillion-dollar proposal for doing
this, from Bjarke Ingels and the BIG Group. The plan, initially called the
BIG U because it wraps around Lower Manhattan in a U-shape, but now
known as the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project, relies on a series of
protective walls that double as sloped parklands and recreational facilities,
such as athletic fields, bike paths, and walkways. The project is divided into
three sections, each called a compartment, and the design ideas for each site
grew out of extensive consultations with local residents, businesses, and
community organizations.
The compartment on the Lower East Side, which is, for now, the only
funded part of the project, features lushly planted berms that protect
neighborhoods, infrastructure, and institutions near the river, while also
bridging them over the FDR Drive (an elevated highway that carries lots of
traffic up and down the East Side of Manhattan and currently cuts off
pedestrian access to the waterfront) to new gathering places and
commercial outlets on the water’s edge. The berms would block and absorb
storm surges when necessary, but their everyday function, as parklands and

---

---

recreational areas for inhabitants of an especially gray and unpleasant part
of an especially gray city, is at least equally as important.
Deployable walls, camouflaged as a series of murals that hang from
strong hinges on the ugly underside of the FDR Drive, are another key part
of the proposal. Most of the time, the structures, which will be designed by
local artists, operate as decorative ceiling panels that enhance the
experience of walking beneath the highway, which, lacking good
alternatives, thousands of residents do each day. Occasionally the walls will
flip down for other functions, such as blocking out wind and framing space
for a protected seasonal food market. And when hurricanes hit, the walls
become hard barriers, reducing the odds that floodwaters will devastate the
area again.

Staten Island, a sprawling barrier island at the mouth of the Hudson River
and directly exposed to the Atlantic, also needs better protection. Residents
there have endured repeated, occasionally devastating flooding since the
late 1950s, when the government began building the Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge, expanding infrastructure, and encouraging people to settle there.
Although Staten Island has a smaller population than any other New York
City borough, it had the greatest number of fatalities during Sandy.
Tremendous waves crashed into its low-lying neighborhoods, eviscerating
homes, carrying cars off the roads, and penetrating communities blocks
from the ocean, where no one expected a deluge.
You can’t wall off an ocean, but you can reduce the energy of its waves
and protect against catastrophic flooding. Doing this, while also promoting
social life and encouraging collective climate action in vulnerable
waterfront communities, is the core goal of Living Breakwaters, a creative
plan to build natural infrastructure—rocky sloped walls full of finfish,
shellfish, and lobsters—that cuts the risk of flood damage and erosion on
the south shore of Staten Island. The landscape architecture firm Scape,
which is directed by the pioneering designer Kate Orff, leads the project.

---

But it also includes a team of climate scientists, marine ecologists,
educators, and advocates for social infrastructure.
Instead of building a massive barrier, Scape’s plan acknowledges the
inescapable fact that water is coming and uses nature’s tools to protect
vulnerable people and places from dangerous floods. It also does something
bigger: since a robust climate policy agenda will require citizens, and not
just scientists, to understand the risks of global warming, Living
Breakwaters includes an ambitious educational program to teach how
ecological citizenship can mitigate future climate threats.
Scape’s way of shoring up Staten Island’s social infrastructure involves
using environmental educational hubs as everyday cultural centers,
promoting social cohesion around a shared set of projects and concerns. The
plan, which also introduces a curriculum codesigned with the New York
Harbor School and the Billion Oyster Project, is designed to bring
thousands of students into marine restoration projects and, through them,
help families and communities see how our fate is linked to the fate of our
oceans. It also links people in the area to one another through cultural
programs and beachfront activities—such as planting oyster reefs and
observing local wildlife—so that they’ll know who needs support, and how
to help them, when the next big storm hits.
Both Living Breakwaters and the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project
await final environmental reviews and regulatory approvals, and there’s
much that could go wrong. Living Breakwaters requires working in or
around areas where the city, the state, and the US Army Corps of Engineers
have other water projects, and it could get tangled in a web of conflicting
priorities and jurisdictional disputes. From the beginning, critics have
warned that cutting costs to meet a budget in the final stages of the East
Side Coastal Resiliency Project implementation process could reduce the
verdant bridging berms into an ugly and imposing seawall, exactly the kind
of project that Rebuild by Design was supposed to reject.
But at this stage the federal, state, and city governments continue to
support the innovative projects, and other cities, in the United States and
around the world, have already taken inspiration from the plans. If the East
Side Coastal Resiliency Project and Living Breakwaters are built close to

---

---

their designs, they will change the way we conceive of climate adaptation,
putting social infrastructure at the core.

Unless we dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, however, climate
adaptation will be nothing more than a temporary survival strategy, one
fated to make environmental injustice a more serious problem within and
across nation-states. Consider, again, Houston: Many of its neighborhoods
already benefit from social infrastructure that fosters cohesion and support
in disasters. Since it’s one of the world’s wealthiest cities, embedded in one
of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful nations, it has resources to
build better hard infrastructure for flood protection too. But as long as
Houston continues its current trajectory, with an economy rooted in oil and
gas and a city plan that promotes continuous sprawl, single-family homes,
and dependence on private automobiles, the great metropolis will wind up
fueling global warming and increasing its own risk. Houston, like all the
world’s cities, needs to become more compact, dense, and amenable to
walking and biking, which means building taller, multiunit residential
towers in central places. It needs more trees to absorb carbon and cool the
air, more urban parks and greenways where people can enjoy themselves
without using their cars. It needs to replace its seemingly endless span of
paved, impermeable roadways that channel floodwater to low-lying areas.
All of this means building better social infrastructure, which is no easy
project in a city that famously lacks zoning ordinances, and rebuilding after
Harvey is the ideal moment to begin.
For inspiration, Houston can look to a nearby city that’s also recovering
from a catastrophic hurricane: New Orleans. In 2010, city leaders
developed New Orleans 2030, a master plan that went far beyond what
people urgently wanted in the wake of Katrina: flood protection, adaptation,
and climate security. The city faced major challenges. Its population,
455,000 before Katrina hit in 2005, had fallen to 208,000 in 2006 and was
only 348,000 in 2010. (It was 391,000 as of 2016.) With far fewer children,

---

New Orleans had no choice but to close some of its public schools. The new
plan called for repurposing and redeveloping the large institutional
buildings as community centers, art studios, small business incubators, and
apartments. That wasn’t the only major change. Before the flood, in 1999,
the city plan promised support for regional commercial development on
major roadways and intersections, places where big-box stores could fit
comfortably and parking would be abundant. After Katrina, as citizens and
civic groups grew more concerned about climate change, that idea was
discarded in favor of pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use commercial and
residential developments that encouraged local social activity on sidewalks
and streets. New Orleans was already famous for its ebullient,
neighborhood-based public culture. Now it would double down.
In highly segregated cities, social polarization is a potential downside of
intense neighborhood culture, and although New Orleans has a long, unique
history of ethnic and racial mixing, its residential areas are sharply divided
by race and class. To combat that problem, New Orleans 2030 features a
social infrastructure that facilitates pedestrian circulation across the city,
and helps with climate mitigation and flood protection too. The Lafitte
Greenway, which opened in 2015 around the historic Carondelet Canal, is a
three-mile, multiuse trail and park linking six diverse neighborhoods,
including affluent areas like Mid-City and Lakeview, the African American
Tremé, a cluster of Section 8 housing buildings, the bustling French
Quarter, and the bayou. The path is lined with bioswales (plants that absorb
storm water, silt, and pollution) and native trees, and walkways run into a
string of neighborhood parks. In just a few years, the greenway has become
one of the city’s most popular sites for leisure and recreation. It has also
helped revive a formerly moribund cycling culture. New Orleans had 11
miles of bikeways when Katrina hit; today it has 115. Since the greenway
opened, New Orleans has shot into the top American cities for bike
commuters. It currently ranks fifth in the per capita population that cycles to
work, and it promises to move further up the list once it launches its bike-
share program. If political officials need evidence that social infrastructure
can entice people out of their cars and into transit options that reduce our
carbon footprint and curb global warming, New Orleans is a fine place to
look.

---

The Lafitte Greenway is a modest project, with an initial budget of
$9 million, but it has already expanded to incorporate new playgrounds, dog
runs, community gardens, and athletic fields that branch off the pathway.
Today, community groups in neighborhoods just beyond its reach are
pushing to build new paths into the corridor. Commercial establishments,
including bars and restaurants, are opening on the trail and all around the
periphery. Real estate development is following, and in the process helping
New Orleans become more walkable and compact. If there’s a downside to
this infrastructure project, it’s that too much upscale development could
generate additional waves of gentrification and displacement. But the early
signs are that residents all along the greenway are embracing the project. It
makes their daily lives healthier and more enjoyable, and it makes the city
more sustainable too.
More important, the Lafitte Greenway, with its storm protection systems
and clean transit networks, exemplifies the kind of new infrastructure
project that we will need to survive climate change. It blends climate
adaptation with mitigation while also improving the quality of urban life,
regardless of the weather, and giving the people fortunate enough to be near
it a way to connect. The water is coming. With the right kind of social
infrastructure, we may well get through it without building an ark.

## CONCLUSION

## Before We Lift the Next Shovel

In February 2017, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a
six-thousand-word open letter on the site he created. It’s addressed “To our
community,” and within a few sentences Zuckerberg asks his company’s
two billion or so users a straightforward question: “Are we building the
world we all want?”
The answer was self-evident.
If there’s a core principle in Zuckerberg’s worldview, it’s that human
beings make progress when we break down social and geographic divisions
and form larger, more expansive moral communities. “History is the story
of how we’ve learned to come together in ever greater numbers—from
tribes to cities to nations,” he claims. “At each step, we built social

---

infrastructure like communities, media and governments to empower us to
achieve things we couldn’t on our own.”
As CEO of one of the world’s most profitable and fastest-growing
corporations, Zuckerberg is generally cautious about making explicitly
partisan statements. But in the 2016 campaign he had denounced the
“fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as
others,” and a few weeks before posting his letter, he condemned Trump’s
executive order to ban immigrants from selected Middle Eastern nations:
“We should…keep our doors open to refugees and those who need help.
That’s who we are.” Zuckerberg’s letter, released during this unusually
public conflict with the new president, was meant to be Facebook’s new
mission statement as well as its blueprint for how to rebuild society in a
tumultuous, potentially authoritarian age.
“In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is
develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global
community that works for all of us,” he explained. Facebook, as Zuckerberg
sees it, is uniquely capable of bridging our social divisions. He recognizes
that, where they remain popular, churches, sports teams, unions, and other
civic groups deliver the social benefits that he wants Facebook to generate:
“They provide all of us with a sense of purpose and hope; moral validation
that we are needed and part of something bigger than ourselves; comfort
that we are not alone and a community is looking out for us; mentorship,
guidance and personal development; a safety net; values, cultural norms and
accountability; social gatherings, rituals and a way to meet new people; and
a way to pass time.” Yet he also argues that, in these dark times marked by
the “striking decline” of group membership since the 1970s, “online
communities are a bright spot.” At Facebook, Zuckerberg writes, “our next
focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community—for
supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement,
and for inclusion of all.”
Zuckerberg’s first promise is to develop better algorithms for predicting
which kinds of “very meaningful” Facebook communities (those that
“quickly become the most important part of our social network
experience”) would benefit its users, and to “help connect one billion
people with meaningful communities, that can strengthen our social fabric.”

---

His second promise is to “expand groups to support sub-communities,”
people who care about the same sports teams, television shows, video
games, and the like. His third is to “reinforce our physical communities by
bringing us together in person to support each other.”
Zuckerberg tells readers how Facebook’s social infrastructure will
promote health and safety, and again it involves getting people to do more
things online. Using artificial intelligence, the company will “help our
community identify problems before they happen.” He says that Facebook
has “built infrastructure to show Amber Alerts,” that it has “built
infrastructure to work with public safety organizations,” and “built
infrastructure like Safety Check so we can all let our friends know we’re
safe and check on friends who might be affected by an attack or natural
disaster.”
Zuckerberg wants to reinvigorate democracy. He sees Facebook as a
tool for helping people vote, speak out, and organize. He envisions it
generating new ways for people around the world to participate in collective
governance, new ways to achieve openness, transparency, and, more
ambitiously, a renewed commitment to the common good.
Zuckerberg’s rhetoric is as grandiose as we’d expect from a man whose
company has billions of active users and a market value around
$500 billion. But the vision of social infrastructure that he endorses is
flimsy. Social media, for all their powers, cannot give us what we get from
churches, unions, athletic clubs, and welfare states. They are neither a
safety net nor a gathering place. In fact, insider accounts from Silicon
Valley tech companies establish that keeping people on their screens, rather
than in the world of face-to-face interaction, is a key priority of designers
and engineers. Facebook can, and occasionally does, help us find people
with whom we build relationships in real life, and perhaps someday it will
improve. In early 2018, Zuckerberg posted an acknowledgment that
Facebook “is crowding out the personal moments that lead us to connect
more with each other,” and he pledged to change the site even if it meant
that “the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement
will go down.” But no matter how the site’s designers tweak Facebook
content, the human connections we need to escape danger, establish trust,

---

and rebuild society require recurrent social interaction in physical places,
not pokes and likes with “friends” online.
It was disingenuous for Zuckerberg to claim that Facebook, like the
social organizations that he sees declining, promotes the kinds of values,
cultural norms, and systems of accountability that democracy requires.
Because when Zuckerberg wrote his open letter he already knew what
Facebook would not acknowledge until the US Congress effectively forced
a confession: During the most divisive and consequential presidential
election in recent history, Russian propagandists had used Zuckerberg’s so-
called social infrastructure to buy more than three thousand fake news ads
that reached at least ten million people. Thanks to Facebook’s technology,
the Russians—as well as alt-right organizations intent on spreading
misinformation inside the United States—could target their campaign to
swing-state voters. The organizations behind these ads did not merely want
to manipulate citizens and suppress turnout in communities likely to
support the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. They also aimed to sow
social divisions that would undermine Americans’ faith in democracy, and
they made similar efforts to wreak havoc in open societies around the
world. Facebook, whose algorithms amplify extreme, emotional messages
that stoke polarization and downplay more nuanced, deliberative posts, was
ideally suited for the job.
Since the 2016 election, Facebook and other tech companies have made
major investments in a lobbying campaign to stave off regulations that
would require them to disclose who is purchasing political advertising.
Zuckerberg’s team has portrayed the Russians’ ability to manipulate social
media for their political project as a technical problem that can be fixed
with engineering. More fundamentally, however, the election and the
subsequent congressional hearings with high-tech leaders revealed that the
companies that manage large-scale, for-profit communications
infrastructures are set up to prioritize generating revenue above delivering
public goods. Publicly traded corporations, including Facebook, are legally
required to maximize shareholder value, and while some CEOs define value
expansively, most focus on the bottom line.
Zuckerberg surely didn’t want his company to facilitate malevolent
intervention into the democratic process; and yet, as investigative reporters

---

---

discovered, Facebook’s advertising salespeople and engineers made great
efforts to help domestic political advocacy groups, including the anti-
Clinton, anti-Islam organization Secure America Now, reach their targeted
audiences. No matter their political preferences, Facebook employees had a
simple reason for doing this: Winning advertisers is their job. Promoting
democracy isn’t. During the 2016 campaign, Facebook made a negligible
profit from accepting paid political ads from groups associated with the
Russian government and the alt-right. American democracy, and the global
community that Zuckerberg says he is committed to building, suffered a
devastating loss.

There is another community that has suffered devastating losses since
Facebook and other big tech companies began setting up shop in the Bay
Area: poor, working-class, and middle-class residents of the region, who
have been steadily priced and crowded out. Gentrification hardly seems like
a strong enough word to describe what’s happened in the Bay Area during
the historic tech boom. Housing costs in San Francisco are so outrageously
high that few members of the middle class can afford to live there. Research
by the University of California’s Urban Displacement Project shows that
47 percent of all the region’s census tracts, and 60 percent of low-income
households, are in neighborhoods at risk of or already experiencing
displacement or gentrification pressures. San Francisco’s African American
population is declining sharply, while low-income and middle-class families
are moving farther from urban centers and spending ever more time on long
commutes. The impact is apparent everywhere. There’s heavy traffic on
local roads and freeways, insufficient parking on city streets and at malls. A
few decades ago, Silicon Valley was full of pristine suburbs that provided a
high quality of life; today it is terribly congested and on the brink of being
overrun.
For all their emphasis on software engineering, there’s no question that
companies like Facebook, Google, and Apple appreciate the value of real

---

social infrastructure: the physical places that shape our interactions. Their
campuses are stunning, with verdant gardens, juice bars and gourmet
restaurants, manicured athletic fields and exercise facilities, hair salons, day
care centers, theaters, libraries, cafés, and ample space for social gatherings,
both indoors and out. These are private social infrastructures, there for the
pleasure and convenience of first-tier staff members whose color-coded
badges grant them access, but, crucially, not for the low-level temps and
contractors who cook and clean in the same organization, and not for
neighboring residents or visitors. These expensive, carefully designed social
infrastructures work so well for high-level tech employees that they have
little reason to patronize small local businesses—coffee shops, gyms,
restaurants, and the like—that might otherwise benefit far more from the
presence of a large employer.
Some companies have made modest efforts to improve the surrounding
social infrastructure. Google, for instance, built new soccer fields, gardens,
and bike paths around its headquarters in Mountain View, and Sergey Brin,
a cofounder, subsidizes leases for proprietors of small shops that cater to
families in properties he owns nearby. In July 2017, Facebook, facing
pressure from employees who were exhausted from long commutes and
from neighbors in East Menlo Park who’d grown fed up with congestion
around its growing campus, proposed developing a campus extension. The
“village,” designed by star architect Rem Koolhaas’s firm, OMA New York,
would link new offices with housing, retail outlets, parkland, and, crucially,
a grocery store for an area that, despite Facebook’s massive presence,
remains a food desert. Zuckerberg hopes to open the extension by 2021, but
—if the comments they’ve made in public forums and news articles are any
indication—residents of East Menlo Park would prefer that the municipal
government slow down and address their concerns first. Why, they ask,
should the city approve Facebook’s expansion without securing funds to
renovate their dilapidated schools, parks, and fields? How will the city
mitigate the traffic and pollution that seem certain to increase as thousands
more employees come into the area? What can Facebook do to make sure
that its plans are good for the community, and not just the company? Does
Facebook really care?

---

Facebook’s attempt to win over local support for its new developments
has been unsuccessful in part because the company has done so little to
improve the local social infrastructure since it moved into Menlo Park.
Although people who purchased houses before the tech companies arrived
would surely profit if they wanted to sell and move out of the region, rising
real estate prices don’t do anything to improve the lives of residents and
workers. For them, the biggest daily impact of being close to corporations
like Facebook is being stuck in traffic, often behind the private buses that
shuttle workers to and from campus. The buses, perhaps more than
Facebook’s famous blue and white logo, have become the most potent
symbol of what tech leaders are doing all over the Bay Area: building
private social infrastructures that help their companies prosper on top of
public ones that urgently need repair, and telling everyone in “the
community” to trust that it’s for the common good.
It’s not surprising that Silicon Valley titans are so intent on persuading
the public that the things they do to advance their corporate interests are
actually meant to make the world more peaceful, just, and humane. The
executives who run oil, finance, and automobile companies have said the
same kinds of things for decades. But it’s off-putting to see Zuckerberg
doing it so brazenly, since he built Facebook on the idea that social media
require openness and transparency. At this point, we all know what the
game is, and it’s insulting to be told that each new revenue-generating
Facebook product—the messaging app for children under age thirteen, for
instance—is really on offer because the company wants society to flourish.
I don’t doubt that, in addition to his interest in accumulating more
wealth and power, Zuckerberg has good intentions. He has championed
experiments that provide a “universal basic income” in communities where
decent-paying jobs are becoming scarce. In 2015, he and his wife, Priscilla
Chan, set up the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (a limited liability company
rather than a traditional foundation, which requires owners to give away
5 percent of the endowment every year and cannot invest in profit-seeking
ventures). The couple has pledged to donate 99 percent of their shares in
Facebook to the charity; at the time of the announcement, analysts
estimated the value of these shares at $45 billion over their life span. Chan
and Zuckerberg have also pledged to give $3 billion in the next decade to a

---

project that aims to “cure all disease” by the end of the twenty-first century.
They’ve already opened the Chan Zuckerberg Bio Hub, a research center in
San Francisco where engineers, computer scientists, chemists, biologists,
and other scientists from Stanford, the University of California, Berkeley,
and the University of California, San Francisco, are collaborating on a
variety of health-related projects. They’ve given $24 million to a start-up
that trains software developers in Africa and made a $50 million investment
in a learning app designed to help children in India.
These are admirable projects, and together they may well save or
improve millions of lives. But today, as Zuckerberg’s open letter to
Facebook users acknowledges, there are urgent problems in the world—
from isolation and polarization to runaway inequality in health, education,
and the capacity to deal with climate change—and many of them are visible
in Silicon Valley’s own backyard. It’s naive to claim that better algorithms
and meaningful Facebook community groups will help us make any real
advances on these issues. Despite—or maybe precisely because of—the fact
that we spend so much time on screens and the Internet, we desperately
need common places where people can come together, participate in civil
society, and build stronger social bonds. Unless we invest in real social
infrastructures, the answer to Zuckerberg’s question—“Are we building the
world we all want?”—will remain decidedly no.
Neither Zuckerberg nor any other twenty-first-century corporate leader
bears individual responsibility for the sorry state of our social infrastructure.
But it’s worth noting that in earlier historical moments, when a small
number of business leaders made enormous fortunes while much of society
struggled to satisfy basic human needs, great philanthropists used their
wealth and power to build places that created opportunities for everyone
and that didn’t double as profit-seeking ventures. Consider the railway and
steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. He was a true “robber baron,” who
allowed managers to hire hundreds of armed Pinkerton detectives and
violently suppress unionized workers during the Homestead strike, and
lobbied fiercely against the income tax and other government efforts to
address inequality. Yet Carnegie gave away so much of his fortune that the
Philanthropy Roundtable, the leading network of charitable donors in the

---

United States, says he “may be the most influential philanthropist in
American history.” His contributions, they write, are “without peer.”
Entrepreneurs have amassed vast fortunes in the new information
economy, and yet no one has come close to doing what Carnegie did
between 1883 and 1929, when he funded construction of 2,811 lending
libraries, 1,679 of which are in the United States. Today, the Carnegie
libraries are set in ordinary residential neighborhoods throughout the world,
and they continue to be powerful sources of uplift. Carnegie’s extraordinary
commitment to American cities and communities is worth recalling, as are
the principles that motivated him. An immigrant himself, Carnegie believed
that anyone who had access to culture and education could achieve success
in the United States. He knew firsthand that not everyone could be a student
here. As a child in Pittsburgh, he had no choice but to work instead of going
to school. But a local merchant who lent books to children in his
neighborhood changed his life. “It was from my own early experience that I
decided there was no use to which money could be applied so productive of
good to boys and girls who have good within them and ability and ambition
to develop it, as the founding of a public library in a community,” Carnegie
wrote. He funded libraries to provide books, courses, social activities, and
relief from the pressures of daily life. He also wanted them to inspire
people, which is why so many of the original Carnegie libraries have high
windows, vaulted ceilings, and ornate designs. Building libraries “is but a
slight tribute,” Carnegie explained, “and gives only a faint idea of the depth
of gratitude which I feel.”
I appreciate the appeal of “moon shots,” the projects with goals like
space colonization and immortality that today’s leading philanthropists,
particularly those in the tech industry, pursue with such passion. But too
many of these initiatives seem motivated by hubris and narcissism rather
than concern for “boys and girls who have good within them and ability and
ambition to develop it.” It’s hard to find Carnegie’s sense of goodwill and
civic-mindedness in today’s Silicon Valley, where the entire industry
depends on a technology developed by the government—the Internet—and
a publicly funded communications infrastructure. Like Zuckerberg,
corporate leaders are always happy to experiment with projects that
promote the common good while raising their market capitalization. But

there are limits to how much they can accomplish by giving while taking.
How much more wealth do they need to accumulate before they are ready
to help?
It’s particularly puzzling that so few corporate leaders from the
information economy, including those in technology and finance, have
supported the library, the primary institution promoting literacy and
providing Internet access to those who would otherwise have no way to get
online. There are exceptions. In the 1990s, Microsoft and the Gates
Foundation, which stands out for its investments in schools, health centers,
and other vital social infrastructures, donated $400 million to help libraries
across the United States establish Internet connections. In 2008, Stephen
Schwarzman, the Wall Street financier and CEO of the Blackstone Group,
gave $100 million to the New York Public Library, which in turn named its
landmark building on Fifth Avenue after him. And in 2017, the Stavros
Niarchos Foundation gave $55 million to renovate Manhattan’s major
circulating library, just across from the Schwarzman building. These are
extraordinary contributions, but they’re just a drop in the bucket compared
with what cities around the world need in order to rebuild the woefully
outdated branch libraries that, despite their old age, still uphold
neighborhoods and communities, helping those who aspire to a better life or
just need companionship to get through the day.
Today, as cities and suburbs reinvent themselves, and as cynics claim
that government has nothing good to contribute to that process, it’s
important that institutions like libraries get the recognition they deserve.
After all, the root of the word “library,” liber, means both “book” and
“free.” Libraries stand for and exemplify something that needs defending:
the public institutions that—even in an age of atomization and inequality—
serve as bedrocks of civil society. Libraries are the kinds of places where
ordinary people with different backgrounds, passions, and interests can take
part in a living democratic culture. They are the kinds of places where the
public, private, and philanthropic sectors can work together to reach for
something higher than the bottom line.
Not everyone believes this. In recent decades, political leaders driven by
the logic of the market have proclaimed that institutions like the library

---

don’t work any longer, that we’d be better off investing in new technologies
and trusting our fate to the invisible hand.
The influence of these arguments is reflected in the way we treat what
was once a sacred public institution. Today, libraries in most places are
starved for resources. Across the country, branch libraries have reduced
their hours and days of operation despite rising attendance and circulation,
leaving those with weekday obligations like work and school with fewer
opportunities to visit. They’ve downsized staff, cutting back on librarians as
well as on basic services like sanitation and information technology.
They’ve decreased the budget for new books, periodicals, and films.
In most municipalities, neighborhood libraries are in old, worn-down
facilities that don’t meet twentieth-century standards, let alone twenty-first-
century needs. In some cities, including affluent ones like Denver, the
situation is so dire that local governments have been shutting down entire
branches. In San Jose, just down the road from Facebook, Google, and
Apple, the public library budget is so tight that system leaders recently
prohibited users with overdue fees above $10 from borrowing books or
using computers. When the fees reach $50, the library sends the case to a
debt collection agency. Instead of lifting up patrons, the library becomes yet
another institution that’s holding them down.
In New York City, global epicenter of culture and finance, the fight over
what to do with branch libraries has much higher stakes. The current battle
pits the library’s executive leadership, which is anxious about the system’s
declining fortunes, against local patrons who fear they’ll lose neighborhood
branches and specialized services if the system consolidates.
They have good reason to fear. According to the Center for an Urban
Future, the New York Public Library system has more than $1.5 billion in
construction needs—just for repairs and maintenance on existing facilities.
In Manhattan, the city sold land and air rights to the beloved Donnell
Library, across from the Museum of Modern Art on Fifty-Third Street, in
2007, for $59 million, promising to open a new facility within the new
luxury hotel and condo building there by 2011. It opened in summer 2016,
and while some appreciated its twenty-first-century design, both users and
critics complained that it felt soulless, more like an Apple Store than a
community hub.

In Brooklyn, where estimates for repairing the borough’s sixty branch
buildings top $300 million, the public library board tried to sell the historic,
heavily used Pacific Library branch in Boerum Hill to real estate
developers, only to withdraw the offer because of fierce neighborhood
protests. Soon after, the board voted to sell the land rights to the Brooklyn
Heights Library for $52 million, so that another developer could build a
thirty-six-story, mixed-use tower that, as in Manhattan, would include a
new library, considerably smaller than the current one. Once again,
neighbors protested, but this time for naught. The Brooklyn Borough Board
approved the sale in early 2016.
The fiscal crisis in the New York Public Library has had more
immediate consequences too. Between 2008 and 2013, New York City cut
the library system’s operating funds by $68 million, resulting in a
24 percent drop in staff hours. A century ago, most branch libraries were
open seven days a week; today, most are closed on Sundays, which have
always been popular days for immigrants, blue-collar workers, and families
to visit. No other institution can fill the void.
Sometimes the market provides partial substitutes. In the Bronx, for
instance, the Baychester Barnes & Noble long served as the borough’s only
bookstore, open seven days and eighty-eight hours a week (from 9 a.m. to
10 p.m. Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday), with
ample time for working parents who could come only on evenings and
children who could come only on weekends. The store opened in 1999 and
immediately began to operate as a crucial social infrastructure, a place
where people were welcome to linger and enjoy one another’s company
even if they didn’t make a purchase.
Bookstores, large and small, have always been more than just retailers.
For centuries—and in the United States, since 1745, when the Moravian
Book Shop opened in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania—they’ve served as vital
gathering places where we can reliably find other people who love good
stories and new ideas, as well as shop owners or clerks who delight in
helping patrons find literature that they’ll love. They often provide special
programs for children and families, sponsor reading groups for grown-ups,
host author lectures and signings, and get involved in all variety of civic

---

affairs. They facilitate conversations among strangers, not only by
providing safe places but also by giving us so much to discuss.
As a professor and onetime graduate student, I surely rank among the
most dedicated bookstore customers. Yet I know people in a variety of
professions with fond and vivid memories of the time they spent in local
bookshops, and I’m hardly the only one who can track the course of my life
through the bookstores that I visited regularly. In Chicago, my parents and I
spent countless hours reading children’s books together at Barbara’s
Bookstore on Wells Street, and when I got old enough I went there solo,
seeking books (like Judy Blume’s adult fiction) that they might not have
approved. In Berkeley, where I went for graduate school in sociology, I
filled entire afternoons reading my way through the musty used books
stacks on the second and third floors of Moe’s on Telegraph Avenue. I was
never alone, either. A small world of students congregated there, using the
books as conversation starters, just as they do in small bookshops in Hyde
Park, Cambridge, Ann Arbor, and college towns around the world.
Fortunately, my girlfriend, and now wife, shared my passion for extended
browsing, and since she had enough income to buy new books, we spent
plenty of nights up the block at Cody’s as well.
We moved to New York City around the time my first book was
published, and I’ll never forget the pleasure of seeing it on the shelves of
the Barnes & Noble stores that saturated our neighborhood: the chain
operated four shops within a half mile of us, two on Avenue of the
Americas, one on Union Square, and the flagship, on Fifth Avenue and
Eighteenth Street. We were somehow regulars in all of them, and at the time
my wife told everyone that she could tell that, after so many years of
graduate student wages, I finally felt some financial security, because it was
the first time she’d seen me buy hardcover books. When our children were
little we made a habit of taking them to a place in the Flatiron District
called Books of Wonder, which, for good or ill, sold cupcakes and coffee
along with every picture book we wanted. As they got older we took them
on outings to places where they couldn’t help but notice that the world is
full of people who love books—and bookshops—as much as we do: the
Strand in Greenwich Village, Mc Nally Jackson in So Ho, Kepler’s during

---

---

our sabbatical year in Menlo Park. The visits could be expensive, but there
aren’t many more worthwhile ways of spending what we have.
These days, of course, there are cheaper and more efficient ways to buy
books (and everything else), and my family is hardly immune to their
appeal. No matter how much we love bookshops, we often opt to make
purchases on the Internet when we’re in a hurry or looking for a better
price. But inevitably, as ever more people choose online vendors over brick-
and-mortar establishments, bookshops close and social infrastructures
disappear. It happened in our neighborhood, when both of the Barnes &
Noble shops on Avenue of the Americas closed within a few years of each
other. One building became a chain grocery, but the other, on Eighth Street,
quickly went from being a vibrant community center to the site of a
homicidal hate crime, which took place in front of the shuttered building
just months after it closed. In late 2016, Barnes & Noble, facing a steep rent
increase, announced that it would close its Baychester operation too, to be
replaced by a Saks Off 5th discount outlet. The change left 1.5 million
people, in a borough whose former residents include the celebrated writers
Mark Twain, Edgar Allan Poe, Cynthia Ozick, and Richard Price, without a
social infrastructure that the community had enjoyed for as long as anyone
can remember. A Barnes & Noble executive pledged that the company was
“committed to working diligently with local officials to reopen a store in the
Bronx in the future.” I very much hope they do.

In an era characterized by urgent social needs and gridlock stemming from
political polarization, it is tempting to give up on government and reach
almost desperately for new solutions—many in our time tech-driven,
experimental, and privatized, based on faith that the market will deliver
what we want and need. For communities without grocery stores, there’s
Amazon and Fresh Direct. For communities without enough corner stores,
two former Google employees have created Bodega, pantry boxes stocked
to meet local demand and programmed so that customers can make all their

---

purchases with a smartphone. “Eventually, centralized shopping locations
won’t be necessary,” says Paul Mc Donald, a cofounder, “because there will
be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you.”
This kind of ambition helped Mc Donald and his business partner, Ashwath
Rajan, secure angel investors at Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Dropbox,
as well as venture funding from some of Silicon Valley’s leading firms. It’s
not yet clear how many Bodegas will ultimately open, but no matter the
number, it’s worth noting that their proposal did not merely offend Latinos
and threaten the ethnic entrepreneurs whose industry they hope to “disrupt”;
it also sparked a backlash in communities throughout the United States,
because most people enjoy living near a small shop run by human beings
who can engage in occasional interaction or, when we’re in a hurry, just
smile and hand over our change.
Today, as our unending interactions with screens threaten to eclipse the
moments we share with other real people, communities everywhere are
voicing frustration with the limits of life online. Across the planet, people
are gaining a new appreciation for the physical places where they gather,
and it’s instructive to see the extraordinary things that can happen when
coalitions of citizens and philanthropic agencies commit to rebuilding the
kinds of social infrastructure that meet our contemporary needs.
Consider Columbus, Ohio, an emerging model for cities that are using
the library to help bridge social divisions and reanimate civic life. As the
state capital and home to the flagship Ohio State University, Columbus is a
fairly liberal city surrounded by conservative counties. Although it has high
levels of income and education overall, there are also pockets of deep
poverty. One recent study found that about 35 percent of preschoolers in the
city were “unready for kindergarten,” because they didn’t have age-
appropriate literacy skills, and another showed that 20 percent of
households lacked Internet access.
When the Great Recession of 2008 hit, Ohio state legislators cut
spending so deeply that Columbus city leaders feared their library system
was in jeopardy. Local branches reduced their hours and eliminated some
programs. They introduced a referendum and gave voters the chance to
decide whether to issue a property tax levy that would add $56 million per
year to the library’s budget. There aren’t many things that American voters

---

like less than property taxes, but the citizens of Columbus had become
passionate about their libraries. Nearly two hundred volunteers canvassed
the city to rally support for the initiative, leading town hall meetings,
running phone banks, and visiting civic groups. As it turned out, Columbus
voters didn’t need to be persuaded. By a two-to-one margin, they opted to
raise their own taxes. Soon after, the city restored full service in the main
building and all the local branches.
In 2016, the city renovated several branch libraries and the main library
as well, adding a wall of windows that looks over its seven-acre Topiary
Park, building new children’s rooms, improving the restroom facilities, and
creating better connections between the library and the park. That year, as
prosperous cities like San Jose cracked down on users with late fees,
Columbus took the opposite approach. As of January 1, 2017, the
metropolitan library stopped issuing fines for overdue books. “Removing
barriers to get more materials into the hands of more customers brings us
closer to achieving our vision of a thriving community where wisdom
prevails,” said Patrick Losinski, the library system’s CEO. So too do the
library’s numbers for circulation and in-person visits, which remain among
the highest in the nation per capita. The fact that the library recorded ninety-
five thousand visits to its homework help centers and nearly sixty thousand
participants in its summer reading groups is equally impressive. The people
of Columbus pay a price to get such strong social infrastructure, about $86
per year for a $100,000 home. But their behavior, at the ballot box and in
their libraries, shows how much they value what they get in return.
Libraries are only one form of vital social infrastructure. As we’ve seen,
many other public places and institutions play a pivotal role in the daily
lives of our neighborhoods and communities. On good days, they can
determine how many opportunities we have for meaningful social
interactions. On bad days, especially during crises, they can mean the
difference between life and death.
Although some important social infrastructures—the church, the café,
the bookstore, and the barbershop, among others—arise from the nonprofit
sector or the market, most of the vital places and institutions that we need to
rebuild are either funded or administered by the state. For decades, antitax
ideology has whittled down the public funds we need to build and maintain

---

all kinds of critical infrastructures. Generations ago, Americans took great
pride in the power and resilience of our ultramodern systems: majestic dams
and bridges, sprawling railways, reliable electric grids, clean waterworks,
verdant parklands from coast to coast. Today, these public goods are in
shambles. Instead of lifting us to reach for something greater, infrastructure
is now a source of shame and embarrassment. Our roads are crumbling. Our
trains are slow. Our airports, President Trump says, are “like third world
countries.” Dozens of cities, including Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia,
were recently caught cheating on water-quality tests to conceal potential
contaminants. Other cities, such as Flint, Michigan, have water so
poisonous that its dangers proved impossible to deny or conceal. Countless
cities and suburbs have social infrastructures that are comparably toxic, and
although the problems they generate unfold in slow motion, they put the
entire body politic at risk.
Debates about infrastructure innovation to better protect the public tend
to focus exclusively on technology, but designers throughout the world are
also innovating at a more fundamental level, transforming the key concepts
and building typologies that have long dictated what we develop. Take, for
instance, the “Polis Station,” the architect Jeanne Gang’s attempt to
transform the police station, a potent site and symbol of the racially divisive
security state, into an inclusive social infrastructure that fosters interaction
across group lines. Gang, who lives in Chicago and has deep ties to the city,
had observed fierce conflicts and rising distrust between the Chicago Police
Department and the minority communities they patrol so aggressively. Her
firm, Studio Gang, began conducting one-on-one and group interviews with
civic leaders and local officials in the neighborhoods where residents and
police were most estranged, and over time they organized gatherings where
youths, neighbors, community groups, and police officers could share their
concerns and desires. The process wasn’t easy. For more than two decades,
the police department had targeted, abused, and, as the city formally
acknowledged in 2015, secretly tortured suspects from the neighborhoods
where Gang was working. Officers were not the only ones with blood on
their hands. Although the city was hardly a war zone, violent crime
remained a major problem in many of its poor and segregated

---

neighborhoods. All of this made bringing the police and the people together
a difficult, sensitive task.
When the different sides came together, however, they expressed more
sympathy for each other’s predicament than Gang had expected, and more
interest in fixing things too. No one harbored fantasies that designing a new
building would solve the underlying problems of gun violence and racist
police abuse in Chicago, but there were other, more practical ways to
improve conditions on the streets. All of them involved enhancing the social
infrastructure. In neighborhood after neighborhood, both community
leaders and the police complained that there weren’t enough safe places
where teenagers and adolescents could play after school. The result was that
too many young people spent their afternoons milling around the sidewalks,
and though they usually weren’t causing trouble, the police had a hard time
figuring out how to maintain order and keep things safe. Gang and her
collaborators had been brainstorming design ideas that could help heal the
fractured social body, and in one of the gatherings they pitched something
novel: What if the police station became a community center, with
recreational facilities that young people could use without fear?
The concept was mind-bending: the station house has always been a
space of detention, inquisition, and intimidation—all the more so in
Chicago, where the threat of violence suffused the criminal justice system.
But Gang, a Mac Arthur “genius” whose accomplishments include building
the world’s tallest skyscraper designed by a woman (Aqua Tower, in
Chicago), was known for big, ambitious ideas. She’s also something of a
local celebrity, with a good relationship with Mayor Rahm Emanuel.
Emanuel, for his part, was eager to signal his commitment to police reform,
and officers were hoping to get residents involved in community
engagement. With interests aligned, they decided to build a prototype. As it
happens, the site they selected is in North Lawndale, whose social
infrastructure had not improved much since I spent time there studying the
effects of the heat wave, and where so many frail and vulnerable people
remained at risk of being isolated at home.
By the time Gang got approval to work in North Lawndale she’d
already developed the Polis Station concept, both in her practice and in her
architecture studios for students. In her grand vision, the Polis Station

---

---

would include many of the social infrastructures whose benefits we’ve seen
in previous chapters: a barbershop, a café and restaurant, a well-groomed
park and playground, a community garden, a gymnasium, and a communal
lounge with free Wi-Fi, all of which would be open to police officers and
citizens alike. In places with more land available, Gang’s designs include
police housing, libraries and computer labs, counseling centers, and places
of worship as well. The scope of the pilot project in North Lawndale was
far more limited. Gang had only a portion of a parking lot to play with, and
after listening to the people who lived in the area, she and her team decided
to transform it into a basketball court, set off from the street by a line of
trees and a handsome black metal fence. It’s a modest but successful
project. The court, painted green with an orange key, is well maintained,
with features like a smooth surface and an intact net that are hard to find on
the dangerous and dilapidated playgrounds nearby.
The station house basketball court is far from the most popular hangout
in North Lawndale, but it’s a place that local youths use often, and each
time they visit, the officers who work there become a little more familiar, a
little less threatening. Hopefully, the proximity will have the same effect on
police officers too. Chicago has not yet committed to developing any larger
Polis Station projects, yet other cities, including Baltimore, where Gang
redesigned the aquarium, are interested in experimenting with a more
expansive version of the concept, and New York City is discussing ways to
do something similar with fire stations. As in Chicago, civic leaders in these
municipalities recognize that architecture alone will not resolve the roiling
conflicts between the police and people of color. But it’s hard not to believe
that turning station houses into social infrastructures would be a productive
first step.

The president of the United States has pledged to rebuild the nation’s
infrastructure, and he’s left no question about his preferred first step: a wall.
There’s no simpler design idea, nothing easier to erect. But a wall is both

---

symbol and agent of the very divisiveness that weakens us. And, as many of
the political officials who are deeply concerned about illegal border
migration argue, it doesn’t even work.
Building walls is as unwise for climate policy as it is for immigration,
but unfortunately, the recent spike in deadly and expensive megastorms like
Sandy, Harvey, Irma, and Maria has inspired calls for crude coastal defenses
that aim to keep the water out. It’s true that, in some places, the irreversible
threat of rising seas and towering storm surges requires protecting
vulnerable people and places from inundation. But walls, as Kate Orff and
the team that designed Living Breakwaters for Staten Island understood,
can generate just as many problems as they prevent. They create a false
sense of security among those who live beyond them, and when they fail—
as the levees did in Hurricane Katrina, and the storm walls did in
Superstorm Sandy—few are ready for the deluge. Worse, sea gates and
barriers are limited tools that cannot be deployed in every area threatened
by global warming. They’re prohibitively expensive in most places, and
often futile. No matter how much we invest in efforts to block out the sea
and its tributaries, we will, inevitably, leave most of humanity exposed to
the elements.
In the densely populated, richly developed places where walls are
necessary—including cities like London, New Orleans, Rotterdam, and
Venice—policy makers and engineers are beginning to understand that
they’re by no means sufficient for climate resilience. That’s why Bjarke
Ingels and the group that proposed the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project
for Lower Manhattan rejected conventional designs for riverfront barriers
and invented “bridging berms” and parklands that bring people together as
effectively as they keep the water out. Like the Polis Station, it’s a radical
concept: a wall that includes rather than excludes, by inviting diverse
communities into a shared social space. Ingels’s design is an infrastructure
that is at once hard and soft, social and physical, meant to improve life for
everyone, every day, and also to protect against the deluge that all of us
fear.
Unfortunately, building hard and social infrastructure for climate
security is extraordinarily expensive, and most of the people and places that
are already being threatened by global warming lack the resources that

---

cities like New York, London, and Rotterdam have at their disposal.
Without substantial financial assistance from the wealthy nations whose
consumption has induced climate change, far more than they agreed to give
under the landmark Paris Agreement of 2016, poor and developing societies
will remain vulnerable to the lethal storms on the way. Today, this degree of
financial investment seems unlikely, but if it doesn’t happen soon
environmental inequalities will grow deeper and more consequential. The
injustice will spark anger and outrage that, like the changing climate and
treacherous weather, may well prove impossible to contain.
For now, at least, we can still control our destiny, and the infrastructure
we build will help determine how long that power lasts. Infrastructures, as
the eminent Princeton engineer David Billington writes, have a way of
symbolizing historic periods and expressing dominant ideas about how to
organize economy and society. Our railroads, highways, parks, and power
grids reveal who we were and what we aspired to become at the time that
we built them. The systems we build in coming years will tell future
generations who we are and how we see the world today. If we fail to
bridge our gaping social divisions, they may even determine whether that
“we” continues to exist.
Today, nations around the world are poised to spend trillions of dollars
on vital infrastructure projects that we need to get through the twenty-first
century and beyond. In the coming decades, as the systems we rely on to
support modern life become outdated and dysfunctional, the United States
will have no choice but to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in new
projects. In the decades after, it will spend even more. Before we lift the
next shovel, we should know what we want to improve, what we need to
protect, and, more important, what kind of society we want to create.
Political officials often claim that infrastructure projects are too
technical for citizens and civic groups to understand, let alone debate
meaningfully in a democratic forum. They ask that we trust engineers and
experts to manage things, which ultimately means letting authority flow
from the top down. But no president or cabinet member should have the
power to make unilateral decisions about how to rebuild the critical systems
that sustain us, and history shows that when this happens people rarely get
what they want. What we need, now more than ever, is an inclusive

---

conversation about the kinds of infrastructure—physical as well as social—
that would best serve, sustain, and protect us. We need a democratic process
that, like Rebuild by Design, solicits the active participation of people and
communities whose lives will be affected by the projects our public dollars
will support, one that respects local knowledge and wisdom as well as
technical expertise.
Rebuilding the infrastructure that can help solve the wicked problems
unfolding before us requires harnessing all kinds of collective intelligence
about the emerging vulnerabilities and possibilities in different cities and
regions. We need smart civil engineering to fix the critical networks that are
failing, no doubt, but we also need to engineer civility in societies—
including our own—that are at risk of breaking apart. It’s an enormous
undertaking, and, given our current conflicts and fissures, it’s going to be a
long-term project. But we cannot put it off any longer. The question is when
and where we will begin.

It’s been more than fifteen years since I moved out of Chicago, but I
attribute my interest in social infrastructure to the experience of growing up
and, later, doing immersive fieldwork in a great city of neighborhoods. My
childhood home in Old Town was directly across the street from the original
Menomonee Club, a nonprofit community organization that offered daily
after-school programs at virtually no cost. Old Town was gentrifying during
the 1970s and 1980s. The neighborhood, which was adjacent to both the
opulent Gold Coast and the impoverished Cabrini-Green housing projects,
was a site of conflict and occasional violence. I spent several afternoons per
week at both the club and the local park where its charismatic director,
Basil Kane, taught soccer to a diverse if not especially talented group of
city kids. For years I took for granted all the things I learned in this special
community center. Now I understand how much it shaped me.
If the ideas for this book come from Chicago, they developed in New
York City, and particularly at New York University. Since 2012, I’ve had
the great privilege of directing NYU’s Institute for Public Knowledge,
which is as real a community as any I’ve known in the academy, and a rare
place where scholars are rewarded for engaging in civic life. I thank Craig
Calhoun, IPK’s founding director, for creating such a special environment
and entrusting me with its future; Katy Fleming, the provost, and Cybele
Raver, the senior vice provost, for supporting it; and Jessica Coffey, Siera
Dissmore, and Gordon Douglas for sustaining it. I’ve also been fortunate to
work with a wonderful group of IPK fellows and students, including Hillary
Angelo, Max Besbris, Daniel Aldana Cohen, David Grazian, Max Holleran,
Liz Koslov, Caitlin Petre, Eyal Press, Alix Rule, Malkit Shosan, and
Matthew Wolfe. All of them contributed to this project.

---

So too did my collaborators in the Rebuild by Design competition. I
thank Henk Ovink, our visionary principal; Amy Chester, our indomitable
managing director; Tara Eisenberg, Lynn Englum, Juliet Gore, Idan Sasson,
and Raka Sen, from the RBD staff; and Judith Rodin, Nancy Kete, and Sam
Carter at the Rockefeller Foundation, our major funder. I’m equally grateful
to the architects, engineers, scientists, and designers whose brilliant ideas
for mitigating and adapting to climate change remain sources of inspiration.
Among the many whose work taught me what we can do with
infrastructure, and what infrastructure can do for us, are Matthijs Bouw,
Pippa Brashear, Bjarke Ingels, Klaus Jacob, Ellen Neises, Kate Orff,
Richard Roark, Laura Starr, Marilyn Taylor, David Waggonner, Claire
Weisz, and Gena Werth.
I owe a special debt to Carrie Welch and the staff of the New York
Public Library, who always kept their doors open and allowed me to camp
out in the Seward Park branch far longer than even the most dedicated
patron.
I wrote most of this book in one of academia’s sacred spaces: Stanford
University’s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. As a
social infrastructure, CASBS has just about everything, including private
writing studios, seminar rooms, miles of walking paths, bottomless cups of
Peet’s Coffee, and dining tables where the conversation has been nourishing
important books in the social sciences for more than sixty years. I thank the
Hewlett Foundation for helping to support my fellowship; Margaret Levi,
the brilliant director who has rebuilt CASBS for the twenty-first century;
and her dynamic staff. I’m grateful for the intellectual companionship of the
2016–17 fellows, including Brooke Blower, Ruth Chang, Mark Greif,
Andrew Lakoff, Deborah Lawrence, Terry Maroney, Allison Pugh, Jack
Rakove, Jesse Ribot, Brenda Stevenson, and Barry Zuckerman. I’m lucky
to have spent a year in their presence.
I’m also lucky to have met Julie Sandorf, president of the Charles H.
Revson Foundation and a fierce champion of public libraries. In early 2016,
Julie came to IPK and pitched a small, collaborative project on the state of
New York City’s branch libraries. I raised the bid, and came back to the
foundation with a proposal for what ultimately became a wide-ranging

---

project on libraries, social infrastructure, and civic life. Julie and her team
have been all in ever since, and I thank them for their tremendous support.
I’m humbled by the generosity of family, friends, and colleagues who
took time to read and comment on drafts of this manuscript. Thanks to
Gabriel Abend, Sasha Abramsky, Hillary Angelo, Aziz Ansari, Eric Bates,
Craig Calhoun, Daniel Aldana Cohen, Andrew Deener, Shamus Khan,
Andrew Lakoff, Margaret Levi, Sharon Marcus, Harvey Molotch, Eyal
Press, Patrick Sharkey, Rona Talcott, Iddo Tavory, Fred Turner, and Matt
Wray.
I owe a special debt to my research assistants from NYU, especially
Delaram Takyar, who collaborated on all aspects of this project, and Matt
Wolfe, who helped with the sections on social isolation and opioid
addiction. After I finished writing, Delaram, who’s now studying law and
social science, and Matt, who’s a sociologist as well as a journalist, teamed
up to fact-check the entire document. I can’t say I enjoyed that process, but
Delaram and Matt saved me from writing things I’d later regret. I hope
more social scientists subject their work to such scrutiny; it pays. Kiara
Douds, a Houston native, joined Delaram on a trip home immediately after
Hurricane Harvey. She connected us with the community at Wilcrest Baptist
Church so we could track their emergency relief efforts. Liz Koslov, Xiang
Lu, and Katie Donnelly spent countless days observing the social life of
neighborhood libraries. I couldn’t have written this book without their hard
work.
The same is true of the team at Crown Publishing. Amanda Cook, my
ace editor, began helping me see the potential in this book the moment she
read the proposal and didn’t stop offering smart, incisive suggestions until
the day we went to press. What a privilege it has been to work with her, and
what a pleasure it is to collaborate with someone who often understands
your ideas better than you do yourself. Zachary Phillips and Emma Berry
pitched in with helpful editorial feedback throughout the process. Maureen
Clark gave the manuscript a brilliant polish. Molly Stern’s enthusiasm
helped me through the final push. I couldn’t ask for more from a publishing
group. Thank you.
Tina Bennett and her assistant, Svetlana Katz, have always delivered
more than I could ask for from literary agents. They’re the best in the

---

business, and I’m lucky they’re in my corner, wherever I go.
It’s a good thing that my parents, Rona Talcott and Edward Klinenberg,
their spouses, Owen Deutsch and Anne Mc Cune, and my mother-in-law,
Carolyn Grey, love spending time with their grandchildren. I’m grateful for
the endless support they offered while I worked on this book project. And I
know that, now that it’s finished, the kids will still rather hang out with
them.
Kate Zaloom somehow manages to make time for all of us, and to help
me think through all things worth discussing, including each idea in this
book. Kate has always had a dazzling mind, but since she launched Public
Books a few years ago, she’s also developed a brilliant editor’s eye.
Spending my life with Kate makes everything I do better.
So too does spending time with my children, Lila and Cyrus, for whom
my love knows no limits. I dedicate this book to them. They deserve a
better world, and there’s nothing I want more than to help them build one.
We can only do it together.

Death and Life of Great American Cities (New York: Vintage, 1961). In recent years,
the eminent sociologist Elijah Anderson has been writing about what he calls “the
cosmopolitan canopy,” places where people from different backgrounds “not only
share space but seek out each other’s presence,” and occasionally forge relationships
as well. Anderson has conducted ethnographic fieldwork in several exemplary sites of
cross-group interaction, including Philadelphia’s Reading Terminal Market and
Rittenhouse Square, as well as in places marked by surveillance, suspicion, and social
segregation. See Elijah Anderson, The Cosmopolitan Canopy: Race and Civility in

“palaces for the people”: Not long after Andrew Carnegie began investing in libraries,
Joseph Stalin started his own campaign to build “palaces for the people” in Russia.
The most significant legacy of this project is a set of magnificent subway stations in
Moscow, each decorated with marble, grand chandeliers, mosaics, and sculptures, as
well as a number of housing complexes and social clubs for Soviet workers.

## CHAPTER ONE: A PLACE TO GATHER

strong incentives to stay away: A study by New York University’s Rudin Center for
Transportation ranks East New York last in Brooklyn for public transit access to jobs
within one hour, and among the worst in all of New York City. See Sarah Kaufman,
Mitchell Moss, Jorge Hernandez, and Justin Tyndall, “Mobility, Economic
Opportunity and New York City Neighborhoods,” November 2015,
https://wagner.nyu.edu/files/faculty/publications/Job Access Nov2015.pdf.
studies of isolation have found as well: See Neal Krause, “Neighborhood Deterioration and
Social Isolation in Later Life,” International Journal of Aging and Human
Development 36, no. 1 (1993): 9–38.
they lack compelling places to go: For the demographic data on aging, see Administration
on Aging, A Profile of Older Americans, 2015,
https://www.acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging%20and%20Disability%20in%20Ameri
ca/2015-Profile.pdf; and Renee Stepler, “Smaller Share of Women Ages 65 and Older

http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/02/18/smaller-share-of-women-ages-65-and-
older-are-living-alone/. On the historic rise of older people who live alone, see Eric
Klinenberg, Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living
Alone (New York: Penguin Press, 2012).
health hazards, including obesity and smoking: See Lisa Berkman and Thomas Glass,

Epidemiology, ed. Lisa Berkman and Ichiro Kawachi (New York: Oxford University
Press, 2000), 137–73, and John Cacioppo and William Patrick, Loneliness: Human
Nature and the Need for Social Connection (New York: W. W. Norton, 2008).
social infrastructure that we have: It’s worth noting that Robert Putnam includes a chapter
on branch libraries in a coauthored book about people and organizations that are
creating social capital. See Robert Putnam and Lewis Feldstein, with Don Cohen,
Better Together: Restoring the American Community (New York: Simon & Schuster,
      2003).
“major impact on their community”: See John Horrigan, “Libraries 2016,” Pew Research
Center, September 9, 2016, http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/09/09/libraries-2016/.
number of hours that people spend in libraries is up too: The data on library usage come
from David Giles, Branches of Opportunity, Center for an Urban Future, January
     2013, https://nycfuture.org/pdf/Branches_of_Opportunity.pdf. Giles reports that
between 2002 and 2011, New York City library program attendance was up 40
percent and program sessions were up 27 percent.

more isolated than ever: In a May 2012 Atlantic cover story, “Is Facebook Making Us
Lonely?,” Stephen Marche offers an unusually extreme claim about the state of our
disunion: “We suffer from unprecedented alienation,” he writes. “We have never been
more detached from one another, or lonelier. In a world consumed by ever more
novel modes of socializing, we have less and less actual society. We live in an
accelerating contradiction: the more connected we become, the lonelier we are.”

## CHAPTER TWO: SAFE SPACES

American public housing: The classic sociological account of Pruitt-Igoe is Lee Rainwater,
Behind Ghetto Walls: Black Families in a Federal Slum (New Brunswick, NJ:
Aldine Transaction, 1970). According to Rainwater, “Pruitt-Igoe condenses into one
    57-acre tract all of the problems and difficulties that arise from race and poverty and
all of the impotence, indifference and hostility with which our society has so far dealt
with these problems” (3).
90 percent of all units were occupied: The occupancy rate of 91 percent in 1957 is reported
in Roger Montgomery, “Pruitt-Igoe: Policy Failure or Societal Symptom,” in The
Metropolitan Midwest: Policy Problems and Prospects for Change, ed. Barry
Checkoway and Carl Patton (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 1985), 229–43.
“The corridors, lobbies, elevators, and stairs were dangerous”: Oscar Newman, Creating
Defensible Space (Washington, DC: US Department of Housing and Urban
Development, Office of Policy Development and Research, 1996), 10.
occupancy rate was 35 percent: Colin Marshall, “Pruitt-Igoe: The Troubled High-Rise That
Came to Define Urban America,” Guardian, April 22, 2015.
“Walking through Pruitt-Igoe”: Newman, Creating Defensible Space, 11.

Vintage, 1961), 35.
“With social variables constant”: Newman, Creating Defensible Space, 11.
“an accord about acceptable behavior”: Ibid., 25, 11–12.
1972 report, Defensible Space: The report was not limited to St. Louis. In New York City,
Newman found that residents of a low-rise public housing complex in Brownsville
experienced 34 percent fewer overall crimes and 74 percent fewer indoor crimes than
their neighbors in the nearby high-rise Van Dyke projects. He attributed this
difference solely to architecture, but subsequent research shows that the families who
lived in the two projects were not at all identical. The Van Dyke complex had far
more single mothers with multiple children, which meant there were more
unsupervised young people, an established risk factor for crime. See Fritz Umbach
and Alexander Gerould, “Myth #3: Public Housing Breeds Crime,” in Public Housing
Myths: Perception, Reality, and Social Policy, ed. Nicholas Dagen Bloom, Fritz
Umbach, and Lawrence Vale (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2015), 64–90.

a work of empirical science: In one fascinating study, a team of Dutch social scientists led
by Kees Keizer conducted a series of experiments to test whether adding graffiti and
litter to a small urban place would lead to more rule breaking. Although, as they
concede, “so far there has not been strong empirical support” for the broken windows
theory, signs of disorder did lead to more criminal behavior in their experiments.
They have called for more research to test the broken windows effect in other sites,
but it’s not easy to get permission to create disorder in real places, and to date we still
have only weak evidence that the theory holds. See Kees Keizer, Siegwart
Lindenberg, and Linda Steg, “The Spreading of Disorder,” Science 322, no. 5908
(2008): 1681–85.

long-term impact of retail outlets on neighborhood crime rates and found that while
alcohol-related shops and banks led to more crime, “third places,” such as coffee
shops and restaurants, made places safer. James Wo, “Community Context of Crime:

are more likely to be present in outdoor areas with trees than in those without trees,
concluding that natural elements in outdoor spaces can draw people outdoors and
make them feel more ownership over their surroundings. Rebekah Levine Coley,

for acculturation” in contemporary societies, and in recent years universities have
grown more central. Today, more than 20.4 million students (roughly 7.3 million in
two-year schools and 13.4 million in four-year schools), totaling about 6 percent of
the US population, enroll in American universities each academic year; more than 2
million, or 3.5 percent of the population, attend universities in the United Kingdom;
and about 1.7 million, or 5 percent of the population, go to college in Canada. Their
experiences are usually consequential, and often pivotal. For US college enrollments,
see the report Fast Facts from the National Center for Education Statistics,
https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372. For the United Kingdom, see

presence of gangs and guns: The USDA classifies food deserts as urban areas in which at
least five hundred people or one-third of the population lives more than half a mile
from a supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store. In rural areas, the distance
must be greater than ten miles. Delaram Takyar, an NYU graduate student and
research assistant for this book, calculated the percentage of low-income census tracts
by using data from the USDA Food Access Research Atlas.

another says it’s closer to $5,000 per year.
“neighborhood redevelopment projects”: The APHA report Improving Health and Wellness
Through Access to Nature is just one of several recent studies to show that treating
vulnerable places by developing accessible public green spaces and other social
infrastructure can do more to improve a community’s health and well-being than
targeting vulnerable individuals or groups. In the past decade, reams of published
research have established scientific evidence for long-standing and widely held
beliefs about the benefits of spending time in natural settings: It promotes social
cohesion. It encourages physical activity and makes people feel more energetic. It
lowers the risk of obesity and reduces stress, anxiety, anger, and sadness. It helps
prevent attention disorders in children. It quickens the pace of recovery in people
who are sick.

## CHAPTER FIVE: COMMON GROUND

“similarity begets friendship”: The classic account of “primary” and “secondary” groups
comes from Charles Cooley, Social Organization (New York: Charles Scribner’s
Sons, 1909), chap. 3. The quotes from Aristotle and Plato are from a classic
sociological article on homophily: Miller Mc Pherson, Lynn Smith-Lovin, and James
Cook, “Birds of a Feather: Homophily in Social Networks,” Annual Review of
Sociology 27 (2001): 415–44.

most major policy matters: The leading text on polarization from the 2000s is Morris
Fiorina, Samuel Abrams, and Jeremy Pope, Culture War? (New York: Pearson
Longman, 2005). In 1996, the sociologists Paul Di Maggio, John Evans, and Bethany
Bryson showed that there was little evidence to support widespread assertions that
Americans were growing more polarized. Why, then, did so many people perceive
rising fragmentation? They suggested several possible reasons, including that
Americans might be developing more intense political beliefs, that the media might
be airing more polarized opinions, and that people tended to romanticize the past and
forget how conflicted they used to be. See Paul Di Maggio, John Evans, and Bethany
Bryson, “Have Americans’ Social Attitudes Become More Polarized?,” American
Journal of Sociology 102, no. 3 (1996): 690–755.

processes visible in black barbershops in other protected spaces, including the tavern.
The classic study is Elijah Anderson’s A Place on the Corner (Chicago: University of
Chicago Press, 1978). Anderson writes: “Urban taverns and bars, like barbershops,
carryouts, and other such establishments, with their adjacent street corners and alleys,
serve as important gathering places for people of the ‘urban villages’ and ghetto areas
of the city. Often they are special hangouts for the urban poor and working-class
people, serving somewhat as more formal social clubs or domestic circles do for the
middle and upper classes” (1).

community organization on local life are Robert Sampson, Great American City:
Chicago and the Enduring Neighborhood Effect (Chicago: University of Chicago
Press, 2012), and Patrick Sharkey, Uneasy Peace: The Great Crime Decline, the
Renewal of City Life, and the Next War on Violence (New York: W. W. Norton, 2018).

10 percent black by 1990: Elmhurst-Corona was the site of a remarkable research project
led by the City University of New York anthropologist Roger Sanjek. Sanjek and his
team of research assistants began studying how community organizations shaped
group relations in the multiracial, multilingual neighborhood in the early 1980s. They
remained there, conducting fieldwork on everyday activities and closely observing
what happens in civic associations, churches, neighborhood events, and local political
meetings, until 1996. The main findings from the project are reported in Robert
Sanjek, The Future of Us All: Race and Neighborhood Politics in New York City

organizations in Elmhurst-Corona draws heavily on this work.

students Kiara Douds (who grew up in Houston and had friends at Wilcrest) and
Delaram Takyar, went to Houston to report on the collective response to Harvey.
They were at this church meeting, and they spent several days with the Wilcrest
Baptist Church congregation observing how it helped those affected by the storm.
and it didn’t happen at random: “Congregations have long been hyper-segregated,” writes
the sociologist Michael Emerson. “As of 2007 (our most recent data with such detail),
      85 percent of congregations in the United States were comprised of at least 90
percent of one group. As of 2010, just 4 percent of all congregations claimed to have
no racial majority.” See Michael Emerson, “A New Day for Multiracial

PALACES FOR THE PEOPLE
## A Reader’s Guide

## A Conversation with Eric Klinenberg

---

A Reader’s Guide for Palaces for the People by Eric
Klinenberg
 1. What is social infrastructure? How does it differ from what we usually think about
when we hear the word infrastructure?

 2. In chapter two, Klinenberg writes about public libraries and their importance to civic
and social life. What have your experiences been with public libraries? What role do
you think they play in your community?

 3. What is the “broken windows” theory? How does Klinenberg shift the focus of the
broken windows theory away from criminal behavior and toward social
infrastructure?

 4. In chapter three, Klinenberg discusses research that highlights the importance of
green spaces. What does this research show? Why do you think access to green space
has a positive effect on people?

 5. What are the best ways to promote a sense of community in a learning environment?
Do you think the small school movement has been able to or could achieve this?
Why or why not?

 6. What are some ways that colleges and universities can help bridge the “town/gown”
divide? Did you find efforts made by the universities that Klinenberg describes to be
compelling?

 7. What do you think are the most important causes and consequences of the opioid
epidemic?

 8. How can social infrastructure help ease the opioid crisis?

 9. What are ways that policies can help improve social integration and bridge social
divisions, especially along racial and class lines?

 10. What causes political polarization? Do you think it can be alleviated?

---

11. Klinenberg writes about how civic associations can help bring ordinary residents
together to work on neighborhood problems. What do you think about the role of
these associations? Have you had any personal experience with these types of civic
associations?

12. Klinenberg writes about how widespread social segregation is today. Are there
examples of social segregation that you have noticed in your daily life?

13. After Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in 2017, the community at Wilcrest Baptist
Church pulled together to help church members in the aftermath of the storm. Do
you think there is something unique about religious organizations, like churches, that
prompts this sense of community? Can you think of groups or organizations you
have belonged to that have created a similar sense of community?

14. Is there a link between climate security and social infrastructure? What is the role of
the community when it comes to preparing for and protecting against climate
change?

15. What are your thoughts on the BIG U plan, or the East Side Coastal Resiliency
Project, as an example of a response to climate change?

16. What kinds of policy responses and infrastructure change would you propose to
protect against climate change?

17. In the conclusion, Klinenberg quotes Mark Zuckerberg as saying, “In times like
these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social
infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for
all of us.” Do you think that Facebook and other big tech companies are good
protectors of our civic life?

18. Palaces for the People focuses on social infrastructure and its relationship with
polarization, inequality, and civic life. Has this relationship changed since the 2016
presidential election?

19. When you think about your own daily routine, what social infrastructure do you
regularly make use of—the corner store, branch library, coffee shop, park,
barbershop, soccer field, etc.? Did this book make you think differently about these
places and their role in your life?

20. What can we as citizens do to build a better and stronger social infrastructure?

A Conversation with Eric Klinenberg
## Author of Palaces for the People

Q. This idea of “social infrastructure”—the physical places that shape the way we
interact—came out of your dissertation and your award-winning book Heat Wave.
You have written several books since then, on topics ranging from the American
media landscape to the appeal of living alone and the challenges of modern dating.
What brought you back to social infrastructure?
A. The truth is that I never stopped thinking and writing about social infrastructure. I just
kept the idea in the background. That changed after Hurricane Sandy, when I did a lot of
writing about how social infrastructure shaped local experiences of the disaster in New
York City. One day, out of the blue, the director of President Obama’s task force on
rebuilding the region asked me if I’d serve as the research director for Rebuild by Design
(RBD), a federal competition to generate innovative plans for twenty-first-century
infrastructure. I jumped at the opportunity. Since then, I’ve been working with architects,
engineers, and political officials who want to build social infrastructure into their designs,
and I’ve learned what a difference it makes.

Q. What makes this such an urgent topic today?
A. Here in the United States, we are more polarized than we’ve been since the Civil War.
We’ve grown more segregated by class, more distrustful, and more politically divided too.
We’re hardly an outlier. Democratic societies throughout the world face massive
challenges. From Brazil to Great Britain, Spain to South Africa, the social glue is coming
undone.
There’s an urgent need to start rebuilding the places where people gather, particularly
those that foster casual interaction across group lines. And, as it happens, the United States
is only one of the many nations that needs to make enormous investments in new
infrastructure, because the systems that make modern life possible are woefully out of date.
I’m not so naïve to think that investing in libraries, schools, parks, and playgrounds is
going to solve all our problems. But the argument in Palaces for the People is that social
infrastructure is just as essential for our future as is the infrastructure for energy,
communications, and transit. We neglect it at our peril.

Q. Political polarization is deepening as we segregate ourselves in red and blue states
—even red and blue counties. It’s increasingly hard for someone in Appalachia, say,
to find common ground with someone from the Bay Area. Can social infrastructure
help heal this larger cultural and political divide? Or does it necessarily work on a
smaller scale?

---

A. You would need a long bridge to connect the people of San Francisco and Appalachia!
So yes, the first step is to connect people who live close to one another but in different
worlds.
Unfortunately, there’s also polarization at the local level—even in the Bay Area, where
I wrote much of this book. Atherton, one of the nation’s most affluent suburbs that is also
fairly conservative, is right between the heavily Democratic and ethnically diverse town of
Redwood City and liberal Menlo Park. People from these communities might not
ordinarily come together, but Menlo Park and Atherton share a school district that includes
their neighbors in the relatively poor East Palo Alto. And residents from all these suburbs
participate in shared activities at local libraries, athletic fields, and parks. Few regions in
the United States have the public resources that make this social infrastructure available in
Silicon Valley, however. In most Appalachian communities, for example, there are fewer
places to gather across group lines.

Q. Increasing inequality is driving the need for more robust social infrastructure. But
issues of unequal access can be extremely complicated, as you show when you address
the changing role of the public pool in social life, and how desegregation correlated
with a rise of private residential pools across America. Do people tend to turn away
from available public spaces when they have the means to isolate themselves from
those they consider “other”? And what can we do to bring people together across such
deeply entrenched biases?
A. That history, which I recount in the book, shows that Americans have a well-established
pattern of shunning—and sometimes even shutting down—public pools and other shared
spaces that promote social cohesion. I’m not glib about the possibilities for promoting
integration everywhere, but the book also points out places where people routinely interact
and build friendships across racial and class divides. Libraries, for instance, are incredibly
popular in cities and suburbs throughout the country, and during the time I spent observing
daily life in branches around New York City, I saw all kinds of unlikely relationships grow.
The same is true on athletic fields, where, like millions of American parents, I spend most
of my weekends cheering. The families I’ve gotten to know so well while watching my
son’s soccer games come from all over the world, have different educational backgrounds,
work different occupations, and hold widely divergent if not fiercely conflicting political
views. Were it not for our shared activities, and the physical facilities that make them
possible, we’d probably never form a community. There’s not a country club on earth that
could give us the experiences we’ve had together.

Q. The book focuses on the social infrastructure of cities and suburbs. What are the
special challenges of rural areas? What should social infrastructure look like in these
places?
A. The special challenge in rural areas is that it’s hard to build shared spaces that are within
walking distance of where people live and work. That’s not an insurmountable problem,
because most rural Americans drive. Where do they go when they want to get together? To

---

places that are quite like the places where urban and suburban people go: libraries,
playgrounds, swimming pools, and athletic fields, as well as to some places that are more
distinctively rural, such as hunting clubs, fairgrounds, and town halls.

Q. Harvard political scientist James Q. Wilson and Rutgers criminologist George
Kelling’s 1982 Atlantic article introduced the “broken windows” model of policing,
which essentially argues that criminals perceive broken windows, graffiti, and
abandoned lots as signals of weak social control and therefore as tacit permission to
act outside the law. While this now infamous theory has encountered plenty of
criticism, what interests you most is the way it was framed, interpreted, and widely
implemented for decades. Has social infrastructure been the missing piece of this
particular policy puzzle?
A. Social infrastructure is actually a big part of the story that Wilson and Kelling tell in
“Broken Windows.” I didn’t realize this until I reread the piece and found this amazing
passage where they introduce their theory: “A piece of property is abandoned, weeds grow
up, a window is smashed…. People start drinking in front of the grocery; in time, an
inebriate slumps to the sidewalk and is allowed to sleep it off. Pedestrians are approached
by panhandlers.” From there it gets worse.
What’s curious is that the first two steps of this vicious cycle—“A piece of property is
abandoned, weeds grow up”—never registered in the public debate about why some
neighborhoods have such high crime rates. The third step—“a window is smashed”—
inspired the article’s catchy title and took center stage. Debates about Wilson and Kelling’s
theory ignored the two problems at the root of their story—poverty and a collective
incapacity to reinvest—and jumped straight to the criminal behavior. The policy
implications are straightforward, we get zero-tolerance and stop-and-frisk policing to crack
down on criminals, but precious little investment in repairing abandoned places.

Q. Social infrastructure is crucial during and after disasters, as we’ve seen time and
again, with drastic climate events occurring more frequently than ever. Can you
explain some of the ways we can integrate vital social support systems into our critical
hard infrastructure?
A. Incorporating social infrastructure in climate security projects was central to my work
on the RBD competition, and it’s one of the policy areas where we can already see a major
change. Take Lower Manhattan, where there’s an urgent need to build better flood
protection systems to prevent the level of inundation we experienced during Superstorm
Sandy. During RBD, the architect Bjarke Ingels led a team of architects and engineers that
designed a series of protective walls that double as sloped parklands and recreational
facilities, such as athletic fields, bike paths, and walkways. It’s divided into three sections,
each called a compartment.
The compartment on the Lower East Side, which is, for now, the only funded part of
the project, features lushly planted berms that protect neighborhoods, infrastructure, and
institutions near the river, while also bridging them over the FDR Drive (an elevated

---

highway that carries lots of traffic up and down the East Side of Manhattan and currently
cuts off pedestrian access to the waterfront) to new gathering places and commercial
outlets on the water’s edge. The berms would block and absorb storm surges when
necessary, but their everyday function, as parklands and recreational areas for inhabitants
of an especially gray and unpleasant part of an especially gray city, is at least as important.

Q. As we have seen in the 2016 election and in the ongoing conversations about
Facebook’s vulnerability to Russian hacking, digital “social infrastructure” can
actually serve to exploit our existing social divisions. What is the key difference
between the spaces we inhabit online versus those we occupy in real life (IRL)?
A. I don’t doubt that Mark Zuckerberg wants his products to connect humanity and
increase solidarity. But the digital social infrastructure that he has created exploits existing
social divisions. Facebook’s algorithms are designed to optimize users’ time on the screen,
not civility and the common good. As a result, they amplify extreme, emotional messages
that stoke polarization and downplay more nuanced, deliberative posts.
Social infrastructures that exist IRL do exactly the opposite. Think about how much
more difficult it is to threaten or insult an actual person who’s standing next to you in a
church, barbershop, school, or library than it is to do so digitally, on Facebook or Twitter.
Spending time with different people in shared spaces is obviously not sufficient to create
solidarity. We have genuine disagreements and real reasons for conflict, and they’re not
going to disappear because we eat, play, or pray together. But if we don’t have physical
places where people with different backgrounds and beliefs can get to know one another,
IRL, we’ll never find common ground.

Q. Much of the social infrastructure you discuss in the book—from libraries and
parks to pools and schools—already exists. Are there new forms of social
infrastructure that we should be thinking about or promoting? What does a twenty-
first-century social infrastructure look like, both here and in developing countries?
A. I know two things that social infrastructure definitely doesn’t look like: a screen and a
wall! Unfortunately, though, these are the infrastructures that two of the world’s most
powerful forces—Silicon Valley and the White House—are trying to build.
Twenty-first-century social infrastructures are already reviving civic life in nations
across the planet: public plazas in low-lying cities that double as massive water storage
systems during extreme weather events; playgrounds that offer facilities for people of all
ages; massive levees and berms that masquerade as bike paths and parks. Americans should
have all these things. Our infrastructure used to be a source of pride and a symbol of our
collective prosperity. Now it’s as broken as the body politic, and we all suffer the
consequences.

Q. What do you hope readers take away from Palaces for the People?

---

A. First, an appreciation for the surprising power of social infrastructure. And second, a
firm belief that a better world is not only possible, but buildable. The question shouldn’t be
whether to begin, but where and when.
