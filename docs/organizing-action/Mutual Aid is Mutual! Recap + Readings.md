This survival work, when done in conjunction with social movements demanding transformative change, is called mutual aid (1).

Dean Spade is also an anarchist!

Point Three: Mutual Aid has been a part of all large, powerful social movements, and it has a particularly important role to play right now, as we face unprecedented dangers and opportunities for mobilization. (1-2)

[Mutual aid, paired with bolder strategies (2), caretakes our people while placing stress and friction on systems that harm us.]

reading hints:

The first chapter of texts like these are usually introductions to the rest of the points in the book. In this way, they function as long, semi/very detailed thesis statement. Read the first chapter twice. Read it. Set it down. Wait. Pick it back up and read it again. Highlight what you think are thesis statements. Then start the book.

Watching the author talk about the book is always super helpful

. You can see Dean Spade discuss his book here, alongside scholars + organizers + teachers
