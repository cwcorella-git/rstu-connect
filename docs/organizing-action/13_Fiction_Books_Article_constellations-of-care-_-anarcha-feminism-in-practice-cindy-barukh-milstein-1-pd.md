Constellations is a beautiful gift to communities of freedom-
minded people, oering a glimpse into many worlds of possi-
bility. Across the many authors and experiences represented,
deeply resonating themes of nurturing love and erce re-
silience intertwine in a tapestry of hope.
—Kai Cheng Thom, author of Falling Back in Love
## with Being Human

With rare candor and rigorous insight, Cindy Barukh
Milstein’s anthologies oer the conversations we need to
sustain the communal possibility of anarchist, feminist, and
queer world-making in the ruins of everyday brutality.
—Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore, author of Touching the Art

An antidote to the commodication of care, Constellations brings
together a multiplicity of voices on the subject, in an approach
that makes visible the intentionality and diversity of care
practices.
—Sundus Abdul Hadi, author of Take Care of Your Self:
## The Art and Cultures of Care and Liberation

Constellations of Care brings together all kinds of veterans of
liberatory experiments in comradeship and kin-making,
providing valuable insight into obstacles and defeats as well
as tales of abundant love saplings, spores, and cuttings for
everyone to propagate and grow.
—Sophie Lewis, author of Abolish the Family:
## A Manifesto for Care and Liberation

---

Cindy Barukh Milstein’s anthology is care and mutual learning
in action. The stories gathered here embrace complexity and
challenge, but also hope for new ways forward. This work is
nothing less than a transformation.
## —Kes Otter Liee, author of the Margins trilogy

This anthology is like a ower under the rubble insisting on
life. It’s a window into the beautiful, diverse, and practical
world of anarcha-feminism, meaningfully woven from the
collective, colorful, courageous threads of believers in a radi-
cally free life—now.
—Dilar Dirik, author of The Kurdish Women’s Movement:
## History, Theory, Practice

Constellations is balm on a collective wound, with each essay
oering validation and relief. The feminist world-building
illuminated in this collection is heartening and hope giving,
providing a mercurial map toward the radical relationality we
need to sustain us.
## —Raechel Anne Jolie, author of Rust Belt Femme

Milstein has beautifully woven together an anthology that
helps orient us toward care and co-making worlds that shine
bright. Constellation’s powerful, vulnerable contributions are
like embers, lighting up pathways to keep us rooted in life
while centering resistance and love.

If we set our aims on destroying hierarchies, …
[we should] devise social relations that no longer
reproduce that world. Our actions right now pre-
figure the world we want, and will help end the
world that tries to contain us. We can taste the old
world’s death in our relations that extricate its
logic and control.

—Scott Branson, “For a Tranarchist Feminism,”
## 2023

There is an element here that is not explicit but
that is fundamental: practice. … We are not talking
about something that could be, we are talking
about something that we are already doing. … Our
rebellion is our “NO” to the system. Our resistance
is our “YES” to something else being possible.

—Sub Galeano, “The Method, the Bibliography,
## and a Drone,” 2015

Daily, hourly, for over sixty-seven days while struggling—
and failing—to write this prologue, I’ve been witnessing—or
rather, feeling—the rubble. The bodies. The genocide. The
system that our ancestors said “NO” to again and again for
millennia across so many geographies. The system that we’re
now watching in real time via images from Palestinians on the
ground in Gaza.
Across an aching world, we add our “NO,” with our feet
and our solidarity, yet it falls silently on the ears of those who
only hear the siren call of hierarchy and control.
So of course words fail me. Fail us.

As one poignant essay observed recently, we are experienc-
ing “grief beyond language.”1 Which is another way of saying
that we’re experiencing rage beyond language, bundled
in a “pain and sadness so big that they no longer t in the
heart of a few,” as the Zapatistas observed in a communiqué
on January 1, 1994, but instead demand a shared, collective
heart.2
We need, as we always have, the “YES” of our practices:
constellations of care, where each and every one of our
still-beating hearts, in concert, rebelliously speaks louder
than words, forming unmistakable patterns of dierent
cosmologies, dierent worlds, life against their death machine.
This happens, as it always has and likely always will, within
an imperfect universe, where we’re guided by billions of
points of our own self-generated light—all the resistance that
came before us and is shining brightly now—even as those
who seek dominion strive to extinguish our luminosity.
I’m reminded here of a Shabbat evening not so long ago,
in the rst year of another ongoing catastrophe, COVID-19.
A small group of us queer+trans Jews circled up in a narrow
Pittsburgh backyard, sandwiched between row houses and
barking dogs, to share and sing songs of joy, sorrow, and
rebellion for hours. As our bodies increasingly coregulated,
brought into sacred connection in opposition to the cruel
isolation of societal abandonment, I turned my face upward,

bedazzled by the ancient stars, and took in a breath of the
world as it should be. Then I saw antisemitic billionaire
Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites begin their crawl from one
horizon of the night sky, with an assured hubris, until they
stretched fully across it. “NO,” I screamed, shattering our
a cappella harmony, and all eyes looked above. We paused,
honoring the loss of the rmament and so much else to
capitalism and colonialism, patriarchy and fascism, and then
looked back into each other’s eyes, in the time-space we
were reclaiming, beyond their thefts, and raised our voices in
melodic deance again.
I’m reminded of how, soon after the start of this latest Nakba
chapter, another group of rad Jews in another city, Asheville,
leaned into our centuries-old technologies of grief practices,
inseparable from our histories of ungovernable political
practices. We organized and held time-space for a Mourner’s
Kaddish, which as many stories have it, became linked to
loss and mourning in response to the Crusades’ murderous
brutality toward Jewish communities in the thirteenth
century. Our “Jews against genocide” public Mourner’s
Kaddish, outdoors by a well-used river trail, gathered well
over two hundred people of various ethnicities, ages, genders,
and faiths (or not) to join in creating an expansive DIY altar
in solidarity with Palestinians and sharing in the fullness of
raw emotions. We knew that we couldn’t stop the bombing—
for as anarchists, we recognize that would entail a seismic shift
in the overarching social order—but we assuredly understood,
as anarcha-feminists, that it is well within our power to forge
social relations that point beyond nation-states.
So we did what states don’t want us to do and frequently

try to stymie, such as in Gaza: collectively mourn, honor, and
remember our dead. By not skipping over our trauma and grief,
by extending empathy to each other and “consoling the dead
lest [we] give up on the cause of living,” by “beckon[ing] forth
a humanism that has to be constructed,” we sustain, as Nadia
Bou Ali asserts in a contemporary piece, “the very question
of what it means to live, to be alive,” in all the ways that
Christo-fascism and white supremacy unceasingly attempt to
crush.3 Indeed, such do-it-ourselves rituals of resistance are
crucial to why people ght so hard for the living. We depicted
that sensibility in an enormous banner framing our Kaddish
altar. It read “Never again means never again for any people.”
Perhaps more to the point, we’d decided to paint luscious
olives and a juicy pomegranate on either side of these words,
rather than nationalistic or statist images and their ags, to
symbolize lengthy, lived practices of interwovenness beyond
borders—the trees of life that we, ourselves, plant from the
countless seeds of “YES.”
It shouldn’t take a genocide to “beckon forth” our better
selves and the preciousness of life. Yet whether we like it or
not—and I abhor it—we are face-to-face with a genocidal,
nay, ecocidal period of (in)human history. And potentialities
for other pathways don’t arise from theories removed from
the here-and-nowness of this everyday devastation, nor do
lives worth living. They emerge from the humus we cultivate,
as in the two examples above.
It’s a big reason that I return, time and again, to the
Zapatistas. They’ve demonstrated their theory not through

the halls of academia or armchairs of intellectuals—those
who have everything to gain from maintaining the deadening
status quo—but instead via their actual practices and lived
experiences of them, relayed through the wit and wisdom of
storytelling, a tradition that harks back to the dawn of human
language. For over three decades now, when the Zapatistas
bump up against new hierarchies or those they hadn’t
fully noticed before, both outside and within their own
autonomous communities, they’ve also embellished on those
tales—at once poetry and promise—to humbly detail needed
renements to their practices.
This ability to journey side by side with each other
toward liberatory vistas we can barely yet imagine but enact
deeply in our daily relations, constructively amending our
circuitous course as we go, and generously swapping stories
and sustenance along the way around the warmth of rebel
campres, real and metaphoric, has the quality of what
might be called anarcha-feminism. This anthology doesn’t
try to pin down a precise denition because that would
limit possibilities and destinations. It would turn anarcha-
feminism into a static, passive term, or a hollow phrase on
a dos-and-don’ts list posted on the walls of a social center.
In contrast, the contributors to this collection make use of
their anarcha-feminism, whether they explicitly use that
self-descriptor or not, and for sure in ways that queer and
transform it, as a verb. They carry it as an ethical compass
that perpetually guides how we, ourselves, routinely take
“positive” direct actions, “wherein our actions directly open
up room for blissful other possible worlds—not merely in our

## PROLOGUE   /   7

hearts, but in our actual lives.”4
So this book asks you, its readers, to gather for a story share
about “anarcha-feminism in practice”—stories that together,
like stars of various shapes, sizes, and brilliance, converge into
discernible celestial patterns, “constellations of care” that
bring the otherworldly dreams of this praxis down to earth—
this imperiled earth. The pieces in this volume implicitly
speak honest, dignied truths against top-down power by
exploring how we act to preguratively disperse power from
below. Such practices can only be “read” through their
engendering and doing, experiencing and feeling, tinkering
with and reveling in, commoning and sharing. They don’t vie
for fame or prot, power or control, but rather continually
embody forms of life and care, love and solidarity, always
against the grain of what wants to destroy all of that, all of
us, along with the whole of our ecosystem.
Certainly, the aspirations of anarchism have always, at
their core, revolved around what could be understood as
“feminist” ethics—self-determination and bodily autonomy,
voluntaristic and consensual association as well as responsi-
bility, egalitarian social relations and relationship building,
mutual aid and social solidarity, and loving freely as well
as queerly, to mention a few. Moreover, the bulk of what
we anarchists have actually done in practice, and still do,
imperfectly and yet beautifully, falls under the banner of self-
organized collective care, freely gifted—or again, what could
be seen as feminist ethics, in which we have one another’s
backs and know that others have ours. We shouldn’t have to,

Circle (Strangers in a Tangled Wilderness, 2022), 69.

in short, add feminism; it should be self-evident in the word
anarchism. Likewise, the aspirations of feminism should
be indistinguishable from an anarchist ethics, toward the
abolition of gender as a category that oppresses, assaults, or
otherwise does violence to the wholeness of who we all could
be, freed from the dominance of cisheteronormativity and
prevalence of misogyny.
Yet for a host of reasons—ranging from toxic “male”
behaviors and patriarchal power structures within our
own anarchist circles, to liberalism, racism, classism, and
transphobia, among others, busily trying to eviscerate the
radical from feminist circles—the aspirations and practices
of communal care have long been devalued, demeaned, or
destroyed, or made invisible. And not merely by individuals—
although it is indeed done frequently by individuals—but
systemically. To borrow from the Zapatistas again, “We must
not forget that when the system has to choose a gender, it
chooses to be masculine, male, man, macho—even when it is
administered by a woman.”5
If we’re serious about fundamentally, nay, radically (as
in “getting to the roots”) transforming this world, including
in joyfully militant and riotously joyful ways, we must
be serious about simultaneously transforming ourselves.
Anarcha-feminists have long articulated this notion. We’ve
underscored too, in words and deeds, that there’s no binary
between social relations and social organization, or what’s
been called “the personal” and “the political.” Instead, there’s
a developmental logic, nurtured through the ways we act as

if we were already free people in a free society, allowing us to
“taste” nonhierarchical worlds coming to life.
Now, in the dumpster re of the nonstop disasters we
confront as a species, there’s no ignoring what feministic
anarchists—these days, thankfully, inseparable from or another
way of describing queer, trans, and gender-nonconforming
anarchists—have been arguing all along: “We are all we
have.” No one, as they say, is coming to rescue us, nor as
anarchists did we ever think they would. So we must also be,
passionately, abidingly, and with erce love, “all we need”
and desire. Whether one is an anarchist or not, the
contemporary turn of geopolitical events—from the global
phenomena of pandemics, fascistic regimes, and collapsing
infrastructure for any sort of social well-being, to capitalist-
fueled climate catastrophes and displacement, to occupations
spiraling into genocides—has compelled a shift toward
prioritizing do-it-ourselves forms of taking good care of each
other. Suddenly, the many anarcha-feministic practices that
previously felt like “nothing” when people didn’t take the
time or care to notice them—or worse, didn’t take the time or
care to engage in those practices themselves—now feel like,
and indeed are, everything.
Or as Nicole Rose of Solidarity Apothecary eloquently
puts it in her contribution,

Care is a radical act, and one of our biggest weapons.
Collective care points beyond all the structures we
ght against while simultaneously already embodying
the alternatives we ght and yearn for. Yet for too long,
the centrality of care to life itself has been downplayed

## 10 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

or erased, including within anarchist circles. Anarcha-
feminists have challenged the invisibilization of care,
even as they’ve typically been the ones to engage
in the myriad types of “care work” that form the
backbone of anarchist infrastructure, and are essential
to everything that anarchists believe in and practice.

As you wander through these pages, my hope is that you’ll
think for yourself, drawing out the theoretical insights that can
only come from the lived activities of those who are acting
as if social relations within our social experiments matter
too. Because at this juncture of profound abandonment and
horrifying scenes of barbarism, they do matter, if we are to
both survive and thrive.
The stories stretch across varied landscapes and contexts,
with dierent pieces emphasizing dierent dimensions of
an anarcha-feminist praxis, which when brought together
in conversation, paint a full(er) picture. Anthologies, to my
mind, are about facilitating and holding a communal space
for dialogue, in which we wrestle together with, to borrow
the title from one of my previous books, “paths toward
utopia.” Key to this is the process itself, such as cultivating
social relations with the contributors, or in the case of this
project, supporting writer-rebels through the ways patriarchy
socializes them to think their voices don’t count. And trusting
in people’s lived experiences and storytelling as generative
forms to unearth not just theory but hopefully change the
world too—through our collective wisdoms. Indeed, I’ve come
to see edited collections as a deeply feminist, anarchist, and
queer practice (and a Jewish one, since ongoing, collaborative

## PROLOGUE   /   11

reinterpretation of the world through words is bound up in
our duty to continually participate in trying to make the world
whole through our actions).
The contributors in this book likewise share in their atten-
tion to “tending to the sparks” as a deeply feminist, anarchist,
and queer practice. They oer their lived experiences as a
small sample of those multitudes of “little” re-keeping tasks
that are too often discounted as “women’s” (or marginalized
genders’) work, but without which nothing could burst forth
into the “big” ames of revolution that allow us, if only for
a divine duration, to “decide for ourselves” within free and
autonomous time-spaces. Activist-writer Dilar Dirik—using
storytelling as a method in another anthology—captured
this magical relation between the embers of “women, life,
freedom” combusting into the anarchically feministic region
called Rojava:

And one day,
the (r)evolution came.
We held instructions in our mighty hands,
but the blueprints of the new era were pink and green
and upside down,
written in a language that none of us could read,
except a mother with three kids on her back and ve
hiding under her skirt.

“don’t expect from the gods, whether earthly or
heavenly, what you can nd in yourself.”

the illiterate woman,
to wash her face with the rays of the sun.6

These days, we must lean in close to feel the warmth of the “rays
of the sun” against the coldness sweeping over this planet—a
chill that nds its source in patriarchy, heteronormativity, and
misogyny, even if it goes by other names like militarism and
fascism, police and prisons. But those shimmering rays are
there, in abundance, because of us, as you’ll see in myriad
ways on the pages ahead.
Against the backdrop of the collective trauma and systematic
violence of the present era—when human and nonhuman life
don’t seem to matter at all, from Palestine to Turtle Island
and beyond—those brilliant rays are there in the galaxies of
communally caring practices, such as the ones so powerfully
shared here, that intentionally strive to cultivate well-being,
safety through solidarity, trust and friendship, vulnerability
and consent, tenderness, reciprocity, accessibility, kindness,
and so, so much more. They are there in innumerable on-the-
ground projects that explicitly orbit around organizing as if
social relations matter, illuminating how the future we dream
of, even if unknown in the best possible sense, is already
unfolding through uid, expansive processes of tending
lovingly to each other. They are there in our feministic,
queered, anarchic, plain-old extraordinary, badass brave
spaces, self-organized in kitchens and cafés, social centers and
social uprisings, parks and theaters, solidarity apothecaries

What you’ll nd between the covers of Constellations of Care
is only a fraction of the many stories that were shared with
me since I put out a “call” for pieces after Libertie Valance,
with Firestorm bookstore, ohandedly suggested the idea of
a contemporary anthology related to anarcha-feminism way
back in summer 2021. (Shoutout and love to Libertie for her
dear friendship, ability to generatively nudge my thinking,
and contribution herein.) This book was, to my surprise,
a tful journey—more so than any other collection I’ve
birthed. To my sorrow, patriarchy, including within anarchism,
is so alive and well, it convinces way too many people that
their experiences, ideas, and projects have no value, and that
they can’t or shouldn’t write.
That translated into me scouring the globe numerous
times, attempting to counter-convince feministic anarchists
to tell their own stories—frequently without success.
It translated into many, many dozens of anarchistic feminists
getting in touch with sketches of what they wanted to explore

## 14 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

or compelling full drafts, yet who alas couldn’t get past
the pain, understandably, of what anarcho-patriarchy had
done to them in order to portray the beauty of own their
practices (the aspiration of this book), or even nd and believe
in their own voices—despite my best eorts to lend as much
support, encouragement, and collaborative aid as possible.
To each and every one of you whose writing ultimately
didn’t appear here, I oer my gratitude, love, and solidarity;
without you, without our many conversations, this book would
not have materialized. You’re on these pages in spirit.
I want to acknowledge as well the many friends, accomplices,
and comrades who widely shared my call for contributions
and translated it into Spanish, sent me contacts for potential
writers and stories, generously supplied me with house+cat
sits and thus time to write and edit, oered a listening ear,
read through parts of the manuscript, wrote a blurb, and so
much more—too many people to name by name, lest I forgot
someone. Without you, without this social fabric of collective
care “work,” voluntarily given and gratefully received, this
anthology would never have made it into the world. I trust
you know who you are, and how much your love and solidarity
means to me—love and solidarity that radiates across these
pages because of you.
That said, I’d be remiss if I didn’t name a few names—
people who went many miles beyond what they likely
thought they were “signing up for” when I turned to them
for anarchist assistance. My heartfelt thanks to Steven,
Erica Lagalisse, and Scott/Shuli Branson for their honest
and supportive reections as well as publishing expertise in
helping me ultimately decide to go with Pluto Press. Much

appreciation to Lilli Sher for reading and oering suggestions
on my essay for this collection. Abiding gratitude to someone
who is wholly—and always so beautifully—a collaborator on,
now, the majority of my books: Je Clark of Crisis; his cover
design captures the heart of this anthology, perhaps because
his big heart so clearly bursts forth in what he dreamed up.
And I hardly know how to begin to thank Wren Awry and
Scott Campbell, much less complete any sort of appreciation
for both of them. They traveled with me through the entire
process of this volume. Their contributions herein are
only the proverbial tip of the iceberg of what they gifted
me, from being solid sounding boards, to empathetically
supporting me through self-doubt on this project, to being
dear friends who also write and publish, and so really got the
depth of the waters when they shared their good counsel.
Much love to you all.
To name other names, it’s been an utter pleasure to work
with Pluto Press, including from the rst moment I met my
Pluto editor, David Shulman, on a bench outside a conference
he was attending in Montreal in summer 2023. He took a
break to ostensibly chat with me briey about this book,
and we talked for over three hours about everything under
the sun, from politics to life—except this project. David felt
a kindred spirit from the get-go, and along with his belief
in and enthusiasm for this anthology, he’s made publishing
a delight. Perhaps most important, he was there when
I hit obstacles that made me feel I’d never nish this book,
supplying just the right—and insightful—advice to aid me
in moving forward. Abundant appreciation, too, to everyone
I’ve worked with at Pluto—all of whom have been supportive,

communicative, and eminently good at what they do: Chris
Browne, Carrie Giunta, Geraldine Hendler, Patrick Hughes,
James Kelly, Jonila Krasniqi, Sophie O'Reirdan, Emily
Orford, Melanie Patrick, Martin Pettitt, and Robert Webb.
Lastly, my love extends to each and every contributor.
I cannot express my gratitude enough for so beautifully and
publicly sharing so much of yourselves and the splendor of
your lived experiences in this book. That takes courage, and
as your stories attest, walking the walk even when the going
is lonely or tough. I’m in such admiration of your ability to
remain true to your ethics, self-reective, and openhearted—
and not give up; instead, you just keep using your praxis as
a bolt cutter to liberate more space for commons of care to
emerge. It was an honor, moreover, to witness the many ways
you all fully held to your feminist anarchist practices during
our lengthy back-and-forths to go from idea through various
stages of revisions to polished piece. So much struck me in
that regard during our private exchanges, but I was especially
moved by your commitment to and humility around uplifting
collectivity; it feels a deeply anarcha-feminist action, as
evidenced in every chapter, to uninchingly believe that it
takes many rebel voices—indeed all of our voices—to speak a
new world into existence.

Cindy Barukh Milstein (they, or he, but never she) curates
anthologies as labors of love and containers of possibilities.7
As interventions so as to encourage a pregurative politics,
not merely one of negation. As inspiration to keep going
toward innite forms of collective freedom via messy-
beautiful experimentation. As mirrors onto other possible
worlds and lives that we’re already enacting, even if only in
glimpses. They do that as a queer diasporic Jewish anarchist,
as a “street intellectual,” at cross-purposes with all the ways
that thinking has gotten separated from doing (and feeling)
as yet another form of hierarchy and control. They do
that as someone who has long tried hard to embody their
ethics in practice, whether in their organizing, solidarity
eorts, books, curation of magical time-spaces, love, or
life. You can nd Milstein on Instagram @cindymilstein,
via cbmilstein.wordpress.com, or at cbmilstein@yahoo.com.

    7. All author proceeds from this book will be redistributed to various
anarcha-feminist initiatives, based on suggestions from the contributors to
this collection and shifting with each round of royalties.

We are not writing this because we have something new to
oer with our story.
Instead, like many young anarchists, we started out
overowing with hope and rage. We were fed up with a
world that had been violent toward our bodies, a world
represented by our rapists, the alt-right personalities doing
campus speaking tours, the university chancellor with over a
half-million-dollar salary who turned the other cheek when
those Nazis came to town, the police who beat up our friends
at protests and continued to kill Black people in the streets,
and an increasingly fascist government with its dierent
presidential faces.
Fed up, wounded, angry, scared, disillusioned. We had this
in common, and it was not original, but it did feel powerful.
In fall 2015, when Nightshade had its rst meeting—
which was not really a meeting but rather a circle of outcasts
telling stories in Ami’s living room—we all had the same ve
Crimethinc posters on our walls, held up by peeling masking
tape.1 Back then, it was hard for some of us to even speak of
the traumas we had experienced, and even harder to articulate
our desires and fears.
But we were radicalized by the notion that we could
become stronger together. At that rst meeting, there were
around twenty-ve people packed into the little room. We
went on to organize together for a while that autumn, not
quite ever fullling our early dreams of crashing frat parties
and beating up any cis men who were violating people’s

    1. Editor’s note: It’s a sweet coincidence that Nightshade is the name
of two, albeit unrelated, collectives in this anthology (see “Tarps and
Gossip”).

consent, escorting girls and gay boys safely back to their
homes, and being a sort of vigilante crew of queers who
would keep each other safe when no one else would. Certainly,
though, we found other ways of being brave in unison.
We did a lot of assembling and disrupting and empower-
ing, grieving and experimenting and loving, as well as we
knew how. Many of the people present at that initial meeting
would go on to get retraumatized in one way or another.
The year 2016 was full of ugly street protests and face-os
with bigots, followed by a scary wave of state repression.
There were also a fair number of misogynists within
the movement who claimed to be dierent, but in fact
were insidious in their own ways, hurting us when we were
most vulnerable.
It was clear to us then, as it is now, that anarchism needs
feminism because misogynists make great informants, or
because misogynists break up movements without even
needing to be hired by the state since the state can rely on
us hurting each other and being already too hurt for there to
be a possibility for recourse.
The Nightshade collective continued to grow into itself,
although it looked a lot dierent after its rst year. Those
of us still left over decided we would attempt to slowly
change the culture of organizing through our creation
of revolutionary, queer feminist content and by radically
changing the way we treated one another. We hosted study
groups on consent and radical conict resolution, organized
workshops and skill shares, made zines to spell out our
pain and conjure moments for collective healing, participated
in solidarity actions and night marches, held safe and sexy

trans-positive dance parties, fostered intergenerational queer
spaces where trans kids and elderly dykes and everyone in
between could break bread, and engaged in immeasurable
hours of interpersonal and relational work with one another.
Inspired by the tekmil method utilized by revolutionaries in
Rojava, we integrated strategies for giving and receiving feed-
back into our meetings and day-to-day relational cadences,
believing thoroughly in the militancy of our love for each
other to keep us accountable to our actions, develop our
strengths as courageous and critical people, and ultimately
sustain and expand the collective well-being.
Over our four years of existence, many of us “came out” as
dierent versions of queer or trans, realizing ourselves anew
with the support of the collective, which brought gender and
sexuality into view as both deeply personal and potentially
revolutionary, transformative, and playful when experimented
with in a group. We joked that Nightshade was a she/they to
they/he, or he/they to they/she pipeline.
It was easier to imagine a queer adult life for ourselves with
all of our friends surrounding us and participating too. Leo’s
house was where Flip got their rst “adult” queer hair cut in
2017, a collaboration between J and B, also in Nightshade
back then, in front of the bathroom mirror. It was in that
same living room that M told us their new name. We all
cheered. Every week it seemed like there was another reason
to celebrate the new parts of ourselves that we nally felt safe
enough to explore and reveal.
We took our aspirations so seriously that we formally
facilitated “dreaming sessions” where we would produce
mind maps on large pieces of white paper detailing the
worlds we were building. One of our goals was to “become

serious contenders in the realm of anarchist theory and
thought”—a desire to slash the gatekeeping and hierarchy
of what serious contenders meant. Us queers without Ph Ds
or rened “masculine” intellect could contribute too, and
were contributing, just by virtue of gathering and refusing to
stay silent.
It was important to us—and still is—to view our collective
self-actualization as trans and queer subjects as a crucial
intervention in the naturalization of cisheteropatriarchy and
the violence it commands. We didn’t want to “substitute some
other great feminist truth for the great white masculinist
truth,” as Kim Tall Bear put it so eloquently. We were “trying
to get it less wrong.”2 We were embracing our transness and
queerness, and viewing them as a way to delegitimize an
entire logic of oppressive domination and control (and not
the sexy kind).
“Why is the transsexual or transgender subject to be
explained, rather than the cissexual or cisgender one?”
observed Xandra Metcalfe.3 In many ways, Nightshade
externalized this question through our very existence. To the
local anarchist scene, to the University of Pittsburgh where
many of us met as students, to the city and world at large,
we strived to throw everything people thought they knew as
objective and inherent about gender into doubt. Nightshade

wanted to shift the dominant assumption that heterosexuality
and cisgenderism is natural, recognizing that fallacy as an
epistemological imposition that we as trans subjects, or
anyone for that matter, did not consent to—and have every
right to reject.
So again and again, Nightshade came together in adamant
refusal of all that failed to arm us. We placed stickers over
the gendered bathroom signs at Pitt so many times that
the actual placards were removed from the walls. We took
ourselves seriously despite outside skepticism, such as people
(often cis dudes from “the scene”) asking why we even existed
in the rst place. We deed the privacy of individual romantic
partnerships and grounded ourselves in the intimate bond of
queer friendship.
Though we were a queer and trans collective, we strove
to go beyond the boundaries of identity politics and access
the transformative capacity of raging against conformity in
our everyday lives. By confronting moments of interpersonal
conict within our collective, we braced for the larger
confrontations we would face as dissidents against the death
mechanisms of white supremacy and capital.
No, we were not original, and we were also nowhere near
perfect. We are not writing this because we think there is
something necessarily new about our story, as we noted
earlier; in fact, there is something wonderfully redundant
going on here. When we were feeling insurmountably lonely,
scared, and hurt, we formed a collective, and as that collective
we created many temporary commons, and held each other
and learned together and allowed ourselves to be militantly
joyful, which sometimes looked like ipping the table of the

## THE COLLECTIVE AS A CRUCIAL FORM   /   25

campus Republicans (shoutout to T) or screaming in the
faces of neofascist men, but more often looked like 2.5-hour
meetings in the dead of winter circled around a pot of tea.
All of that is worth talking about because we are all still here;
in many ways it kept us alive, that collective form, and it kept
us believing in a world that is vastly dierent than this one.
We learned to solidify the commons of care in fall 2018,
when Brett Kavanaugh’s conrmation process for a US
Supreme Court seat turned into a public hearing on sexual
assault. Kavanaugh was taken to task by the women he had
harmed. The hearing made a spectacle of what we already
knew: that patriarchal violence is a function of the state and
therefore the state will never protect us from it. We knew
this testimony would open wounds for many people who’d
been raped, and decided that regardless of the outcome, we’d
make care packages for anyone reliving trauma because of
the hearing.
Over one hundred people requested packages in the rst
couple of days, and we began compiling emotional-resourcing
zines, stickers, dget toys, personalized cards, candles, and
soaps, and delivering them to people both in Pittsburgh and
across the United States. While we hoped to supply some
relief to the survivors who responded to our oer, the ritual
of giving care also helped keep us grounded and allowed us
to move through our own grief. We discovered that in spite
of the trendy online push toward an alienated framework
for “self-care,” people were desperately seeking a sense of
togetherness, to be a part of a process of healing-in-common.
We found many feminist ways of surrounding each other.
Sometimes it took the form of publicly calling out the names

## 26 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

of our abusers while reveling in our collective sorrow and
rage, or engaging in a circle of song in the middle of the street
to hold a pain that is larger than life. At other times the care
was gentle; it was medicine and healing spells and hugs. And
then there was dancing; a queer dance party with a good DJ
is enough to make time stop.
Nightshade’s dance party fundraisers were always messy
and fun. We decorated the walls of what was then the
Glitterbox Theater with posters of our chosen trans ancestors.
We spent hours experimenting with mixology, and coming up
with cocktails and mocktails that sometimes tasted good and
often tasted bad. We explored what it meant to feel “safe”
at a party, and what it looked like to hold space in and with
our bodies.
People of all ages would show up to the functions we
hosted, and we took pleasure in the beauty and discomfort of
intergenerationality. We danced with that discomfort, asked
ourselves who was there, who was not there, and why. We
received criticism. We also received a lot of positive feedback
and gratitude from people who told us they had never felt
so held before, whether at a dance party, event, meeting, or
meal.
We hear “care work” thrown around a lot these days, and
because it’s not “productive” labor, it’s impossible to really
measure the results. But something Nightshade learned early
on was that it didn’t matter if our success was measurable
so long as it was feeling right, so long as there was someone
who was on the receiving end of a gift. The rituals we created
together could not be boxed into the logistic ow of capitalism.
What did “right” feel like? Incompletion, abundance, joy,

sustenance, time travel.4 A ower opening up and embracing
the light. There is nothing to do with beauty but be present
in it—and wait in wonderment for the eeting thing to fade.
Incompletion and exibility carried us through countless
transitions and formations.
We learned this most clearly in fall 2018, when several
organizers of color in Pittsburgh expressed concern that
our whiteness was impacting our practices in ways that hurt
Black and Brown people. In light of this, we decided to slow
down our public organizing and focus on internal antiracism
education facilitated by an outside organization as well as one
another. In hindsight, we have dierent perspectives about
this time period and could not fully agree on how to talk
about it in this piece. This lack of uniformity speaks to the
complexity of identity politics, callout culture, and organizing
in a white supremacist world. We were beginning to discuss
how to move forward as a collective when the pandemic hit.
We met for the last time without knowing it would be the
last time. We had dierent ideas of what would feel necessary
and what we had capacity to do together in the face of a
new type of crisis and emergency. We were not sure how to
envision a future together as Nightshade and perhaps knew in
our hearts that it was time—time for a collective that was once
beautiful to disperse and learn from our many messy conicts

    4. À la Stefano Harney and Fred Moten, incompletion means to
resist the impulse to constantly improve, and then constantly manage and
own what you improve on. Instead, we aim to simply be all that we share
and what we lose happily through sharing, which is our completeness,
the possibility of our ever being nished, staying smugly uncontainable.

Compositions, 2021).

as our politics had instructed us to do. We began gathering
our energy for pressing and diverse mutual aid projects, and
continued growing our relationships elsewhere, but without
abandoning each other as friends.
Even with the imperfections of Nightshade, over those
four years we formulated a model for community care amid
a landscape of trauma and gendered violence. That care
sustained our relationships through attacks that could’ve easily
broken us apart beyond repair. We cultivated an anarchist
feminist vision together that we continue to scatter like seeds.
These seeds take the form of questions—questions we
carry forward into our new projects and relationships: How
can we better apply feminist care to form loving bonds across
all the lines that racial capitalism uses to devastate and divide
us? How can we build collectives that withstand the punitive
culture imposed by elite capture? How do we continue to
queer resistance, queer time, and wreck capitalism through
our very existence as well as our love for one another?
Two years after the last ocial Nightshade meeting, ve of
us gathered in a cabin on a snowy mountain in West Virginia.
We still nd each other on occasions such as this to sing songs,
play games, and dream up the endless possibilities for revolt.
We still love each other as chosen family.
Perhaps this story has no precise point, or perhaps it is
simply evidence that the collectives we make with our friends
are important manifestations of anarchist feminism, and we
must honor them in all of their complicated ts and starts.
The collective form is a crucial part of how we gather. It will
be messy and generative, and most important, it will not be

## THE COLLECTIVE AS A CRUCIAL FORM   /   29

forever, and that will come with uncertainty and grief. But
death work, like birth work, has always been the work of
women, trans people, and queers.
As anarchists and abolitionists in the midst of worldwide
ecological and social catastrophe, we need a trans feminist practice.
This is to say we need a practice of self and collective trans-
formation that ties us deeply into interdependent webs with
one another. We need a process that teaches us how to let
go of all that we cannot take into new worlds and allows us
to mourn all that the old world has taken from us. We need
the queer wisdom of knowing how to transition, change, and
grieve. We can only rest on our intangible knowing, the silent
spaces our words don’t always ll. This growing intuition
hums with immutable vibration.
Yes, this is an argument for the anarchist feminist collective
as a form. And this is a solidarity statement with all the
women and queers internationally, from Iran to Serbia and
back to Turtle Island, whose bodies and spirits are forced to
endure the ongoing violence of patriarchy. And this is a call
for the defense of the commons and the construction of new
ones worldwide, wherever and whenever possible. This is a
love story of ve to twenty-ve queer friends who at various
moments believed the worlds we were creating together had
the power to dismantle empires. This is a letter of gratitude,
to all who participated in Nightshade as collective members
as well as the people who came to our events, those who
critiqued us, and those who came before us and inspired us
to act.

May we continue to embrace the irrationality of dreams, joy
of surprise, soundness of ritual, and method of creating new
cultures of care and revolutionary practice through playful
rehearsal. May we continue to have faith in the supernatural,
the earth, and each other, and always ght for and with the
magic of life despite attempts around us to kill it. We hope
there is something for you in this story too.

This essay is the product of many months of reconnecting,
remembering, and discussion. The words were written by Flip
with essential contributions from Tahel, Elias, Ami, and Leo.

Tahel Axel (they/them) feels most at home hiking in big
mountains, and while making Shabbat with friends and
loved ones. They love spending time in the overgrowth
of postindustrial Pittsburgh, where they currently reside.
Tahel is working toward becoming a midwife and dreams
of dismantling the multilayered oppressions of our current
“health care” system.

Elias Lowe is a writer, student of natural medicine, and
committed friend currently living in Berlin. They spend their
time seeking connection with people and lands, and searching
for abolition in the everyday. They try to stay kind while raging
against the death of the planet. Elias thanks their comrades
and loves in Pittsburgh who grew them into a person who is
able to survive.

Ami Weintraub (he/they) is a Jewish anarchist writer and
rabbinic student. Ami’s work and community organizing focus
on building a world without domination where people can
freely connect to their cultures, lands, and bodies. They call
the hills of Pittsburgh and creeks of Silver Spring, Maryland,
home.

Leo Williamson-Rea (they/he) feels most at home near
water and loves the chaos magic of rerooting relationality. In
between mischief and healing, Leo enjoys spending time with
plants, singing songs in the moonlight, and learning dierent
means of defending what they love.

Flip Zang (he/him) is a writer and geohistorian born and
raised in Shawanwaki/Shawnee and Osage land (also known
as Pittsburgh). He likes to make music and ask big questions,
and can never decide which thing to love most.

Greetings, compas! Thanks for agreeing to talk with me. How would
you like to introduce yourselves?

We should start by saying that we aren’t a collective or formal
group. We see ourselves more as a small group of women
and nonconforming folks who are united by love, friendship,
and the struggle for freedom, autonomy, mutual aid, and life
against the dynamics of the current patriarchal state. We
come from dierent anarchist positions and understand things
dierently in many cases, but we come together to do things
jointly based on trust and the need to support our existence.
We live in dierent parts of Mexico City, where we carry out
most of our struggles.
Or to put it more poetically, we are women of all the res,
born in lands full of misery. Our lives are written in the wind,
and our struggles, loves, longings, and desires to change this
reality live in the sea, in the waves that beat furiously on the
rocks that contain them. Each one of us has her own history,
forged with smiles and tears. Each one walks alone, yet we are
strengthened by our paths that unite with the libertarian idea.
Our hair is interwoven, and we move forward together, trying
to be a support, company, and embrace, despite everything,
despite the uncertainty and this overwhelming moment,
despite the repression.
Survivors of the terrible, only the wind will know the
passion with which we once tried, at some moment, in some
time, for humanity to be strengthened by the beauty of mutual
cooperation and disobedience, without states, exchanges,
competition, and capitalism.

## OUR AFFINIT Y IS OUR MANIFESTO   /   35

Can you share with us how you came to your anarcha-feminist
positions, how you found one another, and how you decided to form
an affinity group?

Not all of us conceive of ourselves as anarcha-feminists.
We’re all anarchists, antiauthoritarians, and antipatriarchal,
yet we’ve never arrived at having a joint identity. We came
together based on the recognition that our own experiences
have provided. We’re a group that ranges from twenty to
forty years old. As such, we don’t all have the same paths,
trajectories, or positions.
All of our stories are individual ones, and each one took its
time. For some, what was important was the break with those
men who we believed to be compañeros, but who betrayed,
hurt, or snitched on us. With that we saw the crumbling of a
discourse that was just that: a discourse—and one that didn’t
delve deeply into how patriarchy runs through us. For others
of us, the reality of being women and feminized bodies was
always present: how we weren’t listened to or were made
invisible in political anarchist spaces; that only masculine
voices were respected; and that even when we sustained
various activities and a large part of the anarchist movement
in the city, we continued to be relegated to the margins and
unheard. So we assumed a position of defense and necessary
confrontation within the movement, which was exhausting,
but that helped us to be in this place today, together.
In a way, we lost our fear of separatism [femme-only
spaces], although we never stopped seeing that there are
men in this world we would have to interact with. We found
one another in mixed, anarchist movement spaces through

## 36 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

that recognition of oppressions intertwined with gender,
class, schooling, age, and others. Sometimes this process
of encounter was simultaneous to our male “compañeros”
dropping like ies due to reports of sexual or physical
aggression against other compañeras, which we could not
deny or support. We were left in a space limited to mostly
femme bodies where sisterhood and recognition occurred
among peers and through our own experiences. We were left
alone, or rather, we were dening our anities with greater
judgment—how great! We recovered our anity as feminized
bodies within the anarchist struggle. We recognized ourselves
as survivors.
From there, the conuence of our actions keeps us together.
We fully trust each other regarding our position with respect
to the state and the police, for example. We also know that
each one of us walks the path of self-management, and not
hand in hand with NGOs [nongovernmental organizations]
or human rights groups. This has given us much of the
condence and trust that we have—even though, we repeat,
we don’t all come from the same anarchist background. We
are united in our belief that our unwavering principles are an
essential part of our ethics.

What are your perspectives on the resurgent feminist movement in so-
called Mexico that began in 2018?

Although the “boom” in the feminist movement around the
world became more visible in the media in 2018, with massive
marches on March 8, strikes in universities in Chile, Mexico,
Spain, France, Italy, the United States, and so on, we hold that

## OUR AFFINIT Y IS OUR MANIFESTO   /   37

---

previous struggles can’t be left out of this upsurge. Whether
we like them or not, that includes approaches that we don’t
adopt—as seen, for example, in the proabortion discourses
that push for legislative and constitutional changes. We believe
that the struggle for the reappropriation of our bodies marks
an indisputable precedent; in some countries, the voices of
women and other bodies are beginning to be heard, and the
struggle for the right to decide for ourselves is strengthening.
And not just with respect to abortion but also with respect to
individual decisions around sexual pleasure.
In the case of Mexico and specically Mexico City, the
struggle was obscured, as it was appropriated by the state
and leftist government. The existence of a small oasis in
this country that provides noncriminalized abortion and
guarantees for gay persons loses force due to the state’s
interference in women’s bodies. For us, it is not enough for
the state to decriminalize abortion, we simply and plainly do
not want it to be in charge of regulating our sexuality and
controlling our bodies.
Yet it is true that in Mexico, we live in a very particular
situation that makes this boom urgent and inevitable. We’re
talking about the fact that in our territory, more than eleven
women are killed every day. A boom that, we must also
recognize, arrived late. What are we referring to? To the
murders on the northern border, in Ciudad Juárez, where the
neologism femicide was born during the 1990s. Why didn’t the
feminist boom explode then? Why was the massive murder of
working women on the border made invisible? Why were we
not outraged by so many bodies found scattered around the
desert?

## 38 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

It’s true that those were dierent times, and many of us
were children or had not yet been born. Nevertheless, we
believe that it goes beyond that; that it has to do with women
whose deaths did not “deserve” to cause indignation because
they were socially and morally devalued by the hegemonic
discourse. They were morally unacceptable for going out late
at night, for going out alone. They were invalidated under
the construction of bodies that simply do not matter: poor,
from the periphery, and workers. The state was lucky that
there wasn’t enough social courage for the entire country to
erupt at that point in the ght against death. Of course, at
that time there were feminist collectives, academics, and some
politicians who pointed out the need to look at this problem.
But we have to recognize that the state won that ght when,
to this day, we’re not even able to remember the names of
some of these women, when we nd it hard to say that we
didn’t see or know what to do and that the state imposed its
version of history. Unfortunately, the so-called feminist boom
can be read as an urgency to respond to the femicides of less
stigmatized bodies too—university students, professionals,
middle-class mothers, and so on—and it is equally regrettable
that even in this situation, the same categories are still used to
determine who gets named and who doesn’t, such as the poor,
whores, workers, and single mothers.
We like to think that the feminist boom is not 2018 and
nothing more, that women and feminized bodies don’t only
appear when the media and government decide to “recognize
us.” We like to think that we can honor our ancestors by
giving continuity to a struggle that we have joined, that we
did not originate, and that doesn’t answer to external agendas

or media attention but rather to an inevitable necessity where
we ght to stay alive and not forget any of our dead.

Street actions get a lot of attention, but beyond those, how have you all
been involved in the broader feminist movement?

As we’ve mentioned, we’re not a formal group, much less a
homogeneous one, and therefore the ways in which we’re
involved in the feminist movement are equally diverse.
Some of us accompany the anticarceral struggle, in which
some compañeras have faced charges after participating
in feminist actions or protests; others of us are involved in
graphic design, which continues to be necessary to visualize
the struggle in the streets and online; others are committed
to physical self-defense; others of us contribute through print
publishing; others are committed to radio work; yet others
are involved in the self-management of mental and physical
health; others have started and sustain spaces of resistance
such as bookstores, libraries, and cooperatives; and others
are involved in solidarity economies. In general, we’re all in
search of life and survival, which basically robs us of a lot of
time and energy.
Something that has become necessary to do together,
though, has to do with the precarious conditions that most
feminized bodies experience. In this regard, in 2020 [when
the pandemic began], we saw how women were at greater risk
due to the forced connement because they were with their
aggressors all the time. It was necessary to go out and call on
women to ght for life and occupy the streets. We called for the

## 40 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

creation of small markets, ea markets, and bazaars by and
for women—there were also trans and queer friends—with
the idea of surviving by exchanging the products we made
and to spread awareness about our self-managed projects.
The organizing that has occurred since the pandemic
has allowed for the opening of furrows where we’ve seen
self-management and rebellion ourish, and where we’ve
brushed its erce and faint breath with anarchy. That’s how
we found ourselves in the streets within a broader feminist
movement. This is not easy because there are many positions
and understandings within the movement that we don’t
necessarily coincide with, but we rmly believe that it is the
dierences that make us powerful.
We believe that maintaining a erce and voracious critique
against the state and capitalism permits us to not waste time
betting on lost struggles—for instance, for the approval of
laws that guarantee us security that in the majority of cases,
are applied against us or help to criminalize what is already
criminalized: the poor and racialized. But we also see that
especially in our context, in certain struggles, our critique
isn’t applicable—for example, the struggles undertaken by
the mothers of the disappeared or murdered. We don’t see
ourselves as having the ability or arrogance to tell them not
to seek “justice” from within institutions or not to engage in
dialogue with the representatives of power, because there are
many cases where that is impossible to avoid. On the contrary,
we see ourselves as deeply inspired by them, by their actions
and paths. We believe that it is those collectives that nourish
us and give us a lot of strength to continue.

## OUR AFFINIT Y IS OUR MANIFESTO   /   41

How would you describe your own general orientation when taking
action?

As we come from anarchism, and we have little by little been
breaking with its classical vision of struggle, we understand
that the struggle is found in all spaces, micro and macro.
Therefore we don’t see the need to wait for some moment
to intervene in this or that; rather, we believe in the necessity
of placing strain on the relations of domination—among
them gender and sex—in the spaces that we inhabit: families,
collectives, compañerxs, and ourselves. But we can’t do
that if we don’t struggle to make it clear that we exist, to
make a space for ourselves among the already established
structures of struggle, dissent, and society in general. That
same space gives us the opportunity to make our positions
clear, to go forward as we would like to live and according to
our principles—that is, outside the institutions, away from the
state, through direct action, self-management, and autonomy.
Contrary to the fashion of “visibility,” we position ourselves
through obscure and opaque daily action. Our action is our
own manifesto.

Speaking of taking action, what has your experience of participating
in feminist actions felt like, and what has it made possible that
previously might have seemed foreclosed to you?

A point of street action that seemed impossible was the
acceptance of the slogan “It was all of us” in a moment
when the white feminist discourse seemed to prevail and
the supposedly citizenly idea of the “good feminist” kept

## 42 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

appearing, almost to the point of them becoming the “police”
of the demonstrations, which they actually did with a citizen
call to protect women police ocers during the protests under
the argument that they were also “sisters” and “women.”1
Currently, this slogan has been taken up by more and more
compañeras in the street, and that is motivating, but we’d
still like to transcend the slogan, and see criminalization and
political correctness be challenged. Even so, hearing in unison
“It was all of us,” and taking on the rage of others as our own,
brings the body joy and rearms our presence in the streets.
We were not enlightened by 2018, so to speak. Many of
us had already traveled a long road in the anticapitalist and
autonomous struggle. It was anarchy that gave us the possibility
to position ourselves from a place of autonomy and have a
deep critique of what it is to struggle against the prevailing
system of domination. This path has given us immense
possibilities, necessary stumbles, and inevitable ruptures. We
have learned that from all of this, self-criticism, pressures,
and openings emerge. One opening was perhaps feminism,
which has swayed us with respect to many questions, leading
us to explore micro- and infrapolitical spaces. We approach
feminism to a greater or lesser extent and make critical
distinctions because we’re not convinced that there is only
one feminism, nor do we try to pursue it.
To place the body [in action] is, in this sense, to assume
our struggle from within ourselves and toward the outside.
To embody [feminist] struggle is to realize that part of it

    1. “Fuimos todas” (It was all of us) was a slogan used in response
to the direct actions carried out during feminist mobilizations. Instead
of pointing out those responsible for the actions to the police, everyone
chanted their complicity.

## OUR AFFINIT Y IS OUR MANIFESTO   /     43

corresponds with us, such that we suer and are not indierent
to it. The somatic experience of this is indistinct from all
we’re doing. Sometimes we are literally a ticking time bomb,
and sometimes we’re bodies that are vulnerable. Sometimes
we are lled with collective strength, and other times we feel
like weirdos and that we’re singled out to such a degree that
we become tiny. Sometimes we laugh out loud, and at other
times we simply weep in torrents.

What has it meant for you all to be an affinity group of feminist
anarchists participating in the movement and being there for each other
as opposed to going it alone?

We go alone and together. We believe in each other’s
individuality and the power of being together. But we know
that not all of us want or can take on the same things, or
have the same abilities, to mention a few dierences. Even
so, knowing that we exist as a rare and amorphous entity has
given us security in moving about our city. We know that if one
of us falls into the clutches of the police, there will be many
of us outside the police station or prison entrance. We know
that if one of us is sick, we’ll have another one accompanying
and caring for us. And we know that whatever idea we want
to carry out, we can share it and nd an echo among others.
In this way, we see that anity cannot be measured entirely
in political, strategic, and pragmatic terms but instead goes
hand in hand with how it transcends and traverses love,
friendship, and the struggle for survival. Are we in anity? Yes,
but we are also accomplices, sisters, friends, and compañeras.
We don’t just see ourselves as an anity group or meet

## 44 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

because of that. We do it because we care about each other’s
lives too, because we like to laugh together, eat together, cook
together, and believe that this is how we’ll be able to survive.
This encourages us a lot.

This is a broad question, but how do you articulate your own feminist
anarchism?

As we mentioned, we have dierent roots, and sexuality has
not aected each of us in the same way and that means many
things. The older members of our group grew up in a fairly
heterosexual anarchist scene, and therefore nonconformity
was more opaque or simply did not appear. Of course, we have
precious beings who are openly gay, but we understand, as the
anarchist scene here is heterosexual, that those bodies escape
from those spaces and construct their own. We recognize that
we came late to many criticisms in this sense, and little by
little we have learned to come out of the closet ourselves or
deconstruct our own sex-gender identity, although we don’t
see it as the core that denes us.
Indeed, we have a critique of identity. Sometimes it means
taking on an essence in order to act from a certain positionality,
but most of the time it blurs a series of dierences that to us, seem
necessary in order to walk together. Perhaps before indicating
our sexual identity, we start from the point of being “dark-
skinned” or Indigenous descendants—an inevitable matter
that situates us on the stage of antagonistic struggles and
more so in an essentially racist country. We are also poor;
we come from places and families that have always struggled
for survival.

## OUR AFFINIT Y IS OUR MANIFESTO   /   45

---

We’ve learned that we can’t generalize, even though there
are structures that aect all of us. And in that sense, we see
ourselves as distant from some groups of trans and nonbinary
people because we don’t share conditions of class or race. As
we have grown up marked by that racism, there are many
nonconforming spaces where we don’t feel comfortable,
or where that feeling of being seen as strange or exotic
accompanies us. Many queer and nonconforming spaces—
not all—are part of the art world, and we experience them as
white and hostile places. Likewise, some of these people take
part in the struggle from institutional, academic, or NGO
spaces—spaces denied to us and that we reject. Our reality
sometimes doesn’t allow us to understand their direction, and
many times we feel we don’t share the same concerns. Maybe
it has to do with us still struggling in a broader sense by not
abandoning the enormous desire to destroy the state and see
capitalism fall. Sometimes, the nonconforming compas focus
a lot on the construction of sex and gender and our positions
begin to bore them. Ha ha.
We don’t take identity as the starting point—even though
a few of us are nonconforming—but rather the practice
and ethics of our political actions, and anarchism on some
occasions has given us the answer to feeling comfortable with
our sexual and political dierences. We think it would be much
better if anarchism were nourished by questions of gender and
sexuality, and displaced the machismo and heteronormativity
that lives in its core, just as anarchism can bring important
questions to the queer and nonbinary struggles. In our ideal
dream, this mutual reciprocity goes hand in hand.

## 46 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

We also know that language is patriarchal, so we take on the
responsibility of thinking of new ways of naming ourselves,
and we are learning to do so.
We don’t trust cis men. Our space does not seek to directly
link with these compañeros. We don’t reject mixed spaces
of work or coexistence, but our primary anity is with
women and feminized bodies, as we mentioned earlier. The
relationship in mixed groups has almost always felt to us
like a utilitarian one stemming from supposed collective and
political positions. We’re not interested in feeling threatened
by or vulnerable to patriarchal thoughts.
Since the break with cis men in our spaces, we have seen
a conscious organizational advance from the perspective of
anarcha-feminism. Our presence in the streets and taking
on demands from an antipatriarchal perspective have been
fundamental to seeing and being in solidarity with others in
dierent latitudes. Understanding that women around so-
called Latin America are being murdered as a result of being
objectied as merchandise has given us the opportunity to
create spaces for dialogue to understand our realities. The
radicalization of demonstrations has called on us to denounce
and act against disappearances, femicides, and antiabortion.
Our anity is not only because we are women or
nonconforming; it is because in our actions, we seek a
radical rupture with traditional patriarchal impositions and
we see with pleasure that this rage is spreading, beginning
transcendent struggles. In some countries, this has been
initiated by women, and has been able to stay active due to
organizational persistence that emanates from our groups or
individualities.

## OUR AFFINIT Y IS OUR MANIFESTO   /   47

As for our aspirations, the least we try to do is walk toward
life in a dignied way, and toward death in a meaningful way,
even if it’s for ourselves. The maximum: social revolution, the
destruction of the capitalist-patriarchal system, the creation
of other forms of living life, although we’re not married to
the idea that someday this will appear; rather, we’re building
it as much as we can in the here and now.

## * * *
As for our informal anity group, we have no names that
dene us. Only the knowledge that nature is everything and
humanity is destruction. To change that is our path.

Even though it is our fingers that hit the keyboard, the countless hours
spent working, chatting, and organizing with our fellow anarcha-
feminist librarians and broader network led to these words. True to
our ways, we speak on nobody else’s behalf, yet we recognize our deep
interdependence and write with what we feel is the “spirit” of the
whole group in mind.

The Anarcha-Feminist Library of Toulouse, or Bibliothèque
Anarcha-Féministe—fondly called la BAF, a wordplay on the
French bae, meaning “slap,” or just la bibli—is a couple-
thousand-book-rich self-organized library in a major city in
the southwest of France. We rent a place, Au Chat Noir (At the
Black Cat), together with four other organizations, including a
chapter of an anarcho-syndicalist / revolutionary syndicalist
union, a local anarchist group, an antifascist group, and an
anarchist-communist group. Additional organizations, such
as a trans support group, fat-positive feminist zine-making
group, and discussion group against borders, are regular users
of the space. The library is, in a way, the shop front of the
building: whether you enter Au Chat Noir for an organizing
meeting, movie night, or support group, you can’t fail to
notice the thousands of colorful books happily displayed on
wooden shelves as well as the comfortable chairs, blankets,
and rugs made for snuggling up with a novel and herbal tea.
In practice, we’re open on Wednesday and Sunday after-
noons—recently, we’ve been opening on Friday afternoons
too, for a special “quiet library session” during which we
keep the space as silent as possible to make it accessible to
people who are otherwise disturbed or impaired by chatty or
noisy environments—with frequent book or feminism-related

events in between. It’s a fun and quite telling fact that when
most activities are more or less paused during the summer in
Toulouse, in summer 2022 we were actually open one extra
afternoon per week, just because it’s a nice place to hang out,
chill, or work on personal projects, and those of us who were
staying in Toulouse during those months were happy to spend
yet another day at la BAF.
Borrowing books is free; we do not track or register
borrowers, and don’t set a time limit on how long people use
a book (we just ask that people keep in mind that others might
want to read the same book, and so remember to bring it back
when nished or given up on). Taking books home is easy, as
borrowers need only write the titles down in a notebook along
with a name/alias and cross out the entries once they bring
them back.
But let’s not spoil everything for you in this intro! Dear
reader, will you dare push the paper door of la BAF open and
follow a few funky tea-and-vegan-cake-addicted, extroverted-
introverted librarians down the path?

## HOW TO SET UP AN ANARCHA-FEMINIST LIBRARY

The library was born from the collision of a pile of books and
a space.1 It has changed and is still evolving with the people
we’ve met along the way.
Books came rst: via a kleptomaniac friend who plundered
Toulouse’s independent bookshops but had to move and leave
some of their treasure behind, some gifts from families and
friends, extra copies from other anarchist libraries, and a

crowdfunding campaign to buy books on anarchist women
when I was a student. As for the building, the local syndicalist
union had lost its meeting space, and along with other
anarchist and antifascist groups, oated the idea of renting
a spot to be shared for our own projects, that of other like-
minded collectives, and/or people from the neighborhood
who might want to start a social center or host community
activities.
I was part of one of these groups at the time, and initially
we meant to manage the library as one of the collective
features of the space. Many anarchist/revolutionary spaces in
France have such a library, yet it often collects dust and isn’t
used much.
When the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement in France
started in November 2018, it created a strong division in
the group that I was part of (as it did in the wider anarchist
movement) around whether and/or how to engage with this
uprising. The gilets jaunes’ struggle centered on the cost
of living, and was driven at rst largely by Far Right and
conspiracist movements, although it then morphed into a
class-based movement for dignity and against police violence.
Interpersonal conicts were added to the gilet jaunes’
disagreements in my group, and we lost most of our members
and then merged with another group.
I wasn’t involved in the main debates around the gilets
jaunes. I was rather critical of any kind of social movement
premised on momentary bursts of intensity and simply
pointing to the failures of structures like capitalism. For me at
least, this wasn’t a sustainable way to work toward liberation,
especially because this recurring pattern feels both mentally

## TEA , BOOKS, AND THRESHOLDS   /   53

---

and physically exhausting. I was more involved in dealing
with the interpersonal conicts, but it soon became apparent
that beneath a supercial agreement on accountability and
conict resolution, our tools and principles were co-opted by
certain people in our group to justify the unjustiable and
avoid challenging any of their own behaviors.
A few months later, I was no longer part of any group and
yet didn’t want to give up the eorts made in working with the
dierent local groups to open a space.
When a shared space was rented, it started in the image of
the “ocial” anarchist organizations in France—in particular,
extremely male dominated—so despite my hesitations, I
decided to help set it up. Having to work across organizational
barriers forced me and everyone else to be more civil and
accountable toward each other—to care more about others.
The space appealed to me because I wanted a project on
a longer timescale, with continuous yet limited eort (as
opposed to movement building) for my own well-being. Then
too, I wanted to focus on establishing strong, dependable, and
honest interpersonal relationships by working directly and
practically with other people, as opposed to taking positions in
an abstract way as part of a group and caring more about how
the group would be perceived by the rest of the revolutionary
movement than about how we treated each other.
Once the library was created (as a project; we had not yet
joined Au Chat Noir at this point), we thought about whether
we wished to be a women-and-queer-only group and decided
against it, although we were quite happy that our rst public
appeal had only been answered by women and queers. We
then requested to join Au Chat Noir as a separate group—or
at least to try, because I assumed that it wouldn’t be easy to

## 54 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

get the other groups in the space to tolerate this notion. What
I didn’t realize was how much these other groups needed
people to do the actual job of making the space come alive—
that is, by the women and queer people who showed up—and
what they had to gain by having a “feminist” token group to
share the overall project with.
Au Chat Noir invited us to a meeting to discuss the idea
of us joining. There are at least two diverging accounts of
how this meeting went. In my version, although I was upset
at having to face the person who had driven me to quit my
former group not long before, I expected little from the groups
comprising the building. So when we were given the keys and
a time slot to open the library, I was over the moon. We had
approached other spaces, but none were as well tted to what
we had in mind. These other spaces were often sympathetic
but private businesses where people would feel pressured
into, say, paying for drinks and so on, when it was essential
to us that our library shouldn’t have this kind of setting. The
version from the other three people goes like this: they were
not enthused by the people who called us “comrades” (which
is not a term that we ever used and was rather o-putting)
and were still condescending despite their best eorts, but
they decided not to challenge them as they knew I was tired
of conict.
We all remember that the meeting was way too long,
running past the breaking of the fast for Ramadan, so we
cut it short as politely as we could and drove to Kentucky
Fried Chicken.

## THE DRAFTS OF BIT TERNESS

Outside the time when the library was open, those of us
with la BAF only communicated using the “Drafts” folder
of an email address that all four of us had access to. What
this meant was that when we received emails regarding Au
Chat Noir’s maintenance that were not always kind or caring,
one of us would immediately draft a response that got saved
in the “Drafts” folder, such that we could all edit along—in
a crude, pre–Google Drive version of collaborative writing.
Others would then add things such as “I can’t believe they
did this. ... But is telling them to fuck o a good approach
strategically?” Then the email draft would either become a civil
yet rm response, one edit at a time, or devolve into an outlet for
us to vent about whatever was going on, creating a weird
collage of anger, jokes, and political analysis that helped us
cope with the (rare) negative experiences we encountered
with other groups.
Sometimes we shied away from raising an issue because
we were tired and felt discouraged at the prospect of writing
our grievance down for others in the space. But it helped to
share our feelings with each other in the early stages, focusing
on what we wanted to achieve, and whether it was fair and
reasonable or counterproductive, all things considered. More
often than not, ranting in a draft email was sucient, and
allowed us to calm down and realize we had less to gain from
stirring up an issue than we had in ignoring it and instead
strengthening ourselves so as to proactively intervene in—and
stop—similar occurrences in the future. Sometimes another
form of action was taken: we wrote and shared a calmer email,

## 56 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

or engaged in a face-to-face discussion; in a few instances,
the drafts were polished into angry emails to individuals or
groups in the space. In all cases, drafting emails to each other
and talking about them collectively gave us time to reect
together, and take everyone’s emotions, distress, and concerns
into account, especially because many people found it easier
to express themselves in writing. The “drafts of bitterness”
were our way to hold space for our feelings while at the same
time working together as a group away and up from feelings
to political stances. It was a practice of community care, and
helped us become wiser in when and how to raise concerns
and take actions—even if it meant having a Pandora’s box of
spite and rage tucked away somewhere.
But let me return to the how-tos of our anarcha-feminist
library.

## REARRANGING OUR SHELVES AND SELVES

The books we had at the beginning were mostly on the
history of social movements and historical anarchist women.
We wanted the library to be in tune with movements as
they exist today and the issues they are dealing with. At that
time in France, there was an emerging feminist theory that
was against capitalism and the state, and advocated for the
abolition of prisons. There was a will (strongly repressed by
the government and media) to challenge French republican
“universalism” and talk about racism. The queer and crip
movements were also starting to publish their rst books
(zines and pamphlets already existed).
So we started collecting more feminist and queer books,
particularly titles that seemed essential. We began attempting

## TEA , BOOKS, AND THRESHOLDS   /   57

---

to decolonize the works in our library by being vigilant about
what social movements we were still ignoring. At the same
time, we wanted to oer novels, poetry, plays (which are
just as political as nonction books), graphic novels (which
are extremely popular and oer many testimonies of life on
the margins), and books for younger people so as not to
exclude anyone.
While all of that sounds easy enough, we’ve run into all
sorts of dilemmas when aspiring to ll out our shelves. Or to
put it another way, our library has taught us much about the
world and ourselves—in generative ways that only aid la BAF
in living up to its anarcha-feminism.
In terms of feminist books, here in France at least, feminism
sells, and many mainstream publishers go along with this fad.
Some great books are published, but also many ersatz ones,
with any radical content expunged, meaning it’s harder to nd
those with liberatory and/or anarchist content. For example,
we haven’t always known what to do about feminist second-
wave classics, many of which have outdated, “problematic”
content about race, transness, or sex work, to name a few. So we
have regular discussions on books that oer “representation”
only, but are not necessarily well written or have little radical
content apart from presenting, say, queer characters (which
is radical in itself given the publishing landscape in France).
Our “process” for choosing books becomes most obvious
when we receive some as gifts from visitors: many times we
just sit around a pile of books none of us have read, skimming
through the pages and glancing skeptically at the cover,
pondering whether they are worth adding. Decisions are hard
to make, and sometimes we excavate a pile of undecided-on

## 58 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

books in the meeting room, a sign from past librarians failing
to choose to keep or dump them. It mostly comes down to
deciding by the “vibe” among us—and if a book is removed
later because the vibe changes, so be it.
Then, too, reading Afro-feminist Fania Noël made us
aware of a bias on our shelves: we had much more about
Black liberation in the United States—such as works by
Angela Davis and bell hooks—than in France and its (former)
colonies. We had already had a similar discussion on how
Emma Goldman is viewed as the one anarchist woman and we
needed to correct that misperception by the titles we oered
in our library. Each book, with its quotes and bibliography,
made us discover more authors. And the journey goes on ...
When we started this task of decolonizing our space, I
thought it was just about adding more diverse references.
Only recently have I realized what should have been obvious
all along: reading these books, relating to them critically, has
changed my worldview, and how I consider social issues and
sometimes even relate to people.
Questioning why hooks was one of the most requested
and borrowed authors at our library, for instance, led me to
understand that while her writings are precious in preguring
a way to act together with men and across color lines, they
also can be read as notions easy to accept on a supercial
level, without changing much in the way we do things.
Philosopher Norman Ajari, on the other hand, has done a
tremendous amount of work in making Afro-pessimism
known to French readers. From an anarchist point of view,
Afro-pessimism reminds us that structures of power do not
stop running through us only because we know how to name

## TEA , BOOKS, AND THRESHOLDS   /   59

---

them; we need autonomous groups with enough power that
they can’t be disregarded in order to start envisioning as well
as building a revolutionary movement together.
In Toulouse, the feminist and queer movements are close,
and these interpersonal networks have meant that for a long
time, the library has been run exclusively by LGBTQ people.
A trans collective meets weekly in our space, for example,
and makes the library available as part of the other services it
oers. Queer literature is always in high demand.
Toulouse also has a number of antiableism and deaf
groups. Our space is not yet accessible for wheelchair users
(some wheelchair users have visited the space, but the
conditions in which we welcome them are not satisfactory).
We are working (extremely slowly) with the other groups in
the building on accessibility issues, and have recently gathered
enough books on these topics to ll a shelf on disability and
deaf cultures. This is quite obviously the area, though, where
most improvement is urgently needed.

## KEEPING THE DOORS OPEN

It has happened more than a few times that when I was
talking about la BAF to someone, I preferred using the more
politically neutral phrase “associative library,” which in France
refers to a community or nonprot organization, instead of
using “anarcha-feminist”—knowing that the overtly political
name could lead to heated reactions.2 Indeed, on a few
occasions when I called la BAF by its name, I’ve been met
with harsher reactions such as, “Oh, so you’re one of those

women yelling all tits out!” True story. Several of us have
had similar experiences, reecting the lack of knowledge or
even awareness about feminist movements, or antagonism
toward them.
There are, of course, many dierent ways to conduct the
struggle, including by creating warm, welcoming spaces like
la BAF. You don’t have to protest loudly and bare chested,
though that is certainly one of many ways to engage. To each
their own ways to ght; to each their own ways to express and
relate to resistance.
But how do we explain any of this to people not already in
our circles? The activist milieu in Toulouse, however diverse
and dynamic, remains relatively closed (which is also a way
to protect ourselves, as we’ll develop later). We run the risk
of staying in a comfortable, familiar, secluded environment
in which ideas circulate in a locked-in system among like-
minded peers. It is thus necessary to nd a balance between
community protection and permeability.
That’s why, in order to spread our ideas but also make the
library and its activities known, a key part of la BAF’s direct
actions involve going out to meet people. It allows us to chat,
share, and in a way, put faces and voices to ideas on a yer or
information found online. We are often present at music gigs,
activist events, and neighborhood forums. And we never cease
to be amazed at how quickly and comfortably people stop by
to talk and open up to us, sometimes in an intimate way. For
example, as a nurse and advocate for respectful gynecologic
and obstetric practices, I’ve had a few discussions about
gynecologic abuse while tabling in a corner of, say, a concert
hall. Easily enough, people put their trust in us because they

suppose la BAF, as feminist, is a “safe space.” Even though
this inference is not exactly correct, it sets people at ease. And
it helps them to dare to go through the door of our library.
Doing outreach outside la BAF allows us to be better
understood and more widely known, but allows us to grow
our space and ourselves as well. For instance, we’ve ended
up exchanging contact information with people we didn’t
know beforehand because they’re interested in holding their
own events at Au Chat Noir, such as popular education
conferences, or conférences gesticulées in French—a popular
education technique that’s half stand-up comedy and half
conference—lm screenings, and arpentages—another popular
education technique that consists of ripping a book into parts,
then each participant has to read the pages they took on their
own, and nally the group reconvenes to share each person’s
takeaway from their reading, “rebuilding” the torn book
through the words and experiences of the eight or ten people
who read some of its contents. We also gather ideas for new
books to buy, zines on underrepresented topics, and new types
of support groups. Meeting outside la BAF is a profoundly
enriching experience, equally crucial to the life of the library
as the actual space.

## TO BE OR NOT TO BE A SAFE SPACE

An important thing to know about la BAF is that it’s not a
safe space.3 This fact may seem surprising or even shocking
because, from a feminist cultural perspective, safety in general
and safe spaces in particular have been central demands. So

     3. This section was written by Éris.

how could this be?
To understand why our anarcha-feminist library isn’t a safe
space, we rst have to understand what a safe space is (or
rather, would be). A safe space is a place, actual or virtual
(online groups or forums can be deemed “safe,” for example),
in which marginalized people are not at risk of violence or
discrimination. Safe spaces are framed using armative
(“LGBTQI+ people are welcome”) or negative (“no racism,
ableism, homophobia, transphobia ... allowed”) language,
frequently doubled up with regulatory means (moderators
and mediators, “safety teams,” or people in charge of
intervening when somebody seems to disrespect the frame,
often by kicking them out and taking care of the person who
may have been hurt).
Safety, however, is itself a problematic concept.
First o, there is never any way to ensure 100 percent safety.
It’s all just harm reduction. Presenting a space as “safe” might
actually make it less safe because if people walk in expecting
to be shielded from any and all harm (each carrying their
own sense of safety and own vulnerabilities based on their
personal history), they are defenseless—and even more at risk
from harm.
Second, we typically focus on what we want to be safe from;
violence, discrimination, and so on, are experiences we seek
to avoid. What if we instead asked ourselves, What are we
safe to? Indeed, anarcha-feminist spaces—or any militant
or “alternative” space, really—seek empowerment—that is,
to enable people to do things that the larger/global society
prevents or discourages. And while being safe to certainly
requires a fair amount of safety from, there is a point where

## TEA , BOOKS, AND THRESHOLDS   /   63

---

the two might contradict because ...
Third, in a society rife with discrimination of all kinds,
demanding that an individual not engage in any of them is
nearly, if not completely, impossible. As activists, we are (or
should be) constantly learning, questioning our previous and
current beliefs, listening to dierent views, and addressing
issues as they arise. People who come into our spaces are not
blank pages; they’ve soaked up a deeply unfair society. We
can ask them—and each other—to put in the work, question
their (often unconscious) prejudices, and listen to those people
they may come to harm, but we can’t ask that they know
“everything” before they even join in our projects. In fact, a
social justice culture that revolves around the usage of certain
words and presents certain issues as somehow denitive (as if
marginalized people never disagree on language or strategy)
is likely to generate “correctness anxiety,” making individuals
(especially young or new to the struggle) afraid to speak or act
lest they oend someone. Such “safe” spaces are not accessible
because the amount of knowledge needed to come in is
deeply elitist. They are not empowering either if one has to
constantly walk on eggshells.
And nally, contrary to “safety,” what we need is resilience.
We need to generate spaces, both social and actual, in which
mistakes are gently remarked, trying is praised, and expressing
one’s discomfort is met with thankfulness and the knowledge
that it’ll allow us to grow. Resilience isn’t about not being hurt
in the rst place; it’s about recovering from hurt. A resilient
space is not one in which people never fall; it is one in which
falling is OK because there is no hard ground to seriously
injure us, and there are comrades to help us get back up again.

## 64 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

La BAF is not a safe space. It is a space to relax, read,
study, or otherwise chill in; a space that opens up onto the
neighborhood, with large, colorful windows; a space that is
free to attend, of course, and anyone can wander in or out.
Obviously, we—the volunteer librarians—would intervene
if anything disrespectful or harmful happened, but there is
no way to make sure that such things won’t happen. That’s
because, for starters, we are de facto a public place, and there
are a certain number of people out there who are less than
happy about anarchism, feminism, or even open libraries;
we have no bulky security guard to throw petty fascists out by
the collar.
We’re also, so to speak, an intermediary place. La BAF
aspires to be a threshold and hopefully a door: we want people
to come in because of the pretty books and free cookies, stay
because they feel comfortable, and come back because they
want to share our struggles or support them. We are aware
we fail, and will keep failing, at being a door. Books are
frightening or at least intimidating to many, and our own ease
with being around books could make us seem elitist. But this
manner of acting as a door, an open way into the struggle, is
constitutive of who we are.
Some people who walk into the library may have never
met a trans person in their lives or someone who’s openly
queer. How could they be anything but ignorant of the ways
trans people and queers have developed among themselves?
Sure, we’ll—gently—correct them when they use incorrect
pronouns, or use outdated language about disabilities (Is there
even a language that disabled people among ourselves agree
on?) or race (the same question applies). Yet it will happen.

## TEA , BOOKS, AND THRESHOLDS   /   65

People will use improper language. People will ask improper
questions or make less-than-informed comments. They will.
They just will. And we’ll do our best to share what little we
know with them.
We’ll try to be as safe a space as possible. But we can’t be
a safe space. And between us, we think safe spaces simply
don’t exist.
Which, you know, is probably a good thing. Only from
places where uncertainty and discomfort remain can we meet
with people unlike ourselves, and share and learn from each
other to build a world more resilient and kind.

## ON DOING NOTHING, AND ALL THE WORK IT ENTAILS

And there we stand on the threshold, the anarcha-feminist
librarians.4 It is peculiar indeed to act the part. Sometimes the
best thing to do is nothing at all. Strangely, this may take more
work than you would expect.
This may seem a little weird at rst. We organize because we
want to do things after all—usually a whole lot of things. But
one of our goals at the library is to create (a) space for others.
A space where people can come to explore, experiment, and
enjoy; where they’re free to do their own things and be their
own selves. So sometimes what we need to do is nothing. Move
back and open up some space for others to breathe.
Is it worth it? YES! When at last you sit back, sip some tea,
and look at people doing their own cool stu in the space you
helped create, it can make your heart swell with pride. And
sometimes they will even want to do things with you too! How

cool. But it’s a lot of work to get there!
Because just doing nothing is not enough. You need to set
up the stage a little, do some prep work. There are a lot of
things to do before you can do nothing at last!
First, of course, you have to make people want to come to
your place.
So you probably need to do some cool things of your own,
you know, to jump-start things a little. To set a tone.
And you need to keep at it. Be open and reliable. Even
when you do a screening of this cool movie, and the room is
half empty. Or when you open the library for the afternoon,
and nobody shows up ... three times in a row. Persist! If you
do things that you enjoy anyway, they will always be a success.
Even if it’s just you and a few friends.
And advertise of course. If people don’t know about you,
all the doing nothing in the world will not amount to anything.
Social networks are good for that, but you need to be OK
with taking part in the system, so ... your call! Reach outward.
Maybe there are alternatives, such as local mailing lists. Go
see other people who do stu you like and talk to them. Have
some yers in your bag and give them away.
Then you want people to stay.
Try to make things cozy. Have some nice places to sit,
eat, and dream. Label food or keep the packaging around
so that people can check what they can eat on their own.
When it’s cold, bring blankets and spread them around the
space liberally.
Make tools available. Make it clear it is possible to do things,
that this place is a space to express oneself. Oer inspiration.
You want to encourage people to do things by themselves.

## TEA , BOOKS, AND THRESHOLDS   /   67

---

Try to provide clear means of guidance about what is
possible and how things work. With drawings, not just words,
if possible. You don’t want people to depend on you to
explain everything but instead to get used to doing things by
themselves and running the place with you.
If people always have the same question, it could be a sign
that something is missing. Can you supply them with the
means to gure it out by themselves next time?
Take care of people. Reduce their mental load. Empower
them to make decisions.
You also need to be there, of course. Open the place. Tidy
up a little. Bring some sort of food (important!) and brew
a pot of tea (extra important!). And since you’re running a
library, choose a good book to read—but not too good, since
you won’t have time to read it anyway.
So the place is set, the tea is hot, and you’re starting to
think that maybe, just maybe, for this once you will have some
time to read this damn book ... and that’s when they come in.
Now is not quite the time to do nothing yet!
Your job is now to make them cross not only the threshold
from outside to inside but also from outsider to insider.
Ask questions and let them give the answers. Good starting
questions are, “Did you come for the library?”—usually an
easy one—and “Do you want a tour, or do you prefer to
browse?” Let them decide how much space they want. Don’t
overload them. Let them breathe. Let them lead the pace.
Try to tell them, or better yet show them, that this is a place
for people to do things, and so they can too. If the place is set
so it’s obvious, even better.
Once they’re satised, let them know you’re available if

## 68 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

they need help. And make sure you’re available if they need it.
You want to make this place and moment theirs as much
as yours.
If you’ve been good enough, they may even start doing
cool stu on their own. Don’t be disappointed if they don’t,
though. Most people may not be up to it, and that’s OK. But
that can only happen if you’re not already taking the space.
So now, at long last, is a good time do nothing! Serve some
tea (you did remember to brew some tea, right?), look at your
book (just look at it, don’t read it; remember, be available!).
Let them own the place.
And sometimes, just sometimes, they will come back to
you and your space with a re in their eyes and a head full
of plans.
And everything becomes possible again.

Libertie: So it feels funny introducing myself since I
already know you, but because there are people listening in,
here goes! I’m a nonbinary trans woman in my late thirties
living in Southern Appalachia on Cherokee land. I’ve been
involved in anarchist organizing since the late 1990s and early
aughts, mostly in the South, and since 2008, I’ve been part of
Firestorm, a queer anarchist feminist collective in Asheville,
North Carolina. For the last seven years, our focus has been
on running a radical bookstore where we also host events and
provide accessible community resources.

Xela: I’m really blessed to have nally met you in person
at the Institute for Advanced Troublemaking’s summer camp
class of 2019. Firestorm has shown support to our projects
and various spaces throughout the years, and we are super
grateful for that. Our collective is eleven years old now. We
are unapologetically detribalized feminist anarchists, and run
Casa C. O. A. T. L. aka The Shed, an autonomous anarcho-
feminist space on occupied Tongvaland, and run by members
of the OVAS—One Very Angry Squad, which was previously
called the Ovarian Psycos cycling brigade. Growing in our
analysis, solidifying our politics, and taking up space beyond
the bicycle has become our primary focus as it allows us the
opportunity to create the world we are ghting for, at least
here for a moment, while we are still alive.

Libertie: Can you tell me a little bit more about Casa
C. O. A. T. L.?

Xela: This is our third autonomous community-based space

in Boyle Heights, a neighborhood in Los Angeles. The last
two spaces were generally open to just about anybody, and
many organizing circles formed out of the rst space, La
Conxa. We had nonstop community events and various
organizing projects, including tenant defense, KYR [know
your role] workshops, and study circles, punk/hip-hop shows,
movie nights, open mics, and fundraisers toward endless
causes, funerals, and solidarity eorts. The second La Conxa
continued in this we’ll-rest-when-we’re-dead type of urgency.
It was exhausting and clearly not sustainable.
At the new location, Casa C. O. A. T. L., we seemed to be
heading in the same direction till COVID hit, and then we
nally took a step back to reect and check in with our hearts,
spirits, bodies, and mentals. Plus the space, still rough, has
taken us about two to three years now of ongoing rehab
work. Yet the FTP [fomenting theory and praxis] community
defense anity group has had biweekly food and clothing
distributions as well as a garden it started in the back. We
now have a media room, where we are still experimenting
with multimedia projects, and we also provide mutual aid and
prisoner solidarity eorts with screen-printing projects. Lastly,
we have a room for emergency housing specically for femme,
trans, and gender-nonconforming comrades who we know,
should it be needed.
More than anything, this space is signicantly dierent than
the other two locations we’ve had mostly because our politics
have shifted from mass organizing to now prioritizing our own
needs and practicing being more intentional about building
intimate relationships as we rebuild our ability to trust. Our
last space was heavily attacked by authoritarians, which sadly

## 74 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

included individuals we once organized shoulder to shoulder
with under the now-defunct Defend Boyle Heights Coalition.
The attacks have left scars, but along with the pandemic, the
course of events forced us to insulate ourselves, allowing us
to reevaluate and reimagine a sort of sanctuary or cocoon
from which we can now explore our individual passions and
interests. We’ve been cementing our politics, our boundaries,
and collective care as we continue building on our skills while
deepening our commitment and capacity. Ultimately our goal
for our current space, Casa C. O. A. T. L. aka The Shed, is to
shed all the ways we were burning ourselves out and focus
our energies on multimedia, anarchist, antiauthoritarian, and
femme of Indigenous descent propaganda.

Libertie: It’s beautiful that you’ve created the spaces you
need for each step of your collective journey. I guess I should
share more about our physical space, since that’s something
we have in common! At the time of this conversation [in
2022], Firestorm is in its second location, a retail storefront in
the commercial corridor of a residential neighborhood. We
started o running a dierent kind of space downtown—a
café, because that’s what we had experience with. None of
us had worked in bookstores. When we left downtown, it was
an opportunity to grow into something new, and we picked a
space we thought would be good for books.
Our collective rst heard about y’all [the OVAS] in 2017.
We screened the documentary lm Ovarian Psycos about your
activities in East LA and thought you were the dreamiest,
coolest, most badass anarcha-feminists in the entire world. So
when you and I met in 2019 at the Institute for Advanced

Troublemaking, I was already a fan!

Xela: Oh, that’s so sweet. Thank you, but really we, or I
should say I, don’t know what the fuck I’m doing. I, like most
folks, am just trying to gure shit out, print, love myself, and
fuck shit up on my bicycle when I can.

Libertie: Bikes are such a cool starting point for a collective.
I mean, I’ve heard about radical spaces that started with a
study group or house shows, but it’s really unique to begin
as a bike crew. Anarcha-feminists on bikes reminds me of
the lm Born in Flames from the 1980s, which starts with a
women’s bike gang doing street interventions, like confronting
patriarchal men and responding to assaults. Can you tell me
more about how y’all got started?

Xela: So a couple of things happened at the same time. As
is still the case today unfortunately, femmes of all ages are
disappearing everywhere, including back-to-back instances of
femmes murdered in our communities specically, generat-
ing the desire to do something other than be fearful. And
not wanting to instill fear in my daughter, not wanting to
normalize misogyny or femicide but instead to reclaim our
collective strength and ride at night, and intentionally take up
the road, streets, corners, parks, and hills—all the locations
where femmes had been killed—for the purpose of becoming
a force to kill patriarchy, seemed more therapeutic and healing
to us than lighting a candle at a vigil ever would.
In February 2010, I took my daughter to pick out a bicycle
for her birthday, and she picked out a black one with orange

and red ames, and the man working at the bike shop kept
telling us that we were in the wrong section of the bike store
and the “girls’ bikes” were on the other side. I exchanged
some words about how silly the idea of gendering a fucking
bicycle was, and proceeded to demand that he either charge
me for the bicycle that my daughter wanted or we would just
take it and call it his gift to her. He shut the fuck up real quick;
we paid and left the store content with my daughter’s bicycle.
I taught her how to ride it right away and was struck by
her fearlessness to be honest. And we began riding together
weekly and talking about how legit it would be to start a crew.
She recommended the name Fire Riders. Aw! But then we
both really fell in love with the idea of playing with the psyco
and cycle phonetics of it all. And then my car broke down
soon after that, and one day on my way home from work on
my bicycle, cars where literally at a standstill and everybody
driving a car was visibly pissed because the streetlights had
stopped working and so I remember maneuvering through all
of that congested trac feeling like, fuck yeah, on my bicycle
I may just be unstoppable—at least as it relates to trac.

Libertie: That’s fantastic! You’ve been an anarchist and
feminist for a long time. It sounded like maybe you got started
in the punk scene, is that right?

Xela: I was an angry kid. I had a lot of rage and frustration,
and punk spoke to that, but what was really awesome and
unexpected were the groups and collectives with zines and
mutual aid projects at the shows that redirected my rage in
a way that gave more context and the possibility to create

some dope shit with, whether that was music or collectives
or other community projects, and build with folks who also
understood and were down to make something beautiful
out of the ugliness we live in. Then the Zapatista uprising
sprouted a new movement here on the Eastside, reconnecting
us to our roots, but with a much more political foundation and
motivation that went beyond the aesthetics of our culture,
really calling us to examine our place in history, our ties to the
land, and ignite collective eorts in that spirit of Indigenous
rebellion. The work with the PSYCOS has very much been
inuenced by my rst collective, Cihuatl Tonali, identifying
as urban Indigenous femmes, but many of us had come from
punk shit. Just being angry knuckleheads, and for a fact at
least back then, we identied hard core as Brown feminists
of Indigenous descent and still anarchist. Made for this shit.
To fuck shit up and smash the state. But maybe just a little
dierent like, fuck the state. Create a world without asking
anyone’s permission.

Libertie: The Zapatistas have always embodied such
incredible Indigenous feminist politics, it makes sense that
they would be an entry point for your radicalization. I’m a
few years behind you, so I got into anarchism in the late 1990s
and then really started to understand myself as being part
of a movement after the Battle of Seattle. That trajectory of
global resistance owed an enormous debt to the Zapatistas.
I identied as a feminist before I was an anarchist. Growing
up in a rural part of the South, being a feminist was the rst
“radical” identity I embraced. As a kid, I didn’t really know
anyone who claimed feminism, so it seemed sort of edgy. It’s

## 78 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

not like there weren’t feminists in Southern Appalachia. I
grew up not that far from bell hooks, but nobody told me
about bell hooks. Instead I knew about Dolly Parton, who I
idolized as a kid. It’s funny that for liberal feminists, Dolly is
a sort of icon, even though she won’t even use the f-word. As
a young adult, I started getting really excited about feminisms
that were more aggressive and less interested in the success of
middle- and upper-class white women.

Xela: You telling me about how you grew up reminds
me that it’s also super important that a lot of us here on
the Eastside grew up under a lot of religious dogma, the
omnipotent patriarchy of god, and for example, myself living
under those conditions, the violence of subjugation. A lot
of us in some form or another get pressed into submission,
surrendering our power, bodies, desires, and dreams, under
threat of punishment by god, the criticisms of society, and/
or the disownment of our fathers and/or brothers, and by
extension the authority of our mothers perpetuating that—at
least that was what I lived. Anywhere, any space that’s created
that is not that, spaces like Firestorm, for instance, or like here
on the Eastside, are crucial to us throwing o that submission
and guring out what we want for ourselves. Besides us
here in occupied Tongvaland, there’s the Eastside Café,
an autonomous community space; Corazón Del Pueblo, a
collective, volunteer-run cultural center; and today, Memories
of El Monte, a QTPOC community arts and mutual aid
space. These spaces need to multiply and exist everywhere.
Tell me what inspired y’all and how Firestorm got started.

## UNSANCTIONED SANCTUARIES   /   79

Libertie: I was one of the folks who started the Firestorm
Collective back in 2008. We understood ourselves as feminists
and anarchists, but in the beginning we didn’t really put those
labels on our project because we weren’t sure how people
would respond. So we were organizing as anarchists, but we
didn’t tell our community for the rst year. Later we learned
that it was really important to be honest about who we were
and that people would actually be excited to support an
explicitly radical space. That’s the rst big thing I remember
being wrong about. The rst of many!

Xela: I hear that. We had similar misgivings about how to
identify likely cuz of our inexperience, and just being happy
that other femmes wanted to come ride bicycles in these
streets at night to bark at the car when a man would drive
by whistling or join us when we stopped at the detention
centers to rage out “Fuck the police!” I assumed everybody
coming out to the rides would clearly have to be feminist and
anarchist, or at the very least would be bound to become one
soon enough.
It seems that whether because we’re poor, Brown, or rowdy,
and zero fucks given, automatically our organizing eorts are
suspect or underestimated and undermined. We can often
internalize that shit and even undermine ourselves. I often
feel I’m not doing enough or not doing it the “right way,” but
I have to catch myself and stop that cop in my head bullshit
cuz really what the fuck is that? The “right way” according to
whom? Doing enough as measured by what standard?
I was asked recently by an old friend, when was I going
to grow up and go do something real with my life. He said,

## 80 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

“Like being a professor, get a career. You’re too old for this.”
Ha! And that’s just it. If what we do is a joke, then fuck it,
I’d rather laugh. Ha! I’d rather play. I’d rather create space
with my homegrrrls where we can live and love and exist on
our terms, and plus if “professionalized” hetero cis men are
irritated with what our collective is doing or more specically
what I’m doing with my life, then for a fact I’m on my chosen
path.

Libertie: I really admire that! When people ask you what it
means that you’re an anarchist feminist project, what do you
tell them?

Xela: We are the squad you’ve been warned about. The
cautionary tale for all who struggle for a better world and are
actively organizing. To be feminist is to be vigilant about power
hierarchies that we may be re-creating in our interpersonal
relationships and within our own political analysis even—and
so be able to reect on our own shit and be intentional about
destroying those hierarchical leanings within ourselves rst.
And feminist because for the last ve-hundred-plus years on
stolen land, we’ve been under patriarchy, particularly of the
white, cis, hetero variety, and that shit gotta go. Anarchist cuz
I will not obey. I refuse to willingly concede control of my life
or body—not to the state, not to a “god,” not to a man. And
anarchists cuz we get a lot more done by ourselves or with
others who care beyond consumption and/or party lines.

Libertie: That’s an incredible answer. I’m writing it down!
(laughs.) Our attachment to anarcha-feminism is similarly

## UNSANCTIONED SANCTUARIES   /   81

rooted in what we’ve experienced and the ways that we choose
to come together as a collective.
Sometimes people are like, “Oh, so is every book in your
store about anarchism?” And of course the answer is “no.”
We have a lot of titles by anarchists, but it’s not our catalog
that makes our project anarchist, it’s us. Our feminism is
informed by the experience of misogyny and patriarchal
violence. We want to create a space together that breaks
away from all of that—prioritizing empowerment, consent,
and accountability. And as a cooperative, we’re also working
to confront and dismantle the toxic shit that goes along with
workplace culture.
I remember when we rst started, there were people in our
community who were pretty hostile toward us because they
thought we were just reproducing capitalism or recuperating
anarchism by running a business. And that bummed us out,
but we also understood the concern. Ultimately, I think we
had to win people’s respect by consistently showing up and
being solid comrades. It probably helps that we kept getting
into ghts with the city. (laughs.) When we were still in our rst
location, which was downtown, we helped lead a campaign
against a business improvement district that would have
created a private police force controlled by property owners.
(We won that ght!) In recent years, we’ve worked with the
Steady Collective, a harm reduction program that distributes
Naloxone and clean injection supplies primarily to folks on
the street. Folks who are disproportionately queer and trans.
In our community, drug users and unhoused folks are on
the receiving end of a lot of abuse because they detract from a
vision of Asheville as an upscale tourist playground. In 2018,

## 82 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

the city tried to shut down the Steady Collective’s syringe
access program that was happening once a week in our space.
It was kind of surreal because the zoning department actually
claimed we weren’t a real bookstore. I don’t think anyone from
the city even came in to see if we had books, they just drove
by and saw homeless people, which in their estimation made
us a homeless shelter—an illegal homeless one. So we got hit
with a “notice of violation” threatening nes and potential
prosecution if we didn’t stop hosting harm reduction work.
When we refused to comply, we received a lot of community
support. At one point, we heard that the zoning department
had to take its phones o the hook because so many pissed-
o people were calling in. The ght consumed a year of our
lives, but in the end we won. And we never stopped hosting
the syringe access program, not for one day. But ghts like
that also wear you down.
I think that we’re probably the most anarchist when we’re
navigating conict or challenges within our collective. Those
are the moments when we really have an opportunity to do
something dierent, to unlearn the patterns of dysfunction
and harm that we’ve experienced in other spaces. So we try to
slow down and ask each other how we want to be treated, how
we want to be cared for. Even when we’re mad at each other!

Xela: Recently somebody mentioned that they try to stay
away from conict, right? And my initial response was, “I
enjoy conict!” But that was a lazy way of saying it doesn’t
bother me. I feel like in those moments of conict, you
can really understand each other at a dierent level. So if
something bothered you or whatever, let’s unpack that further

## UNSANCTIONED SANCTUARIES   /   83

and then I can have a better understanding of where you’re
coming from, and hopefully you have a better understanding
of where I’m coming from. I think we’ve been so conditioned
to center our hurt feelings—and they matter, sure—but
ultimately, where does the relationship that we’ve built for,
say, ten years matter? Or does it even matter?

Libertie: This is something that shows up for us. Conict
avoidance can be a product of white supremacy culture, and
while it’s not only white people who replicate white supremacy,
for us, as a majority-white collective, we’ve really struggled
with this dynamic. Many of us were raised not talking through
conicts or being told that women should keep their voices
down. But if we’re going to have healthy relationships, we
have to be less fragile and willing to have conicts.

Xela: Our collective is primarily Brown, and we’ve been
indoctrinated to not stir anything up, or keep our voices low
or just swallow it, even at the detriment of our continued
discomfort. I see it still in organizing spaces like ours. I’ve been
told, continuously, that it’s my tone, so I’ve experimented with
that. I’ve tried to sing it. I’ll try to say it sweetly. But it doesn’t
matter. It’s the point that I’m speaking, even if I say, “Come
on, we’re sisters. If my tone was this way, if I curse this way,
I wasn’t cursing you.” I think it goes back to how we’re stuck
in carceral dynamics, even the surveillance of how we speak.
One time I started putting duct tape around my mouth, so
that I wouldn’t interrupt. But then it became an issue of,
“Xela, we didn’t like the way you rolled your eyes or how you
looked at us.” So then I’m sort of stuck with surveillance of

## 84 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

how I’m processing things. Yet I’m a human being; I can’t
show up with a poker face.
And then there are relationships where the conict has
kind of solidied our friendship. In the times where I know
their heart, I’m not going to take it personally. I think that’s
really important, knowing each other’s heart, if that makes
any sense. For example, I do a lot of the labor in our space
and am hardly online, so there’s no reason to feel like I am
trying to gain clout! So I think that my actions should speak
to the fact that I’m committed to this work in this way. We
need to really be sitting with and reecting on each other’s
motivations, because you know I’m not above petty jealousies!
You know what I’m saying? I’m not above all kinds of fucking
behaviors. So we should really sit down and reect on our
actions, and our motivations behind those actions. It’s also
really important to understand that nobody is fucking perfect,
but can we experiment further on how to hold space for each
other in a compassionate way? Because clearly, we’re not each
other’s enemy. Regardless of whether you share the same
geographic or cultural background, we share at least anity
in terms of our politics—antiauthoritarian or anarchist if you
want to call it that.
It makes me think about mutual aid and how I’ve seen
where everybody knows what to do to tangibly share resources,
whether food or clothes. And I wonder about mutual aid in
terms of emotional mutual aid. Where it’s actually much
more dicult because you have to be in your feelings. It’s less
physical labor; I’m not having to access a car to go pick up
the food. I just have to access my emotions and be mutually
reciprocal with the other person and understand that we all

## UNSANCTIONED SANCTUARIES   /   85

---

fuck up. I think that takes priority with the folks who we call
comrades, even with family. I think that takes precedence over
the tangible sharing of the resources.

Libertie: That’s really insightful. I like the idea of emotional
mutual aid. I’m curious if you have any norms or practices
that support communication within your collective? How do
y’all manage relationships?

Xela: Well, back in the day, we used to do a very tankie type
of practice: crit self-crit. (laughs.) Then, instead, we tried to
do what’s called Spinoza’s roses: Where do we have owers
and where do we have thorns? But one of the things that I
saw happening a lot was this need to pathologize each other.
That’s kind of fucked up, because that’s why the collective has
the word psycho in it, meaning, “Yeah, the world is crazy.” If
what I’m doing is seen as crazy, we’re already pathologized.
So I didn’t understand the need to pathologize ourselves
further. It felt like surveillance culture and the easy way out
of things. So nowadays, with the collective members who we
have currently, we just talk it out if there’s an issue.
One collective I was a part of before had an interesting
practice: whenever there was discord, or if there was conict
between two folks, we had two options. You could box it out—
some kind of jujitsu domination, or for people who weren’t
into that, you could give the gift of forgiveness, or the gift of
just simply being present for each other to be able to discuss it
further. But these days what we’re trying to do is before every
meeting, have a real honest check-in, a check-in of the heart,
not just how your day is or how your week has been going.

## 86 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

Libertie: And what do you think makes that work? Do you
rely on people who aren’t part of the collective to support
communication when there’s conict?

Xela: No, if the conict is between two people, we have a
member who does her best at hearing both sides. Nobody
ocially made her the mediator, but she does it and just has
skills. But sadly we did lose a member recently who needed
space because they just didn’t have capacity, emotional
capacity, to try to resolve things, and I wish them the best.
Ultimately that is a personal decision. You can’t force anybody
to make the space so that together we can gure it out.

Libertie: It’s hard doing this under capitalism because there’s
so many limitations placed on people’s ability to show up.

Xela: Yeah, but one of the things that we did even back then
was have a hard agreement that whatever gets shared, should
never be weaponized or put in a pocket for later. How do you
all do it?

Libertie: I agree that it’s easier to navigate relationships
when you really know someone; you kind of know their
context and story. A lot of times, when somebody doesn’t
show up in a good way, there’s something going on for them.
So we try to make a lot of space to talk about what’s going
on for us outside our work together. We’ve also experimented
with dierent ways of creating space for relationship building.
For instance, we were doing a thing where every month,

## UNSANCTIONED SANCTUARIES   /   87

---

every member of our collective would sit down with every
other member for one hour and just have a conversation. It
didn’t have to be about the bookstore or a project we were
working on together. It could be about anything—maybe
something going on in your personal life. The hope was that
we could understand where each other were coming from
and have that baseline of empathy for when we step on each
other’s toes. Then maybe we get upset with each other, but
we’re able to temper that with knowledge and understanding
of what’s going on. And we know some dynamics that we can
fall into, things to be careful about.
In terms of actual conicts, we used to do a lot of work
with outside mediators. Around the time of Occupy in 2012,
we had several connections in the community to people who
were really good at facilitating dicult conversations, and they
could come in and help everyone feel heard while uncovering
things that weren’t immediately obvious to the rest of us.
We haven’t really had those relationships in the last few
years, so we’ve approached conict similarly to what you
were describing: we create space in meetings to bring it out
and give it room. We try to honor the conict rather than
treat it as irrelevant or act like it should be dealt with outside
collective space. We’ve also tried to learn about each other’s
communication and work styles. There’s an exercise we do
where we all answer a series of questions, things like “What
do you need when you’re stressed out?” and “What are your
most closely held values?” Then we talk through our answers,
and it starts to form a sort of map of how we work together.
And we can give each other explicit instructions, like “Here’s
the thing that I really do or don’t want you to do for me when

## 88 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

## I’m struggling.”

Xela: That’s beautiful.

Libertie: It’s been useful. It also means that when a new
person starts working with us, we can have them answer the
same questions, but then also share all the answers that we’ve
previously written out. I think it’s nice for new people. So
they’ll know that if I’m really cranky, I probably need to eat
food. (laughs.)

Xela: Classic me too! It makes me think of back in the day,
when we were like thirteen deep, we used to have a thing
every season where we would randomly pick each other’s
names from a hat and then that person was going to be your
best friend for the season. You had to hang out with each
other and gure each other out and share with each other.

Libertie: Something I’m hearing from you, that I know is
true for us as well, is this idea of experimentation. It’s clear
that both of our collectives have never settled on one thing,
right? We keep trying new things, and I think that’s really
very anarcha-feminist of us! We just keep coming back to this
question of how we care for our relationships and create new
organic patterns. It’s never about nding the perfect thing or
following a party line. It’s about new experimental forms.

Xela: Absolutely. For example, our other spaces always
had principles of unity. Then we changed to principles of
solidarity, and then it was, like, principles of war [when we

## UNSANCTIONED SANCTUARIES   /   89

---

were attacked by tankies]. But then, nally, we were like
fuck principles! Let’s understand our personal constitution.
What are the agreements that I make? Our body is our rst
territorial defense, right? And so understanding that our body
was our rst territory, then what are my personal principles,
my personal values, my constitution? What does that look like?
It’s important to understand our own personal constitution
because then we can create agreement for the space. And
then when we collaborate with folks, they have the option
to be in alignment with that or not. The idea of boundaries
is so intangible, like when a person says, “You crossed my
boundaries” or “You’re not respecting my boundaries.” How
would I know, unless I know your personal constitution?
That’s what forties each of us individually, understanding
what our boundaries materially and tangibly look like, right?
So that’s one thing that we’ve been practicing, and it’s been
interesting because it’s been a harder task to think about our
own boundaries in this way. To put actual sentiments and
words and feelings to that, as opposed to principles for the
space, which is theoretical.

Libertie: That sounds similar to our experience. Our
collective is negative on policies and rules that people need to
follow. Instead we try to build a shared culture that changes
as our needs change. Maybe that looks like generating a
collectively written document, but we write statements and
not contracts. Sometimes we end up sharing those statements
publicly too—as a form of transparency or to help people
understand what we’re doing. Years ago, we wrote some
collective agreements to guide our work together in meetings.

## 90 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

We have a lot of meetings! And the agreements included things
like respecting each other’s time. But what does respecting
someone’s time actually mean? It’s so culturally specic. So
whenever a new person joins our collective, we have to look at
the agreements again and revise them. Which is good because
it also gives us a chance to ask ourselves if our agreements still
reect the culture we’re striving for. They have to stay uid
because relationships are uid.
Maybe we could also talk a little bit about the mistakes we’ve
grown from, because some of those mistakes at Firestorm
were related to our feminism, and I know y’all struggled with
your identity and original name, Ovarian Psycos.

Xela: The name was speaking initially to the immediate
issues of those in the collective, which originally was just me
and my daughter. As our collective grew, we got a lot of heat
on a variety of issues. Like we were not real cyclists cuz we
didn’t wear the right clothing nor were we posting constant
clocking in of our miles, so who cares? We can’t aord your
fancy gear, jerks! Or, for example, why not let men ride? And
we were like, well, fuck it. Men can hold the water for us, if
they want. Ha! Maybe some people thought we were really
arrogant, but nah, nah, this collective is for us women. So we
doubled down, but then we got schooled appropriately on the
fact that not all women have ovaries.

Libertie: Was that feedback from your local community or
strangers on the internet?

Xela: On the internet, but even to our faces. Our politics

## UNSANCTIONED SANCTUARIES   /   91

---

were still in development, but we recognized the error in
equating women with ovaries, so now we go by OVAS.

Libertie: I think it’s great that after hearing how your shit
was landing for people with dierent experiences, you wanted
to change it up, to make it clear that you were in solidarity
with trans folks.
Firestorm had some experiences that were maybe a little
similar. I think you can’t run a public project and not get
called on some shit. And sometimes maybe you disagree with
the call, but you still learn something. Early in Firestorm’s
history, our collective didn’t describe itself as queer or trans.
We brought those identities with us, but it wasn’t the basis of
our organizing. So at some point, in maybe 2009, we got into
conict with a radical trans crew in our town. I think these
folks didn’t understand us to be part of their community, and
they approached us with the same suspicion that queer and
trans people often approach straight spaces. They were upset
because we booked an event with an artist who we didn’t
know had played the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival.

Xela: That was a TERF festival, right?

Libertie: Yeah. But I honestly didn’t know anything about it
at the time. So we booked this feminist musician Bitch, who
was on Ani Di Franco’s record label, and a couple days before
the show we found out that people were tearing down and
defacing our yers. Asheville is a small town, so we gured out
who was doing it, and asked them to sit down and talk to us.
By the time we sat down together, this group of mostly trans

## 92 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

women was really pissed at us because we hadn’t canceled the
show. And we were pretty unhappy with them for not coming
to us directly, you know, for not extending us the opportunity
to hear them and act in solidarity without having our arms
twisted. In the end, we went back to the artist and made a
proposition: we wouldn’t cancel the show on the condition
that they participate in a community conversation about
trans exclusion and be accountable to their involvement in
Mich Fest.

Xela: At the very least have a goddamn conversation. Yes,
yes.

Libertie: Right. Well it was short notice, but it seemed
reasonable. Bitch decided not to play the show, so there wasn’t
a public conversation, but it was still a big lesson for our
collective. We realized that we had a responsibility to be more
careful with the content that we platformed, and I think some
of us also started thinking about how we needed to better
communicate who we were to our community, because for
me the hardest part of it was not being recognized by other
trans people.

Xela: Yeah, I think that’s important. That’s why we have
been open about reecting on the terms being used. Like, if
our shit sounds TERFy, then fuck that noise because that’s not
what we are about. And because patriarchy aects even men,
even cis men, it aects everybody. It aects the whole damn
world at the end of the day, like colonization aects the whole
damn world.

## UNSANCTIONED SANCTUARIES   /   93

But thank you for sharing what you all went through. It
does matter. It all matters at the end of day, like being better
humans to each other without centering humans over animals,
plants, owers, and all living creatures, and dead ones as well.

Libertie: We all need practice talking through dicult stu.
It’s clear that most of us have experienced being silenced or
not having our concerns taken seriously, and so we haven’t
developed the skills we need to communicate. Or we don’t
have a culture that supports eective communication. I think
it’s good when projects like the OVAS or Firestorm get a
chance to build our skills, and maybe even model eective
responses to conict and harm.
When I think about feminism, one of the things I think
about a lot is how we respond when people are experiencing
harm. Within our collective over the years, we’ve had a
lot of opportunities to confront toxic behavior and we
made mistakes, especially early on. We didn’t hold people
accountable eectively and weren’t really holding ourselves
accountable. Then even when we started taking anti-
oppression work seriously, we were slow to recognize how
harm played out between queer and trans people. But I guess
the thing that we did right is that we didn’t give up, and when
people criticized us—we didn’t use that as an excuse to stop
trying. Those experiences have been really foundational to
my feminism.
The way you were talking about how much you give—
and how much community spaces like Casa C. O. A. T. L. are
giving—makes me think about how movement spaces are a
type of feminist direct action. What I mean is that there’s a

## 94 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

tendency to gender the work that supports movements. The
work of maintaining a space and caring for a community’s
physical needs, it’s reproductive work, you know. It’s the work
of caring for our radical movements, and a lot of radical
men don’t want to do that work, or they do it and then move
onto something more prestigious. I guess nobody is writing
books about the nineteenth-century anarchists who cleaned
the bathrooms in the Paris Commune! Chances are they were
women.

Nowadays, the grounds around Mc Pherson library are quiet.
Led by real estate proteers and the city government, a
combination of cold, constant encampment sweeps and an
organized eort to drive away every community outreach to
unhoused people has had a profound impact on Kensington.
Still, unhoused drug users and sex workers remain. This
Philadelphia neighborhood has had a culture of unhoused
drug users and sex workers for over two centuries now. No
wonder it is resilient.
Nightshade, a collective community space by and for
outdoor and poor sex workers and drug users run jointly by
Project SAFE and the Philadelphia Red Umbrella Alliance,
was formed in 2016.1 A proud member of Nightshade, I
joined during my early sex working days sometime in 2017 and
became a core organizer in 2020. After the 2020 lockdowns
started, we shifted to gathering in open public spaces; the goal
was both risk mitigation due to the pandemic and meeting
people right where they were at, quite literally.
When we began those outdoor meetings, the park grounds
were extremely lively and lived in by unhoused neighbors.
People set up tents together, shared their resources, and
became entangled with and looked out for each other. I want
to be explicit here: drug use and sex work is a part of life
for many living in Philadelphia. Nightshade is an extension
of this culture. So people share tips and tricks on drug use,

reduction organization, see https://projectsafe.com/. For more on
the Philadelphia Red Umbrella Alliance, an all-volunteer, sex-worker-
run collective, see https://phillyrua.com/. Editor’s note: It’s a sweet
coincidence that Nightshade is the name of two, albeit unrelated,
collectives in this anthology (see “The Collective as a Crucial Form”).

## TARPS AND GOSSIP   /     99

sex work, and raising money in myriad other ways, and
accessing resources including shelter. Most people are queer
and/or disabled, and many intersections of lived experiences
converge at Nightshade.
When oppressed people openly claim a space, they are faced
with hostility. Kensington is no dierent. Police presence is a
constant. I have witnessed cops idly circle around repeatedly
in their SUVs to inspire terror, stage violent arrests, bike
up on people in droves, and kick sleeping people awake.
The violence does not stop there. In response to decades
of organizing against policing, diversion programs such as
Police Assisted Diversion and Dawn Court, a postdiversion-
ary program, extend “benevolent” carceral violence. These
programs, a coalition between police, city government,
and nonprots, promise to put people through rehab and
mental health treatment with the stipulation that participants
must exit the drug and sex trades. Yet with no job or real
housing opportunities, participants nd themselves trapped
in a cycle of poverty and incarceration. Then there is the
issue of medical care. As the US government decreases the
supply of pain medication, stimulants, and other lifesaving
care, more people nd themselves unable to hold onto what’s
necessary to survive capitalism. More people end up living on
the street, revolving through various programs and jails, and
the carceral system uses their visibility and plight to escalate
conict between housed and unhoused neighbors. Proteers
promise a “cleaner and safer neighborhood” to residents,
and use this pledge to support violent encampment sweeps
to pursue gentrication. These are the conditions in which
Nightshade exists.

## 100 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

Still, every week a few housed sex workers open up space by
laying down a poly tarp in our designated spot in a park. We
come bearing a cartful of kits packed with harm reduction,
safer sex, and rst aid supplies. There is hot coee and tea,
and bottled water gets passed around. Sometimes we are able
to bring clothes, shoes, donuts, pepper spray, coloring pages
and pencils, knickknacks, and other small or portable items to
exchange. We share bad dates sheets—pieces of paper with
descriptions of clients who may have robbed, assaulted, or
otherwise caused a sex worker grief. We ask for “bad date”
and “bad [drug] batch” reports, emphasizing that we do not
work with the police and take no identifying information
from workers.
While we bring supplies and information, it is important to
understand that Nightshade is not focused on direct service.
We catch up with each other. Someone brings along a new
member, and another person talks about considering rehab.
We sit with each other on the tarp and color while discussing
the poisoned street drug supply, swapping humorous sex
working anecdotes, and telling each other about our hopes
for our personal and collective futures. Sometimes people
come to nap. There is no preassigned agenda. Every meeting
is dierent from the last. And how could it not be? At the end
of the day, Nightshade at its heart is just a time and place
where a group of sex workers come to meet each other and
exchange gossip. No two gossip sessions are alike.
When I sat down to write this piece, I wanted to extract
some deeper organizing wisdom gained from our gatherings.
The truth of the matter is, we are just some whores stubbornly
carving out something in a space wrecked by unimaginable

## TARPS AND GOSSIP   /   101

hostility. As sex workers and drug users, we are not seen as
people able to manage ourselves and our lives. We are viewed
as too stupid to care for ourselves, too airheaded to make our
own decisions, too materialistic to organize ourselves, and too
zombied out to defend ourselves. Institutional violence deems
us as “not human,” and this translates palpably in the ways
we are treated.
Rather than being stymied by it, it gives our organizing
more freedom. Unlike other organizing spaces, Nightshade is
not goal oriented. It is instead oriented toward friendship and
rest. Some of my favorite Nightshade memories are of people
coming to nap. Not only do we build relational trust that
allows napping to happen, but we model community naps and
community rest. Then there are the gossip sessions. Because
the conversation is easy and owing, we can ask each other
more in-depth questions about where our various perspectives
are coming from and gently interrogate internalized stigma
when it inevitably rears its head. Here, I learned that some
of my friends enjoyed outdoor living and scrutinized my own
preconceptions about unhoused people. I have also gotten
to share the dierent ways I work and been able to support
members when they wish to transition to dierent parts of
the erotic labor industry. In this way, we cover vast terrains
of politically deep conversations stretching from race in
sex work, to overdose prevention sites and safe supply, to
encampment organizing.
In this context, Nightshade is a protest too, week in and
week out. On a sunny afternoon during the retelling of a
boisterous joke, a librarian comes over to tell us we should
not be serving food to unhoused people. We counter that we

## 102 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

are just a group having a picnic with friends and family and
successfully send him away. Other encounters do not always
end so smoothly. On a quiet fall day, a cop comes over and
wakes up one of our members from her nap, feigning concern
over an overdose, despite our vehement protest. That day,
while we were unable to stop a cop from enacting violence
on our autonomy and breaching our space, we modeled what
community self-defense and solidarity looks like. Abolishing
the police is a deeply held value in Nightshade. To detractors
of police abolition, sex workers in the open experiencing
violence may be an excellent example of why we need police
as protection. But we don’t. We protect ourselves from hostile
neighbors and the police. We prove to ourselves that a new
world is possible.
Nightshade continues to survive as a space where we self-
determine how we love and value each other. In foregrounding
this space in camaraderie, we become conspiratorial. Here,
neither collective care nor community defense feel aspirational.
Rather, it is an easy thing we extend to each other. Under
systems designed to eradicate our existence, we quietly create
an oasis as a manifestation of a more collective future.

In winter and spring 2017, a group of adult women and
nonbinary people, mostly Black and Brown, came together
in Portland, Oregon. Some of us were the mothers of Black
and Brown girls and femmes. Some of us were young Black
adults who had once ourselves been Black girls and femmes
growing up in Portland. And some of us were expert childcare
workers and career healers. All of us, individually and in our
friendships, were thinking about the diculties facing young
girls and nonbinary youths of the global majority growing
up in a majority-white city with an egregious history of anti-
Black and anti-Brown racism.
A feature of community-led, anarchist organizing is that
we recognize a need or problem and respond, nding an
organic solution from within. We know what is really happen-
ing from lived experience and we know what we need; we do
not look to or trust the authority of the state to identify and
address our concerns. As children, the adults who became
the original Brown Girl Rise (BGR) collective had personally
experienced dealing with white supremacy in Portland’s
schools, neighborhoods, medical settings, and more. The
parents among us were learning how hard it was to nd
anity spaces and culturally arming education for our
kids, particularly for Black girls and nonbinary youths, and
noticing how our children suered as a result of this lack. And
many of us had worked in environments where youths were
telling us what they needed: “I had just come out of working
at [an Indigenous organization] and really seeing youths not
have any understanding of their body, but also craving that
education,” founding member Allie shares. “We’re failing our
youths, and we wanted to create a space that was safer, and

## BROWN GIRL RISE   /   107

---

actually addressed the resilience of our communities as well as
the histories and realities of violence, but also empower folks
with understandings of the body and ways to nd agency and
sovereignty in their bodies.”
So the question arose among us: How do we take care
of our own? Could we oer our youths the space to build
relationships with each other, the adults in their communities,
and their cultures and ancestries? BGR was established to do
just that.

## SISTERHOOD

Many of the people involved in BGR had histories of working
in nonprots or government agencies, and had been burned
by the ways the state insinuated itself into every aspect of that
work. BGR didn’t want to re-create typical nonprot models
of youth service provision, and we continue to resist the pull
of professionalization and the culture of white supremacy at
every turn.
Dani, who had worked with neurodivergent youths in
nonprot settings prior to working with BGR, names how
nonprots expect a kind of false, authoritarian division
between the service provider, youth “client,” and family
surrounding the youth. She says, “When I worked with youths
in other organizations, it was really like, I’m there solely for
the youths and I don’t listen to the parents. The parents
aren’t a concern to me because having a relationship with
the parents would jeopardize my relationship with the youths.
Like it wouldn’t serve them as well.”
Dividing our personal and professional selves, including in
care and educational professionals, is an eective tool to divide

## 108 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

us from our communities, empathy, and shared humanity. It’s
also a missed opportunity for reciprocal healing; the person
providing care loses the chance to be healed in return by the
person receiving care. And as Gloria notes, “It’s extractive, by
the organization, when you’re not getting the healing back in
that process.”
We knew that we wanted to break down the walls erected
between us by those in power and instead build interde-
pendence. To do that, sisterhood became central to the
mission of BGR from the start. We understand sisterhood to
mean a feminist expression of deeply committed relationships
in which reciprocal care and mutuality are seen as the primary
forms of resistance and generation. BGR made sure to provide
programming that wrapped around the entire family unit, not
just the young person involved. For instance, we held social
events like movie nights and had gatherings just for parents
to chat with each other while the youths had workshops. Or
we met up at protests and performances so we could deepen
relationships and create solidarity space.
Like an abuser, the state would see us isolated, unable to
make the connections that would allow us and our youths to
free ourselves and create new worlds. Women and nonbinary
people of the global majority in particular are kept from
collective wisdom and anity spaces, expected to manage
our grief and anger in private. Allie observes that “we’re
constantly having to hold ourselves and be good on our own,
and have that kind of constriction in our bodies and spirits.”
But in BGR, “sisterhood means looking at our relationships
and striving to decolonize them with each other, because
so much of it has been internalized and lateral violence.”

In Joyful Militancy, coauthors Nick Montgomery and carla
bergman point to the way that non-nuclear kinship networks have been sustained
in the face of state terrorism and incarceration,
residential and boarding schools, and Empire’s
ongoing attempts to privatize and destroy non-nuclear
kinship networks, extended families, and webs of
relationships that include nonhuman kin. Nourishing
and sustaining these communal forms of life throws
into question some of the dominant ideas about ...
[the] separation of activism or organizing from
everyday life. They challenge the segregation of kids
from the rest of the world (and from organizing and
politics in particular) and the ways that elders are
isolated and intergenerational connections are lost.1

As organizers, we want to cultivate solidarity between our-
selves and between youths. Further, we want to nurture it
between generations. We believe that kinship in the face of
state violence is a radical armation of the value of our lives.
We also see sisterhood as primary to achieving lasting and
profound change, where we can resource each other outside
the transactional and scarcity-oriented programs of the state.
Building intergenerational relationships and centering
youth leadership is not always easy. BGR has frequently
come up against the ageism that permeates our world. The
parents in our organizing collective are all older than the
other members who do the majority of the direct youth work.

We’ve created a youth advisory board and hired a former
program participant. Finding the line between mentorship
and condescension, between youth empowerment and lack of
support, is really dicult. On the one hand, youth collective
members have called the adults in on behaviors like not taking
their ideas as seriously or giving their voices equal space. On
the other hand, our organization continues to grapple with
our youth board and workers being at a dierent place in
their learning and development. Youths often need more
teaching, modeling, and logistical support because of the
simple fact that they’ve had less practice in the world. A desire
to empower our young people by giving them control of the
organization has meant that at times, things aren’t getting
done or done well. And youths sometimes feel unsupported
and lost in that dynamic. BGR continues to seek a balance
that will avoid these pitfalls.
In our work with youths, the emphasis on kinship has
meant that our programming activities concentrate on
relationships between youths rather than between youths
and adult/authority gures. Much time is spent in games
and relationship-building activities. Opportunities for risk
or pushing the learning edge (such as our annual campouts)
allow youths to express vulnerability as well as turn to each
other for support and creative solutions to problems, including
social concerns. Addressing allyship by focusing workshops
on dierent identities (that is, disabled folks, LGBTQIA+,
Indigenous people, etc.) builds sisterhood as well; youths learn
to value the self and others equally along with the skills to be
in solidarity with the kids around them.
Practicing sisterhood has at moments been dicult when

## BROWN GIRL RISE   /   111

---

organizers or families do not feel deserving of care, or expe-
rience vulnerability in relationships as unsafe. As communities
impacted by injustice, many of us struggle with imposter
syndrome. We’ve had organizers who had to leave because
they weren’t showing up to do the work, but they also weren’t
able to accept the support to address their needs and stay
in our community. Trauma can make sustaining relationships
incredibly hard.
But we’ve had success too. In 2020, both organizers and the
families we worked with were deeply impacted economically
and socially by the violence of the COVID-19 pandemic and
ongoing racial genocide. Because we had spent three to four
years building deep connection, we were able to quickly act in
support of each other. Mutual aid was already a key component
of how we worked. In spring 2020, our organization made
regular calls to families and youths to check in on their well-
being, and delivered thousands of dollars in mutual aid as
well as food deliveries and care packages. Moreover, our
organizing collective brought each other meals and groceries,
fundraised for each other, met regularly online to process our
feelings, and attended antiracist protests together in groups.
We knew the ins and outs of each other’s lives, and our focus
on relationships meant that we had already normalized
reciprocal care. Giving and receiving support was therefore
easier than it would have been otherwise.

## FIERCE LOVE

At the level of the BGR organizing collective, the way we
practiced sisterhood became synonymous with the term erce
love, which was coined a few years into our work and play
together. As Dani denes it,

Fierce love is loving people authentically and as they
show up, and really loving people to the point where
you allow them to be their full self around you and
also to make that love a priority over everything else.
I think in our work we are constantly dealing with
deadlines and having to present to the world in a
certain way to make the work that we’re doing seem
legitimate. And I think the way that we really ght
against that is with erce love. No deadline matters
as much as the needs of people within this collective.

This emphasis on the erceness of our love for each other
is about a militant resistance to the ways that the culture of
white supremacy constantly tries to worm its way into our
work and relationships. For example, it continually promotes
a state of urgency and crisis. Our collective members struggle
with the feeling all the time that we’re not doing enough, and
what we are doing isn’t happening fast enough. Funders and
other institutions push this value on us further with inexible
deadlines and persistent demands on our work. But we push
back by “moving at the pace of trust,” as Ashnie, a parent and
BGR auntie, says, adding,

## BROWN GIRL RISE   /   113

---

The pace at which we’re growing is at the pace of trust,
which is of course slower. So I think one of the things
that is dierent for us as an organization is, on the one
hand, we’ve achieved so much, and on the other hand,
if we weren’t, you know, bothering with this erce love
thing and caring about each other, we would move
at a pace that would have accomplished things that
culturally look successful. But we’ve redened what
success looks like with the value of erce love at the
center.

We have worked as a collective to turn down opportunities
that overburden us and pivot our programming to adjust to
reasonable workloads for the leadership team. We don’t wish
to replicate the values that created the problem in the rst
place.
Fierce love has also come to mean a commitment to holding
each other accountable even as we give each other care and
understanding. In fact, these two things go hand in hand. As
Dani puts it,

Accountability is a big part of erce love. The way
that we hold each other accountable is to really
remind each other of our inherent goodness. Anytime
I’m reminded, anytime somebody calls me in, you
know, it’s always to remind me that I can treat myself
better or that what I’m doing is not the way I have to
be doing it. I have the capacity to make changes that
are good for myself and good for my community as a
whole.

## 114 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

This is often the way accountability has shown up in our
collective: to address the ways that shame and internalized
oppression have impacted our ability to be present in our
work. Typically when there is an issue, such as someone not
following through on a commitment or acting in an oppressive
way toward others, the person is addressed directly. But in
addition to being told honestly about the impact of their
behavior, they are listened to as well as oered compassion,
resources, and support in making changes. We understand that
people’s behaviors do not exist in a vacuum and that change
is only possible if the root causes are addressed collectively.
It may be that something needs to change in the structure of
our work as much as the individual needs to grow personally.
As Grace underscores, “Accountability for us was never a set
of protocols, and always a matter of trying to love each other
and our community more deeply, more radically.”
Fierce love is sometimes unsuccessful when fear of conict
and a sense of danger get in the way. As mentioned before, we
each struggle with histories of trauma and marginalization.
Conict has been incredibly harmful for many of us in the
past. Sometimes collective members have avoided speaking
their truths because of this. At other times, some of us have
been defensive and unreceptive to being called in, even with
love. We experience a critique of behavior as a judgment on
who we are as people, and this can cause intense anxiety.
A powerful example of successful erce love in action,
though, occurred in late summer 2020. Two of our young,
Black coordinators, Grace and Dani, approached the collective
to let us know the ways that ageism and anti-Black oppression
were impacting them and our programming at large. They

## BROWN GIRL RISE   /   115

---

shared the ways that they had felt marginalized and shut
down, particularly by non-Black and older organizers. Their
concerns were taken seriously and addressed via changes in
personal behaviors as well as organizational practices. We
poured further care into each other rather than pulling away
or engaging in performative change.
## Grace shares that what was really transformative for me in my role at
BGR in terms of accountability was that it was never
like “Grace, this wasn’t right” or “Grace, where is this
thing that you committed to doing?” It was always a
question of, “What kind of connection do you need to
feel supported in doing this specic thing?” or “What
comes up in your physical body when you are doing
this thing?” Always trying to work with people as
human beings with urgent social, emotional spiritual
needs and not as productivity machines.

This means that erce love is about process over product in
our organizing, including creating space for intergenerational
vulnerability. “We as adult facilitators,” explains Grace, were holding space for young people dealing with
racism, homophobia, and sexism in their everyday lives
and trying to foster solidarity. Doing that facilitation
authentically meant sharing our own experiences and
opening up about what we do to move through those
spaces with wholeness—always recognizing that we
## are part of a continuum of Black and Brown femme

## 116 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

experiences of growing up and growing outward into
a world that wasn’t built for us. We aren’t separate
from the participants and we’re all learning how to
be “good ancestors” during our time on earth in our
physical bodies, at various stages of our journeys.

Lizzie states that with erce love, “My belonging [in BGR]
is not based on whatever I can do for XYZ, this capitalist
transactional exchange of I can make this contribution.” Our
collective members and families have inherent worth and
belonging, regardless of the role we each play or where we are
in our growth. “We’re all at dierent places,” Gloria, another
parent and BGR auntie, says, “but we recognize, one, that
we’re all growing and we welcome that, and we’re not going
to throw each other away because we’re not perfect.” There
have been many moments when a collective member had to
take a break from BGR, be it for one meeting or a year, and
yet they still had a place in our group.

## PLAY AND JOY

Creative engagement has been part of BGR’s pedagogy from
the start. We made sure to have interactive programming
that included games, art, discussions, and more. Yet in the
beginning, we still fell prey to white supremacist tendencies
to try to stu as much information into our youths as possible.
The urgency we felt to help our youths engage in activism and
be educated about social justice made us want to push too
much content in our workshops. In many anarchist and leftist
circles that we have participated in, this focus on theoretical
knowledge combined with protests, boycotts, and so on, is

## BROWN GIRL RISE   /   117

---

upheld as the gold standard for revolutionary work.
But we kept hearing from youths that the aspects of our
programming they loved the most were when they were free
to be creative and improvise, to be silly and playful. When we
had swim days, learned group games, and got messy with art
supplies, and especially when we took the kids on overnight
campouts in the summer, youths showed as well as told us of
their joy and excitement. We saw them put energy into each
other and our work more deeply.
Listening to our youths, we realized that play and joy were
not means to an end, not the sugar that helped the medicine
of real learning go down. The play and joy are the goal. For
Black and Brown girls and nonbinary youths, play and joy
can be scarce resources. Hierarchical social systems strive
to deny us these aspects of human life in order to keep us
tired, destabilized, and subjugated. Our neighborhoods are
deprived of parks, museums, and cultural centers. BIPOC
youths, especially Black youths, are seen as older than they
actually are, and therefore punished younger and not aorded
a lengthy, playful childhood. And most BIPOC youths don’t
have the luxury of waiting until they are older to understand
the harms that exist in the world. We experience them
personally from a young age.
Black and Brown youths heal when they have the
opportunity to play and have fun. Centering play in youth
work and indeed all activism means that we are practicing
now the world we wish to have in the future—a pregurative
politics. In Undoing Border Imperialism, Harsha Walia denes
preguration as “the notion that our organizing reects the
society we wish to live in—that the methods we practice,

## 118 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

institutions we create, and relationships we facilitate within
our movements and communities align with our ideals.”2
We know that we wish to live in a world in which kids can be
kids and develop at their own pace, and in which pleasure
is equally available to everyone. As Grace asserts, “We also
recognize that joy has always been crucially restorative for
our peoples and an essential part of the resilience of our
communities. Creating spaces of joy has literally always been
how Black and Brown queer people have sustained ourselves
throughout history and uctuating degrees of violence or
being targeted.”
Around our third year, BGR began turning further toward
this way of practicing youth work and intergenerational
organizing. Today we rarely have traditional workshops with
lots of talking at youths. Our programming mainly consists of
joyful activities such as roller-skating, swimming, art making,
and farming. We get into our bodies as much as possible and
nd ways to meet each other there, connecting through play.
We believe play is a basic human need.
One illustration of how play became central took place
during late spring 2020, at the height of the uprising following
the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. BGR
organized a meetup for any families that wished to be in
community together at a vigil in a park in North Portland.
Hundreds of people were present, mostly adults, standing
and sitting with signs, listening to a long line of speakers.
It felt heavy.
The kids who were present had for months been learning

2013), 11.

## BROWN GIRL RISE   /   119

remotely because of the pandemic, isolated from each other
most of the time, yet they were constantly hearing news of
our people being killed. It seemed to come naturally to them
that when meeting up in person amid all the intensity, they
wanted to play with each other. Rather than demanding that
they and their families conform to the norms of typical protest
behavior, several BGR organizers began to play with them.
The organizers learned Tik Tok dances with the youths and
formed a little crew of performers. They handed out bubble-
making supplies and chalk, and the kids spent an hour writing
and drawing beautiful messages all over the park against police
violence and in support of Black lives. There was silliness and
anger and conviction in these activities. As Lizzie, a parent
and BGR organizer, put it, “You could see in the youths who
were present, this sense of I’m releasing something, and there are
people around me who care about me and see me, and are mirroring back
my joy at me. Even in the midst of this really painful moment,
they are feeling in their body.”
In this example, play allowed us to connect with each
other and gave the young people space to process what they
were feeling. It oered them a chance to feel delight and
participate in ways that were meaningful for them, not others.
Simultaneously, play is one of the best ways we can engage
in problem-solving. When we live in a society that includes
terrible acts of inequity and brutality, it can be dicult to
gure out paths to a better world. Imagination provides us
with a platform to explore the unknown while in relationship
with each other. We can try out dierent ways of being and
discover what organically emerges that was unavailable to us
via intellectual exercises.

In his manifesto and guide to storytelling and imaginary
play, Grammar of Fantasy, Italian communist, author, and
children’s educator Gianni Rodari sums up his views on the
revolutionary nature of creativity in his chapter titled “Lenin’s
Grandfather.” He recounts a story he heard about children in
Russia who liked to sneak into their cousin Vladimir Lenin’s
grandfather’s garden via a window versus the door.

The wise Professor Blank (Lenin’s grandfather on
his mother’s side) was very careful not to forbid this
innocent fun and had rm benches placed beneath
the windows so that the children could go in and out
without the danger of breaking their necks. It seemed
to me to be an exemplary way of placing oneself at
the service of children’s imagination.
By using stories and those fantastic methods that
produce them, we help children to enter reality
through the window instead of through the door. It is
more fun. Therefore it is more useful.
Moreover, there is nothing to prevent anyone
from having an impact on reality by means of more
demanding For example: What would happen if there were
suddenly no more money to be found in the entire world, from the
## North Pole to the South?”3

The state doesn’t wish for us to be well enough to dream

of another way of living that excludes the state. We can see
this in everything from the defunding of the arts and mental
health programs, to the destruction of Indigenous healing
and well-being traditions. We reclaim all sorts of ways to feel
pleasure and envision a better future for ourselves.
Our leadership team strives to experience this playfulness
and joy together as well, though again, it’s not always easy. One
of the main barriers to integrating these values in BGR is that
everyone on our collective is already dealing with so much.
Energy levels are low, and we can get stuck in feelings of crisis,
scarcity, and burnout. We push back on these challenges by
making food together, singing karaoke, celebrating birthdays,
and processing and planning via theater of the oppressed and
somatic exercises. Because our work is often hard, and because
we continually experience violence and have to ght against
the tide of white supremacist culture, emphasizing pleasure is
a necessity. “I’m tired of my joy being resistance,” Dani says.

And I am tired of it being that for the youths too.
So I’d rather see it as just a natural experience that
everybody deserves. But also seeing the way that it
serves people, and yes, serves us on a physiological
level, on a mental level, and at the same time is a big
relationship builder. If you can laugh with somebody,
if you can kiki with somebody like you, if you can be
weird with somebody, then it makes it so much easier
to transition into the things that you don’t always feel
comfortable talking about with other people.

Sisterhood, erce love, play, and joy are all deeply interrelated.

Kalie, a youth who came up through our programming and
is now a member of the organizing collective, speaks to the
impact of these values: “After the rst [BGR] meeting, I just
felt so amazing. I was nally home. I tend to bottle up a lot of
my emotions around people. I don’t let myself go, and I don’t
let myself have fun. But when I’m with BGR, I can just fully
let myself be.”

There we were, in a squatted abandoned lot at a feral punk
show in Querétaro City, deep in Carrillo, a neighborhood
that was once full of ower farms, but has sadly been invaded
by concrete factories. A place where the false ag of progress
took precedence over the human lives that reside there.
Yet humans are resilient. It’s no surprise that this trampled
community was the bastion of a thriving scene, back when
punk was illegal. Back when distortion and dissonance were
outlawed. The prohibition of wild music couldn’t and wouldn’t
stick. No matter how many times you dig up dandelions,
they always grow back. The community organized—and it
keeps organizing. Freedom is a ght that never ends. Today
those small deserted lots, full of broken bottles and broken

from urban decay, from the rot of capitalistic malevolence,
from the violence of toxic masculinity. We are the wild plants
that grow up through the cracks of concrete, and one by one
we guide each other back to the fertile lands of grassroots
autonomy, mutual aid, horizontalism, and companionship.
But even in the so-called anarchistic punk scene, our owers
get trampled in the form of microaggressions and petty
competition. We nd ourselves walking on eggshells around
fragile egos. Our songs get talked over, our voices muted,
until we have to scream just to be heard. Where the fuck is
the solidarity?
That’s how Mujeres Subversivas came into being, back in
2019. The rst call, one of many, was initiated by Mara and
Anita. Working with a cogendered collective, they organized a
two-day event called Mujeres Subversivas: Anarcho-Feminist
Action and Self-Defense. There was a DIY market, discussion
about the zine “Accion y Autodefens Anarcofeminista” (Anar-
cho-Feminist Action and Self-Defense), self-defense class,
documentaries, and workshops on interpersonal violence
and teaching new forms of masculinity, screen printing,
papermaking, and stencils, not to mention performances by
lots of bands and a radical feminist theater troupe called Ollin
Compani. Many people in attendance, though, got upset that
the thespians took to the stage between bands and started
disrespecting the powerful art being performed before them.
The artists and actors were baring their souls and getting
heckled for it. The rage in that moment sparked the re for
the femme-based collective Mujeres Subversivas. That same
rage could still be felt under the rubble of the old ower elds.

I want to name violence with owers in my mouth.
I want to be among those who bend the world to us.
I want to create words that cut o autumn, and along the way, the
heads of some rapists.
I want to tell my mother,
My friends, and all of them,

That we are making history and because of them it is poetry.
I want to see re spread through the prosecutors’ oces and not
the factories where they [our mothers] work,
I want the bullets aimed at God and not at them,
I want them [our grandmothers] to utter their laments until they
become rain,
I want to sail with them,
I want the wind to blow in their favor,
I want them to be hurricanes,
I want them to be hope,
I want this world to be theirs!
And I want our hearts
To tremble with love,
With rage,
But never with fear …
At the least, I want these words to cross the planet and grow
thorned owers that show the strength of being a woman, of being
a poet, of being them.2

Gaby threw her words o the stage and into the hearts of the
crowd at this punk show, kindling their inner res. The potent
rhythm of a drumbeat felt like the countdown to a blasto.
It was followed by a screaming guitar ri and bass line that
resounded throughout the space. The music was throbbing,
sharp, raw, and direct. An all-femme mosh pit broke out,

by the band Filoso.

our bodies ying around in a blur of shnets, patches, studs,
glitter, chains, boots, eyeliner, and raised sts full of rings.
Hugging each other passionately, we spun around to keep the
chaotic energy moving. “Sharpen your knives! Sharpen your
minds!” Gaby screamed into the mic, the voice of our fury,
the voice of our solidarity. She ended with a body-shaking
shriek. When the music ended and the musicians conferred
about the next song, chatter bubbled up among us.
“Chingón [fucking awesome]!!!”
“Amigaaaa! What an epic day! First the Autonomy for Kids
workshop and now this! Increíble!” Fist bump.

## * * *
Anita clapped her hands together. The game was starting
in today’s kids workshop. We lined the children up in a row,
making the younger, rambunctious, and distracted Erizo the
leader. He called the shots, directing the other kids to pass
small foam mats—foamies, as we called them—along a path
to get to the other side. No one else was allowed to speak. It
took some coaxing on our behalf, reminding him now and
again of the goal, and asking him what he should do next, but
eventually he got all the other kids across.
We played again, but this time we changed the rules.
Now everyone could share their ideas and work together
collectively without a leader. Needless to say, the kids made
it across much faster on the second pass. Then we all sat in a
circle talking about the experience. How did it feel to have to
listen to one single person in charge and not be able to voice

## COLECTIVA MUJERES SUBVERSIVAS   /   131

---

your thoughts? What changed when no one was the leader
and everyone could work together? Which version worked
better? Gaby spoke about the dierence between vertical
and horizontal hierarchy. How working together collectively
opened the space for new ideas and faster outcomes, not
to mention that having your voice heard is important to
everyone. Anita emphasized the importance of listening to
others, and having the courage to speak up for yourself and
those you care about, or those who aren’t always able to speak
up for themselves.

## * * *
We wrapped up the workshop and led the kids through the
patio, past the parents sitting in the front room and into the
kitchen of Casa de Vinculación Social (Social Connection
House) to wash their hands. Casa de Vinculación is a social
center in the heart of Carrillo. It’s a large two-story house
with ample front and back patios as well as a large garden.
Many collectives ow in and out of the space. Over time,
a musical collective has taught guitar classes for kids, various
exercise classes have been held, a psychologist oers care,
and people built a sweat lodge out back. An environmental
collective maintains the gardens. Several years ago, Casa de
Vinculación organized and planted a community garden in
an abandoned lot around the corner too. Recently, a couple
of the collectives got together to form Micelio (Mycelium),
which organizes around the issue of Querétaro’s water, an
especially poignant topic since 2022, when the state moved to

## 132 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

ocially privatize water rights. The state’s plan has sparked
many calls to action and a larger conversation about the
future of water in Mexico.
The ship that is Casa de Vinculación is under the guidance
of the formidable Mari Carmen, who provides a special
space in a neighborhood that is frequently overlooked and
overpowered by the industries that built over its ower elds
and mesquite trees. Mujeres Subversivas started working
with Casa de Vinculación in 2020. And now that the kids
workshop had wrapped up, it was time to put everything
away. But rst snacks.

## * * *
The parents had prepared sliced fruit and tostadas with vegan
toppings and salsas, and made sure that coee and lemon
verbena tea stayed hot on the stove. They sat in the next room
around a big table chatting and opened up space for several
of us to sit, while others began bringing the foamies back
upstairs and putting away the art supplies. Mona, Ramona’s
mother, thanked us.
“This is such great work you all do. How did you get
started?”
We looked around at each other.
“Well …” Mara started.
“Mara!” blurted out Fatx. “You’re the connection for all
of us.”
Mara shrugged with a smile. “Well what can I say? I just
wanted to be organizing with powerful feminists. And it all
just came together.”

## COLECTIVA MUJERES SUBVERSIVAS   /   133

Then Anita spoke up. “I remember the temazcal [sweat
lodge] with Gaby and Pau that Yun organized with her
collective, Casa Tonatzin Tlalli Temazcal.” Yun gave her a
wink. “Oh thank you, amiga, that felt like a metaphor for the
birth of our collective. And then we all just came together
from dierent parts of the city, from dierent backgrounds,
dierent ages. Like the invitation was sent out, and everybody
came running.” Anita giggled with an excited hand gesture
and elvish grin.
“And at just the right moment!” Leo jumped in, pointing
at her. “One by one we gathered together, looked around,
and realized we’d found something really special. Then later
we found this space to work out of, Casa Vinculación, and
everything just came together.”

## * * *
Victoria, Erizo’s mother, nodded with understanding. Lora
came down from putting the foamies and art supplies away,
nding the last empty seat at the table. There was curiosity
in the eyes of Yun, whose boys Mateo and Geronimo were
playing with the other kids out back. “OK, so explain to me
more about your collective,” Yun said with her warm smile.
“Like what is it?”
The intention of Mujeres Subversivas, from the start, has
been to create a network of women and femmes connected
by common ideals, organized horizontally and in solidarity, to
share feelings, thoughts, and the re that rages within us all.
To weave the world with our words, growing together up out

## 134 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

of the concrete, sharing hardships and cultivating our wild
ways within the world.
Fatx eagerly asserted, “I see our collective as a platform to
know ourselves through each other. We come from all over
the city as artists, teachers, painters, dancers, and poets, and
together our actions create space to live out our ideals, dreams,
rebellions, and passions. We all came to Mujeres Subversivas
looking for change—in ourselves, in our community. We
believe in building a better system, and we’re doing the work
to make it happen.”
“One rebellious mural at a time!” blurted out Leo, laughing.
“Mujeres Subversivas is based on friendship. We’re about
freedom and horizontal organizing. We’re about solidarity
and mutual aid. We teach each other lessons, from the kids to
the adults and everyone in between. We’re diverse and cross-
generational. We even have a member from the other side of
the border,” Leo said, looking at Lora, who smiled, shrugged,
and then gave her own answer in an accented Spanish.
“I see us as revolutionaries. We have strong personalities, we
have conicts, but at the end of the day, we all have the same
goals. Freedom. Make the world a better place. And we each
bring dierent ideas about how to accomplish those dreams.
When we mix all of our ideas together, I like to think that
we’re able to bring something really special into the world.”

“Denitely,” said Majo, the mother of José Carlos. “What
other activities have you all put together?”

## COLECTIVA MUJERES SUBVERSIVAS   /   135

“The rst event we put together as Mujeres Subversivas
was with Polilla, who came up from Puebla to organize a big
three-day event over the course of two weekends. The idea was
a direct action on the street to create a feminist mural using
stencils,” Mara replied. “On the rst day, we had a discussion
about anarcho-feminist education. We shared ideas about
strategies and working collectively. We spoke about bringing
art and direct action into the public space.
“The next day, Polilla taught us how to use stencils. It was
also a massive brainstorming day. We threw all of our ideas
together. To start, we wanted to demonstrate freedom and
autonomy, so we used a drawing of a bicycle to represent
that. We wanted to be inclusive for all kinds of women, so we
made the bike long with multiple seats to include a woman
with a prosthetic leg. There was one person in high heels and
another in boots to portray the spectrum of femininity. We
also added a child to represent motherhood. The bicycle was
shooting ames to represent the internal re we all carry, and
in the ames we’d written ‘Existe Resiste’ (Exist! Resist!).
“The next weekend, we got together for the third and
nal day to paint. We worked in groups to make the mural
because the stencils were so large. That was in December
2020. Then in February, we got together and created another
three murals.”
“The murals were amazing,” said Leo. “My grandparents
even showed up! I was kinda scared about that at rst, but it
turned out great.”
Gaby came in from washing the dishes. She wiped her
hands on a tablecloth. “I really loved those events! It was a
perfect balance of being organized yet spontaneous.”

## 136 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

“Oh my goddess, yes,” said Pau.
“Has anyone swept yet?” asked Fatx.
“Not yet,” answered Gaby.
Leo got up and headed to the broom closet, leaving a space
for Gaby to sit down.
One component of working with Casa de Vinculación was
that we were responsible for cleaning the space after using
it. There was no overt delegation of tasks for this. Instead, it
always owed organically. Putting away supplies, sweeping,
mopping, dishes, and tidying. Usually another round of
dishes. Making sure there was toilet paper in the bathroom,
and nally, locking up afterward. This was part of working
in collaboration with other collectives, forming a larger
community of dreamers, organizers, artists, and healers.
“Yeah that event did have good ow,” said Mara. “Then
there was the lecture series we did on anarcho-feminism with
writings from Peggy Kornegger.3 We did one every month for
four months. We got together and collaboratively created the
yer collages for each one.”
“That was fun,” said Lora. “It was hard too, because we all
have such strong opinions, but I think we learned a lot about
working together in those sessions.”
“Then we stepped up our game with the Autonomía Para
Niñxs [Autonomy for Kids] workshop,” said Anita, “and
twice a week!”
“Thank you again,” said Mona. “It’s been great for the kids
to reconnect after all the craziness in the world.”
We all kind of sighed and took sips from our coee, or

grabbed another piece of fruit. The pandemic had been a
bookmark in time for so many things, the collective included.
During the quarantine, we organized an online self-defense
class. Once we could meet up in person again, we started
working with Casa de Vinculación. That was a whole new
phase. We all had extra time, so we were meeting up almost
every week, and sometimes more, to plan for the lecture series
and organize for the M8 Women’s March, which happens
once a year in every major city across Mexico on March 8.
We were part of a class on libertarian education and were
dreaming up a workshop for children.

## * * *
“So what have you folks learned from all of your organizing?”
Sebastian inquired
We grew pensive.
“Take notes!” said Gaby, which got a round of laughs and
lightened the mood.
Then Lora spoke up. “I think we probably overorganized the
lecture series. Turns out you can overdo it on the organizing
end. We were meeting all the time, but we would get o topic
and didn’t get a lot done. Not always; sometimes our meetings
were really productive, but at other times it was like four hours
would just disappear without anything concrete happening.”
“Yeah, there was a lot of self-induced stress,” Fatx observed.
“I think we’ve learned the importance of delegation and
trust—to trust ourselves, trust each other. We don’t all have to
be there for a yer collage, for instance.”

## 138 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

Gaby built on that, saying that it was “nding a balance
of organization and spontaneity. Honestly, I think a fast-
approaching deadline can help everything come together.
Everyone nds what needs to happen and gets it done.”
“It’s balance, like you said. You don’t want an event so
unorganized that no one knows what’s happening and it’s all
chaotic,” added Mara.
Leo put the broom away and popped back into the
conversation. “I’ve learned that I wasn’t the only one who
wanted to do this. There are a lot of people who want to
change things, who know there are better ways. We keep the
faith and nd what actions to take. And by doing that we
connect with others who share that same internal desire to
live better. I feel grateful that everything came together for all
of us. That doesn’t always happen for people who want it to.”
“But that’s what DIY is all about, right?” said Mara. “Do
it yourself, start with a friend, nd another, then another, and
it all snowballs into the beautiful dream you have. And by
organizing these small events, you never know who might
come into the fold or who you’re opening the door for.”
“That’s so true. I think we are making an impact, but we
might not even see it. We might be blazing a path for someone
for things they didn’t even realize were possible. And we’ll
never know,” Lora reected. “Just like those who came before
us will never know how important that rst punk show was, or
that rst protest or rst radical feminist theater performance.
And it’s never just one person. It’s collective, it’s community,
it’s the scene, it’s everything. But regardless there’s something
inside of us that makes us do it.”
Leo exclaimed, “Yes, that community weaving, where we

## COLECTIVA MUJERES SUBVERSIVAS   /   139

---

eect this small piece of the world, but it ripples out! From
the individual to everyone’s beautiful kids and the people who
come to our events. We even make an impact on our friends
and families with the actions we take.”
“And it has an impact on ourselves as well,” noted Pau.
“Sharing, organizing together, it brings us out of ourselves
and places us into the world. Like when you climb a mountain
and you get a larger perspective of everything. We can start
to see what we’re doing. I think the closing party we threw for
the anarcho-feminist lecture series brought that all together
for me.”

## * * *
That afternoon of the lecture series felt like a psychic hug
from the collective. We were equals, smiling and happy. And
we were erce! We channeled our rage into stories sung as
poems hurled into each other’s hearts. We were vulnerable,
opening up about our battles and crying over our wounds of
war. We were furious, but we weren’t alone. That made all the
dierence, and together we danced joy back into each other’s
lives, creating and sharing our art.
Mujeres Subversivas has been our call to action, solidied
with the help of everyone there. Together we forge this
liminal space, with open dialogue and an egalitarian spirit,
carrying the torch for those who couldn’t make it and
those who rst lit it to create a magical space where we feel
protected, safe, and accompanied. Our work in collective has
always been accomplished through horizontal organization
and autogestión, which is a word that doesn’t translate well.

## 140 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

DIY comes close. Self-management is what the dictionary says.
Autogestión is a way to generate opportunity for yourself
without a boss.
To open the party that marked the close of the lecture
series we held a DIY market, where our friends bartered and
sold their art—inspiring us with their energy and their re.
Once the space had lled with laughter, we gathered everyone
together for the last lecture in our series, which included a
slideshow, arts and crafts, and deep questions. We’ve always
strived to bring a balance of tactical experience and theory to
our events, and this one was no dierent.
We concluded with the open mic, which without over-
organizing, was spontaneous and organic. At rst, we were
anxious there wouldn’t be enough time or that nobody would
want to perform (despite the fact that the open mic was
listed on our yer). As it turned out, between ourselves and
those who had participated in the lecture series there was no
shortage of performances: poems and theoretical musings
were read out of scribbled handmade notebooks, instruments
were played, and voices oered the songs they’d been waiting
to share, some melodic and some dissonant.
The rst act to light up the mic was Power Animala, an all-
femme rap group that inspired our bodies into motion with
dynamic beats. Powerful verses made our hearts run wild.
Then Fer shared a poem addressed to the trash human who’d
wasted her time while she’d let her own talents languish. Josi
lled the microphone with a poignant story about a person who
tried to cut o their colorful wings and wanted to control their
magical dreams. Roux gave a solo rap performance about the
time she was metaphorically drowned by a relationship that

kept her glow from lighting up the sky. Leo took our breath
away with her exposed, passionate body. As she danced and
twerked, we saw parts of ourselves that we’ve denied, and the
desire to rebel. Musa bewitched us with her lyrics full of rage,
love, and rebellion on ukulele rhythms that transported us to
mysterious dimensions. Fatx closed by creating the space for
us to pause and reect, to search for ways to process emotions,
with an interactive zine full of love.
“That open mic was like looking into an open heart. It felt
like standing before the mirror of all my sisters as we rewrite
our history as womyn,” Pau asserted.
The beauty of her words stunned us into silence. We looked
into our empty drinks. Then Anita slapped her hands on the
table, “Well, I’m going to go mop!”
And we all laughed.
“Does anyone still have unwashed dishes? I’ll do round
two.”
“Thank yous” were handed out along with the dirty cups
and small plates. Yun looked around the table at us and then
asked, “So what comes next for all of you?”
“We’re a work in progress, a movement, constructing
reality through the people we meet. We are a circle of trust.
We want to change, to try new things. We learned from the
lecture series that too much organizing can get in the way,”
Leo answered. “But we’re still here. We still want to put events
together; we just want them to ow more organically.”
Gaby explained that “the diculties and dramas that we
faced in the past were part of the process, and they’ve made
all of our friendships so much stronger. I’ve seen us change
both individually and as a group.”

## 142 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

“Truly. With each cycle we go through, we get deeper, nd
more space,” armed Fatx. “Now what’s next? Where do we
go from here?”
Just then Pau entered the room with the mop. “Amigas! I
think where we go from here is to the show!” She turned to
the parents in the room. “Are y’all coming too? It’s at the city
museum downtown. It’s a great venue to bring the kids to.”
“Yeah, we’re denitely coming,” said Yun.
“Us too!” chimed in Victoria and Sebastian at once.
## “Great, let’s go!”

## * * *
We nished up the last of the chores, gathered up the
children, and piled into various vehicles to caravan together
downtown. The city museum was a collision of the past and
present. Its stone Spanish architecture of the colonized past
met with modern mood lighting of the present while powerful
artwork hung in stark contrast on white plaster walls. It was
an unlikely venue, usually reserved for ne art exhibitions
and gatherings of Querétaro’s well-to-do. The building had
an outdoor patio built into the interior, and that’s where the
show was taking place. So while the Spaniards had forced
their culture onto the diverse Indigenous peoples of what is
now Mexico, we were spreading our own culture in this place
that now belonged to the upper class, the oppressor class.
It was a strange dichotomy indeed, but we were here to break
the space and claim it as our own—at least for a night anyway.
Gaby took to the stage, grabbing the mic and channeling

our fury and rage, our solidarity and friendship.

The Pink Peacock | ‫ר יד‬‫ עוועז‬‫ עוו‬began as a mutual aid
project in 2020. On Rosh Hashanah 5782 | September 2021,
after months of hard manual work, the collective opened a
queer, Yiddish, anarchist feminist, anticapitalist café and
infoshop on Victoria Road in Glasgow. The space was run
entirely by volunteers, and everything—from food to events
to the online shop—was always pay-what-you-can down to
£0. In late Sivan 5783 | June 2023, amid astronomical price
increases for rent and utilities, and with collective members
all suering from the latest stage of capitalistic collapse and
nationalistic self-destruction across the United Kingdom, the
Pink Peacock closed its doors. The following conversation
with cofounder Moishe (Misha) Holleb | ‫ה )עשימ( השמ‬‫בעל‬
(he/him/‫רע‬/‫ )םיא‬took place a few months earlier.
I rst met Misha, and the Pink Peacock’s other cofounder,
Joe Isaac (she/her), during Rosh Hashanah 5780 | September
2019.1 The Jewish New Year falls at the end of summer,
traditionally the period when we’ve harvested our crops, and
all the seeds we sowed during the year have come to fruition
(or not). We pause there, on a threshold, before entering the
transition into the dark, dormant part of the cycle. For me it’s
a time to reect on our actions and choices, and think about
what’s important, what needs to change, and what we want to
do and be in the coming year. Misha and Joe didn’t know me.
We’d connected virtually through one of those loose, fragile
networks of anarchist-adjacent thinkers that exist in many
places. They shared a wonderful celebratory meal with me
that night in their home, making me feel relaxed and welcome

work and contributions throughout the project.

in a completely new (to me) kind of Jewish community. On
my way home to another city about two hours away, waiting
in Glasgow’s brutalist central bus station at midnight, I felt
tender and openhearted, quietly in awe.
That rst time we met, I will always remember Misha saying
that he wanted to start a Jewish anarchist café. It sounded
lovely, but I couldn’t imagine how such a thing could really
happen. I thought it was a statement that told me something
sweet about my new friend, not about the world we live in,
gray, skeptical, and hard. As it turned out, it was both.
The Pink Peacock project began about half a year later,
during the rst COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, when everything
changed. Misha and Joe started by running regular deliveries
of homemade vegan Jewish food from their home to others,
then an online art and infoshop, and beautiful, inclusive,
online ritual events, including a weekly group discussion and
blessings for Havdalah (the closing of Shabbat and onset of a
new week). I took part in some of these, in various moods—
often sad, sometimes hopeful, perpetually grateful—and felt
the signicance of the ritual in a way I hadn’t appreciated
before: creating a sacred time-space together, grounding
ourselves through our senses. In that desperately frightening,
isolating time, it was wonderful to share those moments (and
conversations about ghosts and love, plants and Star Trek, and
much more) with far-ung people through the hub of the
Peacock. I’ve drawn inspiration and learned so much from the
various Pink Peacock events I’ve attended since then. Being
around the Peacock taught me about food, justice, gender,
magic, and Yiddish as well as new ways of thinking about
work and social relations, this world, and the world to come.

## 152 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

During that time, I met people from all across the globe
who asked me if I knew about the Peacock. They’d tell me
enthusiastically that they’d been there once, or been at virtual
events, or planned to make the trip there one day. Then,
invariably, they’d share their astonishment that such a place
could exist: Really, a luxuriously queer, fabulously accessible,
Yiddish anarchist space where you could eat delicious bagels
with carrot lox for free? It sounded, we all agreed, like a
dream.
I thought a lot about those conversations when the Peacock’s
closing was announced—in the grieving days, feeling numb,
discouraged, and lost, connecting with strangers again, this
time through the lyrical tributes that we poured into the
unfeeling void of social media and gentler circles of group
chats. It felt miraculous when the space opened; it now
feels impossible that it’s gone. New parts of me, parts that I
cherished, had grown up wrapped around its structure like
vines.
“Like a dream” echoed in my head, reminding me of the
closing passage of socialist poet William Morris’s classic novel
News from Nowhere (1890), in which the narrator experiences
a postrevolutionary, utopian society full of happy, fullled
people who have long ago dispensed with money and
authority, sharing freely while taking pleasure in creative,
domestic, and agricultural pursuits. The story ends abruptly
when our protagonist wakes up at home and realizes they’ve
been asleep the whole time: “[I’m] trying to consider if I was
overwhelmed with despair at nding I had been dreaming a
dream; and strange to say, I found that I was not so despairing.
Or indeed was it a dream?” They think about the last look one

of their new friends gave them and how it seemed to say,

Go back again, then, and while you live you will see all
round you people engaged in making others live lives
which are not their own, while they themselves care
nothing for their own real lives—men who hate life
though they fear death. Go back and be the happier
for having seen us, for having added a little hope to
your struggle. Go on living while you may, striving,
with whatsoever pain and labour needs must be, to
build up little by little the new day of fellowship, and
rest, and happiness. … Yes, surely! and if others can
see it as I have seen it, then it may be called a vision
rather than a dream.

This is how I feel today: “not so despairing,” at least most
of the time. I’m writing this less than a month after the
café closed its doors for the last time, and days before the
rst mutual aid free meal share that I’m now organizing in
my area. Rosh Hashanah is still a couple of months away,
but again I have the feeling of standing on a threshold. I am
remembering and honoring the Pink Peacock, and as I do so,
I try to look ahead to our possible futures and back to the past
we shared. I know that others saw it, lived it, and felt the way
I felt; it was a vision and not a dream.

There’s so much that’s important and unique about the café! Yet I
know from being a regular visitor that both your accessibility policies
and COVID safety processes are especially thorough, really considered,
and an essential part of the way that the space operates. 2 Accessibility
seems to be a key, guiding principle. So I was wondering about your
influences. Were there are any texts, places, or experiences that were
inspiring for you, or informed any aspects of the policies you’ve put in
place around accessibility—or negative examples that demonstrated
the need to do things differently?

It was obvious to us from the beginning that accessibility
would be a priority. We follow the social model of disability
and accessibility: everyone has access needs, and they all
deserve to be lavishly met.
Money is an access issue, and that’s always been one of
the fundamental principles of the café: that it’s free. That
came from our experiences of food insecurity. I remember
the rst time I was given free food in a similar way; it was
summer 2011, I was about twenty-one, and my band was
doing a DIY tour circuit with a bunch of anarchist punks.
We were hungry, and someone said there was free food at a
church every Wednesday or whatever; they gave away food,
no questions asked, with no means testing. So we went and
got fed there—and that changed my whole life. I realized that
this was what I needed to be doing too. Soon I got involved
with Food Not Bombs in East London, and that was even
better than the church because it wasn’t Jesus-y. The church
people were nice—they weren’t preaching or proselytizing—

but churches can be alienating just because they’re churches.
But just seeing it happen, this practice, showed me that it was
possible and essential. It’s a basic human thing that people
need to eat, and yet it costs money, so some people can’t. And
it’s really important for the café to meet that need, especially
because so often, both for Jewish and queer spaces, money is
a barrier to entry and accessing community as well as food.
On other accessibility needs, there are so many dierent
sides to it. Of course there are all the physical and sensory
needs, which is what people often think of rst. And then
there are mental and social access needs. Things like you
don’t have to read Hebrew to come to our Seder. You don’t
have to look a certain way, or be between eighteen and thirty-
four, to be treated with dignity as a queer person. You don’t
have to know all about gender theory and what your own
gender stu is in order to come talk to us about trans stu. We
didn’t do a lot of reading theory. At the start, it was just Joe
and I, and neither of us were up on crip theory; it was just, we
know that these are barriers and so we’re going to look at how
we can reduce them. This wasn’t a point of principle—the
not reading. It would’ve been good if we had read more and
known more; it just happens that we didn’t do a lot of reading
rst. We didn’t have time.
Our main inuence has been constant feedback, both from
our volunteers and other people in the community. Some
things, I think, we did a really good job on, and other things,
we did a bad job, and people told us and we learned from it.
Joe and I are both autistic, and I’ve got other mental health
stu, which gave us some awareness of how equipped spaces
are or aren’t to deal with anything that’s not normative. So

## 156 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

mostly it was just empathy. We had the desire to be in and
provide an accessible space, and the knowledge that disabled
people are disproportionately likely to be poor and hungry,
and that queers are disproportionately likely to be disabled,
and so on. It was just knowing that people need a thing and
so we try to make the thing happen.

Could we talk a bit about communication between the collective
members and other volunteers, and how people take responsibility and
ownership around improving things in terms of accessibility? Are there
any examples of someone sharing a new idea or suggestion on meeting
an access need, and how has that gone?

One of the rst things that I say to new volunteers is that
their dignity, comfort, and safety are what’s most important.
So if they’re volunteering and there’s something they don’t
want to do, they shouldn’t be doing it; we can get somebody
else to do it. Some people love to do dishes, some people love
counting out coins, and some people are happy to clean the
toilet because they love cleaning. The collective works.
It usually takes collective members some time before they
really take ownership of the project because it’s just so unusual
that we’re like, “OK, we’ve welcomed you in and now this
space is yours as much as it’s mine.” It takes people a little
while to really believe that. But then once they do, they start
to make changes and make things better.
So, for example, people are constantly organizing and
reorganizing the storage areas in the back to make things
accessible. That might not be the most obvious accessibility
thing for everyone, but it is for us, because now it’s so much

## PINK PEACOCK   /   157

---

easier to nd what you’re looking for and it’s not stressful
anymore. One of the collective members made allergen
charts. Somebody installed a bunch of shelving, and then
we told him the shelves were too high—he’s tall, and a lot
of us are small—and he was like, OK!, and adjusted them
straightaway so that it’s easy for us all to reach stu. And then
we have one really tall person in the collective, and when
they rst joined, they found that some of the door frames
were too low for them, so they asked, “Can we get some big
bright yellow stickers or tape that’s really visible so that I
don’t hit my head?” Obviously that was such an easy thing
to accommodate, but as a short king, I just didn’t think of it
until it came up.
There are a lot of examples around neurodivergence too.
We decided early to have autism-friendly days—low-sensory
days where we wouldn’t play music—but we changed from
playing white noise to playing other things that are less harsh
like birdsong because of the collective’s feedback.
There are always potentially conicting access needs as
well, and I think that for the most part, we navigate those
pretty well considering that we have no resources and we’re
all tired volunteers. For instance, the dog-free day: we have
one dog-free day a week, and it works really well for most
people who don’t want to be around dogs. But it doesn’t work
for people who are extremely allergic to dogs because there
are dogs in the space the rest of the time, and because we’re
clear that service dogs are welcome all the time, even on dog-
free days. So if you’re extremely allergic to dogs, then that is
an access issue that at the moment, there’s nothing we can
really do about it because we’ve decided that we’re going to

## 158 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

prioritize the need of someone who has a service dog. And it
sucks that we can’t do both, but we can’t do both.
So there are problems that we haven’t solved yet. When
we rst started out, Joe and I expected it would be hard work
to make the space accessible. Because basically nowhere else
does it so thoroughly, we thought that it must be really dicult
and expensive. And it’s not. So much of it is so easy. Like, the
lighting in the cafe is great, it works for the broadest umbrella
group of people: it’s bright enough that you can read at night
when there’s no natural light, but not so bright that it gives
anyone who has sensory issues headaches or anything like
that.

I like the privacy curtains as well—you have these cute lacy-black
curtains over the lower part of the windows so that plenty of light
comes in, but you don’t feel like you’re sitting in a display window on
the street, and they’re not blackout curtains so it doesn’t feel weird. It
feels cozy and safer as a queer space.

Thank you! Both of those things, the lights and curtains, really
required little thought and not a lot of money to make them
work, and you install them and then they’re there forever.
And there are so many access things that are like that. Such
as installing a ramp—wheelchairs are always the rst thing
people think about, so installing a ramp is the kind of thing
that’s in the general public’s mind. You install the ramp once
and it’s done. It’s there for years and years before you need
to replace it. So it’s kind of pathetic that there isn’t step-free
access everywhere. I mean, it’s dierent if all you have is a
space that’s up or down a ight of stairs in one of these old

## PINK PEACOCK   /   159

---

historic buildings where it’s almost impossible if you don’t
have heaps of money and space to install an elevator. But for
anywhere that’s on the ground oor, if it doesn’t have step-
free access, that’s really lazy and embarrassing, and there are
so many places where they just haven’t bothered. We installed
our main ramp for the cost of concrete.

Interestingly, I think some of the policies that are in place primarily
because of accessibility also make such a big difference in terms of
making the café space so special; they incidentally make it stick out
against the mainstream experience of going to cafés in the capitalist
hellscape. Like the lighting, and also the efforts you make to reduce
noise by having soft furnishings, tablecloths, and so on. From my
viewpoint, I come into the Pink Peacock and just notice how much
more pleasant it is to be there. When I go to other places that are
supposed to be nice and luxurious, often everything in there consists of
hard, uncomfortable surfaces that reverberate noise. And as somebody
who, as far as I know, doesn’t have any specific sensory issues or
particular communication difficulties, it’s still just unpleasant and
makes me feel angry because I know that, for instance, my deaf friend
can’t be in those environments, and there are so many other people who
would struggle or have a horrible time in spaces like that.

Even people who have no reason to be angry about it—people
who don’t have that empathy or understanding, and don’t
have any sensory issues—nd those environments stressful.
They’re meant to be stressful. It’s meant to keep table turnover
high—that’s why those cafés are built like that, especially the
big corporate ones. By design, they don’t want you lingering.
And so this is something that we always knew we needed to

## 160 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

do: make the café as comforting and welcoming as we can,
and make sure people know that you don’t need to spend any
money to be here or stay as long as you like.

The café has come about in a time and place where it’s much needed.
It’s been sorely needed both in terms of the growing poverty in this part
of the world, and the many kinds of insecurity and inequality that
have been brought to light during COVID, and neither of those things
look like they’re going away. While the lockdowns are over, the cost
of everything is rising, and so is food insecurity, so if anything, it’s
getting worse and worse right now in the United Kingdom.

Especially at the beginning, we had a lot of people who had
obviously never taken a COVID test; they didn’t have access
to them because they’re street homeless, or because there
were language barriers that meant that they don’t interact
with pharmacies or the Scottish government website. So I’ve
shown dozens of people how to take their rst COVID test—
which was upsetting because I’m not a medical professional
and I’m not really qualied to do this—and then sometimes
those people would have a positive result, and then I’m the
one who’s giving them medical advice, saying here’s what
you need to do so that you can recover and not transmit it to
anybody else. We get told all the time at the Pink Peacock that
we’re the only place asking people to take tests; people look at
us like we’re insane when we ask them to take COVID tests,
even when they were easily available for free.
It seemed like, generally speaking, both anarchist and
mainstream venues were thinking more about accessibility
during the period where we were coming out of lockdowns.

## PINK PEACOCK   /   161

---

But soon, a lot of people just wanted to forget about COVID.
There was a really welcome pivot to making stu available
online, and I’m sad that it hasn’t persisted for the most part,
even among leftists. I’m so upset that queer spaces in this
country failed so badly at any kind of pandemic protocol.
I have expectations of leftist and queer spaces that maybe I
don’t have for Jewish community spaces here, just because
the Jewish community is so small in Glasgow. But in leftist
and queer circles, I’ve seen people—at least those in charge
of spaces and organizing events—very, very quickly abandon
pandemic measures. I mean, like, summer 2020, abandon
them and never look back. I don’t really go to queer things
anymore because so many queer spaces and events don’t have
even the smallest nod to COVID hygiene.
As a community, haven’t we learned anything from the
AIDS crisis? The parallels are so obvious in terms of the
things that you can do. Being airborne, COVID is even more
contagious and easier to transmit, but what you can do is use
protection—masks, air puriers and ventilation, and nasal
sprays—and get tested regularly. And especially if you’re in
riskier situations, get tested. And the fact that this parallel
is not being drawn on in any kind of mainstream way is
disturbing to me. I feel like we’ve forgotten our recent history,
and at the expense of people’s lives. People die because it’s
uncomfortable to remember.

I would say that people seem to have forgotten not only the 1980s and
1990s but things that were so much in our general public awareness
just two and three years ago as well: COVID prevention, and the
widespread concern around things like food insecurity and insecurity

## 162 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

of places for people to live. Certainly where I live, at the start of
the lockdown there was this huge wave of general awareness that
many people in our community were struggling, people who couldn’t
work and couldn’t get furlough, people who couldn’t risk going out
to shops, and people who had suddenly found themselves trapped in
unsafe situations. And it felt like everybody was worried about that.
People were pulling together and getting together informal food delivery
services; there was one that I helped with for a while, getting meals to
people who were experiencing food insecurity. But many of those things
have gradually disappeared, and now so much of the city feels like it’s
business as usual, and surely those problems haven’t just gone away.
Do you think it’s that fatigue sets in?

Yeah, there’s fatigue, and there’s exhaustion, because we’ve
been going through and are still going through a pandemic
and a lot of grief, and I think our collective capacity to deal
with all of this is really weak right now. There’s this sense of
fatalism: What can we do?

And yet in that extremely hard time, you’ve created this space!

I’m not doing any other activism. This is all I’m doing, and
that way, it will be sustainable and I can be reliable, rather
than trying and failing to show up for everything that I care
about. I make sure, as best I can, that there’s food for people
to eat and the café is open as much as possible, and I don’t do
anything else.

What are some of the things that make it possible to keep it open, to
sustain it and the collective? The decisions you’ve mentioned, thinking

## PINK PEACOCK     /   163

---

about sustainability and commitment, make me feel like this is a
question that relates to accessibility too.

Support. It’s been so important, right from the start, that we
had a lot of support both from people here in the Southside
and a wider community online. We would be nothing without
that. At the beginning of the pandemic, when we didn’t have
any space and we weren’t sure whether this was going to
work, we posted online that we were going to try doing food
deliveries for people in our postal code for pay-what-you-want
down to nothing. There were two separate links: here’s where
you place an order, and here’s where you can send us money
if you want to, but you don’t have to, and we won’t know if
you do or not because we’re not checking. We will just bring
you food, and if you don’t pay for it that’s ne. And we did a
few delivery days throughout spring 2020, and every time we
made enough money to pay for our material costs—not our
labor, but our material costs—except for the last time. So we
posted about that on social media, just saying, “Hey, we didn’t
quite make up the costs this time, but we served eighty meals,”
or whatever it was, “and if you can help us cover the costs,
here’s the link,” and people immediately did. We don’t always
get that kind of response now. But that really is what made
things possible in the beginning.
We have the best customers and supporters. The customers
who come to the café are overwhelmingly lovely. And online
as well—there is a lot of bad-faith interaction on social media,
and there are people out there who hate us and persistently
harass us, and that is really depressing and actively makes me
less able to engage. But the other side of it is people saying

## 164 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

about the project, and our accessibility and COVID safety
stu, “I’m not in Glasgow, but I love and support you, and I
wish somebody was doing this in my city.” We hear that all
the time.

People who haven’t even tasted the carrot lox—which is delicious,
by the way—love you! This also relates to something I wanted to
ask you about: social relations and what the café project has to offer,
particularly from an accessibility viewpoint, in terms of changing,
reshaping, or opening up those relations. You show people what’s
possible in the context of food and drink and accessible spaces, but are
there ways that you’re showing what’s possible interpersonally?

A lot of the volunteers at the café are disabled, and it’s really
important to us that we are supportive—not just “tolerant”
or “accepting,” but genuinely supportive of each other. So if
someone’s having a pain day and can’t come in that day, or
if they’re here but they need to go home early, or they don’t
want to go home but they need to sit down for the rest of
their shift instead of being on their feet, we say, “OK, great,
do that.” And that’s been such a learning curve for all of us,
to be in an environment where you can actually state your
needs and have them met. That just doesn’t happen most
places. So that’s one social thing that we’re trying to shift for
all the collective members—the way we think about labor
and rest, and prioritizing the well-being of the workers above
everything else. It always feels bad to close the café on a day
when we’re supposed to be open, but we are always so clear
that we will close the café rather than have somebody working
there who’s not well in whatever way. So if you’re working

## PINK PEACOCK   /   165

---

and you need to stop, and there’s nobody else who can do
it, then we’ll close, and that’s better than you being here and
having a bad time.
It’s also hard that nobody is telling each other when to take
a break because we’re all in charge of our own needs and
boundaries. We’re always trying to encourage each other to
identify and state those boundaries, to say, “Hey, I need to
sit down” or “I need to go home” or “I can’t commit to this
today,” and we’re getting better at it. And hopefully we do
notice things with each other, like if I’m getting tired today
or burning out generally, somebody will notice that and say
something, but not necessarily so. There’s no one who’s going
to “manage you” in that way because there are no managers.

Right, I think it’s important to note, though, that having those
things—hierarchy and managers—which exist in “regular” jobs,
doesn’t necessarily mean that a worker is safer that way, or that their
well-being is any better or being looked out for; it can be quite the
opposite. Because the praxis that you’re describing, genuinely putting
the volunteer workers’ health and well-being first, is incredibly far
from the norm in paid work contexts. Even in public-facing jobs, you’ll
regularly see people at work who are visibly physically unwell and
absolutely should not be at work doing those tasks right now, and it’s
so bad for everyone.

Right, and that’s just the visible things! There’s always
pain and exhaustion and mental health stu that you can’t
necessarily see as well, and whether or not it’s a public health
concern, those people are absolutely not being looked out for
and told that it’s OK to stop, or take a long break, or go home.

## 166 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

We try to have a good collective culture around this, and
I actually think we were better at it before but now we’ve
slipped into being shit about taking breaks. Some people can
be—denitely myself included—reluctant to take breaks, and
actually stop and rest when they do take them. It’s hard, and
we’re working on it, and we all know that we should be better
at it, but we’re also constantly understaed. It would be easier
to take breaks if we had enough people to cover everything,
but we don’t. So we’re always pushing ourselves because we
care, you know—it’s important to us to stay open and keep
making the food.
For me, one way that I navigate the mental gymnastics
around taking care of myself and valuing my rest—because
I want to be at that place—is reminding myself that if I burn
out, then I can’t help, and in fact then I’ll be a burden on the
collective because I need support too and that’s not good for
anybody. The idea of being a “burden” for needing support is
fucked, but if leveraging my own internalized ableism works,
then it works. And another tactic that I have is modeling:
reminding myself that I’m trying to model the behavior that
I want to see, so I’m a role model to you and you’re a role
model to me, and we constantly reproduce and strengthen
our own social norms here in our milieu. So that means that
it’s my responsibility—not only to myself, but to everyone
else—to model good behavior and our values, which includes
resting when I’m sick or tired. Taking my breaks reminds
other people to take theirs as well as giving me the rest that
I need.
Another thing on social relations, and something I’m really
proud of that the café does, is we shift the paradigm away

## PINK PEACOCK   /   167

---

from capitalist assumptions. People come in and order food,
and we tell them the suggested total—people are regularly
baed by that as an idea. Sometimes they’re like, “How do I
pay it forward?” And we say, “You give us some money, and it
goes into making the things.” And they say, “No, I want to buy
the next person a coee,” and we have to tell them that’s not
how this works. It’s a small but really important distinction.
The pay-it-forward system would be, say, you pay it forward
for a coee, I put a coee token in the coee jar, and then
someone can get a free coee with this coee token. So rst
of all, that means that there is only free coee if someone has
paid and the token is in the jar. So that immediately doesn’t
t with what we do because we will give you free coee no
matter what. If nobody pays, we will just give away free coee
until we run out of money and then that’s it. And we accepted
that in the beginning.
But second of all, the pay-it-forward model is built around
the pay-it-forwarder feeling good, more than it is about the
person receiving it and being able to do so with dignity.
Obviously, having a pay-it-forward system is better than
nothing—it’s better than people not being able to access your
thing at all, which is the case with most places, so I don’t want
to shit on people who do use it because they are trying to do a
good thing. But think about how it is for the person receiving
that. Like, do they have to take the token, or point to the thing
and be asked to pay, and then say, “No, sorry, can I have it for
free?” It draws attention to their poverty, which breeds shame
and self-exclusion.
So we say, we will give you food no matter what. Here is
how you can pay if you would like to, and you don’t have to,

## 168 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

and as best as we can, we’re not going to watch you make that
decision—that’s why we keep the donation box away from
the counter. You receiving the food or coee has nothing to
do with how much you can or can’t pay. So we’re shifting that
socially for so many people. Sometimes people don’t know
how to receive free food because there’s so much shame and
stigma about receiving “charity.” Making it accessible has
to mean making it as dignied and easy as possible because
you’ve got to remove these barriers of shame.
There’s also something that we can see happening with
those people who can and do pay. You can see something kind
of icker in their eyes. You say, “The suggested total is £6, but
you can pay what you want down to zero,” and they go, “Oh,
OK, I’ll just pay the £6.” They’re clearly not used to hearing
that payment is optional, and I think this shows people that it
is possible. It’s possible to have this space—a space that does
need money to function, but where the prices aren’t set based
on what we’re selling; they’re based on what you can aord.
That feels like a social thing that we’re changing.
We haven’t really talked about feminism explicitly, but we
have been talking around it. I think there’s a lot to be said
about caring and nurturing work, and what kinds of labor
are more likely to be undervalued, and about food and all
the dierent kinds of work that go into food, and what gets
celebrated or not. There’s that old but really good poster that
says something like “Everybody wants to do the revolution,
nobody wants to do the dishes.” All kinds of organizing are
important, but you can’t have the revolution if there’s no food.
The work that we’re doing at the café is capacity-building
work: when we feed somebody, it means that they can do

## PINK PEACOCK   /   169

---

something else with their time. Because when you’re hungry,
you can’t do anything else, you’re just surviving. We can give
people capacity. And maybe what they choose to do with that
extra capacity is something awful! But I know that most of
the time, it isn’t—and even if it was, everybody deserves food.
That’s also why the anarchist angle is something we’re
always up front about; we foreground the fact that this is an
anarchist project, this is one avenue of anarchist organizing.
And that means there’ll always be someone who asks us,
“Oh, but doesn’t anarchism mean rioting and violence and
chaos and disorder?” That’s such a teachable moment. It’s an
annoying question, but we’ve been asked it so many times that
we’ve got good answers now.

That means education is another thing that you’re providing for people.
This kind of nonjudgmental education in political spaces is in short
supply, and I think, also good feminist and accessibility praxis.

I hadn’t really thought about the space being educational
outside the literature we stock, but yeah. So much of the
education is social, like explaining anarchism, explaining
Jewish stu, health stu. I talk to a lot of older gays about
trans issues. It’s just answering questions.

From my point of view, another aspect of anarcha-feminist praxis,
which is also accessibility praxis, is that you’ve committed to being a
dry and all-ages-friendly place. I used to work in an extremely male-
dominated workplace in tech a few years back before the pandemic,
and all the social events centered around drinking. And it felt like it
was always me and one or two other female workers who had to say,

## 170 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

“Hey, have you ever thought that maybe this isn’t equally accessible
to everyone? Do you know that there could be reasons why some people
might not want to—or might not be able to—go get drunk with their
male boss and their 90 percent male workforce and be in a situation
where they’re all drunk?” That really seemed like it was so new to
people—the idea that alcohol isn’t great for equality and accessibility.

Exactly, yeah, and queer spaces here generally have the same
problem of things revolving around alcohol and nightlife,
which means there’s nowhere to go if you don’t want to drink.

Right, so the café is a place you can come to if you’re queer and in
recovery, you’re too young to go to a bar, pregnant or trying to get
pregnant, don’t drink for religious reasons, have caring responsibilities,
or don’t want to be around drunk people because of trauma. And there
are also all kinds of issues around communication: for anyone who has
any kind of difficulty with speech or hearing, or is using a language
that isn’t their first language, in places with loud music and drinking,
it can be really difficult to interact. That can be a real invisible social
barrier, and it’s so important that you’re providing an alternative.
I feel really inspired by our conversation; it’s given me a lot to think
about and new ways of considering accessibility as a concept. So thank
you! To wrap up, do you have a piece of advice to share. Is there one
thing you wish you’d known three years ago, or one thing you’d tell
other organizers not to forget?

I think the things I wish I’d known at the start and things I
think other people need to know are maybe dierent. What
I wish someone had told me is really specic and kind of
depressing. I wish I’d been prepared for the amount of vitriol

and harassment that we get from so-called leftists. We were
prepared for antisemitism from Nazis, and queerphobic shit
and TERFs, and cop harassment, and being slagged o in
the Sun [a reactionary tabloid newspaper], and that kind of
thing—which all happened. And we were also quasi-prepared
for parasocial stu from lonely people. But I was not prepared
for being doxxed by people who called themselves antifascist.
I was not prepared for the unhinged rumors about us, or
people sharing my address online, or stalking my mother’s
Facebook in the name of trying to prove how rich my Jewish
family supposedly is. So those are possibilities—realities—far
more than I thought they were. And that’s really sad. But
knowing that ahead of time would have been helpful.
My perception of what people need to hear, though, is
easier. You’re probably worried that you don’t know what
you’re doing, and that’s OK. Do it anyway and you’ll gure it
out. It’s so much better to do it and fumble and have things be
a bit slower than you want than to not do it at all because you
feel like you’re not an expert or it won’t be perfect immediately.
But also, I don’t want to be unrealistic about this; there are
reasons that we were able to succeed. First, having enough
people in the collective. There was a point at the start when
it was only the two of us, me and Joe, and we have dierent
abilities so that meant there were specic things that only one
person could do, and it was immediately obvious that even with
neither of us having another job or childcare responsibilities
and things, that was unsustainable. One or two people alone
cannot take on a project like this; you have to get friends and
comrades on board until you have the capacity to do what you
need and use the dierent skills that you all have. For example,

## 172 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

my background is in social media and so I knew how to build
a social media following before we had really done anything,
and that meant that we had an audience that was enthusiastic
about crowdfunding us. I used my skills to make that happen.
But we didn’t have skills in renovating a building, so that took
forever because we didn’t know what we were doing, and it
was slow and expensive.
So it’s not just, oh, anyone can do it. It’s hard. And you
have to know how to manage your energy, and the resources
that you have, and the skills that you have, to the best of
your ability because you’re going to fail in lots of—hopefully
small—ways, and you have to pick yourself up from those and
keep going.
We also thought about it for fucking ages before we did
it, so we were dedicated to the idea before we started, and
that was helpful as well. And we had a good pulse on what
our community needs, which is important; you have to
know what need you’re fullling. We knew that our local
community’s needs were for free food, an alcohol-free queer
space, an alcohol-free space that’s open at night, a Jewish
communal space outside shul [synagogue], and any space that
is wheelchair accessible at all. Because when we rst started,
there were no accessible bathrooms on the whole of Victoria
Road, or in this whole neighborhood. We were the rst one,
and now there are two—the place right next door to us has
one now too, but I think that’s it. So those were the biggest
needs. And then internationally, having an anti-Zionist Jewish
space was a need and having a Yiddish space was clearly a
need. Know what needs you want to fulll, and work out what
your capacity is to meet those needs. And do what you can.

Just traveling home from seeing Kevan in [Her
Majesty’s Prison] Belmarsh. The only comfort of the
day other than holding his hands was seeing all of my

that] they were all on the inside.

## —Solidarity Apothecary, Instagram, March 1, 2022

As an anarchist and herbalist, I focus on supporting people
experiencing state violence. This is the heartbeat of my work
in the world.
For me, anarchism is the commitment to eradicating all
forms of domination. I believe in a world without cages. I
believe in collective care, self-determination, and responsibility
to each other as well as the land. I am continuously inspired
by movements, revolutionaries, and organizers around the
globe, especially Black and Brown feminists and abolitionists
who share frameworks of healing justice, abolition, mutual
aid, and liberation. My goal as an herbalist is to contribute
to developing health care infrastructure that builds autonomy
beyond the state, capitalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy.
My love of plants was cultivated in prison, which for better
or worse, has shaped my adult life. I’ve been supporting
partners, friends, and comrades in prison for the last 17 years.
I did a 3.5-year sentence myself after a huge wave of state
repression against a campaign to close down Europe’s largest
animal testing company. Plants sustained me through that
time, and many years later I wrote The Prisoner’s Herbal book,

## SOLIDARIT Y APOTHEC ARY   /   177

which is distributed to prisoners worldwide. I now run a
mutual aid project called the Solidarity Apothecary that
focuses on working with plant medicines to support people
experiencing state violence and am part of another mutual
aid effort, Mobile Herbal Clinic Calais.
Having burned out, hard, writing about it, and eventually
“recovering” (a complex and imperfect term), I also support
organizers going through similar cycles of loss, despair, and
overwhelm. Plant medicines oered me a path through the
maze. And now with clinical training and huge amounts of
learning from others doing this work, I’m able to oer the
balm and comfort of plant medicines to others too. I send
care packages to sites of resistance such as protest camps
and oer one-to-one aid, recognizing that the front line
is everywhere that we are doing the challenging work of
struggling for freedom.
Until anarchists and other people committed to social
change give radical attention to how we care for each other,
we will always burn out, we will always feel unsupported, and
thus we will remain dependent for “care” on state institutions
that dehumanize us. Withdrawal is not an option, but trans-
formation is.

State violence shapes people ’s bodies. In prison, we referred
to health care as “health scare.” It was such a dehumanizing
process to submit a written application to see a doctor, wait
for weeks, and then just be dismissed, patronized, or put
down during the two-minute consultation. Medical neglect
is the norm. My friend, for instance, nearly died of cancer in
prison after the authorities failed on nine separate occasions
to take her to hospital appointments for the lifesaving surgery
she needed. To cite just one statistic, in the United Kingdom,
the average age of death for those in prison is 56 years
compared to the wider UK expectancy of 81 years.1 In the
United States, research has shown that this impact extends
to prisoners’ families too. Life expectancy is 2.6 years shorter
for people who have an incarcerated or formerly incarcerated
family member than for those who don’t.2
The relentless roller coaster of prisoner support also
impacts prisoners’ families along with those organizers trying
their best to oer solidarity to incarcerated people so that they
can survive in unimaginable conditions. Those on the outside
often experience burnout, becoming physically exhausted,

emotionally overwhelmed, and vicariously traumatized after
years of prison visits, not to mention the chronic stress of
being separated from people they love.
I’ve met hundreds of ex-prisoners, prisoners’ families, and
comrades across the world engaged in prisoner support work.
Most don’t come out of prison or this work unchanged. I’m
not sure where I rst heard the saying or from whom, but
it has always stayed with me: “You can never really leave
prison because prison never really leaves you.” A framework
related to “post-incarceration syndrome” is slowly emerging
and increasingly being studied, yet it’s still not clinically
recognized despite thousands of prisoners living with complex
post-traumatic stress from their captivity.

systems, and attend to wounds of all kinds. Plant medicines
oer us tools to survive and recover from state violence. They
can help us move into dierent states of being through their
direct eect on us, supporting us to shift many forms of
chronic illness and so much more. Beyond just “consuming”
herbs in a medicinal format, connecting with plants on a
practical level (being outside, gardening, making medicine,
etc.) can aid us in achieving a parasympathetic nervous system
state, aka “rest and digest,” where our bodies get a chance to
relax and recover. For people scarred by trauma, such as from
seeing the worst in other human beings who keep them in
their cages, plants oer companionship and trust in a way
that only nonhumans can.
Integrative models blending allopathic frameworks (espe-
cially emergency care infrastructure) with traditional and
holistic forms of medicine have served communities well for
thousands of years. The radical beauty of plant medicines
is that you don’t need to navigate an authoritarian or state-
mediated system to access them. Knowledge is shared orally
across generations. Those separated from traditional herbal
lineages due to colonialism, capitalism, and oppression, in-
cluding being displaced from land, are relearning herbalism
through apprenticeships, DIY study/experimentation, pop-
ular education, and skill sharing, all of which enables people
to access the information they need to take care of themselves
and each other.
Feminist health movements have focused on this for
decades, with anarchistic feminists in particular seeing the
connection between bodily autonomy and the expansive
struggle for freedom in all realms of life. Emma Goldman,

for instance, herself a nurse and midwife, took direct action
to bring contraceptive devices into the United States and
disseminate information on birth control and abortion at a
time when both access and knowledge were illegal. She saw
her feminist health practices as inseparable from her anarchist
values and ideas.3

rose tincture and took it from the stack of drawers
we have there, and she started to cry. No amount of
tincture could take away the pain of leaving your
husband [back home] to ght a Russian invasion. But
I’m glad in that moment I could pass her something
that showed her we cared, we are with her, and that
rose is available to hold her tears through grief and
rage and pain.

mutual aid, such as smuggling food to prisoners and providing
safe houses for people on the run from fascist regimes. The
Solidarity Apothecary is herbal medicine as mutual aid.
The main focus of the Solidarity Apothecary is making
and distributing plant medicines to people experiencing
state violence and repression. This includes people being
arrested, on trial, detained, imprisoned, or recovering from
these experiences as well as prisoners’ families, frontline
organizers, and others. Herbal solidarity comes in the form
of care packages or one-to-one support, or as part of our
mobile clinic. A group may contact me asking for herbal
support. We’ll talk through any medications, and whether
people are pregnant or have any potential risk factors that
could contraindicate with herbs. I’ll then prepare something
that speaks to them and their group’s needs.
One common need is nervous system support. Nervines—a
group of plants that aect the nervous system—can help
support our bodies to relax and gain respite from the intensity
of the ght-ight-freeze response we feel when experiencing
or reexperiencing trauma and stress. It might be a tea blend
to help people sustain energy for dicult emotional meetings,
or a blend to help people prevent or recover from burnout.
Common nervines that I work with include rose (Rosa spp.),
hawthorn flowers and berries (Crataegus monogyna), and lemon
balm (Melissa ocinalis). I tend to make glycerites, which are
herbs infused in glycerine—a fantastic alternative to alcohol.
I may also send people general support for their immune
systems through the mail, including a strong cough syrup,
chest rub, and incredible immune tonic that brings together
herbs such as thyme (Thymus vulgaris), ginger (Zingiber ocinale),

## SOLIDARIT Y APOTHEC ARY   /   183

---

turmeric (Curcuma longa), echinacea (Echinacea purpurea), and
elderberry (Sambucus nigra). Another favorite is re cider
vinegar—long revered in dierent folk herbalism traditions
as a spicy immune enhancer to help people survive winters.
I try extremely hard to make medicines from the land where
I live and that I care for. If I’m unable to grow at the scale
needed, I will source herbs from local organic suppliers, or a
broader network of herb growers and foragers that support
the Solidarity Apothecary.
It’s not just the biological eects on our bodies, however;
gifting medicine is an act of showing that we care about each
other and see the violence someone is experiencing. In Bristol,
many parents lost their children to prison following the
March 2021 Kill the Bill riot, a response to a new, repressive
policing bill in the United Kingdom and the murder of
Sarah Everard by a police ocer. Herbal medicines were
commonly distributed after sentencing to these parents, who
often became tearful just knowing that someone cares about
them and even thought of this as a need. Lavender-infused oil
(with olive oil from Palestine) is a favorite sleep aid for people
experiencing grief and distress. Likewise, rose glycerite helps
people “hold steady” amid turbulent times in their lives.
For me, anarchist organizing isn’t about just helping prepare
people for their trials or time in prison. It’s not just sharing
their addresses publicly to generate letters and fundraising to
meet their material needs. It is also about expressing care—
unlearning machismo, and actually talking about the eects
of state violence on our bodies, relationships, and movements.
And it’s about recognizing that care and solidarity comes
from nonhumans too; that plants can directly support us in

## 184 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

surviving this world.
As an herbalist, I oer more in-depth, personalized support
on a one-to-one basis as well. This involves a forty- to ninety-
minute session exploring a person’s full health history, creating
unique herbal and nutritional recommendations, and aiding
them with whichever medicine may best support them. This
oering is shared at a sliding scale, from completely free for
people without papers, people experiencing state violence, or
those leaving prison, to more expensive packages for people
with the nancial resources to pay for my time and medicines,
thereby redistributing their wealth to support others for whom
it otherwise would be nancially impossible to access this kind
of in-depth care.
As an abolitionist, I cannot do this work without centering
people in prison. When I walked out those gates, I knew I
couldn’t leave others behind. Even though a part of me
never wanted to think about prison ever again, I also knew I
couldn’t accept the injustice, racism, and violence continuing.
Until the last human and animal are out of prison, this will be
my emphasis for the rest of my life. As it’s nearly impossible to
send in any kind of herbs or have consultations with people,
the best thing we can do is to support people in prison to
study herbalism themselves. That’s why I created the The
Prisoner’s Herbal; it is written for people in prison who want
to learn about the medicinal properties of plants commonly
found in prison courtyards. Among other information, it
contains ten detailed plant proles as well as instructions on
how to prepare plant medicines in prison. The book is based
on my experience of using herbs throughout my own prison
sentence.

## SOLIDARIT Y APOTHEC ARY   /   185

More than two thousand copies have been sent to prisoners
via dierent prisoner books and support projects, and we
now have a dedicated crew called the Prisoner Herbalism
Collective that makes it all happen. Our collective meets
monthly, and between us all, we coordinate sending books to
prisoners in the United Kingdom, United States, and Mexico.
In September 2022, The Prisoner’s Herbal was translated into
Spanish. We’ve created two editions of this version of the
book: one for people imprisoned in the Spanish state, and
the other for people incarcerated across Abya Yala, the
name in Guna for the so-called Americas, used by millions
of Indigenous peoples across these continents. La Herbolaria
de lxs Presxs has now gone to prisoners in Mexico, Chile, and
farther afield in Immigration and Customs Enforcement
centers and prisons in the United States. The launch event
in Mexico was hosted at the Plantón de Mujeres Mazatecas,
a site of ongoing occupation by Mazatec women family
members of the political prisoners in Eloxochitlán de Flores
Magón, Oaxaca. This erce feminist campaign connects the
intimate, personal pain of loved ones being imprisoned with
oppression and injustice worldwide. This for me encapsulates
anarchist feminism: the emotional, relational, and animist
reality embedded in acts of care and resistance; the personal
and political along with the refusal to separate the two; and
keen insights into gendered oppression while refusing to be
reductionist and instead always seeing the interconnectedness.
In addition, many prisoners are now undertaking distance
learning courses in prison with our support. Every letter I
open from someone inside nearly always makes me cry.
People write to us saying how much the book has inspired

them. To connect with plants in prison is life changing. With
relationship and connection, we are never alone. As just one
example, a prisoner wrote,

I love your herbal book. … Personally I cannot
overstate how this book has helped me in prison. I
have many ailments from asthma, COPD, [and]
severe reactive skin. Unfortunately our prison yard
is mostly concrete. But I have managed to treat my
ailments by picking dandelion leaves to eat and wash.
Also we have some plantain that grows so I use that
for lots of things. Also we have a bit of clover so I
use all [of] what I can. On the out[side], I lived in
a eld and never touched detergent. I have a good
knowledge of herbs, but your book has bolstered up
my own knowledge, and the use of canteen items
as well is amazing. Thank you all so much for this
book. Herbs keep me alive in prison, and give me light
and greenery.

## —Solidarity Apothecary, Instagram, November 2019

It needs no introduction that state violence is racialized,
classed, and gendered in its design and application. The British
border is no exception. People arrive in northern France
after having traveled for months and thousands of miles in
order to then cross the Channel to apply for asylum in the
United Kingdom. Many have come from Syria, Kurdistan,
Afghanistan, Iran, Sudan, and Eritrea, to name a few places.
Their journeys expose the horror of white supremacy in
what’s often dubbed Fortress Europe. In Calais, people live
in outdoor encampments with constant police evictions and
brutality as well as food and water insecurity after having
already faced a dangerous trek of crossings via water or
hidden in trucks—both of which have taken many lives.
For the last ve years, Mobile Herbal Clinic Calais has
maintained a presence in northern France supporting refugees
and migrants risking their lives to cross the British border. I
regularly visit Calais most months as a eld coordinator and
herbal rst aider being mentored by senior herbalists and
doctors on our team. Since October 2019, we have seen more
than ve thousand people with upper respiratory conditions,
skin complaints, digestive issues, and more, not to mention
injuries inicted by the police. Our medicines are crafted by a
dedicated network of grassroots medicine makers and growers,
with expenses covered by do-it-ourselves fundraisers. During

## 188 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

the rst months of the pandemic, we made and distributed
more than six thousand medicines in fteen hundred packs,
crossing the Channel regularly despite restrictions. Each pack
included cough syrup, antimicrobial vinegar, salt water, and a
chest rub to alleviate COVID-19 symptoms. We also included
a leaet in ve languages about where and how to access
further health care during the pandemic.
At times, it can literally feel like a “sticking plaster,” as we
say in England, when you’re applying bandages or engaged in
wound care. Yet it’s clear after thousands of conversations that
the solidarity is valued and needed, and people feel warmth
and anity toward the medicines we used, particularly
because many of the travelers are coming from countries with
strong herbal medicine traditions.
Herbal medicine comes into its own in response to upper
respiratory infections (coughs, colds, u, sinus infections, etc.).
We give people cough syrup, immune tonic, chest rubs, salt
water, lozenges, and so on, to help shift their symptoms. We
listen to people’s chests if they’ve been coughing for longer
than a week, and refer them for antibiotics or a hospital when
needed. Our work in the region is not just about symptomatic
relief; our multimodality team of doctors, paramedics, and
herbalists aims to nd those people who may slip through the
net and yet need urgent care. One man I met who’d had a
long-term cough and sore throat actually had tuberculosis. He
was able to access urgent care during a two-week hospital stay,
and it was amazing to shake his hand on the next visit once
he was out of the hospital. We also oer bruise ointments and

every day. And we’ve distributed garlic, ginger, and lemons
as general immune support for folks to cook with in their
informal encampments.
In Calais and Dunkirk, there is a constant ow of new
arrivals, so we give them a guide to all the services in the area
(produced and translated into multiple languages by a group
called Refugee Infobus). Many people are not aware that
health care is possible if you do not have papers or money.
The reviews of La Pass, the local free clinic, are mixed; many
report experiences of racism and frustration, though others
have had a more positive experience. Either way, it’s important
to know that the clinic exists and is available if people need it.
Still, many people won’t take the long bus ride to the clinic,
especially due to racism risks, and so working in the camps
is essential. Many people have secondary infected wounds,
such as a small mosquito bite that’s become infected. We use
conventional rst aid dressings, but will often bring in herbal
tools such as baikal skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis) powder
combined with aloe vera gel into a paste. People will look at
you wondering what the hell are you putting on them, only
to come back over the following days delighted that their
stubborn wound is nally healing.
We’ve had so many beautiful and tender conversations
about people’s experience with herbal medicine where
they are coming from too. It’s a validating reminder that
herbal medicine is the primary form of health care for most
people on the planet, and not everywhere has the prejudices
and reductionist attitudes toward herbal remedies that is
prevalent in the United Kingdom, where many people
have been separated from the land for seven generations of

notions that separate people from their bodies and landscapes.

## CARE IS A RADICAL ACT

I’ve had this tiny anxiety in the back of my head that
people wouldn’t nd [our humble herbal medicine]
useful in this context. Like WTF can some herb tea
do right now? But the demand has taken me aback,
and everyone is constantly saying how needed and
appreciated it is.

## —Solidarity Apothecary, Instagram, November 2019

Plant medicines gave me the opportunity to see that our
work for liberation is not just about social war but also
about healing. Indeed, developing and experimenting with
collective, transformational ways to heal actually is the work.
In an abolitionist context, this can mean searching for forms
of healing that don’t involve reimprisonment or further state
violence (such as being sent to a psychiatric hospital). It can
and should involve recognizing that abolitionist work is as
much about trauma recovery as it is about resistance—that
reclaiming life from trauma is resistance. Recovery must be
a politicized practice and collective endeavor. It can mean
engaging in methods of healing that build mutual aid and
reconnection, solidarity and social relationships.
Care is a radical act, and one of our biggest weapons.
Collective care points beyond all the structures we ght against
while simultaneously already embodying the alternatives we
ght and yearn for. Yet for too long, the centrality of care to

## SOLIDARIT Y APOTHEC ARY   /   191

---

life itself has been downplayed or erased, including within
anarchist circles. Anarcha-feminists have challenged the
invisibilization of care, even as they’ve typically been the
ones to engage in the myriad types of “care work” that form
the backbone of anarchist infrastructure, and are essential to
everything that anarchists believe in and practice.
Plants sustain life too, despite the fact that “we” in the
colonized Western world have been taught to no longer
see plants, much less have a relationship with them. Yet
as Indigenous writer and scientist Robin Wall Kimmerer
observes, “In some Native languages the term for plants
translates to ‘those who take care of us.’”4 Plants take care of
each other and their ecosystems, including taking care of us.
They take care of us in prison courtyards and refugee camps,
when fleeing war zones or working toward a world free of
domination, exploitation, and oppression. The Solidarity
Apothecary and my related projects are just tiny conduits; the
herbs themselves are mutual aid.

Mags: It’s the last few days of May 2020. Or maybe it’s the
rst few days of June. I don’t really know anymore. I haven’t
slept signicantly since May 26, the day after the murder of
George Floyd. He was assassinated at Thirty-Eighth Street
and Chicago Avenue—a place that would become known
(and still is) as George Floyd Square. In the days immediately
following his killing, the Third Precinct of the Minneapolis
Police Department at Lake Street and Minnehaha Avenue
was the site of a pitched battle that ended in police eeing and
the building being set on re. The structure is still a fenced-
o, charred shell as of this writing over three years later. The
house I lived in at the time was—as the crow ies—halfway
between those two intersections.
There is no way here to capture the days and weeks of that
time in Minneapolis, in my neighborhood. The beauty, fear,
and complexities, or even just the sounds. And for anyone
unfamiliar with this city, it may have seemed like a random
spark—this death. It wasn’t. For years, the murder of Black,
Indigenous, and Brown people here has been at epidemic
levels. This moment was only one culmination, among others,
of years of struggle. I would never claim to have been at the
center of any of that. I played a support role, predominantly
as a street medic with North Star Health Collective. Yet
what happened was a rebellion, an exploding ecosystem of
glorious rage, solidarity, and care in which we were all ghting
like hell for a new and dierent Minneapolis and world.

Cory: I was vetted by North Star about forty-eight hours
after the community burned the Third Precinct to the ground.
Less than a week earlier, I’d returned to the United States the
night before George Floyd was murdered, after spending
seventy days in a military lockdown in Ecuador at the start of
the pandemic. Knowing that it lacked the resources to handle
the assault of COVID-19 that we were seeing in Europe at
that time, and with only thirty-seven conrmed cases in the
country, Ecuador put a strict nationwide curfew into place
that ran from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. each day.
At 2:00 p.m., sirens blared all over Quito, the capital city
where I was then living, and at 2:30 p.m. helicopters could
be seen ying overhead, making sure that people were in fact
inside for the rest of the day and night. The consequences
for breaking curfew and other regulations involved being
ned a month’s salary and thrown into jail for three to
four months. Having come from this extreme Ecuadorian
lockdown, I was still in the mindset of taking curfews
seriously. Early on in the George Floyd uprising, and shortly
after curfews were being set in both Minneapolis and Saint
Paul, I heard a rumor that street medics were allowed “curfew
immunity.” This turned out to be a laughable fallacy, yet as
I like to say, “I came for the lie; I stayed for the community.”
Although there is absolutely no such thing as curfew
immunity for street medics, I’m glad this false rumor led me
to a phone call that changed my life. With my hands shaking
out of nervousness, I called a number given to me by a friend
of a friend and left a voicemail with someone at North Star
Health Collective, asking if I could become a street medic.
As a certied Wilderness First Responder for over twelve

years at that point, I had already put together a makeshift
med kit and was carrying it around with me at the daily
protests. I felt like providing medical and emotional care was
something that I could do for my communities during this
time of crisis. Back in 2016, I had received some basic street
medic training while at Standing Rock, but the early days of
the George Floyd uprising were where I rst saw frontline
duty. Connecting with North Star gave me a community that
was incredibly supportive and empowering.
Before long, running as a street medic was what I did with
my life for the rest of 2020, and have done ever since.

## * * *
North Star Health Collective “ran”—shorthand for going out
as a street medic—in support of what would become known
as “the uprising.” Later, it was called the rst uprising or
George Floyd uprising because of the one that was kicked
o the following year by another murder-by-police, this time
of Daunte Wright. We ran beginning with the rst march
after George Floyd was killed, although we had no idea what
was coming at the end of that march when it reached the
Third Precinct. As the anger on the streets found traction and
sustained itself beyond a day or two, or even a few, North Star
wasn’t fully prepared for the level of labor to come in caring
for our communities.
This is not an attempt to tell that story, even though we’ll
reference it. Instead, it is a reection on how, as medics, we
engage in movements and grassroots organizing, because the

## NORTH STAR HEALTH COLLECTIVE   /   199

---

voluntary, self-organized practice of oering health care on
the streets is often overlooked when we focus on our most
intense moments or the ones that are usually centered in the
media spotlight. That how is also the way by which we have
come through the uprising(s) stronger.

## A BRIEF HISTORY

How we were drawn to this work is unique to each of our
lived experiences, of course, but the street medic world has
a long and powerful history. We usually start the story in the
civil rights era—though there are lineages far older than
that—and share the origins of the Medical Committee for
Human Rights, which had a protest arm that took care of
people in the streets in places like Selma, Alabama. We honor
the health care work of the Black Panther Party and Young
Lords.1 The teachers of the next generation of street medics
came from that time and taught those of us in the “another
world is possible” era in the late 1990s and early 2000s the
same skills. Medic skills evolved and continue to do so to
this day, when now those of us from that earlier time in turn
teach the new generation. North Star’s tale falls into these last
chapters.
North Star Health Collective was founded in 2008 in
preparation for the Republican National Convention set
to be hosted in Saint Paul that year. Founding member

Kat Donnelly notes that “2008 was a really intense time
in Minneapolis organizing … and we got hit real hard by
repression. Real hard. A lot of people got very, very hurt.”
North Star wasn’t an exception, and so while we were medics
for that large action, there was a good bit of care work that
was needed for the community and ourselves afterward.
This work wove its way through the following years, through
Occupy and other encampments, supporting protests in the
region such as against a NATO summit in Chicago in 2012,
and during the 2014 uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, after
police murdered Mike Brown. Here in Minneapolis, between
the ongoing killing of Black people by cops and responses to
the rise of the alt-right, we were consistently doing what we
could to support struggles. Then in 2019, “Donald Trump
came to town. And then the pandemic happened. And then
George Floyd was killed. … And then we’ve been just running
at-out for the last two years,” says Kat. And when we weren’t
running, we were leading trainings.
What came with the uprising was more than just that
“at-out” run. It meant that we had to change how we did
things. In some ways, everything changed after the murder of
George Floyd, but what carried us through and continues to
do so is that we never lost sight of our values. In unparalleled
experiences of upheaval across whole swaths of the Twin
Cities, we were able to breathe and ask ourselves, “OK,
how do we participate yet stay grounded in who we are?”
Before May 25, 2020, when a protest happened, the core
organizers—a loosely aliated group of medics that chose
to do more of the logistical organizing—would reach out to
all the trained medics, including ourselves, to see who could

## NORTH STAR HEALTH COLLECTIVE   /   201

---

go run. Maybe someone dispatched from afar, but there was
not much of a structure; we hadn’t needed one. By three days
into the George Floyd uprising, we realized that we needed to
build something more solid. Our existing medics were already
burning out from the intensity on the streets, while people
wanting to street medic were coming out of the woodwork.
These new folks were excited by what was happening around
them, and some had medical training, yet the majority of
them were almost entirely without street medic training and
sometimes any medical training at all.
While this is a brief glance at our history, much of what
North Star was able to hold during the uprising and into
the present is based on years of developing our theories and
practices, and building out our ideas, trainings, and what is at
the heart of our work. This can’t be understated. A moment
of uprising can turn the world upside down, but our practices
can carry us through those moments well (or not) regardless
of our role. North Star and street medics in general, along
with many other roles integral to this ght, cannot be seen or
understood only in moments of upheaval or crisis, because
how we act in those moments is dened by much longer,
deeper relational work.

## NORTH STAR ETHICS

There is a dierence between being a street medic and being
a medic-in-the-streets. Health care professionals who hit the
streets with their med bags are not necessarily prepared to give
care to people under extreme duress with limited resources.
And unless you’re a trained street medic, you might not be
operating with the same values that North Star holds. We

## 202 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

are there to serve our communities by giving consent-
based care and spreading calm. We are the antithesis of the
“Batmans” who charge into situations with their med kits
and credentials in hand, more interested in playing the
role of hero while forcing “care” onto patients than actually
doing the deep work of decolonizing themselves or the
medical systems that employ them. It’s one thing to provide
medical care to those wounded on the front lines. It’s another
to do so while making sure that the patient’s bodily autonomy
and dignity is prioritized.
When North Star trains community members—whether in
basic health and safety or as full street medics—we start with
our ethics. Our core values include consent, do no harm, take
no shit, and noncooperation with state actors and fascists.
North Star believes that in order to help keep people calm,
slow is smooth and smooth is fast—meaning that we’re more
capable of moving through a situation quickly and respectfully
if we slow down and remain calm. We maintain people’s
condentiality and only work within our scope—that is, a
set of skills that we’ve self-determined together make sense
in our role as street medics. We rely on a buddy system and
accountability, lean into exibility, and support a diversity of
tactics. These ethics map onto the anarchistic and feministic
frameworks, among other liberatory ones, of the collective.
For us, it all starts with consent. Most of our medics
remember the moment in training when one of us jumped
up and down yelling “Consent! Consent! Consent!” over and
over again. Consent is embedded in everything we aspire to do.
It’s rooted in both preguring the kinds of solidaristic care
we ascribe to and aiming not to replicate the white Christian

## NORTH STAR HEALTH COLLECTIVE   /   203

---

supremacist, misogynist culture of the dominant conventional
medical system, which among other things, typically follows
a hierarchical structure of “the doctor knows best” and
imposes that onto people seen as “patients.” Instead, as Kat
puts it, North Star emphasizes “enthusiastic, radical consent.
In every interaction, it’s something that I strive for.” We see
our relationship to those we’re aiding in the streets as both
mutualistic and a way to “honor how we each move through
the world,” says Kat.
From this place of centering consent, we get to the notion
of “do no harm.” This is an ethic that supposedly runs
through medical culture and yet we know how little that
tracks with people’s lived experiences. When we really take
this seriously, it runs deep. Sometimes North Star is perceived
as being overly cautious because of this value. As an example,
we don’t carry medication to give out—even over-the-counter
meds like ibuprofen—because when we’ve never interacted
with someone before, we don’t know anything about them,
such as their allergies or medical history. So if we’re trying to
challenge the ways that capitalism and patriarchy push things
onto people, or that as health care providers, we somehow
know better than you about your own body, then in a brief
instance on the street, we can’t pretend that we know what
will or will not harm you.
Furthermore, this gets at a demilitarized approach. As we
mentioned, “medics” poured into town during the uprising,
with some asserting, “I was a combat medic in the military,”
and bringing along an attitude of “I’m the big man who
can throw someone over my shoulder and run them out of
the fray.” In the streets—in a time of resistance—this looks

## 204 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

exactly like the shit so many of us femme, BIPOC, queer, and
trans folks experience in the dominant system of medicine.
We reject such practices so as to shift the experience for both
the person oering and the person accepting care. Parvaneh,
a newer medic, underscored “just how blatantly fucked
up the medical system is” and that North Star continually
stresses that fact “through all the trainings. There’s a super
deep understanding of how fucking colonial, racist, sexist,
and homophobic the medical system is, and how we need to
consistently be pushing against that as medics. Unlearning
that is so active.”
Street medics love to say, more expansively, “Do no harm.
Take no shit.” This encompasses our core value of doing no
harm, but is also shorthand for not being neutral. We don’t
work with the state; we don’t work with fascists. We’re on
a side, and we show up so that our side can keep ghting.
For example, if you take a standard CPR class, you’ll be
taught to call 911 as a core part of any response. In North
Star, we learn how to recognize when someone needs higher
medical care, get consent from them before engaging with
911 or emergency medical services (EMS), and not give away
sensitive or identifying information to emergency services.
We center not only the person we’re caring for and act as an
advocate for them if they desire but recognize that we are
in an antagonistic relationship with the state too. When the
EMS and police show up, we don’t chat with them like we’re
buddies just because we might have similar training. We don’t
cooperate with or even ever talk to them unless it is explicitly
in an advocacy role and with the injured person’s consent.
Jay, who has run with North Star, notes that these ethics

## NORTH STAR HEALTH COLLECTIVE   /   205

---

are for them about “moving through the world with a radical
attention to how I impact other people, and doing that in a
way that doesn’t devalue myself. I feel like those are often two
things in our culture; we have a hard time balancing or even
acknowledging our impact and caring for ourselves.”

Mags: When I think about why I’m a street medic, I think
about an experience the rst night of the uprising after
the murder of George Floyd. People weren’t particularly
prepared for it to turn into such a street battle. The cops were
in hard defense of their precinct; it had been breached and
was surrounded on three sides. They were ring tear gas every
way they could. They would re a round, and people would
move back to let the chemical spray pass. And there, in that
moment, is my medic buddy and me. We wash peoples’ eyes
out so that they can advance again. Twenty years ago it was
the same. We wash your eyes or tend to your wounds so that
you can keep ghting.

## 206 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

such Saturday, my buddy and I arrived on-site and were
quickly approached by two people marked as medics who
we’d never seen before. Dressed head to toe in camouage
and with the familiar posture of someone who is obviously
taking themselves too seriously, one of these so-called medics
introduced themselves and proceeded to tell us about an
alleged protocol we were supposed to follow for calling
ambulances. North Star’s protocol is to only call an ambulance
with patient consent. In sharp contrast, it was clear that this
“medic” believed they had the authority to call an ambulance
whether their patient wanted them to or not.
With the colonizing air of a white person who is used to
deciding who is in charge and who is not, this person bowled
forward, “And don’t forget, you have to treat anyone who gets
hurt today, including any cops or fascists! You have a moral
and legal obligation to do this. And if you don’t want to follow
your moral and legal obligations, then what are you even doing
here?” The “medic” locked eyes with me as if I had outwardly
shuddered at the thought of treating a cop or fascist. I know
that I had not, in fact, reacted at all; as a woman of color, I
have had a lot of practice keeping my face and body language
neutral while a white person lectures me or bosses me around
with an assumed authority that they don’t actually have. I
wait for them to nish having their moment and then walk
away, continuing to live my life how I see t. In this particular
instance, I knew that I wasn’t bound to the so-called ethics
that a random medic-in-the-street had suddenly sprung on us.
I wouldn’t have given the interaction that much more
thought except that my buddy was pretty shaken up by it,
initially worried that we needed to do what the medic-in-

## NORTH STAR HEALTH COLLECTIVE   /   207

---

the-street told us. “We don’t need to listen to random people
whose values seem super suspicious,” I assured my buddy.
“We get to hold to our values.” To validate my instincts, I
called our dispatcher to explain what had happened. She was
horried that the other medic had tried to pressure us to put
ourselves in danger by treating a cop or fascist. “Absolutely
not!” I can still hear our dispatcher’s voice in my head,
booming out of the speaker on my phone as my buddy and I
huddled around it in the cool November air. “There actually
is no moral or legal obligation to treat cops or fascists, especially
not as a BIPOC person; that could really put you in danger!”
I remember feeling really grateful that after six months of
running nonstop as a North Star medic, I was grounded
in our collective’s ethics, which helped me see through the
bullshit, and make a better decision for myself, my buddy, and
the people we were there to protect. Ignoring that shitty white
medic’s oppressive and obsessive need to assert dominance
and control is one of the ways I really leaned into the “take
no shit” part of “do not harm, take no shit.”

## NORTH STAR PRACTICES

Holding a set of anarchist values while in motion is important.
North Star often thrives—or knows why we’re not—because
of our practices. We work to live this out in everything we
do. Which means that we develop protocols as well as discuss
how to evolve and change, but from a strong rooting in what
we are working to build. It’s granular, like when we check in
with each other at the start of an action. It guides us, such
that we insist on never running alone. It’s why we have a
whole dispatch system so as to care for each other on, and as

## 208 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

we’re leaving, the streets. Our ethics supply us with a compass
for the wide-ranging and challenging ongoing process of
remaking care work in the world today.

## BUDDIES AND THE RITUAL OF OUR CHECK -INS

To understand our check-ins, you have to understand that
we always run with at least one other person and sometimes
more. If there are three medics at a march, they all stick
together. If there are more, they can split into pairs or trios.
The larger collective trusts the autonomy of the medics on
the ground to decide how to do that within our protocols.
Buddies are important for several reasons—safety, support,
accountability, and just plain logistics, to name a few. When
we train street medics, before we ever get to medical skills, we
teach our ethics and then our buddy system because it is a key
practice of those ethics. In each training, we teach and stress
PEARLY (physical vulnerabilities, emotional vulnerabilities,
arrestability, role, loose ends, and yes [or no] to buddying),
and buddy pairs go through this list with each other at the
start of a run.
Whether we’re approaching a candlelight vigil or thousand-
person march, check-ins give us a moment to ground ourselves,
within ourselves and to one another. We do this even if we
have the pleasure of running as a street medic with several
of our best friends—friends who’ve been in our lives for years
before we ever became street medics. PEARLY allows us
room to be dynamic human beings, capable of changing our
boundaries as needed every time we run. There’s also a sort
of secular holiness in practicing this ritual. It prepares and
calms us the way that reverence prepares and calms a person

## NORTH STAR HEALTH COLLECTIVE   /   209

---

in a moment of spirituality. This is unsurprising, as caring for
our communities is a holy and sacred act.
“It’s a ritual that it allows us to also do something really
important, which is acknowledge vulnerability and fear. And I
feel like my fear is most dangerous to me and others when it’s
left untended and unnoticed,” explains Jay, adding,

How am I vulnerable? What things will break if I don’t
hold them or if I’m not here to hold them? What do
you need to know about my body to keep me safe from
really intense harm? You can’t really do PEARLY
without noticing what makes you afraid. And I feel
like going through that with somebody else is the only
way to not be ashamed about it, otherwise I’m going
to do something stupid in a dangerous situation to try
to prove I’m not afraid. When we do PEARLY at the
beginning, we’re writing our own story about what it
means to do something dangerous and what it means
to be afraid and where our values live in those choices,
as opposed to capitalism’s values or from our fucking
martyrdom complexes. There’s nothing more radical
than to say to your buddy, “I’ve never spent close time
with you, but our work is now to keep each other safe.”

## DISPATCH

Buddies on the ground are backed up by our dispatchers,
who oer care as well, but remotely. Our dispatch is a
support system made up of people who are away from the

## 210 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

action and can keep tabs for the medics on big-picture
information, such as what’s being reported on trusted live
streams or Signal threads—say, about where the cops are or
where there’s a serious injury. Dispatchers can also respond
to questions about protocols or where extra medic supplies
are located. Most important, dispatchers know where medics
are at all times when they’re running, who each medic wants
as their emergency contact in case they are arrested or hurt
on the street, and that each medic has gotten in and out of
the action safely. Historically, North Star had a loose way of
doing dispatch, but during the rst days of the uprising, we
built a complex system involving Signal threads, encrypted
spreadsheets, and dispatching protocols, allowing friends and
then other vetted folks to do dispatch from within and far
beyond Minneapolis.
North Star sees dispatch as a duty to our medics and never a
burden. Our commitment to our medics is to know where and
how they are. To care for each other is to take responsibility
for each other. In numerous actions across the continent, for
example, street medics have been targeted by both police
and fascists. Dispatchers share such intel with our medics,
and let them decide whether they want to keep running that
night or not, and where. If the medic wants to be taken o
the streets, dispatchers help them do so as safely as possible.
We then make sure that the remaining medics have buddies,
including by activating on-call medics. Dispatch might feel
overbearing to some medics, as in, for instance, “Why do we
have to remember to check out when we leave?” But we see
it as working to solidify a culture of collective care by holding
everyone through each action.

## NORTH STAR HEALTH COLLECTIVE   /   211

---

For us, building and holding such structures, such agree-
ments and protocols, is part and parcel of the active work of
building the world we want in the shell of the old. Many of
us are in the medical eld, or have some relationship to it as
part of our jobs, history, or future. We reckon with the myriad
problems of those institutions daily. So when we borrow some
skills from “our day jobs” to apply in the streets, we choose to
craft something else in that self-organized space; we aspire to
practice and pregure other ways of doing care work. That
means that as a collective, we’re continually trying to balance
our knowledge and humility, our protocols and exibility—
which is both messy and risky as well as beautiful. Jay captures
that generative balance:

What really drew me into North Star was this way to
create boundaries, love and care, and ethical support
and structures around providing care work that held
me accountable to the people I was caring for, and
protected me in relationship with others as well. I
was desperate to nd a way to be a carer in the world
that didn’t just destroy me. And I also was so deeply
moved and connected to what I think is like a deep
and anarchist core principle as well: that everybody
has agency, and my “job” as a medic isn’t to decide
things for people; it’s to take care of them and support
them in making the choices that they need to take care
of themselves. In Judaism, there’s a concept called
halacha, which is often translated as law, but it literally
means the way of going. And the ethos behind being
a North Star street medic feels like halacha—together

## 212 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

we are nding a way of going. I found other parts
of my life suddenly shifting in relationship to those
principles and ideals.

## A FULL DIVERSITY OF TACTICS

It’s easy to look at the past few years and focus on the burned
buildings and pitched street battles. We can’t see those times
clearly here without that; the charred remains of a police
precinct stand on one side of South Minneapolis with an
intact yet still protected precinct, encircled by barricades and
barbed wire, sitting on the other end of Lake Street. Street
medics show up when needed. We do so without judgment of
tactics or a role in deciding them. That means that we don’t
just treat your burns from a tear gas canister; we stick by those
who need to express themselves in many ways.
Frequently “a diversity of tactics” gets used as a code that it
has to be OK to burn things down. But what the twenty-four-
hour social media cycle probably missed is that in the years
during, following, and in between uprisings, there have been
marches, protests, community assemblies, vigils, communal
mourning, building occupations, mutual aid eorts, and more.
We don’t, as medics, have endless capacity or time, and so we
can only do so much and hope that others ll in the gaps. Still,
we aren’t just there for the re. As individuals, we have many
dierent feelings about various tactics being used at dierent
points and in dierent places. As a collective, we try to show
up where we are invited and needed, because people who are
organizing and agitating can use care.
What we strive for is to be a group that makes the best
tactics and strategies possible—because people are cared for.

## NORTH STAR HEALTH COLLECTIVE   /   213

---

We don’t have set rules, just living questions that we ask
ourselves, such as, What is the denition of the streets? Those
types of questions allow Autumn, as a street medic, to connect and be vulnerable. Which I feel is dierent
than being out and being like, fuck the system! Fuck the
system! I denitely feel and love to participate in that.
But I think of the experience of, say, the small march
where I was positioned right by Daunte Wright’s mom.
The sentencing [for the killer] had just come out, and
as we were calling out the names [of Daunte and so
many others murdered by police], there was so much
fucking grief. As a medic, I was able to be soft in that
moment and just feel that grief with Daunte’s mom
as people were naming o the names, repeating back
who was murdered, who was lynched, and yelling her
kid’s name. I’m super grateful we’re all here for such
times, because Daunte’s mom needed to be at that
modern-day funeral procession.

That day, in that anger and grief, someone was clearly upset,
yelling and moving around erratically. As street medics, we
didn’t interrupt or stop that person. We let them be in their
rage yet also stayed close in case they needed support. To street
medic shouldn’t be an interruption of legitimate emotional
response but rather a means of holding people during it.

## CARING FOR THE CARERS

Of course, this doesn’t ever come easy or with some magical
clarity. Many of us are burned out right now, even though

## 214 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

much of our work isn’t happening during intense street
battles. Much of our work is actually preventative—oering
sunscreen and electrolytes-type stu. But it’s almost as if
we’ve been on call for over three years since the uprising. So
we’ve had to wrestle with what it is to care for ourselves as
## well. Jay observes that we can be so thoughtful and so careful about how we
connect and move through the world, and also not
destroy ourselves in that process. Everybody gets to
say yes or no to anything that’s happening. And if
I really believe in that [consent] for other people, I
have to believe that about myself, because I notice
that the moments I don’t believe that about myself
are the moments I start stepping over other people’s
consent and agency. When we care for ourselves it’s
disruptive of a story that’s so convenient to capitalism,
which is that people just care and then die, right?
They don’t get to keep growing. I don’t think until I
really encountered and tried to live out that principle
that I actually understood that capitalism wins when
caretakers die and burnout. It had never occurred to
me that there was another way.

North Star has made it our business to not allow this to
happen to our medics. A clear example is when eleven of
us were arrested on November 4, 2020, the day after the US
presidential elections. In what became known as “the most
expensive dance party in the history of Minnesota,” multiple
law enforcement agencies kettled nearly seven hundred

protesters who were in the process of marching o I-94,
after having temporarily blocked it, back into residential
neighborhoods. The police trapped protesters, medics, and
independent media on the freeway for upward of ve hours,
and a dance party broke out to pass the time.2 Immediately
North Star demonstrated incredible care to the carers—from
contacting our family members to let them know we were
getting arrested to nding all of us a lawyer to help get our
charges dropped. North Star even paid for all of us to have
group therapy sessions, where we were free to process all the
joy and fear that existed side by side that night.
We’re not perfect, as North Star, in taking care of ourselves
and each other. As we’ve doubled and tripled in size, and come
through multiple years of upheaval and ongoing community
actions of various types, we continue to work to nd ways
to hold each other in this for the long haul. We’ve tried all
kinds of things from more casual hangouts to using outside
facilitators, and are always open to new ideas. We don’t take
lightly that we have a lengthy ght ahead of us, and so we
must take good care of everyone in the here and now. It’s
noteworthy in this regard that almost all the street medics,
dispatchers, and other members of the collective are femme—
literally over 95 percent. In a patriarchal society where many
of us are also parents, adult children, nurses, and/or parts of
chosen queer family, to care for ourselves while we care for
our communities is a challenging yet radical act.

things on. I want to meet your problems and create space for
that in myself [even if] I don’t even have it,” remarks Em. “I
have to separate that from my earnest desire to do good in the
world. And I think North Star has been really helpful for that
because I’m not taking anything on simply to do it. I feel good
about this work and don’t feel like I’m necessarily bringing
gendered baggage.”
“I feel like North Star does a great job of centering taking
care of yourself too. That has been the vibe every time there’s
a protest,” explains Parvaneh. “‘You have a stomach ache?
Don’t medic that night.’ I really respect and appreciate that
because especially in other spaces that I’ve been in, it’s just,
‘Who can last out here the longest? I haven’t eaten in four
days. What about you? Don’t you believe in the cause!’ With
## North Star, it’s chill.”

## NORTH STAR TODAY, NORTH STAR TOMORROW

Minneapolis, the Twin Cities Metro, and the state of
Minnesota are in a challenging moment right now. It’s been
nearly three years since the uprising in response to the lynching
of George Floyd, followed by subsequent uprisings around
the city, and almost two years since the culminating summer
of frontline ghts against the Line 3 pipeline. The amount of
people being ground up while going through the legal system
is staggering—somewhere in the thousands—not to mention
the impact of trauma on those facing state repression and/or
having been part of such battles. The work of trying to pick
up the pieces and gure out what comes next, and how heavy
that weight feels, is palpable. For all the broader attention that
comes with the pitched battles and direct actions, there are a

## NORTH STAR HEALTH COLLECTIVE   /   217

---

lot of attempts to do things dierently that go unseen. There
are struggles with resources (too many and too few), burnout,
strategic and tactical dierences of opinion, and an often
exhausted crew of mutual aid folks working to keep up with
the ongoing battles between unhoused people and the city’s
eviction campaigns.
This only scratches the surface of the work that we both
try to care for and not destroy ourselves in doing. And it all
comes with a lot of grief. It is one thing to say that we pushed
to new levels when that precinct burned down; it’s another
to live here day-to-day with the police who continue to get
more money and act with impunity. It’s impressive to watch
a community throw everything it has at the system (we even
tried voting in a citywide referendum, one of the outcomes of
the uprising, to “abolish” the police); it is also a hard reality
to face that harm is still being caused and parents are still
grieving their state-murdered children.
This is the moment we are trying to live into and build in
right now—with our values in hand, no matter how that ght
continues to play out. We do that in community relationships
with other projects, collectives, and groups. We do that by
taking time to dig into our own internal structure and makeup,
aspiring to move into increasingly nonhierarchical structures
balanced by listening to those with long experience in both
North Star and our communities. As part of that, we’ve
initiated an Anti-Racist Praxis Project within North Star.
North Star is built on a history and practice with dened
ethics, and we train this and work to live it every day. We are
not neutral. There’s no test or ideological adherence required
for entry, but most of us are anarchists, and we don’t shy away

from that word within our collective. Instead, we lean into
what we are trying to build. We create a space where we use
the words anarchist and abolitionist, underscoring that we’re a
largely femme and queer organization. Perhaps that is a key
way in which we are deeply feminist: we are here to be in
relationship with each other as we all grow together.
Within that, our roles change and shift. Some of us are
over two decades in, and some of us have been part of North
Star for three years or even three months. We recognize that
organizing can be challenging and frequently inaccessible.
How does a group that spans generations, and spans life
experiences related to race, gender, culture, faith, and so
much more, make space in a way that is open and welcoming?
All we can do, as medics with North Star, is cup our hands
around the ame, feel its warmth, and tend to that with care,
and hope that what we strive to nurture continues to grow.

For those on the margins, making do with scraps is common
sense.
I’ve no idea if that’s what led me, as a preteen and teenager,
to take bits of colorful fabric, cut them into triangles and
trapezoids and other queered shapes, and stitch them into
square patches. The idea was to someday craft enough that I
could then sew them together into a patchwork quilt. I made
neat, growing stacks of these patches, setting them aside in
my closet. Over those years, I had more than enough for
many quilts, many times over, but I never started, much less
nished, even one.
In parallel with this solo activity, yet stretching back as
far as I can remember, I was constantly dreaming up and
bringing to life all sorts of otherworldly spaces, also pieced
together from scraps, but collaboratively with others. To take
just one early example, along with a crew of preteen pals,
I self-organized our own theatrical adaptation of Hansel
and Gretel using the basement of my house as our stage, and
naturally felt it was a great idea to drag in hundreds of fallen
tree branches that we scavenged outdoors to construct a full-
on forest indoors. In our version, as I recall, we celebrated
kids running away from insuerable situations and trying to
live by caring for each other (via foraging and candy), with
the witch as an accomplice—not villain. Yet the real magical
transformation was that a dusty cellar lled with abandoned
things could become a leafy wooded paradise overowing
with friends.
In hindsight, weaving beautiful social fabrics has been a
contiguous thread running through my life. I realize now,
though, why I never completed a quilt: one shouldn’t have

## STITCHING TOGE THER OTHER WORLDS   /   223

---

to do it alone; moreover, the insidiousness of how patriarchy
socializes us all made me “feminize” and thus devalue
my hand-sewn patches as any sort of contribution. It feels
metaphorically accurate that I hid them away in a closet,
making my own handiwork invisible. I didn’t yet understand
that every labor of love can be a small piece of something
much bigger, wholly at cross-purposes with the current social
order, when we intentionally and collectively suture those
parts into a whole. We have all the material we need, right in
our scrappy hands.
Take the implicitly rebellious history of quilting.
This “women’s work” was, for centuries, not merely a
necessity in terms of supplying households of modest means
with blankets. Crucially, it allowed female and queer folks to
create their own social, cultural, and political space in the
form of what has come to be called “quilting bees.” Here,
those relegated to the so-called domestic sphere came together
to collectivize their scraps and labor, literally and guratively
sewing communal comfort for each other, and in the process,
making room for themselves in a world that typically shut
them out. While stitching, they could exchange everything
from recipes and home remedies, to their problems and fears,
to news and gossip, or skills and other resources. They could
tell each other stories of hardship or harm, and from there,
lend each other protection or intervention; or swap stories
of loss and grief, and oer emotional care; or spin tales of
joy, dreams, and aspirations, likely fomenting all sorts of
resistance to achieve their visions.
Frequently, these bees turned into community events,
bringing what would otherwise be invisible eorts into the

## 224 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

light of day, including via folks embroidering their own stories
as images on quilts. That kind of radical comfort made its way,
for instance, into the AIDS memorial quilt, an idea emerging
from street demos following the 1978 assassination of gay San
Francisco supervisor Harvey Milk and the resultant riots as
a way to honor the dead and ght for the living during a
“silence equals death” pandemic that killed o so many gay
and gender-nonconforming people.
The point isn’t that every quilt equals revolution. It’s that
we shouldn’t minimize the potential of what can feel like
small, individual patches of practices, whether on our own or
with tiny circles of friends and neighbors. We shouldn’t make
invisible the kinds of liminal, messy-beautiful time-spaces we
make for our crafting and scheming, whether they produce
material embodiments as a result, and/or the essential
immateriality of reciprocal comfort and care, aiding us to be
coconspirators in mending this world. And when displayed
together—like the AIDS quilt, which stretches for miles now
and was toured at the start of another pandemic, COVID,
which in turn sparked a wave of mutual aid and summer of
uprising—we realize that we are indeed everything we need
and want and desire. We ourselves sow possibilities, and
ones that can get us through the coldest and darkest of days
and nights.
So here’s a small sampler—what’s usually dismissed as
ultimately forming a “crazy quilt,” without design or intention,
when viewed from the vantage point of heteronormativity,
patriarchy, and other tools of violence that rip us to shreds.
Yet through the lens of dignity, life, and freedom, it’s the stu

of weaving a perfectly beautiful, anarcha-feminist pattern.1

The beloved project ended, badly. A monthlong anarchist
camp—but so much more than that—that I’d thrown myself
into for a decade’s worth of summers. It split into two halves
that could never again form a whole, if it ever did. More
precisely, one half had to leave because the other half had,
over the years, organized as if in a cloud-cuckoo-land, not
wanting to venture past its own political dogmatism, internal
power dynamics, and patriarchal behaviors (despite rhetoric to
the contrary), or inability to deal with the reality of mundane
logistics like paying the bills. Our half had brought vibrancy
to this project, not only renewing it in many ways, but doing
the lion’s share of the self-organizing and communal care to
make it happen. In the end, we became, to borrow from Ursula
K. Le Guin, “the ones who walk[ed] away” from what had,
for us, so often felt utopian, knowing that our departure also
spelled the death of this longtime, remarkably transformative
space for hundreds of other anarchists from around the world.
Similar to the conclusion of Le Guin’s short story, we
couldn’t yet imagine what alternative universe we were
journeying toward, though, mostly because our hearts were
so heavy. “It is possible it does not exist,” observes Le Guin.
    1. This sampler is based solely on my own recollections, ltered
through the mists of time, beginning with the rst piece in the 1990s
and early 2000s, and moving closer to the present from there. It does
not mean to imply a seamless experience; like all feministic anarchist
experiments, these have their share of aws and heartbreaks. Still, it’s
crucial to recognize those time-spaces when we feel as if we’re already
inhabiting the kinds of social and organizational relations that we so
desire and deserve.

## 226 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

“But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who
walk away.”
What we knew, as genderqueer friends and even chosen
family, was that we had to process our loss together. We had
to rest and regroup, play and rethink. And as part of that, on
one sunny day, we circled up around a table outside a bakery
in our tiny town, ourselves a tiny crew, to eat and brainstorm.
What did we want to see emerge out of the ashes and lessons
of the project we’d just left? Over the next year, ve years, or
even ten? And crucially, what did we want to promise each
other about how to do the next project(s) dierently so as to
actually embody our ethics, especially around organizing as
if social relations matter? Felt-tip markers transferred our
musings onto big sheets of butcher-block paper, which quickly
lled with seemingly unattainable strivings.
Soon after, serendipitously, some folks starting an
anarchistic all-ages café and community hub asked if we
wanted a small room on the second oor above them, along
with access to hosting events in their space. Thus our all-
volunteer, no-prot, collectively run Black Sheep Books was
born, with both projects opening their doors on the same day.
We eventually outgrew our spot and moved about a block
away, into a storefront already painted black and red. And
ve years after our mutual grand opening, the café and Black
Sheep ended, but well.
At some point during that time, us Black Sheepers
looked over our now-rumpled list of dreams and were
startled to realize that we’d achieved so much of what we
wanted, materially, organizationally, and politically, plus
ahead of “schedule.” But what felt best was that we’d lived

## STITCHING TOGE THER OTHER WORLDS   /   227

up to our promises, even when it was hard, or when each
of us was going through tough times. Those promises were
numerous, yet one jumps out in particular: entering into and
exiting collective eorts with intentionality and empathy,
and checking in every six months to be sure we all felt good
about each other, what we were doing, and continuing to go
forward together. This involved making good on our promises
of, say, communal care and good communication, but
importantly, it was grounded in our shared recognition that
both the project and every one of us had to grow alongside
each other, even if that meant consensually disassociating
when Black Sheep wasn’t nourishing for us, our communities,
and/or our aims anymore.
So we had many an open and honest conversation in
that last year, including through breakups, heartache, and
depression, and knew that while Black Sheep could have
forged ahead, it shouldn’t. We ended while we still appreciated
each other; we ended without being in debt, and in fact,
seeded several other new anarchist projects in our town
with the leftover funds; and we ended by each of us moving
toward other horizons. It felt sad, yet in a way that could
be integrated and didn’t erase each other or the joy in what
we’d created together. And it ended with an anarchistic
marching band, going between the bookstore and café
in a celebratory, musical “funeral” march for us and the
community around us.

It was not a safe space. How could it (pretend to) be?
Not only was it smack-dab in the center of the intensive

## 228 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

war zone that was “gentrication,” aka displacement and
dispossession, in San Francisco. But our space was not
immune from causing harm to ourselves and others. After all,
every anarchist, no matter where they live, has been shaped
and socialized in, and traumatized by, the violent social order.
Instead, from the rst moment I pressed the doorbell on the
grated-metal door, directly across the street from the chaos
of the best and worst of humanity on the 16th Street BART
Plaza, and looked through to see zines haphazardly tossed on a
small shelf, then walked up the two interior ights of rundown
stairs lined with militant posters from around the globe, to
next enter into an enormous room decorated with banners
and abuzz with activity—and vibrantly multipurposed as an
infoshop, event, and organizing space as well as living room,
kitchen, and set in the corner, bathrooms—it felt deeply like
coming home. Then it became home. And now it may always
be the closest thing to home for me, even though eviction stole
it out of anarchist hands.
It felt homey precisely because everything feels unsafe in
this world, and the Station 40 collective, through a rotating
cast of twenty to twenty-four housemate-characters and
countless guests, somehow squeezed into eight bedrooms and
lots of nooks, held to this agreement: “We’re not a safe space.
But when shit happens, we promise to deal with it.”
Because shit will and did happen. And dealing with that
by not involving the cops and state, nor lashing out at each
other, takes experimentation and dedication—including
making mistakes—through the ins and outs of daily life. So
while my housemates mostly prided themselves on being and
going “hard,” their demeanor extended to being rock-hard

## STITCHING TOGE THER OTHER WORLDS   /   229

---

solid when it came to the “soft” practices of collective care
and solidarity in ways I’ve rarely experienced before or after.
Station 40 was far from perfect, or easy, or always kind. It
could feel like a war zone inside our doors, too, at times. “Shit”
occurred routinely given that we were a hub for anarchism in
the Bay Area at the time. Pretty much every intense thing that
could happen, did happen. But I learned, time and again,
that when the going gets excruciatingly tough, I wasn’t alone,
nor did I have to slip into being the lone caretaker. Moreover,
“care work” was neither made invisible nor gendered but
rather felt like the hearth, as it were, of our home—even if
that care didn’t look warm and fuzzy, such as false promises
of “safe space.” In fact, some of the housemates who showed
me, personally, the most tender care and deep reciprocity had
the crankiest, coldest, hardest shell (or so they fronted).
Yet those shells became shields of mutual self-defense and
protection at a moment’s notice when faced with threats to
our house and/or potential perils to housemates, friends,
and comrades. Our space—through which thousands of
anarchists and like-minded folks passed, and that deed the
typical face of anarchism given our eclectic and wide-ranging
mix of races, cultures, genders, ages, and so much more that
somehow meshed so well—almost invariably lived up in
queer-feministic practice to the slogan “Be careful with each
so we can be dangerous together.”
That looked like, for example, knowing that our lengthy
rectangular kitchen table—at the heart of Station 40—was
open for any and all topics, including many that would have
been o-limits or politically incorrect in most antiauthoritarian
spaces. Over big meals or after 11:00 p.m. in particular,

## 230 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

we spent many a night wrestling with dilemmas, in lively,
provocative, and generative dialogues. Those raucous, no-
holds-barred conversations helped us grow. Together, we
felt comfortable scrutinizing and challenging various “safe”
positions in the wider anarchist world—positions that other
comrades frequently took up unthinkingly, for one, but also
positions that ultimately put anarchists and others in further
harm’s way (for instance, via essentialized notions of identity
that broke down our solidarities).
It looked, too, like us acting in concert, each playing their
accomplished part without a conductor, such as when police
suddenly raided our home during a big, crowded event.
Everyone simultaneously leaped into action, taking on roles
that t their skill sets. That meant that we had everything
we needed, within minutes, to lockdown our space, mobilize
lawyers and community to show up outside, and spirit away
what or who needed special protection while deciding on
our strategy, yet equally, to calm our many guests and oer
emotional support as needed.
Or it looked like us collectively ghting outbreaks of
bedbugs, eradicating the infestations by relying on our own
research and self-organization, being transparent with the
wider community and at times responsibly shutting down our
space to visitors, and aiding each other with the many tedious
tasks necessary to ensure success. It meant trying to turn this
tragedy into humor as well, from dubbing it our “social war”
to jokingly imagining our neighbors all setting their bedbug-
infested mattresses alight at intersections for a street party
against evictions to scare o the invasive tech bros driving
rents sky high.

## STITCHING TOGE THER OTHER WORLDS   /   231

Or it looked like intimate caretaking in the most unsafe of
situations for an individual, such as our whole collective holding
empathetic space for a housemate actively contemplating
suicide over a twenty-four-hour period and nding them the
consensual resources they needed to decide to live.
Shit happened. And together, we got through it as safely
as possible.

Maybe it was the open, multilevel, hundred-plus-year-old
barn that sparked our “cultivating care” framework. After all,
anyone driving by it on the wooded road, friend or foe, could
see right into the charmingly ramshackle structure, making
this now-longtime radical space feel equal parts beautiful and
vulnerable. It was clearly a magical location for our anarchist
summer school. But the magic wasn’t simply “there,” like this
barn, built decades ago by unknown others. As an organizing
collective, we had to continually tend to the oorboards and
support beams, literally and guratively, to conjure it up. And
that ongoing “repair work” had to be something that everyone
who participated in the camp for three summers proactively
engaged in side by side.
How, though, could we encourage everyone to be tinkerers,
and with what tool kits? There were so many devices we
wanted to pack into the programming—history, strategic
thinking, hands-on skills related to direct action, play, and
more. Way too much for an eight-day camp. Yet perhaps the
most crucial tool turned out to be something that is not usually
ready to hand in most anarchist spaces: being vulnerable with
each other, and doing so as the foundation for everything else.

## 232 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

From the opening circle on, held in the embrace of the
ancient barnwood that had once been a canopy of trees for
other ecosystems, we welcomed and modeled the painstaking
yet joyful work of everyone striving to be the person they
aspire to be, sharing the fullness of themselves and their
gifts. We took up what might seem like antiquated tools—
such as opening up our hearts and minds to each other,
challenging ourselves to grow in generative ways including
by leaning into discomfort, and remembering that anarchism
and life are messy-beautiful processes—so as to see and get
to know each other as multidimensional, messy-beautiful
people. We emphasized that community isn’t a prefab, static
entity; it’s something we all directly and dynamically cultivate
together. So we invited everyone, for the duration of camp, to
experiment wholeheartedly, tenderly, and in ways we usually
only dream about with “caring for each other like we’re
already in a new, do-it-ourselves world.”
That’s how the magic appeared. Which is another way of
saying that otherworldly social relations emerged.
On that ground, we experienced all sorts of otherworldly
conversations, dances, campres, rituals, and silliness,
otherworldly learning, adventuring, grieving, and creating,
otherworldly good troublemaking and inspiration. And
when we stumbled into dicult territory over the course of
those three summers in that barn, we chose otherworldly
ways of journeying through it. We chose empathy and trust.
We chose love.2

participant ignored many people’s boundaries—from emo-
tional to logistical, material to physical—and kept violating
consent, we chose to see everyone—all of us—as perfectly
imperfect people always capable of transformation. We
chose to strive to not merely do no further harm but rather
aid each other in breaking patterns that arise from and/or
cause trauma in ourselves and others. And even though we
had, in the end, to ask that person to leave camp, we didn’t
dehumanize them or leave them out of these aspirations.
Instead, we let love guide us.
The ins and outs of how we did this aren’t reducible to a
how-to list, in the same way that love can’t and shouldn’t be
quantied. That’s almost certainly why this “accountability
process” worked better than the vast majority of them. It
wasn’t a formulaic process; instead, it was embedded in bonds
of love, expansively understood and intentionally nurtured by
everyone’s willingness to open up to and with each other. As
such, we didn’t begin or end by broadcasting rumor or drama
to the whole camp. We didn’t cancel anyone or make anyone
disposable. We didn’t think or act through binaries of good/
bad, nor a carceral or punishment logic.
We listened. We believed. We held space for everyone’s life
stories, including the person who was pushing boundaries, and
how people’s past experiences shaped their present behaviors,
feelings, and reactions. We held space, too, for how violations
of consent can bring up a lot for everyone, whether receiver,
giver, or eyewitness to the harm. We brought curiosity to how
those stories and experiences can butt up against each other,
intentionally or not, and how much this world that we so long
to change has such power to turn us into people we don’t

## 234 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

want to be or can’t see we’ve become.
Almost organically, like gently tossing a pebble into a
mirrorlike pond and letting interdependent circles ripple
outward, we threw ourselves compassionately and self-
reectively into the fabric of our social relations, which we’d
been cultivating before and during camp, and let circles of
mutualistic care ripple outward. Those circles let us each take
on what we felt we could, and what we felt we could contribute,
and equally at times, encircled us when we couldn’t take on
various tasks, or even more profoundly, helped us see when
we couldn’t or shouldn’t take on various tasks. Those circles
embraced everyone in dierential yet interdependent ways,
during and well beyond camp, including the person who
seemingly couldn’t maintain boundaries. And those circles—
the ones we ourselves had built—saw us all as deserving of
dignity, solidarity, and love, even if we need to not share
space sometimes.

Richard Spencer’s cross-country speaking tour at US colleges
was put to a screeching halt by thousands of “little” acts of
antifascist care.
Of course, what the headlines will tell you is quite dierent:
“Violence Erupts on MSU Campus as Richard Spencer
Speaks”; “Fights Break out at Michigan State [University] as
Protesters, White Supremacists Converge for Richard Spencer
Speech.” And alas, some of the more bro-ey antifascists among
us who contributed to this wildly successful deplatforming
eort would largely agree, pointing to the ghting—the
physical community self-defense—as what did the trick on

March 5, 2018. Not that throwing punches at a neo-Nazi,
antisemitic conspiracy theorist, and white supremacist such
as Spencer is bad or wrong; often it’s strategically wise and
tactically necessary. Fascism tends not to listen to “reasoned”
arguments, contrary to what liberals like to believe.
But sometimes liberals, including progressive and social
democratic ones, can be moved by compelling arguments to
actively and consensually take direct action against fascism.
And so when we heard Spencer’s tour was slated to come to
East Lansing, and anarchist(ic) folks knew that if we hoped
to squash his mobilization, we needed large numbers of
people—far beyond our confederation of anarchist groups in
a half-dozen Michigan cities—we spent months making those
arguments in a form that might not be recognizable as such.
We asserted, in deeds not words, solidarity and care.
That wasn’t without some contention with our own
anarchist circles. Strains of machismo maintained that
“care” wasn’t radical. That attitude, in turn, meant that
some patriarchal behaviors crept in, elevating “defense” and
those who prioritized it, while at times denying “solidarity”
to those of us focusing on communal care (though never
doing so on the streets thankfully). Remarkably, however, we
all understood the big picture—smashing fascism—and the
necessity of outreach to build momentum and, on the big day,
numbers. So ultimately, for and through this antifascist win,
we all took care (double meaning intended!) to make it work,
before, during, and after #Stop Spencer.
This manifested in so many ways, it would be impossible
to capture them all, and such tender direct actions of care
are better lived than described. But a few examples should

## 236 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

provide an idea.
Before: The collective I was part of, in the town with the most
amount of organizing toward March 5, joined in a coalition
among a wide range of political tendencies, with the majority
of folks falling somewhere on the liberal spectrum, new to
activism, never mind antifascism. Many had never been to a
demonstration, or at least not one where the risk of heavily
armed cops and fascists was so palpable. Our collective
already had the trust of most activists in our town due to
how we’d consistently shown up, and as the most imaginative,
savvy, and welcoming of mischief makers. We put that trust
to work, with patience and humility, rst listening to why
most people in the coalition were so hesitant to actually be
present in person to #Stop Spencer; second, really hearing
and believing them, with empathy not annoyance; and nally,
oering weeks of mentorship. Because when we listened, it
came down to two reasons: not so much their liberal or social
democratic sensibilities, as we’d thought, but fear and lack
of experience. Through trainings, one-on-one conversations,
and myriad other support, we gave them the knowledge,
skills, and wisdom to feel empowered to be there on March 5,
on whatever terms and by taking up whatever roles felt most
consensual to them. The result was not simply that our city
brought out the most people, and in anity crews, but also
that those folks felt as comfortable and prepared as one can
when facing o with cops and fascists.
During: As we’d taught other anity groups to do, my
collective had spent hours ahead of time talking honestly
about our fears and preferred levels of engagement at
#Stop Spencer. Based on that, we’d created layers of a buddy

system, o-site meeting point, secure communication, jail
support forms, and backup plans, among other things, plus
we had agreed to arrive and leave together. And we did that
over a fun evening of banner making and food in the warmth
of a collective member’s house, further nourishing our
friendships and the deep culture of care among us. On the
“battleeld” (in this case, a corneld behind what’s known
as Moo U) that March 5, our bonds meant that we could
simply look each other in the eye and know what needed to
dynamically shift or who needed extra solidarity. All the care
work put into building the #Stop Spencer coalition and other
statewide social relationships among organizers, though,
meant that many of us—beyond our own anity crews—could
do the same. Time and again, through eye contact or body
language, people aided others in calming down or stepping
back when needed, or crews felt braver than anticipated
and moved closer to the front line with the complementary
support of other anity groups. In the heat and intensity
of this real battle, communal defense was inseparable from
communal care.
After: It wasn’t planned, but in the week after #Stop Spencer,
we not only celebrated what was a victory on multiple
levels—Spencer canceled his tour, some prominent fascist
groups unraveled, no one was shot or killed by cops or white
supremacists (a real worry), and we forged loads of new
mutualistic infrastructure and projects, to name some. We
also dived gratefully into one debrief after another, large and
small, in public spaces and private ones. For even though
we won, the tension and trauma of being so close to heavily
armed cops and fascists still brought up big feelings. Three

things stuck out during our debriefs. People were deeply
committed to this form of aftercare, showing up as their
whole, vulnerable selves with and for each other. Most of
those who weren’t or hadn’t previously been anarchists before
#Stop Spencer credited us anarchists with supplying the care
and solidarity they needed to nd their own strength, allowing
them to go further than they ever thought they could. And
crucially, processing together works wonders.
Care works, including in the ght to hinder fascism.

There were so many times during #DefendJ20 when it
felt like the state was sitting back, laughing at us, watching
codefendants and their supporters tear each other apart. I
knew it was the intense emotional strain of some two hundred
people facing the possibility of seventy-ve years behind bars
after being mass arrested during #Disrupt20 at Trump’s 2017
inauguration that caused the internal fractures, acrimony, and
even downright nastiness as the weeks turned into months
of us trying to sustain our DIY solidarity infrastructure.
It’s not that J20 codefendants weren’t supported with a
tremendous amount of love and solidarity—legal, material,
and immaterial. But on the regular, there wasn’t a feministic
commitment to gently, skillfully, and carefully intervening at
the rst sign that the statist stress was being misplaced onto
our own dynamics.
To this day, I’m proud that a core of us supporters—
“coincidentally,” a majority of which were queer and/or
female—stuck it out, even if the end was bittersweet: collective
defense mostly held and the charges were dropped, thank

## STITCHING TOGE THER OTHER WORLDS   /   239

goodness, but unprocessed trauma and antagonisms within
ex-J20 circles lingered on.
State repression is good for that: rst creating immense
fear among those targeted, then dragging out the costly (to
us) proceedings, and then waiting for the fear itself to do the
work of destroying or at least severely harming us.
But not always. Maybe we’ve learned, including from our
mistakes.
Take #Stop Cop City in so-called Atlanta. For all the many
imaginative “diversity of tactics” that have so marked this
inspiring movement over the past couple of years, perhaps the
most overlooked is its self-generated “culture of care,” which
seems to be almost a given, especially within the solidarity
eorts. The more that the cops, courts, and governments
have ramped up serious, albeit absurd, charges against forest
defenders, and particularly after the statist assassination of
Tortuguita on January 18, 2023, mourning ceremonies and
communal rituals, in-person care clinics, mutual aid therapy
and peer-to-peer emotional support, medicinal herbs, and
various other healing arts have only multiplied. Like everything
else in this struggle to #Defend The Weelaunee Forest, all of
this care is autonomously self-organized and oered with a
generosity of spirit as well as pregurative sensibility.
Those bigger, more visible direct actions of care are touch-
ing, of course, and go a long way to explaining why #Stop-
Cop City has not only captured so many hearts and minds but
also been so relatively long-lived, growing to embrace people
from many dierent walks of life. What’s felt so transformative,
though, are the innumerable smaller, everyday direct actions
of care that seem hardly worth remarking on or even taking

## 240 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

note of—not out of lack of appreciation, but because they’ve
coalesced into a shared culture of communal care that we’re
now so deeply embedded in, it’s like the air we breathe within
the solidarity eorts. Or more precisely, it’s like a warm hug
when things feel stressful—or for that matter, joyful too,
or indeed when things feel all sorts of ways because of the
ravages of state repression.
To take a few “breaths” as examples:
When a large Signal thread full of supporters started lling
up with gratuitously mean-spirited texts related to some
genuine conundrum we were grappling with, one person
matter-of-factly observed that the state has a long history of
employing counterintelligence tactics against us. They noted
that we can and should engage in disagreements over tough
issues, but in ways that don’t play into the state’s divide-and-
conquer schemes. Not only did this single, succinct text serve
to de-escalate; it almost immediately reinstalled a sense of
shared purpose.
When in order to “do our job” (voluntarily of course) as jail
support folks, we had to watch hours of court hearings on live
You Tube feeds, with our comrades, movement, and politics
being painted by the red-baiting prosecutor as “terrorist,” two
therapists held a virtual “processing space” afterward. Not
only did this single, humble session gift us with something
we didn’t even think we needed, but once we began talking/
crying, we clearly did; it fast rearmed that we, too, as
solidarity “workers” were seen and appreciated.
When a family member of a current codefendant was falling
apart from worry about their beloved, a family member of a
now ex-codefendant from the J20 days spoke with them. Not

## STITCHING TOGE THER OTHER WORLDS   /   241

---

only did this single, modest phone call hopefully go a little way
to supplying the kind of empathy and understanding that only
comes from a shared, unique experience; it repaid forward
something that this J20 family member had constructively
critiqued as wanting for themselves and not getting back
then—that is, support for the impacts on the codefendants’
kin.
Indeed, when folks see that someone in our solidarity
circles, no matter their role, is struggling—such as because
of a fresh loss, mental health challenge, or overwhelm and
exhaustion—it’s almost commonplace to simply reach out to
them, one on one—if at a distance, by sending a loving voice
message, say; if nearby, by putting a consensual arm around
their shoulder and encouraging them to breathe. Not only
do these single, simple gestures aid in deactivating some of
the worst edges of, for instance, grief or anxiety; they almost
instantly reinstill feelings of not being alone, or conversely,
being interconnected.
Or when rumors begin to y, there seems to always be
someone oering a calm reminder that we can deal with any
solid information that arises—we have everything we need
among us to handle what gets thrown at us—but that rumors
only whip up fear and panic, and can lead to harming other
supporters/codefendants, breaking trust, and/or making
hasty, bad decisions. Or someone will serenely volunteer to
look into the rumor and follow up with facts. Not only do
these single, levelheaded responses ease the added emotional
turmoil that rumors catalyze; they quickly reinscribe the
knowledge that a lot of folks, with a ton of skills and savvy,
are engaging in joint defense, whether legally or ethically.

## 242 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

Each of these minor interactions—most taking only a few
minutes—have to date, time and time again, not only held our
solidarity in place. They seem to be mitigating unnecessary
suering—the kind we too often inict on each other when
the boot of repression presses down on us, rather than
directing our hostilities at the correct target, the state—while
accentuating the quality of care we see as simply the culture
of everyday anarchism.
When the charges are hopefully all dropped, it’s possible
to already imagine this culture carrying forward, as second
nature, into the next battle.

The two most joyous anarchist gatherings I’ve experienced
since the pandemic began both made the most amount of
room for grief. And I wasn’t alone in that assessment.
That might sound paradoxical. How can sorrow and
joy commingle? How can we nd the greatest sense of a
harmonious whole by publicly curating space for both anguish
and delight?
For most of human history, people practiced an abundance
of intricate, culturally embedded communal rituals and sacred
spaces to not only get them through every transition, good
and bad, but also make sense of those shifts. Such ceremonies,
from festivals to funerals, were inseparable parts of a healthy
ecosystem. They (re)generated, sustained, and armed life
and its cycles, giving them dignity and meaning. They let
people immerse themselves in the entire spectrum of human
emotions, which in actuality don’t t neatly into experiences
but instead are bound up in the highs and lows of them all.

## STITCHING TOGE THER OTHER WORLDS   /   243

Alas, among the many wisdoms lost when our elaborate rituals
were stolen over the centuries by the powers-that-be, whether
by assimilation or annihilation, was this: rituals, which bring
out all the pieces of ourselves, are essential as the reparative
and restorative glue of fully living.
Contemporary anarchism has, to its detriment, followed
too obediently in the footsteps of the hegemonic death-
denying culture we’ve been boxed into, largely abandoning
rituals, most especially ones related to grief, and leaving our
losses and feelings around them largely unprocessed. When
unprocessed, feelings don’t just go away. They build up until
they explode—whether inside ourselves and/or at each other.
Those “explosions” have been keenly palpable since the
onset of COVID-19. The numbers of suicides, road-rage
accidents, overdoses, and the like have skyrocketed, even as
the dominant culture—so adept at producing mass death—
further isolated folks from each other and urged a return to
“normal.” Anarchists, too, yearned to go back to our normal,
such as bookfairs and social centers, uprisings and frontline
camps, but vastly underestimated how much the collective
trauma had touched us, and thus did little to deeply think
through, much less implement, what needed to shift in our
own convergences. And with little to no ritualistic mechanisms
to fall back on to journey through our own layers of loss and
grief together, too many anarchists blew up at each other,
destroyed their own beloved projects, and further dissociated
from their own sorrow as well as joy.
This attitude of ignoring grief at our own peril really hit
home for me, personally and painfully, some eleven years
ago, when I needed to caretake my simultaneously dying

parents for about thirteen months. I thought I had a big, solid
anarchist community, but it disappeared almost overnight.
I was met instead with, “Come back when you’re done,” as
if death and mourning were somehow outside our circles
and friendships, and as if we could or should ever be “done”
with grief, which is another name for what we love. That’s
why I threw myself into “rebellious mourning,” in words
and deeds, soon afterward.3 Because too much of what we
love—the majority, I’d argue—is unnecessarily taken from us
by this death cult of a social order. When we explicitly mourn
our losses, as part and parcel of everything else we self-
organize, we’re extra clear-eyed about what and for whom
we’re ghting, from the living to our ancestors; we proactively
mend ourselves and this world; and we keep love and life at
the heart of all we do. Moreover, we’re far better able to stick
side by side with each other, tightening our interrelationships
so as to get through the most excruciating of times.
Still, I often felt too alone in that task while wandering
around doing hundreds of grief circles, and felt “crazy” seeing
how much damage was wrought by us not doing the collective
work of grief. Yet I was wrong. I wasn’t completely alone;
other anarchists had also felt called toward this task. And
to wind my way back to those two, most joyous of anarchist
events—Another Carolina Anarchist Bookfair (ACAB) and
the Montreal Anarchist Bookfair—those isolated labors had
now coalesced into shared eorts. Making space for grief was
as integral a component as, say, tabling, food, and parties,
thanks especially to feministic anarchists on both collectives.
At ACAB, held in Asheville in August 2023, the organizing

collective had intentionally scheduled not just one but instead
three workshops related to dying, death, and mourning,
with my grief circle kicking o the bookfair to set the tone.
A regional collective that includes anarchist gravediggers and
casket makers was invited to craft a custom altar, which sat
outside the front door of Firestorm Books, one of the main
venues for the entire weekend. And given that ACAB’s rst
day fell on the sixth anniversary of Charlottesville, a friend
from nearby Durham, NC, brought an enormous banner
made around that time that read, “We struggle in memory of
all we’ve lost to white supremacy and fascism.” The banner
was painted soon after Heather Heyer was murdered, and
so many others were deeply injured and forever scarred, by
fascists during the Unite the Right in August 2017. It was
originally hung from the ten-foot-high stone base of the
rst Confederate monument that folks tore down in North
Carolina, and later, on the one-year anniversary of that
monument falling, it was hung up again—this time as part
of an altar with names and owers and candles around it,
and folks read the names of people killed by the police in
Durham. The banner took pride of place at ACAB, draped
from Firestorm’s rafters as background for workshops—
including “Herbs for the Cycles of Grief ” and “Radical Death
Care”—and still hangs there to this day, honoring our dead
on a daily basis alongside all the standard pleasures of an
anarcha-feminist, queer+trans bookstore.
To wander back a bit further in time to February 2023,
when those of us on the Montreal Anarchist Bookfair collec-
tive were in planning mode, I ran across three queer and/or
female anarchists who all wanted to do a grief space. It was

## 246 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

not only the dead of winter in a cold city but we were also
grappling with recent heavy losses and didn’t feel up to going
out, so we met on Jitsi, having never met each other before.
Over the course of an hour, the body language went from
the equivalent of wrapped in a blanket on a couch, slumped
over, barely able to look up or participate, to eye contact,
enthusiasm, and warmth, leaning toward each other. We went
from hardly motivated to being able to brainstorm a long list
of great ideas. In between, without really intending to, we’d
basically held a grief space for ourselves “simply” by talking
about what we wanted and needed in one for others. We came
with sorrow, and found joy too, and it was as if we’d known
each other a long time.
Fast-forward to the bookfair in May 2023, and our little
collective set up the biggest, most beautiful grief space I’ve
yet to have the honor of helping to create—and not only that,
but it was a sheer pleasure to organize from start to nish.
Collectively, we had everything we needed to implement
all of our many ideas; we allowed for a plurality of grief
modalities and ways of approaching mourning; and when
the bookfair was wrapping up, we sat in a circle inside our
space to talk about our feelings, what went well, and what we
wanted to do better next year—because we already envisioned
a future together.
The space itself, outdoors near the main entrance to
this gigantic bookfair for the entirety of the weekend, was
composed of two pop-up tents with owing DIY walls of
fabrics and gorgeous hand-painted “grief ” banners on the
outside, along with a table of free anarchistic zines related to
suicide, dying, death, and mourning. Inside, we constructed a
“oor” of blankets and soft cushions, asked folks to take o

their shoes when entering, and artfully laid out all sorts of
participatory materials for mourning, from an altar to musical
instruments and art supplies. We oered two programmed
times—one focusing on somatics, and the other on talk—but
for most of the time, we let folks engage with the space as
they needed, with one of us on hand to hold space as desired.
Mostly, we witnessed how people brought all of their senses
to bear on the space—from sights and sounds, to smells and
touch—and all of their emotions—ranging from tears and
rage to laughter and love.
What struck me at both bookfairs was how many people—
folks I didn’t know, and who didn’t know me, and had no
idea I was part of any of the grief spaces—eagerly wanted
to share their joy with me at being there. They went on and
on about how friendly we anarchists were being toward
each other, across all tendencies, oering genuine warmth,
playfulness, and openness. They remarked on how refreshed,
reconnected, and hopeful they felt thanks to these gatherings,
in contrast to the past three years of despair and loss of faith.
I could relay story after story, but one suces as illustration.
At a magical afterparty held at an enormous community
space won through two decades of struggle, one particularly
exuberant young person was gushing to me about their day at
the Montreal Anarchist Bookfair. “I feel such joy, I can hardly
express it,” they said, beaming from ear to ear. I asked them
to give me an example and suddenly their face turned somber.
They spoke of having to fend o fascists in their small town
with their small collective for the past three years, amid all the
pandemic isolation, and how bleak everything felt before this
weekend. “I wasn’t sure I was up for a huge event and lots of

socializing. Then I saw that grief space. I didn’t go in. It was
enough to see it and have it there. To have my grief made
visible and acknowledged. That felt so genuine, which felt so
joyful. It opened me up to joy again.” A broad smile returned
to their face. “Why do we hide grief ? It has such power to
bring and keep us together.”

Ten years ago, in the blink of an eye between my dad dying and
my mom soon to follow, I was tasked with cleaning out their
home of many decades as part of caring for them through
sickness and death. The easiest solution, and most intuitively
anarchistic one, was to do a make-an-oer “yard sale” right
in the house itself. Yet in the down-and-out economy of
Michigan, it quickly became apparent I needed to turn it
into a really, really free market. Over the course of a week,
hundreds of folks dug through the whole house from attic
to the basement—the one I’d remade into a theater/forest
so long ago—and took what they wanted. In the process,
people told me their hard-luck stories, and I listened; then
they wanted to hear about my losses, and they listened.
They also joyfully shared their nds with me, from a teenager
who eagerly snagged the same typewriter I’d used as a teen,
saying they wanted to be a writer, to the people without health
insurance who’d discovered leftover medical supplies from my
parents’ illnesses that they themselves greatly needed, to the
person who carted o what to me looked like sheer garbage,
saving me the trouble.

Toward the end, one person lugged a dilapidated, musty
cardboard box up from the cellar and plopped it in front of
me. A huge grin spread across their face as they opened the
box to reveal hundreds of fabric patches, a bit faded, but still
bringing together geometries of purple and turquoise, pink
and green, red and black, into pleasing designs. “Wow, I love
these! Can I take them home?” they exclaimed. “Maybe I can
invite a bunch of my friends over for a potluck and together
we can all make a quilt!”

I felt inspired to draw this because I wanted to express that
we’re out here. In my experience, it can feel lonely trying to
nd other people. Yet I have found and we will nd people
who understand how deeply we need each other, who want
to grow together, to acknowledge that we’re going to make
mistakes and are capable of harming others, but will support
each other with love, care, accountability, and tenderness
to unlearn ways of thinking that are hurting us, and create
safe, loving, anarchistic relationships and joyful realities. I
created this illustration to print as a sticker and paste around
my city, although I’m still looking for a printer that uses
vegan materials, is worker owned, and has as little ecological
footprint as possible.
My drawings are representations of my dreams of building
another world as well as protesting against hierarchy (patri-
archy included), speciesism, adult supremacy (that’s why most
of my characters look young), binaries, and the academy.
They are about tenderness and vulnerability, about allowing
us to feel rage and sadness, let our emotions bring us closer,
and take care of and defend each other.

beyond borders, spotlighting ghts around the globe for land,
dignity, and self-determination. Specically, it honors women
who have sacriced their lives in these struggles. The gures
portrayed here represent 1960s’ Palestinian (left), 2000s’

three individuals are accompanied by the phrase “I would die
for you,” in Arabic, Kurdish, and Armenian (left to right)—a
powerful expression of aection used in Southwest Asia and

Our promise: we will remember and uplift all of those
women who battle tyranny and fascism. Our promise: we will
never forget you, Shireen Abu Akleh, Jina Amini, and Anush
Apetyan, who all lost their lives in 2022 due to occupation,
domination, and colonization. Our promise: we will honor
those who came before us and support those striving for
liberation today.

This image was inspired by a group of young skaters of
Bolivian Indigenous origin, Imilla Skate (imilla means “young”
in Aymara and Quechua). Through skateboarding, they give
new meaning to the role of Latina women without losing sight
of our traditions, culture, and resistance, nor the insurgency
of our people against bloody colonialism.
My artwork portraying feminism reects my own trajectory,
treaded for years alongside rural, Indigenous, quilomba,
riverside, and landless women, who also stand side by side with
those women ghting in big cities for the fall of patriarchy,
capital, and the state. I’ve learned that an Indigenous Kaiowá
compañera’s struggle is the same as that of a compañera in
Rojava, and that a woman without land defends the caboclo
seed like a Zapatista woman does too. I create art linked to
community self-defense movements from Latin America
to Africa and Asia as well as struggles for land and water,
honoring the experiences, barricades, and memories of
rebellion in Abya Yala, the original and ancestral name for
the Western Hemisphere.

“Autonomía, autonomy, our bodies will always belong to us,”
repeated as a chant in my mind while I created this image.
With Roe v. Wade’s overturn and the attacks on gender-arming
care, the capacity and right to decide for oneself becomes
disputed, preventing us from moving freely and reaching the
horizons we dream of. In this harsh landscape, uplifting self-
determination is an everyday task.
I hold tight to the love in the collective eorts to care
for one another, to show up and share the bounties of our
gardens. I look back into herbalism and ancestry practices
as our paths toward healing. In this print, I dream of and
portray an endless cascade of possibilities and autonomy
for us all.

ANOUK KUONA
The re that we feed with our rage, our voices, and solidarity
is the same ame that keeps me warm in cold nights. This
linocut, Chispas – Sparks – Funken, summons this feeling. Every
time we stick together, defending and holding each other, this
roaring ame only grows stronger. It’s the same re that keeps
us alive as activists; our connection is fueled by warmth, care,
and tenderness.
I live in a small, conservative town, where it’s hard work
to sustain our feminist network. It’s often exhausting to build
structures for the rst time here, and sometimes it’s easy to feel
alone, isolated from the larger, more established movements in
the bigger cities. I create images in an attempt to overcome the
separation between local and international struggles. I strive to
oer a common language of love and rage as a reminder that
although we may be few in my town, we’re far from alone.

BREE BUSK
International Women’s Day on March 8 (8M) has become
sacred for those of us still riding the wave of this ongoing
feminist uprising. Although we mobilize all year round,
8M is when we can celebrate the size and strength of our
movement, and ood the streets with our liberated bodies.
Together, we can wear as much or as little as we want; we
can paint our politics on our skin or embroider our slogans
into our costumes. On 8M, you can hear our voices, but our
bodies talk too. This watercolor captures a fragment of the
spirit that animates us: a smiling young feminist balances on
a fence while proudly displaying her hand-stitched violet-
colored skirt, which reads, “Abort the patriarchy!”
My work, like my politics, is intensely personal, as my
paintings are often intimate portraits of my friends and
compañeras in the context of our feminist activism. Yet my
work also features slogans, symbols, and performances that
reference both local campaigns and global struggles against
all forms of domination. This dichotomy speaks directly to
my anarchist-feminist ethic since my art is an exploration of
the interplay between the politics of everyday life and our
collective ambitions for a utopian future.

ERRE
A year ago, I was traveling around dierent cities, as always
with the aim of putting my graphic work in the streets, and
learning and creating alongside like-minded projects. In
Paris, I was invited to paint a mural on the exterior wall of
a self-managed social center. This image was inspired by my
experience of being able to journey widely only because of
the mutual aid and solidarity of many friends, old and new.
It was also inspired by the social center, which oers social
support as well as cultural and education activities all based
on solidarity, exchange, and sharing. As I drew the image,
lyrics from the punk band Sham 69 came to mind: “If the
kids are united, then we’ll never be divided.”
My work emerges from personal things mixed with social
problems, using art against oppression, hierarchy, and
inequality so as to invite people to unlearn practices and lose
their fears, and instead speak up with complete autonomy.

FEMINIST COLLAGES PGH
The slogan “Take Back the Night” came from a 1970s’
movement against all forms of sexual violence. In this case,
it’s tied directly to Dee, one of our collective members, whose
mother was an active volunteer with Pittsburgh Action against
Rape in the 1980s and 1990s, and went on Take Back the
Night marches. For Dee, the slogan means “still here and still
taking back the night,” and the paste honors their mom, who
died in 2018.
Feminist Collages PGH emerged after one of our collective
members spent time in New York City in 2022 and saw wheat-
pasted feminist phrases there. After doing online research,
we found out that people were putting up similar street art
around the world and began doing the same in Pittsburgh
in January 2023. The wheat pastes—relatively easy and
aordable to make by copying individual letters onto white
paper—are a direct action to make our voices recognized and
heard, because as cis and trans women, we’re so often told to
be quiet. The history of feminist collages started with a call to
end femicide in particular—a topic that’s rarely talked about
and denitely never mentioned in Pittsburgh. Our goal is to
raise awareness of things not typically spoken about in public
and help bring an end to the violence of patriarchy.

KILL JOY
I was part of a community paste-up mural project to honor
George Floyd in his childhood Third Ward neighborhood
in Houston on the one-year anniversary of his murder. The
next day, I used the leftover glue to create the wall pictured
here using screen-printed versions of 5”x5” woodcut prints.
It addresses the lack of clean air and water, healthy food,
health care, aordable housing, and other basic necessities
for a dignied life in my neighborhood, inhabited primarily
by Latines.
I consistently nd that in my community-fueled projects
in Texas, and throughout Mexico and the Philippines, the
most marginalized groups are most successfully organized by
everyday women: mothers, teachers, peasant farmers, and
neighbors. Women are not only demanding updated water
drainage in our older neighborhoods prone to ooding during
hurricanes but also building houses when homes are destroyed,
organizing bulk meals for children whose families have little
resources, and defending the land that they till and sow. As
a BIPOC femme feminist, I’m in solidarity with women of
the world who prioritize making life fuller and sweeter and
bringing so much love to our neighborhoods.

N. O. BONZO
I frequently don’t have a goal or specic statement I wish
to convey with a piece other than enjoying the process.
I understand anarchism as a distinct movement and
identication that many have made incredible contributions
to and sacrices within. More often when I work, I think of
people I know and those who’ve left memories of themselves
behind. And for those who aren’t here with us anymore, I
reect on how much we lose with their absence.
In this image, I thought of the black thread that’s woven
through generations, connecting us beyond walls, borders,
states, and nationalities. Tracing that black thread shows
how the beautiful idea itself forever reemerges in spite of
countless rounds of violent repression against its adherents. I
spend a lot of time these days trying to trace the black threads
back, and become lost in the myriad stories of profound
losses and victories of people hunted, tortured, and driven,
yet still managing incredible feats, their hearts lled with
their ideas. How one anarchist is able to sow the seeds from
which a hundred spring up, even if it is decades later. And I
think on them and us, and what we can contribute for future
generations to carry in their hearts.

RAYAN
The rst thoughts I have every morning on waking are
thoughts of anger—toward the human impact on nature
and animals, and the general human need to dominate and
destroy everything. That daily anger motivates me, gives me
a sense of purpose, and even lls me with hope. So after a
series of racist and queerphobic attacks in the big city where I
currently reside, I created this print, composed of old farming
tools that I’ve seen my grandmother use. These tools are
sometimes sharp and can have a menacing appeal to them,
but they can also connect us to the soil beneath our feet,
helping us to survive and thrive with nature.
To be a feminist is to be against domination. Abolishing all
sorts of human domination will be the fruit of our common
labor, utilizing shared tools. Meaning at the end of the day
when I close my eyes to imagine the beautiful world that we
can create with each other, I see us blooming in it, together.

Rayan’s printmaking path started during the 2020 COVID
connement when aiming to raise money for animal sanc-

hold close to their heart. You can nd Rayan on Instagram

ROAN BOUCHER
In this time of COVID, climate change, wildres, and mass
abandonment, I’m constantly thinking about breath and air
as a source of life and sometimes harm—something that
physically connects us all. Jewish liturgy is lled with references
to breath, a word that in Hebrew also means “soul”; the words
on the N95 in this print read “nishmat kol chai” (the breath/
soul of every living being), and the words around it are from
the same prayer. Throughout the pandemic, I’ve found ways to
pray, sing, protest, organize, celebrate, and grieve collectively,
with accessibility and COVID precautions centered, to keep
our shared breath from causing injury. This is fundamental
to the values of collective care, solidarity, consent, mutual
aid, and liberation that I share with my communities, but that
radicals broadly have often neglected.
In my art, I’m always thinking about these values and the
emotions that go with them: joy, grief, and rage; sacredness,
resilience, and beauty, and despair. Our connectedness is
everything, whether we acknowledge it or not, whether we
feel it or not. May we wake from the collective trance of
individualism. May we keep each other safe, together, and
make a new world that we can all live in.

SUGARBOMBING WORLD
I grew up watching Japanese anime. The rst one I ever
saw was Candy Candy, a normatively romantic, soap opera-
style cartoon where patriarchal values, gender roles, and
white beauty standards were everywhere. I always loved the
drawings, but I could never get through an entire episode
because of such messages. Through my own art, now as an
adult, I’ve been able to reconnect with the type of cartoon
I would’ve loved to watch as a kid, but I’ve subverted the
character Candy, a blond girl, into a badass brown anarcha-
feminist with rainbow hair.
During my artistic journey, I’ve found a lot of satisfaction
in switching the gender roles that the media typically imposes
on us. I even created a genre for this, which I call Subversive
Pop. As some of my pieces proclaim, “We deserve a world
that does not hurt,” and that includes not only destroying
patriarchy and protecting trans, queer, and femme folks, not
only raising our black ags and sts against their violence,
laws, and stereotypes, but also proudly and playfully showing
that our feminism is anarchist or it isn’t feminist at all.

ZOLA
This mural, done in 2022 in so-called Montreal, honors
all nature, land, and forest defenders across the continent,
battling capitalist tyrants to save what’s left of the living world.
I painted it thinking of frontline struggles such as Ada’itsx /
Fairy Creek, Weelaunee forest in Atlanta, and Wet’suwet’en
Yintah. With the accelerated encroachment on what remains
of natural habitats, ghting to defend nature equates with
ghting for humanity. I also used a pink realtree camo pattern
to represent queer bush counterculture. Marginalized, gender-
nonconforming people and freaks show up in numbers at
land defenses. Because of our dysphoric experience with
normative lifestyles, we see through the illusory comfort and
false promises of “progress” in our capitalist hellscape. We see
death creeping around the corner and nd comfort in mutual
relations between all ways of life.
As a militant, feminism is a methodology that drives me to
be vulnerable with my peers and make sure to leave no one
behind. As an artist, feminism inspires me to represent and
uplift the experiences of people in resistance to patriarchy who
are both brave and caring.

My compañera Karina once told me that it’s a mistake to try
to re-create the past. We were talking about the bittersweet
sensation of looking back on the estallido social (social outbreak),
the anti-neoliberal revolt that rippled through Chile in late
2019.1 It left an indelible mark on those of us who lived
through it, and not always metaphorically. While some came
away with commemorative tattoos, others were left scarred or
even maimed by tear gas canisters and crowd control rounds.
Thirty-four people didn’t come away at all. Despite the rage
and horror, for many of us relatively young protesters—
Chilean, Indigenous, or migrant—participating in that mass
uprising dramatically transformed our understanding of what
type of change was possible in our lifetimes.
Over three years have passed since that historic upending
of business as usual, and we have undeniably entered darker
times. The dream of the revolt—to overthrow the neoliberal
system imposed during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet,
and put an end to impunity and state violence in all of its
forms—feels more unreachable than ever. In 2020, the
Constitutional Convention became the primary vehicle
for the broad spectrum of social demands raised during
the protests—demands developed over the course of thirty
years since Chile began its transition back to democracy,
and channeled by the recent waves of student and feminist
activism. When the proposed draft was voted down in the
September 2022 plebiscite, a deep malaise spread through the
country’s left-wing social movements.

 1. Social outbreak is the most commonly used term to describe this
uprising, but those who participated and still align themselves with its
goals often refer to it as la revuelta (the revolt).

Today, we’re still deep in the plebitusa: a portmanteau
that originated in Colombia in the wake of the 2016 Peace
Accord to describe post-plebiscite disaection. The proposed
new constitution—globally acclaimed for its pro-democracy,
feminist, environmentalist, and pro-Indigenous priorities—
was meant to be our consolation prize after the pandemic
consumed the momentum of our street protests. The
proposal was ultimately pronounced dead on arrival, rejected
by a majority driven into the arms of the Far Right by a fake
news campaign that exacerbated people’s anxiety over losing
what little they had to so-called migrant invaders, degenerate
Communists, or Indigenous terrorist cells.
On the Left, there was plenty of blame to go around,
and in some cases, we were happy to turn on each other for
bothering to have hope in the rst place. I recently stumbled
on a piece of Banksy-esque street art featuring two skeletons
collapsed on the ground, holding signs inscribed with two of
the most iconic slogans of the revolt: “Con todo si no pa’
qué?” (Give it all, or why bother?) and “Hasta que la dignidad
se haga costumbre” (Until dignity becomes the norm). As I
trudged past, I wondered whether the artist intended the
work to function as a reection or accusation. Was the revolt
symbolically murdered by the devastation of the pandemic or
did it die of neglect when we directed our eorts toward the
constitutional process? When a political moment has passed,
what remains?

## * * *

The ghost of the revolt continues to haunt downtown Santiago
in the form of grati slogans and tattered posters calling
for the release of the remaining political prisoners. Mobile
street vendors are still hawking ags, T-shirts, illustrations, art
books, and glossy photographs featuring the most memorable
faces and scenes of the revolt. The images persist even as the
reality fades.
Chilean protests and protesters have an international
reputation for being photogenic, even in our worst moments.
There are the heroic secundaries (high schoolers) who are
regularly documented dodging riot police, chucking molotovs,
and romantically clutching hands in the midst of swirling
clouds of tear gas. With the arrival of a new feminist wave in
2015 came topless university students sporting body paint and
ostentatiously decorated balaclavas. And there is always the
re, creeping out of the smashed-in door of a bank, roaring
up from a bonre of trash and construction debris, or tracing
the contour of a barricade blocking a major avenue. Even our
pain and despair have an aesthetic dimension because there
is always an army of professional photographers at the ready
to document the brutality of the armed forces and bloody
injuries that follow. There is little that goes undocumented,
for better or worse.
At the dawn of 2023, these types of thrilling mass
mobilizations have decreased in both number and frequency.
The police repression—reaching shocking levels of violence
at the height of the revolt—has persisted, surviving the
transition to a so-called left-wing government a year earlier.
The administration of Gabriel Boric was meant to be yet
another consolation prize, a lesser evil who shone like a

## REMEMBRANCE AND SUBVERSIVE BODIES   /   285

---

beacon in comparison with José Antonio Kast, his fascist
opposition. I suppose it helps that we never expected much
from him. And yet, as the joke goes, he still managed to
disappoint us. Boric is currently overseeing the development
of a new constitutional process—one carefully engineered
to limit democratic participation and exclude the historical
Indigenous and social movement demands introduced during
the previous Constitutional Convention. People said “Chile
despertó” (Chile woke up) in October 2019, but today it’s that
handful of months where the government was running scared
that feels like a dream.
As an anarchist raised and radicalized in the United States,
I think I’ve adapted to our bleak new reality a bit faster than
my compañeres. I cut my teeth on the US antiwar movement
of the mid-2000s, and the result of that struggle taught me
that failure was the rule, not the exception. I had grown into
my politics obsessing over an idealized past, dreaming of
the Spanish Civil War because I couldn’t imagine myself as
an agent of change in the time and place I had been born
into. I never expected to make history, rst as part of an
unprecedented anticapitalist feminist uprising in 2018 and
again in 2019 in the massive revolt it fed into. After so many
years of feeling powerless and outnumbered in my birth
country, I will never forget what it was like to nally have
a taste of poder popular.2 It would be easy to turn the revolt
into just another anarchist fantasy, one I can only return to

    2. Poder popular (popular or people power) is a form of workers’ or
direct democracy. In Chilean history, it has referenced a form of political
power derived from the independent activity of working-class people,
which in its formulation and constitution is (in theory) highly collective,
exible, representative, and direct.

in dreams, but after nearly eight years living and ghting in
Chile, I’m not as American as I used to be—that is to say, not
as estadounidense.3
In Chile, remembrance is not synonymous with mere
yearning for what has been lost. It is an act of resistance and
our inheritance from the generation of people who resisted
the dictatorship, often at the cost of their lives. I arrived in
Santiago in August 2015, just in time to participate in the
annual commemoration of the coup that took place on
September 11, 1973. My compañera Romina took me to
the National Stadium, a mass torture and detention site
under the dictatorship that has since been converted into
a site of memory. The stadium’s facade was papered with
posters featuring silhouettes and the refrain that has echoed
throughout this country for fty years: “¿Dondé están?”
(Where are they?).
The names of the detained and disappeared, not to mention
those whose lives were lost or stolen under democracy, haven’t
been forgotten. Thanks to the work of the feminist movement,
this practice of commemoration extends to victims of
femicide as well, including women who were murdered by
the armed forces or extractive industries. When a martyr’s or
victim’s name is cried out in any march or protest, a chorus
of a hundred voices will answer “¡Presente!”—a callback that
is both acknowledgment and battle cry.
We lit candles and toured the interior spaces that had once
served as cells, pausing to listen to a crowd boisterously sing-
ing “Venceremos,” the hymn of Salvador Allende’s Popular

    3. South Americans consider all the people of the Americas to be
americana/os. I’m thus still “American,” but no longer consider myself so
bound to the United States in my political thinking or culture.

## REMEMBRANCE AND SUBVERSIVE BODIES      /   287

Unity coalition. The sound reverberated through the concrete
corridors of the stadium, encouraging the singers to up the
volume with every chorus. While some younger faces could
be found in the crowd, it was clear that many of them were
of an age to have fought for mass social and economic trans-
formation in the 1960s and early 1970s, only to see their
utopian dreams crushed under the boot of the military
dictatorship. During his rule, Pinochet did everything in his
power not only to wipe out any wisp of resistance but also
destroy memory itself, hoping that no one would recall what
it was like to live any other way. And yet people survived, and
they hadn’t forgotten how to sing.
The ongoing resistance of our political predecessors is
a reminder that it is still possible to rediscover hope after a
massive defeat, even when so much has been lost and fascism
is once again on the rise. We are still collectively fumbling
in the dark, searching for the exit from the plebitusa, and I
suspect that in order to nd our way back to the light, we
will need to reengage with the revolt and its legacy, not as an
idealized past to which we wish to return, but as one more
red thread of rebellion that anchors our current, seemingly
hopeless present to our own history of resistance, and one
that also stretches forward into the future where an inevitable,
irresistible revolution awaits us if only we keep building
toward it.

I have never wanted to write my estallido social story. At
rst, there was no need. I was experiencing something
transcendent alongside millions of others. We didn’t need to
talk about it because we were living it. During the protests,
marches, and countless other gatherings, I remember how
easy it was to strike up a conversation with strangers or even
just exchange complicit smiles. Our story was being told all
over the world, through news reports, solidarity protests, art,
and performance, and I was lost in the joyful collectivity of it
all. In my own barrio, I followed the sound of banging pots
and pans to a group of neighbors with whom I went on to
form a popular assembly. Everything was special, but nothing
was unique.
Today, my reasons are dierent. I don’t think I’m alone
in nding it dicult to think back on the good times from
the perspective of the present. Even the walls of Santiago—
historically a living record of the political upheavals of the
day—have surprisingly little to say. The city is bued with
sloppy rectangles of gray paint—the right-wing answer
to our colorful, positive propaganda. In 2022, street-level
fascist groups had rediscovered the dictatorship era practice
of painting over leftist or otherwise subversive posters and
grati, and the result is a city with its history redacted. They
want us to forget, which makes it so much more important for
us to remember.
When I walk downtown, my memory is there to ll in the
gaps left on the walls. As a member of the Brigada Laura
Rodig, the feminist art and propaganda brigade of the
Coordinadora Feminista 8 de Marzo (CF8M), I can narrate
the revolt through an account of our political interventions.

Here, we painted a massive green pañuelo (bandana) bearing
the slogan, “This government rapes, kills, and makes people
disappear.” There, on that wall, we plastered our mosaic
portraits of movement martyrs as dirty wheat paste dripped
into our eyes and hair. And here, on this corner, we tied red
paper owers to the fencing cordoning o the site where a
protester fell to his death through an unsecured maintenance
panel. Memories of these actions are frequently interspersed
with personal ones. Watching roaming squads of hundreds of
high school students break into the subway stations barricaded
against them. Being ecstatically crushed among millions of
protesters during “Chile’s Biggest March.” Witnessing the
arrival of Las Tesis’s iconic feminist performance “A Rapist in
Your Path” to Plaza Dignidad (Dignity Square), the epicenter
of the protests. I snapped photos of it all with my outdated
smartphone, knowing that I would someday need to look back
at it and remind myself it was real.

It was November 23, 2019, and I was having the best day
of my life. The revolt was in full swing, and I remember the
ethereal quality of simply existing in public and seeing it
unfold around me.
The historic Communist mural brigade, the Brigada
Ramona Parra (BRP), had put out an open call for volunteers
to join it in painting a massive mural alongside the Mapocho
River where it passes Plaza Dignidad, and my compañera
Denisse and I had decided it was an opportunity not to be

missed. While neither of us had ever been attracted to the
politics of the Chilean Communist Party, we had tackled
similar public art projects as part of the Brigada Laura Rodig
and were captivated by the idea of doing a collaborative mural
on such a large scale. That was the ocial line, at least. If
pressed, I would have had to admit to being a longtime BRP
fangirl dying to see how my own street art skills measured up
against those of the iconic muralistas.
I arrived early in the day and had a truly hair-raising
experience descending a rickety ladder to the otherwise in-
accessible riverbank. Strangers caught rst my backpack and
then me, as I tumbled from the nal rungs. I was eventually
joined by Denisse and dozens of other volunteers—some with
experience, and others only with enthusiasm. The revolt was
only a month old at that point, and there was a widespread
feeling of entitlement to public space. The walls and streets
were ours, and they would be the record of both our recent
advances and revolutionary aspirations. We traced and
painted the symbols that we all already recognized as part
of the story we were writing together. A high school student
jumping a turnstile. The infamous riot dog Matapacos and his
red bandana. A masked protester. A grandmother wielding
a wooden spoon to cacerolear—the action of beating on pots
and pans as a form of popular protest. Dozens of eyes crying
bloody tears, in acknowledgment of those who had recently
been maimed by the police through their indiscriminate use
of crowd control rounds. The mural was impossibly long,
stretching out far beyond my line of sight. As I perched on
a piece of scaolding, paintbrush in hand, I felt the eeting
euphoria of what it was to be a part of history and wished it
could last forever.

It didn’t, of course, and it wasn’t any easier on my way back
up the ladder. I was sweaty and sunburned, but the thrill of
the experience helped me push through my exhaustion. From
the street, I could see other volunteers still working away on
the mural’s details. For anyone crossing the nearby bridge, it
would be impossible to ignore.
It was early afternoon, and as I was essentially already at
Plaza Dignidad, I thought I would take a walk around the
area before going home. I was hoping to take photos of any
new grati or posters that had appeared since the latest round
of Friday night mobilizations. I began the lengthy process of
crossing the multiple lanes of trac that divided the river to
the north from the plaza to the south. As I arrived at the
nal crosswalk, I encountered a hastily assembled barricade
of construction debris that presented just enough of an
obstacle to keep the oncoming trac at bay. Music surged
from a portable amplier as a pair of masked tango dancers
embraced in the middle of the street. The two of them moved
as if they were the only couple left on earth, executing their
graceful steps without a care for the growing threat from the
drivers who tapped their horns in irritation. Each movement
was timed to perfection, demonstrating both passion and
athleticism. It was a performance that would have looked at
home on any stage, but contained many layers of carefully
considered symbolism.
The dancers wore matching black shirts and shorts with
T-shirts tied over their faces in the style employed by protesters
of all ideologies (not to mention the young, apolitical, angry,
and disaected) disposed to engaging in direct combat with
the police. Their tted clothing and lithe, queer-coded bodies

were in stark contrast, however, with those of the stereotypical
cis male rock-throwers who often wore typical street clothes or
simply stripped down to their shorts, sneakers, and bandanas.
The choice of music also struck me; I recognized the sound
of La Lira Libertaria, a local group known for drawing on
the popular musical and poetry traditions of the region to
interpret modern antiauthoritarian themes. Years earlier, my
friend Vicky had insisted on introducing me to their music
as part of a crash course in what it meant to be a Chilean
anarchist. The dancers had choreographed their tango to
“Ármate,” a song that begins as a melancholy ballad, but
builds to a chorus that demands listeners to “arm yourself and
be violent, beautifully violent,” a phrase recalling the words
of Luisa Toledo, a beloved revolutionary icon of resistance
against the dictatorship who relentlessly championed the
creative, destructive power of young people until her death
in 2021.
Felipe and Manuel, I would later learn, were professional
dancers who performed as Zuinger, a duo committed to
breaking the gender binary as well as bringing their queer
take on traditional dance out of the studio and into public
space. In the short documentary lm Sentido y razón by
Martín Pizarro Veglia, Felipe describes Chile as a country
in which everything is oriented around the cisgender male
gaze. Where, they wonder, is there room for women, queers,
and transgender people?4 At rst, like so many other broke
and talented young people, the duo performed along the
busy sidewalks of downtown Santiago in exchange for tips.
When the October uprising overtook the capital, they made

the decision to take Zuinger to Plaza Dignidad, where they
performed in the midst of tear gas and water cannons. And
that is where I encountered them, claiming space for those
of us who burned to bring our liberated bodies out into the
streets and be “beautifully violent” ourselves.
A small crowd had gathered to watch the performance
that day, and as motorists tried to nudge their way past the
barricade, we nonchalantly blocked the gaps with our bodies
and whatever else came to hand. No words were spoken; none
were needed. The plaza had been ours for weeks, and we were
the ones to decide how it—and indeed public space all over
the country—would be used going forward. As I watched, I
snapped photos and thought, “I am nally living in the new
world we have fought for. In this world, beautiful, unexpected
things will be the rule, not the exception.”

In the rst weeks of the pandemic, I suddenly had more
time on my hands than I knew what to do with. Although
I still considered myself a painter, I had largely abandoned
my personal practice in favor of collective projects and the
capitalist grind. The quarantine was almost a blessing in that
sense; at last, I could look back on my collection of photos
from a busy year of protests and select the best to use as
painting references. Even then, I think I understood that the
pandemic meant the end of the revolt as I knew it, but I still
anticipated the idea of returning to those memories with
pleasure, knowing that the act of painting was a way to escape
my dull, uncertain present.

## 294 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

I chose a photo I had taken of the tango dancers, of course.
Not only did they make for an objectively stunning subject,
but I felt compelled to put the feeling I had that day into
a painting. For me, creating art is a type of meditation. As
a practitioner of photorealism, I spend days and sometimes
weeks concentrating on every line and shadow. I come to
know my subjects intimately. And whether I am painting a
comrade or an anonymous muse, it is always an act of love.
Given that we’re living in historic times, I think it is also my
way of giving weight and importance to what I think is worth
remembering. My comrades are worth remembering, as are
the activities we’ve organized together. The spontaneous acts
of beauty and resistance I’ve witnessed are worth remembering
too. I don’t see myself as an individual artist distantly recording
events as they unfold but rather a participant in the project of
building our collective memory of this period—a record not
only of what passed but also what it meant to us and how it
felt to live through it.
When I completed my painting, El Tango Encapuchao (The
Masked-Up Tango), and shared it on social media, I received
some positive feedback from friends and fans who in turn
shared it with their own networks. A few days later, I was
shocked to receive a message from Felipe, one of the dancers
depicted in the painting. Through a series of audio messages,
they told me that seeing the painting had truly moved them
and they couldn’t thank me enough for creating it. Once
the pandemic was over, we promised each other that we
would sit down together for a coee and indulge in a little
mutual admiration. I mentioned my dream of exhibiting
my quarantine era paintings someday, and Felipe immedi-
ately committed to performing at the opening. Although the

## REMEMBRANCE AND SUBVERSIVE BODIES   /   295

---

possibility of having a public event seemed so distant, it went
straight to my heart that someone who had inspired me so
much could in turn take something from my own art; that
neither the performance nor my photo nor even the painting
itself would be the end of this cycle.
Nearly two and a half years later, in October 2022, the
exhibition nally became a reality. I had sent a proposal to
the collective that managed Librería Proyección, the beloved
radical bookstore and infoshop where I attended so many
meetings and other activities, and it had agreed to host
my exhibition, including an opening night. After so much
time spent in lockdown, I was eager to turn the event into
something of a coming out, a return to the streets. I was
still in mourning over the shocking defeat of the proposed
new constitution one month earlier, but as the slogan goes,
it “smelled like October”—the month the revolt had kicked
o—and my rebellious heart was waking back up.
Once the date was set, the rst thing I did was write to
Felipe. Part of me expected them to have forgotten their
promise, but they instantly reassured me that they wouldn’t
miss my opening night for the world. While their former
dance partner, Manuel, had moved to Spain, Felipe informed
me that they were now working with a new partner, Rodrigo,
who would be pleased to perform. With that crucial detail
squared away, I shifted my thoughts to how I could bring my
exhibition out of the gallery and into public space.
I decided to create a gigantografía, a popular form of
street art I’d learned about alongside my compañeras at the
height of the feminist wave. I used a free internet program to
transform a digital scan of El Tango Encapuchao into a ninety-

## 296 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

one-page PDF, which I then printed out and laboriously
pasted together on my living room oor. The result was a
mosaic poster nearly twice my height, ready to be pasted onto
a wall of my choosing. After some discussion with my contact
at the bookstore about logistics, I set my sights on a blank wall
just north of the entrance.
The day of the exhibition, I put out a call within my feminist
organization for extra hands. A handful of compañeras
showed up just in time to help, and to my surprise, Felipe
and Rodrigo arrived early for their rehearsal and decided
to pitch in. Together, we scrubbed the wall clean and began
the arduous work of wheat pasting the poster high above our
heads, out of reach of passing fascists and their buckets of
gray paint. Rodrigo was the most fearless, using his dancer’s
grace to balance on the highest rungs. Felipe and I couldn’t
stop smiling at each other as we worked, and after all,
why not? Foot by messy foot, we were reintroducing their
performance—so grounded in another place and time—to
our post-plebiscite reality.
When we had nally achieved our goal and stepped back
to admire our work, we all grinned for seles and squeezed
each other’s hands in excitement. Nearly two weeks prior to
the second anniversary of the revolt, we had made something
new that was neither a melancholic commemoration nor a
nostalgic commodity. It was street art in its best sense, done
without permission by comrades old and new, dragging hope
back out of our mourning and pasting it up on a wall for the
world to see.
I left the dancers outside to rehearse and returned to the
work of preparing the exhibition. I moved chairs, straightened

## REMEMBRANCE AND SUBVERSIVE BODIES   /   297

---

frames, and scrubbed my face clean of the soot that had rained
down on us while we worked. A short time later, I began
welcoming my guests, nearly all of whom were compañeras
of my own organization or friends from our broader activist
community. When it was time for me to speak, I talked about
how it still hurt to think back on the revolt and how I had
worried that my art, a record of my own experiences, would
end up as just another cynical commodication of something
priceless. And then I told the story of the best day of my life
and the painting that commemorates it, and how it’s helped
me pick up the thread of rebellion again and again. It meant
everything to me that something so beautiful and profound
could keep growing from one October to the next and nd
new life even in this dicult new era, when we need it the
most. I was met with hugs and tears and words of support
from my dear community, which I am pleased to say, had no
idea what was coming next.
My compañera Fernanda, the MC for the event, corralled
us all out of the bookstore and onto the large paved area in
front of the building. High above and to the right of our small
crowd, the gigantografía was gloriously visible, shining out
from the drab bricks and concrete of downtown Santiago.
And then the music started, and I didn’t have eyes for
anything else but the long, elegant leg emerging from the
bookstore entrance. As Felipe and Rodrigo executed their
rst steps, all in black, T-shirts wrapped around their faces,
moving with all the exquisite passion that the tango has to
oer, I nally felt it again: that same surging joy I remembered
from when I rst saw two dancers come together to perform
behind a barricade.

## 298 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

And I realized what should have been obvious all along.
It has always been our queer, feminist, subversive bodies in
motion—mourning, remembering, and resisting—that are
the ultimate legacy, not only of the revolt, but of all revolts.
For those of us who are still here, the stories we have lived will
be the memory of resistance for those who come next.

Los años siguen su rumbo y el olvido no descansa
Volviendo la vida mansa, dejándola sin memoria
Burlando su trayectoria, ya que así el poder avanza
Más nos queda y el incendio al que me apego
Volviendo el recuerdo al fuego que como plaga se
expande
Porque ante todo el que mande no seré nunca borrego

The years march on and oblivion doesn’t rest
Making life tame, stripping it of memory
Twisting its course, since that’s how power advances
More remains for us and the blaze I cling to
Turning memory back into a re that spreads like a
plague
Because in the face of any authority, I will never be a
follower

SHAKESQUEER TUCSON:
PERFORMING
## ANARCHO-FEMINISM

|
## W R E N AW RY

On a Friday evening in April 2022, in the street in front of
autonomous social center BCC Tucson, a gure crept out of
the shadows and onto a hand-painted stage.1 “In fair Verona
where we lay our scene,” the Chorus began, and with this
invocation, Shakesqueer’s production of Romeo and Juliet
commenced. But it wasn’t a straightforward version of the
play: Verona was depicted as an egalitarian commune tucked
in a crystal abyss, Romeo and Juliet were both queer women,
and the people of Verona were fed up with the squabbling
Montague and Capulet families, which were still holding onto
their wealth and power. Over the next three hours, romance
and intrigue erupted across the stage, lit in soft neon shades,
and lled with actors draped in metallic chains and white lace.
Romeo and Juliet was the fourth production of Shakesqueer,
an all-volunteer crew in Tucson, Arizona, that puts on queer,
radical interpretations of the Bard’s work. Throughout the
course of the 2022 spring season—during rehearsals for
the play and after it was done—I interviewed members of
Shakesqueer about the troupe, and the ways in which these
performances create a community of care while striving to
embody queer, feminist, and anarchist ideals.2 What follows is
an informal oral history, stitched together from bits and pieces
of those conversations.

    1. For more information on BCC Tucson, see https://bcctucson.org/.
2. I’m also a member of Shakesqueer, and have been part of Macbeth
(2018), As You Like It (2019), and Romeo and Juliet (2022) in onstage
and behind-the-scenes capacities. Since these interviews took place,
Shakesqueer has put on a fth production, A Midsummer Night’s Dream
(2023), also performed at BCC Tucson.

ACT 1: “ WE COULD JUST PUT ON A PLAY WITH OUR FRIENDS”

Maggie: I was unemployed at the time. Glen had just moved
to town, and I was trying to engage him as a new friend. I
knew that he had community theater experience. I was like,
“That’s so funny, because I have no experience whatsoever.
But I love Shakespeare. And I have a lot of time on my
hands.” I thought it might work because Tucson was this
place where I saw a lot of people being active in cool ways.
You’re doing hard work with your friends, and it’s actually
producing something.

Glen: Yeah, we could do that! We could just put on a play with
our friends.

Ember: At a release party for a No More Deaths abuse
documentation report, Maggie and Glen said, “We’re thinking
about putting on a Shakespeare play.”4 That was my rst full

year in Tucson, and one of the moments when I was like, “The
fact that this came up without me even being the instigator of
it means that I’m 100 percent in the correct community for
me.” Because one of my fondest memories from childhood is
going to Shakespeare in the Park in Kansas City. The theater
company would put on a Shakespeare summer camp, which
I attended and loved.

Glen: Somebody suggested, “Glen and Maggie should
direct.” Then we sent out an email. The subject line was, “It
wasn’t a joke.” We invited nine or ten of our closest friends in
Tucson to a meeting. People we thought might be interested
in it. At that meeting, we explained, “We’re gonna do the play,
we’re gonna have rehearsals, we’re gonna have auditions.
Me and Maggie are gonna direct. Does this sound good to
everybody?” We just kind of went for it.

Inmn: I got involved in Shakesqueer when I was living in
Asheville, North Carolina, and I came to Tucson to help with
the No More Deaths Spring Break. It was the rst day that
I got into town, and I ran into a friend, and they said, “Are
you going to the play tonight?” They told me that this group
was putting on a production of Twelfth Night and the theme
was “space punk,” and it was all genderbent and wacky.
So I drove all the way down to Arivaca, Arizona, to catch
the last performance and absolutely fell in love with it from
the moment the curtains opened. Then the next year I was
in town visiting in the winter again and got a random text
message from a friend about auditions for Macbeth, a second
production that Shakesqueer was putting on.

## 306 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

Sophie: I got involved in As You Like It just through word of
mouth with friends. I had done theater stu growing up and
in high school. It was this really revolutionary concept to me
that a group of friends could just be like, “We are going to do
theater,” and then be able to do that in an informal way.

Dominique: I saw Macbeth and loved it. I saw As You Like
It. Loved it. Dressed up for As You Like It, in a ower crown
and oral clothing and fun makeup. Tried to get others to
participate via bringing more owers to wear and saying,
“Here’s yours, here’s yours, here’s yours.” I remember
running lines with Ember because they were in As You Like
It. When the auditions happened for the 2022 production of
Romeo and Juliet, I actually wanted to play the Nurse for a fun
thing to do. Glen encouraged me to try out for a bigger role,
so I looked at some of the monologues and showed up to
the audition semi-prepared and very much excited. And also
excited to get the role of Romeo and terried to get the role.

Egg: Someone I knew was in As You Like It. I went and saw it.
I read the playbill that you probably wrote, Wren, and I was
really excited because I had just read Silvia Federici’s Caliban
and the Witch, and thought, “Oh, all of this material about
the enclosure of the commons is really doing it for me.” I
didn’t follow Shakesqueer closely enough to be part of the
rst production of Romeo and Juliet, but when there was an
open call for auditions in winter 2021, that’s when I tried out.

## SHAKESQUEER TUCSON   /   307

ACT 2: “NO ONE PERSON COULD HAVE POSSIBLY
## DREAMED UP WHAT IT IS”

Adrian: Because the majority of the people in the group every
year have been radicals, or people who believe in revolution
and liberation, that has inuenced what we create. Even if
we’re not always going around and saying we’re an anarcho-
queer project or anarcho-feminist project, I think we’re all
people who are aware of power, people who are aware of
control and hierarchies, and want to act on that in our smaller
collectives that we create and form a dierent way of relating
to one another. Because of that, we shift the plays to take out
moments, or shift those moments to feel better in relation to
what our ideals and values are.
Sometimes it’s really in your face in a fun way, like at the
end of Macbeth, killing me, the king, and yelling, “Never
another king, never another cop, never another policeman,
never another president,” and blood foaming from my mouth.
And then taking that on tour to rural Arizona was intense. We
had to have conversations about what we felt was appropriate.
I think we decided to not use all the same language when we
were in Ajo. We had a whole consensus meeting about it. It’s
not that we wanted to censor ourselves but rather we asked,
## “What’s appropriate in dierent spaces?”

Egg: Part of putting together a production that makes it have
these elements of anarchism could be found in other theater
productions as well, which is beautiful when you think about
it. But the elements that make Shakesqueer anarchist are the
ways in which the cast becomes mutually dependent on one
another in the formation of this creative project; we rely on

## 308 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

the work that we and our peers are putting into the endeavor.
The other thing we do as a cast is to be deeply involved in the
set creation and creative visioning of the project. There is no
distinct line separating directors from other participants.

Glen: Anarchism, at least in my understanding, means the
minimizing of hierarchy. And putting on a play is coordinating
a sizable group of people into doing an extremely specic
and predetermined set of actions. With this project, those
hierarchies have always been put under the microscope of
the group, or very, very much put out there in the group, such
as, “This is what we’re doing, we’re thinking about creating
a temporary, consensual hierarchy here.” That to me is
anarchist; when those top-down structures pop up, they can
be disassembled by the group if they are not legitimate or
whatever.

Adrian: We’ve had a couple of iterations of how much control
the director did or did not have throughout the years. There’s
been moments when people feel like the director has too
much control, and yet those plays went extremely smoothly.
And then there’s been moments when the directors have felt
like they didn’t want to have much control or power, and want
it to be more consensual, and then it was a lot bumpier and
slower and maybe a little more chaotic of a production. I feel
like this past year, we hit a real sweet spot. Inmn had a vision
and a real story that they wanted to tell. We all really loved
that vision and story, and wanted to help create that story.
But there were certain moments when Inmn wanted to do
something and the rest of the cast didn’t want to, and we did
a consensus process and then Inmn’s ideas didn’t happen.

## SHAKESQUEER TUCSON   /   309

---

Sophie: I didn’t really get exposed to collective and non-
hierarchical organizing until coming to Tucson, and the
Shakesqueer project has been one of those things that really
has shown me how possible it is to organize and orient in that
way. Sometimes it feels really messy, but especially with As You
Like It, there’s all of these ideas that came up where I was like,
“That’s impossible,” or, “I don’t know if that really ts with
the rest of the play.” And then watching all of those things
actually manifest and happen in these beautiful, chaotic ways
that then blended together, it was a really visible way of seeing
how collective processes can work. How breaking down those
power structures can bring about such cool art and creativity.
No one person could have possibly dreamed up what it is.

Dominique: Toward the beginning of Romeo and Juliet re-
hearsals, we had a meeting specically for what our COVID
protocols were going to be. We were in the middle of a COVID
wave again; it was in January. We were still masking at the
rehearsals, and being outside and trying to keep distance and
stu like that. As the numbers went down, we relaxed some of
those protocols. It felt good; we were trying to move through
that according to what science and numbers showed us.
The decision on how the play was going to end was
collaborative in a couple of dierent ways. We played with
the idea of Juliet living, Juliet killing Paris, or maybe the
play ending after Juliet stabs herself, and not having the
families come and see Romeo and Juliet. That was all a group
discussion. All of that collaboration is the anarcho side, and
on the feminism side, I feel like some aspects of feminism are
so basic, like let’s just not have cis men in charge of everything.

## 310 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

Yet more than that, I feel like it’s gearing toward the idea of
what feminism could be when it’s actualized.

Egg: I suppose the way that I see it as a feminist project is
that the tasks of putting it together don’t become sharply
dierentiated and the people taking them on are not stratied,
not doing so because they are forced into a position of
caretaking, cleaning up, or taking responsibility for things that
others are avoiding because of a desire to be in the spotlight
or do more glamorous tasks. It’s kind of analogous in my mind
to other autonomous projects where everyone does the dishes.

Maggie: In more subtle ways, I think Shakesqueer does reect
anarcho-feminism and anarcho-queerness by empowering
people to take on creative projects that maybe they haven’t
had access to before. Along with all of that there’s some sort
of DIY aesthetic that I really love. I think it’s so cool that
with the rst play, almost no one had theater experience. We
worked through that together, and we trusted each other to
put in the work to learn those skills and then share those skills
with our community.

Adrian: The rst year or maybe two years, we never called
it Shakesqueer. But Twelfth Night was an extremely queer
production; we just didn’t brand ourselves as queer. I think
that reects the fact that most of the members are queer,
and we had a poly love fest at the end of Twelfth Night where
everyone got together and it was really fun.

Ember: I just started calling it Shakesqueer and put that on the
posters for Macbeth. But there was denitely a misconception

## SHAKESQUEER TUCSON   /   311

---

within the group after I did that that only queers could
participate, whereas I had been much more of the opinion
that we were queering Shakespeare. A queer reading of
these texts, and then sometimes it’s queer reinterpretation or
remix and rewriting. Queer casting, of course. In mainstream
theater, it’s called “genderblind” casting, but that’s too neutral
for what we’re doing. When I was casting for Macbeth, I was
like, “I want some gay! I want some gay stu going on!” So
that’s the opposite of gender-neutral casting. Queer was a
part of it from the beginning, and it was really fun to tease
out those elements from the text because they’re already just
right there.

Egg: I think that Shakepeare’s writing already oers up a lot
of space for queer possibility. In his plays as well as his other
writing and sonnets, you can easily read how dierent forms
of love are explored.

Inmn: As You Like It is about this “woman” who disguises
herself as a man to travel about the world more easily and
safely, and ends up meeting a man who’s in love with her, but
doesn’t know that she is a her because she’s disguised as a man
and starts to court him as this man, which is very gay. That’s
just how the play originally is. But in the original version,
she unveils at the end and can marry this man because she’s
actually a woman. In our version, which feels very familiar
to me, through playing at being another gender, you can nd
the ways in which the gender that you’ve been raised in is not
necessarily the gender that you are, the experience that you
have, or the identity that you embody.

## 312 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

I remember being obsessed with reading about these female
protagonists in stories. Then you know, later reecting, “Did
I have crushes on these characters? Or did I just want to be
them?” and then realizing later that I just wanted to be them,
that I was trans but didn’t know it. So in our version of As
You Like It, Rosalind, the woman who disguises herself as a
man to navigate the world, in doing so realizes that they are
not a woman. At the end of the play, they come out as being
nonbinary trans. So the reveal at the end of our play was that
they could marry everyone because they liked them all.

Dominique: There was queerness in a lot of dierent aspects
of Romeo and Juliet. There was a story line of Mercutio having
a big old crush on Romeo that was kind of unrequited; falling
in love with your best friend, that does happen. We discussed
early on, too, do we want part of Romeo and Juliet’s star-
crossed lovership to be that their parents are homophobic?
And we decided no, we don’t want that to be a part of this
story because it’s part of so many other stories and it’s kind
of overdone. Let’s just have this in a queer utopia sense where
that’s actually not the issue at all.
The costumery had elements of, “What is gender?” even
with Glen’s role as the Nurse. There’s a lot of roles that are
“male,” and the Nurse was not really one of them, but then
Glen being the perfect Nurse, wearing the elements of a nurse
and talking about being a wet nurse. Then there’s a number
of characters who use they/them pronouns. We’re conned
by some of the words, but we’ve changed some of the words
to be what we want them to be. There was a fat joke in one of
the exchanges, and I asked, “Can we take that out?” and the
## group replied, “Oh, yeah, strike it! Done!”

## SHAKESQUEER TUCSON   /   313

Inmn: In a few of the productions, we’ve tried to write in or
amplify anarchistic ideals that are already present in the play
or that we want to insert into the play to tell a certain story. In
As You Like It, there’s this historical footnote that the play was
written in response to the Enclosure Act and enclosure riots.
Even though it’s this play in which nobility are some of the
protagonists, they’re nobility who’ve been exiled by this evil
duke, and they go to live in the forests, and there’s all of these
jokes in the play that took me a really long time to decode that
are about random farmers and sheep herders feeling weird
about accepting wages for work. And then digging deeper into
it and nding that this play was also written at a time when
there was a shift going on from feudalism to early capitalism.
Seeing these small pieces of it in this play, whether it’s
nobles who no longer have feudal power going around and
paying people to do things, and re-creating these structures
through the exchange of money, or a bunch of people who
have been exiled and are now hiding out in the forest, which
was a huge part of the commons that were being encroached
on and that ordinary people completely relied on to live.
These were all parts of the play that were written into the
original text, but were so subtly buried that to the nobility at
the time it wouldn’t have appeared to be this heavy critique of
the shift into capitalism or feudal power structures, but a lot of
common people would have gotten the jokes and references
that were being made. So we amplied those footnotes and
subtle references, and turned them into a larger backdrop in
the play.

## ACT 3: “JOY ABSOLUTELY CONNECTS WITH CARE”

Adrian: I want to talk about the feelings of this play, Romeo
and Juliet, in regard to care or mutual aid, which is an anarchist
principle. We really came into that this year, where there was
a lot of reciprocal care happening within the play. There was
a lot of checking in and making sure people’s needs were met,
a lot of consensus process, asking people what they needed,
and helping them get those things. In a lot of ways, it’s a
feminist ideal as well: making sure people in the collective
have what they need and listening to people.

Dominique: If someone was having a stressful time in their
personal life or because of the play, there was actual caring. I
got stressed out because some of the content of the play was
reigniting my work stressors [working as a nurse throughout
the COVID-19 pandemic] and I wasn’t fully mentally pre-
pared for that to happen. I wasn’t sure if I was gonna mention
it, but then decided to talk with Inmn and Adrian about it. I
talked to some other friends too, but within this group of new
ones, I trusted that they would be kind and allow me some
grace to kind of freak out.

Maggie: It’s really hard to be vulnerable and do art with
your friends. In order for that to actually happen, you have to
create an atmosphere of care so that you can actually learn,
mess up, play around, and do a lot of dierent things with
acting. A lot of people struggle with public performances.
I was talking with Adrian, who was the director for the
rst round of Romeo and Juliet, about how I didn’t feel like
I had a lot of condence in my acting and was struggling

## SHAKESQUEER TUCSON   /   315

---

at rehearsals because I didn’t think that I was doing it well.
She sat me down and told me all the ways that I was able
to generate emotion within her when I acted. It’s such a
condence booster for your friends to see you grow in an art
form and support you in that as well.

Egg: Care showed up as people taking collective and
individual responsibility in the creation of the project as
a whole, and care also showed up in many interpersonal
dynamics that I was a part of and witnessed. Learning all
the ght choreography for Romeo and Juliet, there were these
moments of really embodied care when Dominique would
knock me down, stand over me, and murder me during every
practice, and then extend her hand and lift me up, pat me on
the back, and wipe the dirt o me.
Another form that care took was in people encouraging
one another to be the best that they could be. There was this
moment midway through rehearsals when Glen spoke to the
whole group, and as a reminder to people to memorize their
lines, said, “If we had our lines memorized by now, we could
all be focusing more on acting.” It was a gentle invitation to
the group that probably could have felt a little bit like shaming
in a way, but instead was kind and helpful.

Inmn: Having been the director twice now and getting to
work really closely with people on some of the acting stu,
it’s been beautiful to watch people take on these roles or build
intimacy with their scene partners in ways that they might
not have ever done before. We’re always all learning about
the production while it’s happening. One of our members

## 316 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

always has some note about historical Shakespeare stu to
tell everyone at rehearsals or someone’s like, “Wait, what does
this word mean?” and then somebody knows the historical
signicance behind it.
Acting in general can provide this playful structure for
people to participate in ways that they don’t normally get to
in their everyday life, to go and put on these other personas,
and play around in them for a little while, maybe learn
something new about themselves or their relationship to
gender or any of the themes in the play. Watching people get
to perform as villains, for instance, where they just have to be
irrationally angry in ways that the actor maybe never really
gets to play around with. I think there’s a lot of potential for
therapeutic healing that comes with putting on a production
like this, especially in an environment where a lot of us are
pretty amateur. There’s room to explore stu in ways that I
hope feel less intimidating to people when they’re not at some
regular production worrying that the director’s gonna yell at
them for not remembering their lines or something.

Dominique: A couple of things were going wrong on the
second night of Romeo and Juliet. Someone was mentioning the
second night curse, and I was like, “What the fuck is that?”
But denitely things were going wrong and awry. We had a
little meeting in the intermission, and there was someone who
had a slightly harsh tone, and someone else oered, “Come
on. Let’s be gentle with each other.” That’s a beautiful thing.
That’s a beautiful reminder.

Ember: Something that’s amazing about theater is how
immersive it is. It seems impossible to not get swept up in

## SHAKESQUEER TUCSON   /   317

---

the primacy of the play—the play’s the thing. Every play
follows this arc, and toward the end, all of this momentum
starts building and building and building. I’ve denitely seen,
in lots of dierent kinds of productions that are building
momentum, breaking points and tension explosions between
folks, and also it’s an amazing display of community. Because
of that momentum, it’s really, really hard to crap out on. Part
of it is having a strong mutual goal that’s also time bound.
Putting those kinds of constraints on ourselves encourages us
to gure out how to care for each other and problem solve.
In some ways, the timing and pressure make a community
of care necessary. Otherwise, it would be miserable, and we
wouldn’t keep doing it.

Sophie: A lot of our world is oriented by work and then
activism. There have been times in my life where I feel like I
just work and go to meetings. Shakesqueer was a huge thing
for me of making and deepening friendships. I think when
we’re just meeting people at parties or something casually,
we’re not working or building something together in the same
way. There’s a magic to theater, especially doing shows and
stu; it’s fun, exhilarating, and energizing, and that energy
has this kind of social stickiness or glue to it that is really
important for building community.
I’ve met people through that process who I’m now good
friends with, and I feel more cared for overall in the commu-
nity because I think we’ve been through stu together, even if
it’s sort of fun-slash-stage-stress. This year there are new cast
members; they’re maybe not somebody I would have met or
interacted with a lot, and thus get to form bonds with. It’s nice

## 318 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

to go to rehearsal and do something creative too. There’s a
huge community care aspect in that—saying this is worth our
time to do and gure out.

Maggie: The rst time we did a play, everyone in the audi-
ence didn’t really understand what we were doing, and so
when they saw it, they realized, “Oh, they’re actually putting
on a play and memorized the lines.” It generated joy and
love in the community for the coming days afterward and
maybe even further. Why I love doing events in general is
creating a space for the community to come together that’s
not always based around a party or something. How can we
think through dierent things or show each other talents
that maybe we don’t usually show each other? Joy absolutely
connects with care.
I was talking to Ember within the rst couple years of
doing Shakesqueer and said, “This is just fun work. It’s not
political work.” And Ember was like, “Why is it not political
work also? It’s just a dierent kind of political work than we’re
used to.” That really struck a chord with me: that political
work is not always in the streets or on the border or whatever.
Also, if you’ve done projects with your friends that take a lot
of coordination and working together, what results is that you
are better able to work together in the future on a diversity
of projects. We fucked around and did rehearsals and a play
for three months, and that made it so when we’re doing, for
example, Tucson Mesh or stu with the BCC, it makes it that
much easier to come at it trusting that you can do something
with someone else and that you’ve had fun with that person.5
    5. Tucson Mesh is a community-controlled and collectively run

## SHAKESQUEER TUCSON    /   319

Inmn: It’s always been really special to me that we have
this commitment to going on small tours and bringing queer
theater to rural places. Like going to Arivaca, which is this
small town near the border, and bringing this production to
this place where a lot of people, I think, don’t really get to
see anything like that very often. Or bringing it to Ajo, where
one of our friends brought their middle school class to the
production, and queer and trans kids in that class got to see
this play that was very much put on for people like them.
Or the ways that it oers collaboration between a lot of
people; for instance, there’s someone who has traditionally
done a lot of the music for the play, and they bring an
anarchistic brass band with them. It just turns into this big
old production that a lot of people in the community have
stakes and participation in.

Maggie: I don’t think that we just do theater and everything’s
great. It’s a specic way to tell stories, to bring community
together, to build our ability to be creative together. It’s
just one part of many things that we can do together that
creates a better world. It makes me sad to think about a
project like Shakesqueer ending, but I think that it’s OK for
certain projects to come and do something special, and then
they don’t have to be institutionalized, you know? We should
only be doing this if it’s creating joy and happiness in our
community. Let’s stop when it’s not doing that and let other
people decide what they want to do.

## 320 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

ACT 4: “ WE’RE DEMONSTRATING SOMETHING
## TO OURSELVES BY DOING IT”

Dominique: The obvious potential is to fuck shit up, and
with creativity, destroy the harmful structures of society within
this little space that we’re creating. For a moment, for a night,
for a few hours, queerness isn’t the issue; for a few hours this
element of friendship and magic and crystals and all of that
can exist. I used to play the strings for this country band that
sang songs about being gay. We played gay bars in small towns
in the Midwest and Southeast, or we played smaller venues.
It’s a similar feeling of, “For this time, in this room, we are
going to create the world that we want to live in.” My hope is
that people get so invigorated, recharged, and inspired by that
feeling that we all created for the audience that they go and
do it themselves in their lives. It exponentially makes more
spaces where that can exist.

Ember: I really believe in the importance of local art. I don’t
like art being perceived as this thing that only people who
went to art school and have abundant surplus income can
make, or this weird thing where people all over the world are
consuming the same media and there’s this monoculture, kind
of like a attening of local cultures. So what Shakesqueer also
does is it reminds us that we are artists, and builds on and
contributes to local culture.

Sophie: I was teaching high school when we were doing As You
Like It and talked to a couple of my students about it, and they
were like, “What? You can do Shakespeare but queer?” Just
having that conversation with young people, and being able

## SHAKESQUEER TUCSON   /   321

---

to present dierent storytelling and representational things,
felt huge.

Dominique: My friend’s kid, she just turned twelve, and I
was really excited for her to be in the audience for Romeo and
Juliet. For her to see a queer love story, I think that’s very
beautiful in and of itself, but also for her to see how fun
costumes can be, and how there’s this world of theater that
exists where you can yell and stomp and fall to the ground
and cry and have a choreographed ght sequence. You can
be whoever you are, be this other character, this badass, this
very vulnerable person.

Inmn: Theater is a real-life experience. You have to leave
your house to see a play and be there with the actors. If the
actors put on a play, and part of the play moves, maybe the
audience moves with the play, maybe the play roves, and
maybe they go do some other stu and it becomes unclear
whether it’s part of the performance or whether it’s a political
action in and of itself.
I grew up watching Bread and Puppet and the Beehive
Collective put on performances that were connected to polit-
ical struggles going on.6 I’ve always really loved how theater
is something for the people, less so than the ruling class.
Theater traditionally has been this fun way that class hierar-
chies can be temporarily broken down. You can get away with
a lot that you couldn’t normally get away with and poke a
lot of fun at the ruling class in ways that at least historically,

breadandpuppet.org/; Beehive Collective, https://beehivecollective.org/.

## 322 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

people might have been much more heavily reprimanded for,
or were killed or imprisoned for.
The theater provides this shield—I mean, it’s not a
thick shield; it’s pretty paper thin—against repression or
consequences because it is playful, although I think that is less
true now than it was during the Middle Ages or Renaissance.
One of the traditional pieces of Halloween was that you could
go and demand food from rich people, and if they didn’t give
it to you, it was perfectly legal to throw rocks at their house
and shit. But if people did that now, they’d probably get in
a lot of trouble. So when I think about what Shakesqueer
could do as far as that in our current time and context, I think
about things like that, about how we can draw attention to a
lot of struggles that are going on that we’re implanting into
or amplifying within the plays. I would love it if in the future,
we used the productions to push the envelope with current
struggles a little more.
That said, queer and anarchist theater can create spaces
for people to play around with ideas in physical and somatic
ways that they might only ever get to think about. My hope is
that by providing these temporary spaces, those moments can
persist beyond the performance.

Egg: Theater in my experience has oered the most potential
to the people who participate in it. It’s an invitation to frolic
in a world where the rules have changed, and that invites a
reimagining of political, interpersonal, and social possibilities.
Theater enables us as creators of a project to inhabit dierent
selves, and try on how we could move these hauntings and the
possession of ourselves into our everyday life.
Theater is also a space for radical possibility in that the

## SHAKESQUEER TUCSON   /   323

---

creation of a temporary project for the purpose of enjoyment
and art and creativity invites us to step away from the
pressures that a lot of us feel to be creating things for lasting
glory, or padding our egos in more structured and long-term
projects. In theater, instead, we are creating things together
and then dismantling them, either every night or at the end
of the project. The temporariness of the experience is part of
what’s beautiful about it. This festival-like thing.

Adrian: We love putting on these productions for our
communities so they can see and feel the joy—or this year,
mourning—of the story, but also it’s for the people who are
in it to have this intense feeling of putting everything aside
in their life. The potential in that is that you get comfortable,
and experience creating something beautiful and new, and
really hard, with a group of radicals that share your vision
of what the future should be. Then you get to show the
whole community what you’ve done and the artistry, but I
think honing our skills of consensus and collaboration and
storytelling creates room for other projects. You could say
there are parallels between doing a direct action as well. Being
in a group of people where you’re trying to gure something
out together and collaborate, and it’s uncomfortable, and you
have to put everything in your life aside for it.

Glen: Another way of putting it would be that we’re
demonstrating something to ourselves by doing it. Some cool
things about theater are that it’s big, it makes a splash, it’s
an event, it’s one night or three nights. I think it’s important
to me, from the way that I relate to art, not just to have a

## 324 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

consumerist relationship to art, and as an artist or consumer,
you have to be dodging out of it because that’s the hegemonic
way of relating to it. We proved to ourselves that rst year
that not only could we tell a story in this big way of freezing
time and gathering everybody to share in this storytelling but
we also felt that it was worth doing just for the sake of doing
it. That way of relating to art could potentially feed into a
way of relating to society in general.

Ember: I love the idea of touring. I was really excited when we
learned that there’s an anarchist theater festival in Montreal.
In my dream, I was like, “We’re gonna get a school bus and
ll it up with our set and the band and whatever, and drive to
Montreal and have the best time, the most outrageously fun
time we could possibly imagine.” I hope that’s not impossible
in the future. But it’s perfectly good for Shakesqueer to stay
the scale that it is, and it’s important for the people who are
putting it on and the people who are the audience.7

Maggie: It’s been really nice with Shakespeare that we can
adapt a play to touch on themes of queerness or feminism
or radical politics in general. But I hope that we’re giving
people the skills and condence to do storytelling through
theater that’s maybe even more blatantly radical. Before
Shakesqueer, I didn’t really know anyone doing theater in
Tucson. And since Shakesqueer, a lot of our friends now have
dierent skills around it. The more ways that we know how
to tell stories, the better, because I think stories are powerful
when it comes to pushing these ideas into the realm of reality.

production of Romeo and Juliet.

Our relationship with our territories is woven into the tulpas,
the millennia-old res of encounters, legacies, avors, and
knowledges. Memory is spun, and the res of resistance and
freedom are rekindled. Today, there are those who try to usurp
this space of ames and aects, to glamorize it, and turn it
into an image and propaganda so as to later steal it, empty it
of meaning, and destroy it as a passing fad or merchandise.
The tulpa, though, this center of women in collectivity with
the land and family, this heart of liberation and intimacy,
this power to be ourselves without being seen or judged so
as to continue surviving, has no price and cannot t into the
market. This sketch recalls the tulpas, invokes them, and calls
on us to care for ourselves by caring for them. It is the life
around the re that keeps us going.
When neighborhood women feel the same needs, when
neighbors talk about their problems, or when neighbors
come together and feel the same hunger, many times they
self-organize around food, around the re, around their
challenges. This has happened historically, and it continues to
happen to this day in large and small uprisings, mobilizations,
and marches, where particularly women—and all of those
who labor daily to care for life—work to provide food during
social actions.
For example, during the 2021 national strike in what they
call Colombia, when youths issued a call to rise up against the
increased taxes and cuts to health care proposed by President
Iván Duque Márquez’s government, and then hundreds of
thousands of people seeking social transformation joined
the protests, the communitarian kitchens, sustained by re,
were an essential pillar, feeding the front lines of the uprising

that exploded in the streets for more than sixty days.1 It’s not
known how many communitarian kitchens were created. It’s
only known that whoever passed by donated what little they
had in their home—rice, beans, lentils, salt, oil, potatoes,
bananas, or whatever was within reach—and the various
ingredients were then cooked into soups, stews, and broths in
the giant communal pots that fed the mobilized masses in the
cities. Groups of women and men collected the food, and then
sorted and prepared it, keeping the communitarian kitchens
in constant action. As people washed, peeled, chopped,
seasoned, and mixed foodstus to create a delicious and
steaming hot soup, they also shared words about the struggle
in the streets, their needs, the media’s lies, the repression, the
resistance, and their dreams as well as life and death.
The communitarian kitchens were where youths came
to enjoy a good meal and collectively fed themselves while
ghting together for a common cause. In fact, some of the
impoverished youths, strong on the front lines, said that during
the strike, they were able to eat three times a day thanks to
the communitarian kitchens. As well, families and collectives
prepared food and drink in their homes, and then brought it
directly to the barricades because they both wanted to take
care of the mobilized youths and were indignant that the so-

    1. Translator’s notes: Technically, ollas comunitarias means “communitar-
ian pots” in English. I’ve chosen to go with “communitarian kitchens”
to get at the spirit of what they embody, but other translations might be
“communal pots,” “communal cooking pots,” or “community pots,” or
“communal kitchens” or “community kitchens.” The front lines, sup-
ported and nourished by the communitarian kitchens, were made up of
women, men, and nonconforming folks who put themselves at the front
of the marches, encampments, and other collective actions in order to
safeguard the mobilizations and protect other people. Many of them
were killed, disappeared, tortured, and/or jailed by the state.

## 330 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

called public forces had destroyed some of the communitarian
kitchens, leaving them without food. In spite of this, the
communitarian kitchens persisted in word and action during
this lengthy mobilization. Hopefully they will continue to be
maintained through the self-organization and solidarity of
the peoples, countering any eorts to institutionalize them
and make them dependent on the state.

## THE FIRE THAT INHABITS ME

Since I was a girl, re has been an everyday part of my life.
Innite memories of our daily relationship with re now
inhabit me. The tulpas always remind me of dreams, signs,
stories, advice, plants, remedies, avors, colors, smells, and
sounds. I remember the tulpa in our house in the mountains
of the Indigenous reservation of Jambaló, in the southwest
of what they call Colombia; its three big rocks were on the
ground, almost in the center of our kitchen, with pieces of
burning wood atop the stones. Always nearby were the pots of
food, medicinal waters, brewed coee, and toasted coca that
provided all the energy for the day’s work.
I remember my maternal grandparents, with whom I had
the privilege of spending my childhood. They were always
close to the tulpa, asking us about our dreams; explaining the
meaning of signs (bodily vibrations) to us so that we could
recognize the messages of Mother Earth; showing us how to
use plants to protect ourselves and care for the territory; and
advising us, based on their joys and sorrows, on how to walk
through life.
They taught us how to understand the re’s signals. When
the sounds of the re seemed smothered, for instance, as if

## COMMUNITARIAN KITCHENS   /   331

---

someone was blowing on the ames from inside the replace,
it was because a visitor would arrive soon. We were then
supposed to take a little bit of ash and throw it into the re,
saying aloud, “May they not come empty-handed. May they
bring something.” Or when the re sparked and emitted small,
sharp explosions, it meant that an ill-tempered person was
going to arrive. That is what I learned from my grandmother,
and that is how I live today, here and now, with my family in
the mountains I inhabit.
In 2013, when I was participating in the “Little School of
Freedom according to the Zapatistas” and staying in the home
of a family from the bases of support, the re there began to
spark. My compañera host listened to the memories of my
grandmother while we did the domestic work necessary to
then eat some delicious tortillas. I explained to my compañera
that an ill-tempered person was probably about to arrive. A
short time later, a woman came to the house. The surprised
compañera told me, “Here comes my comadre [friend], and
yes, she is very harsh!!!”
Our relationship with re is fundamental for familial
intimacy and also territorial collectivity. The res of familial
intimacy are woven into territorial collectivity, not just due to
the material support each family brings, but because of the
spiritual energy that each family provides for the community.
This fabric of res has given birth to collective words and
actions to defend life too, beyond the rural and urban—the
locations that the state has assigned to us.

## THE COMMUNITARIAN KITCHENS

Today I relive the memory of the communitarian kitchens
that we helped to stoke in the mountains of Jambaló in 1986,
when my mother became a teacher in the rural community of
El Voladero. Festivals and school ceremonies were held that
wove us toward a better education. I remember the comadres,
midwives, and neighborhood women arriving with something
from their garden and a knife in hand to cook. I remember
the day laborers, musicians, and neighbors arriving with
rewood, and in case more was needed, machetes in hand.
We held a minga—ancestral collective work where everyone
contributes—to enjoy life in community.
We all took collective action to build a decent school, better
education, happy childhood, and organized community.
From that space, we dreamed and created daily life around
the re. At that time, almost everyone had a tulpa in their
home. The school meetings were places to not only to talk
about the progress and setbacks of the students but above
all address the problems of the community and look for
collective solutions. Not everything was rosy, but keeping the
re burning during the various collective actions ensured that
community organization was maintained at the time.
The communitarian kitchens, better known as fogones in
our territories, have always accompanied the communal work
carried out through the mingas. They have been present in
the barter exchanges and assemblies, nourished the traditional
festivals, and never been absent from the mobilizations and
collective actions that we have carried out for the past fty-
three years organized by the Cauca Indigenous Regional

## COMMUNITARIAN KITCHENS   /   333

Council in the Mother of the Forests (Kauka, in the Namtrick
language of my Misak people).2
Our fogones have been fed by the determination and
solidarities in the mountains, reciprocity between us and
the land, and need to achieve a common objective among
pueblos originarios [rst or original peoples]: to recover the
land. Toward this objective, my grandfather told me that
they used to have big parties to gather resources, but that the
police almost always arrived to tear down the communitarian
kitchens and dump out the pots of chicha, a fermented maize
drink, in order to hinder collective action.
Knocking down the communitarian kitchens has practically
become the law. The state and police have done it everywhere
so as to destabilize our organizing. Even so, the communitarian
kitchens have been the heart of our territorial struggles, and
with greater need in the cities now, they have become a refuge
that mitigates the hunger caused by the extractivism and
dispossession that commodies the land and life itself.
In the cities, there are beautiful experiences too. There are
those who have resisted the systemic crises that fall on their
shoulders, thanks to the collectivity found around the re, and
have managed to feed themselves despite the impoverishment
they have been subjected to in urban spaces. The coming
together of those who are displaced and impoverished in the
cities has allowed people to not only ght for food through
the communitarian kitchens but also feed the rebellions for a
dignied life.

culture, and autonomy of the peoples in the mountains of the Cauca.

## FIRE FEEDS THE BODY AND SPIRIT

In the uprisings, strikes, revolts, marches, encampments,
popular assemblies, blockades, land recuperations, communal
congresses, appropriation of factories, roadblocks, and
popular tribunals, and on pickets and barricades, re has
always been present.
Fire helps us to endure low temperatures and cook food
so as to resist, among many other things. Communitarian
kitchens and re are a necessary couple. They have been
present and vital in feeding the dignied rebellions that
denounce and question the state, transnationals, and all the
other powers that have always oppressed us. For the most
part, the communitarian kitchens have been the fruit of self-
organization, self-management, and self-care, far beyond the
promises and lies of the state.
For a long time, in ruralized and urbanized territories,
communitarian kitchens have sustained struggles against
hunger, for land and water, as a life practice and central axis
for collective nourishment. Without going too far back, it is
enough to recall some exemplary moments in various latitudes
that have stoked the res of struggle.
There is the Housewives Committee of the Twentieth-
Century Mine founded in the 1960s by the wives of tin
miners at the Siglo XX Mine in Potosí in what they call
Bolivia. These women organized against the repression
and imprisonment of their husbands, who had marched
for the payment of wages. They demanded the miners’
freedom, food supplies, and payment for work. Among them,
Domitila Barrios de Chungara distinguished herself as one of
the most courageous.

Then too, there is the Villa El Salvador Self-Managed
Urban Community, which arose in 1973 from the eorts of
impoverished families in Lima in what they call Peru, where
women organized themselves to guarantee food. In this
context, María Elena Moyano, one of the great examples of
this self-managed community, founded the Micaela Bastidas
Mothers’ Club, concerned with women’s issues, education,
and family health.
Also, in Veracruz in the place they call Mexico, there is
the inspiration of Leonila Vásquez, who in 1994, moved
by the Central American migrants passing through on the
“Bestia” (train of death) to reach their “American dream,”
decided to share what little she had for her family and deliver
it via “launches,” throwing bags of food onto the train for
the migrants. Today there are more women, known as the
Protectors, who continue Leonila’s legacy and now have more
support to carry out this humanitarian work.
And there is the piqueteros (picketers) movement, born at
the end of the 1990s in Buenos Aires in the place they call
Argentina. “Pickets” (roadblocks and blockades) were erected
in various parts of the city in rejection of the precariousness of
work and resultant hunger caused by rampant neoliberalism.
In 2001, the pickets grew stronger, along with the bravery and
dignity of the women—visible because they were not only a
fundamental part of the communal feeding but in all areas of
care during the pickets as well.
This is just a sample of an endless number of illustrations.
Yet without a doubt, the eighty bonres of Cherán in the
Purépecha Plateau of what they call Mexico are our reference
point. Day and night for more than six months in 2011, the

## 336 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

people of Cherán resisted, ignited by women setting bonres,
which in turn became the spark for the K’eri communal self-
governance there that today inspires and infects the world.3
During the pandemic, hunger, discontent, and indignation
were what compelled people to organize. People clearly saw
the need to collectively feed themselves in order to resist
economic subjugation, urgency to rise up together in the face
of policies and reforms that continue to impoverish them,
and necessity to decide how to sustain the various uprisings
and safeguard life. Moreover, against the backdrop of rising
fascism, social abandonment, and the current wars and others
in the making, it is not enough to name the self-proclaimed
Front Line Mothers of the communitarian kitchens in what
they call Chile or Ecuador, Colombia or Peru—the women
who are fundamental to self-managing everything in daily
life, and more so when they come together and manage to
feed revolutions. We must also mention the mothers, women,
children, and youths who day by day are being bombed,
displaced, and disappeared, and impeded from having their
own communitarian kitchens.

## TO INHABIT OBSCURITY AND CARE FOR THE TULPAS

There are many other communitarian kitchens that don’t
declare themselves as such. They, made up mostly of women,
simply provide dignied food for the resistances and feeling-
thinking that walk side by side during concrete actions. That
is, from what we’ve witnessed recently in the resistances in
    3. For the story of these bonres and the communal self-governance
structures that arose from them, see Scott Campbell, “The Bonres
of Autonomy in Cherán,” in Deciding for Ourselves: The Promise of Direct
Democracy, ed. Cindy Milstein (Chico, CA: AK Press, 2020), 161–98.

Abya Yala [the Americas], it is not enough to list the self-
managed spaces, write down the names of communitarian
kitchens, and quote the words of the women cooking to
enumerate the fullness of collective actions.
We must go beyond the spotlight. We must gather ourselves
in the shadows to ensure that communitarian kitchens
come together through self-organization, self-care, and self-
management, and don’t get lost in welfare politics that try
to bureaucratize even food. May they not get lost in the
institutionalization that political parties seek. May they not
turn into banners for the compañera or compañero from the
struggle who transforms themselves into a candidate in order
to take power from above. May they continue to germinate as
seeds that bloom in soil fertilized by dignied rebellion and
the urgency of autonomy.
In a context where the powers from above have shown
us that no matter how libertarian they may be, they must
always comply with the regime of sacricing the people (it’s
enough to look into the mirror at Venezuela, Nicaragua,
Chile, and Bolivia), our res are crucial. In a context where
other pandemics such as hunger are looming, wars continue
to be the biggest business, extractivism continues to triumph,
patriarchy continues to turn the land into merchandise, the
communitarian kitchens are an emergent necessity to sustain
life and collective relations among peoples. This continues to
be demonstrated here and now by the Network of Community
Kitchens in Popayán. I invite us to immerse ourselves in the
obscurity that inhabits the ollas comunitarias when the lights of
the spectacle cease to shine on the sweaty faces and calloused
hands behind the steaming pots.

Growing up in a Balkan household, without the excess of
capitalist-driven consumption (in the 1990s at least), I (Aleh)
was used to collective ownership, hand-me-downs, knowing
aunties and uncles you could get in touch with if you wanted
to get this or that done, and sharing and taking care of the
resources you had because no one could aord replacements.
Later on, it was through Food Not Bombs that I really grew
to appreciate mutual aid networks and care for one another
in a deliberate way, though. Indeed, many of us in the North
London Food Not Bombs chapter embodied queer, femme,
and migrant identities. We were also looking for a community
where we could share our true selves with one another and put
our politics into practice, beyond waged labor relationships
and exploitation, beyond the imperialist and racist attitudes
of white English culture, beyond the alienation and forced
segregation of the rapidly gentrifying mega city of London.
We rst met in around 2010 in Colchester, a small town in
Essex in the United Kingdom, where we were both studying
at the time. Our rst conversation happened over a pot of
simmering stew that was later carried outdoors for a food
share. From there, we shared many conversations around
anarchism, mutual aid, feminist politics, and practice, and as
our friendship solidied and grew stronger, so did our politics.
We found that exploring our lives and organizing through an
anarcha-feminist lens told us a lot about our own experiences,
what we wanted our friendship to look like, and what we
wanted our community and political projects to reect. So a
couple years later, when we decided to establish a Food Not
Bombs chapter in London with a small group of friends, it
seemed natural and essential that the values that had guided

## SUPPORTING THE REVOLUTION   /   343

---

us and sustained our relationships would be at the core of any
initiative we cocreated.
Our rst-ever cooking session together was at the rst
AFem conference in London in 2014. We showed up sleep
deprived to the communal kitchen and cooked a giant pot of
warm food, which we then carried by hand to the anarcha-
feminist conference venue. We set up a simple table with our
pots in the center of a hallway, and a queue started forming
soon after. And we stayed there until every portion of food
had been served and we had a clear view of the bottom of the
pot again. As we shared food, we spoke to people who said
they hadn’t been able to aord to eat all day and this was their
rst warm meal in days. Having access to free, tasty food gave
them the energy they needed to take part in the discussions
and workshops. This experience really drove home the point
that we can’t separate our political selves from our bodies.
Since then, as the two longest-running members, we saw
our Food Not Bombs chapter shift across various London
neighborhoods between 2014 and 2021, but we also found
a place to call home: our collective. We did that on the solid
ground of those who came before us. In fact, one of our most
prized items was passed down to us through a person living in
Angel (an area of London) who got in touch to say that he’d
hung onto a sturdy old pot used by his now-defunct Food Not
Bombs. Could we please make use of it? It still had the group’s
initials in marker on the side and an old piece of string left on
one of the handles many eons ago.
For years we lugged that sixty-liter steel cooking pot around
on bicycles, in all sorts of baggage compartments, on public
transport, by hand, in pairs and fours, with hot stews fogging

## 344 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

people’s glasses as they waddled over to wherever we’d set up
our stall that time. This pot ended up feeding the neighbors,
feminists, migrants, houseless folks, people using drugs, sex
workers, families, students, and friends who would come to
our stall to share a hot meal, cup of tea, and whatever useful
items we’d scrounged that week—from menstrual pads to
sleeping bags, dog food or crates of veggies, or antimilitarist
and anticapitalist literature. To do that, we’d actively reach
out to neighborhood businesses for their leftover food, trek
with big backpacks at 5:00 a.m. to wholesale markets halfway
across the city, or in the early days when supermarket bins
weren’t behind big walls and lock and key, go dumpster
diving. All of this allowed us to consistently be at a corner
twice a month, including when we found our most permanent
spot, Seven Sisters station in the borough of Haringey, where
we shared food and know-your-rights literature at a joint stall
with the local group resisting immigration raids.
The planning, coordination, and physical labor required to
cook a meal for dozens of people was a humbling and beautiful
experience for all who took part. Often we started the day
exhausted after a long week of wage labor, but left energized
by the community spirit and commitment of everyone who
was able to take part. Caring for others felt like caring for
ourselves too. We’re told repeatedly that the answer to our
burnout or tiredness is to just rest and even withdraw from
organizing—which is of course sometimes necessary. But we
don’t acknowledge enough how solidarity, collective care, and
direct action can also provide us with essential ingredients to
boost our spirits and keep us going: hope, joy, togetherness,
support, friendship, and more.

We balanced many responsibilities, including full-time (or
more) jobs, with sustaining our chapter of Food Not Bombs.
As part of this work, we tried (sometimes denitely more
successfully than at other moments) to challenge capitalist
ways of working that push us beyond our limits so that we
can “achieve.” We did our best to be honest about our energy
in a world that forces us to separate ourselves from the needs
of our bodies, and we didn’t pressure ourselves to “push
through” if there wasn’t enough capacity to make something
happen. We supported each other in taking breaks as well
as in making sure the work was joyful, loving, and revolved
around connection and relationships with each other. For us,
it was crucial to maintain a space that felt nourishing in many
ways, not only physically, but emotionally.
The relationships we formed through our organizing were
a big part of what allowed us to sustain this group for so
long (to our knowledge, we’re the longest-running Food Not
Bombs chapter to have ever existed in London!). Centering
relationships also meant being clear about the types of
networks we wanted to build: reciprocal, horizontal, caring,
and supportive. We truly believe that our group survived
despite the odds because of the intentionality with which
we built up our political practice, aligning with feminist and
anarchist values that saw us resisting engrained hierarchies
and patriarchal organizing patterns, and how that manifested
in the way we looked out for each other.
Being in a public space as mostly women, femmes, and
queers, we unfortunately did face occasional sexism and
patronizing comments. When members were confronted
with sexual harassment at our stalls, we would intervene to

## 346 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

protect each other and make it clear that such behavior wasn’t
acceptable at our food shares. One time we dealt with a man
who seriously insisted that we serve him with our “lady hands,”
which we refused with humor, but not without frustration.
In another instance, once when we returned to one of our
kitchen spots in a local community center, we found that our
IWW poster, aimed at men and boys with the phrase “The
Revolution Begins in the Sink!,” had been defaced by a man
who seemed to have taken oense at it.
While we worked in a horizontal way through consensus,
we were aware that many groups without formal hierarchies
in practice end up reproducing informal power dynamics
that remain unacknowledged. Rather than pretending they
didn’t exist, we made time, when we could, to reect on and
acknowledge those dynamics among ourselves. Moreover, we
tried to gure out how we could pass on, instead of centralize,
knowledge and connections, better encourage others in our
group to take up space, and build a kitchen that felt welcoming
and inclusive, where questions were welcomed as well. This
happened through regular meetings along with informal and
annual strategy days where everyone could speak freely about
group dynamics and newer members could take ownership
of where we were heading as a collective. For a lot of us,
this type of open communication and space to challenge and
subvert hidden hierarchies within collectives had been sorely
missing in organizing spaces we’d been part of previously (and
even now). We’ve seen a lot of those other spaces fall apart
because there is resistance to centering this type of caring
accountability as an organizing practice.
Our Food Not Bombs experience left us with the conviction

## SUPPORTING THE REVOLUTION   /   347

---

that relationships and care labor are absolutely essential to
movements and organizing. Direct action and political
interventions aren’t just about marching down streets with the
black bloc, picketing racist and exploitative employers, and
puncturing police and immigration vans’ tires—and if that’s
what they look like, they can and should take place on a full
belly! In short, care (including food), which is so often devalued
and gendered, is in fact the invisible fuel that sustains us in
the struggle. Emphasizing only the most visible, frontline, or
confrontational forms of activism fails to acknowledge the
massive amounts of labor carried out every day that may
look quite dierent, but are still part of the glue that holds
us all together. It also creates a harmful standard, the socially
accepted gure of the “activist,” against which only able-
bodied folks and those who don’t face disproportionate risks
due to their immigration status, race, ethnicity, or gender
identity and expression can measure up to.
Over the years we swung ladles in the kitchen for and with
prison abolitionists, antiwar demonstrations, sex workers’
conferences, migrant rights groups, feminist meetings on
intimate partner violence, and many more. None of us were
professional cooks, except for the few times someone with
that background happened to join in. We tried to be both
pragmatic and creative, and gure out simple recipes based
on the various vegetables and staple foods we had available
at any given time. Sometimes, shut away in kitchens while
others labored on strategies and organizing techniques, we
worried about whether we would be perceived as reproducing
the same patriarchal, gendered dynamics that historically
and disproportionately put femme people there. Yet that was

## 348 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

quickly dispelled during shared chats and meals. Once, for
instance, we cooked in a community center for a collective
providing support to arrestees. We barely saw their faces the
whole time. Warm, nutritious food awaited them when they
took a break from what turned out to be a challenging and
complex discussion about their future work. They told us later
that being cooked for in this way throughout the day made
them feel cared for and supported so as to stay grounded and
wade through dicult conversations together.
Whenever we cooked for organizers, picket lines, protests,
and dierent collectives, we brought with us this understand-
ing: sharing food publicly, for free and to whomever shows up,
was an unexpectedly subversive act in a world where we are
always expected to earn a living and earn our survival, where
we have to prove we’re deserving of compassion and care,
or repent before being deemed worthy of basic necessities.
We actively challenged the few people who treated us like
a catering service and expected to be served and waited on
like they were in a restaurant. Based on our experiences, we
developed written guidelines setting out our ways of working,
including that we were not service providers. We made it
clear that we opposed classist, patronizing, and tokenistic
attitudes internalized by passersby who felt that the food we
shared should only have been given to “people in need” or
“the homeless.” We refused to engage in the capitalist power
dynamics of top-down humanitarian work that divides
people into service providers and service users. We practiced
solidarity, not charity.
This meant that we would not accept gatekeeping in our
cooking and food-sharing spaces. In a gentried, expensive

## SUPPORTING THE REVOLUTION   /   349

---

city where barely anyone can aord to own a home or car, or
have the room required to cook a big meal, we were always on
the lookout for the next kitchen and storage space we could
use as a base. Over the years we had many spots—kitchens
in our homes, homeless shelters, or community centers, with
pots and pans, grains and canned goods, stacked on each
other in our living rooms and people’s sheds.
Over those same years, we were also a political home for
many people—those just arriving in London would look us
up, and we hosted many visitors who joined us for a cooking
session while they were on the rainy island we called home
for a while. Whenever I (Fenya) would travel, I’d do the same:
look up the local Food Not Bombs chapter and join it for
a food-sharing session. From sharing food on the streets of
Tijuana, to distributing dozens of burritos from the trunk of
a car in Skid Row, to militant picnics during antiwar protests
in London, I immediately felt at home chopping veggies and
guring out how to support the revolution one stew at a time.

AN EXPERIMENT
IN ADDRESSING
I N T R A O R GA N I Z A T I O N A L
## VIOLENCE

|
## B E N J I H A RT

What would it actually take to end sexual violence in
grassroots social movements? How do we dismantle massive
and entrenched institutions while simultaneously confronting
the ways that we as individuals have internalized those
institutions’ harmful practices? If our movements are only
as strong as our communities, how do we build up both in
ways that are committed to ghting gender-based violence for
the long haul? How do we make concrete commitments to
collective care with the understanding that the apparatuses
of the state—including war and militarism—are themselves a
source of sexual violence and not the answer to it?
These were some of the key questions I asked alongside
a small group of organizers as we attempted to plot out the
policies and procedures around addressing sexual violence for
a new conguration, Dissenters. We did so with the intent
of imagining new structures to hold our movements—ones
created through a feminist anarchist lens—that centered the
needs of the most marginalized members of our communities
and made ghting sexual violence a high priority instead of
an afterthought.
A youth antiwar organization, Dissenters was launched in
2020 in Chicago, Illinois, only months before the COVID-19
lockdown and subsequent George Floyd uprisings. The
goal of the new formation was to reenergize Black and
Brown youth-led eorts to combat war proteers, weapons
manufacturers, and Western imperialism globally. It also
aspired to reclaim the antiwar movement from much of its
white liberal leadership and toothless calls for “peace,” which
often fail to connect US militarism abroad to its insidious
iterations in Black, Indigenous, and migrant communities in
the United States itself.

## AN EXPERIMENT   /   355

Dissenters’ cofounders worked diligently for months leading
up to the launch and remotely throughout the pandemic.
They tweaked the organization’s chapter-based model, which
looks to college campuses as an initial locus for antiwar
agitation, and dened its vision, core principles, and internal
structures, all with the aim of creating an organization
that could withstand attacks from the behemoth military-
industrial complex as well as the internal conicts that
regularly take our projects down from the inside.1 It was from
this latter place that the cofounders identied the dire need to
address sexual violence within the organization before it got
o the ground.
As one of the original members of the Safety through
Practice and Accountability (SPA) team—the internal mech-
anism meant to both build a culture of consent within
Dissenters from the beginning and provide resources and
support in anticipation of potential intraorganizational
violence—I joined a crew that included many people who
themselves are survivors of gender, partner, and sexual
violence within radical spaces. We had each been, if not
the direct recipients of harm, then witnesses to the ways
that interpersonal violence and its mismanagement can
destroy the relationships necessary to maintain movements
along with the communities that comprise them. The tired
responses of shielding individuals from accountability due
to their social importance, and treating the addressing of
sexual violence as secondary to “real” organizing, were
recurring attitudes that had undermined or even ended
previous eorts we’d been part of.

      1. For more information on Dissenters, see wearedissenters.org.

## 356 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

These experiences motivated our initial work with Dis-
senters’ SPA team—not merely wanting to avoid the pitfalls
that had wrecked other attempts, but understanding that
ending war is impossible without ending sexual violence. Any
antiwar eort led by youths, women, and trans and queer people
cannot separate militarism from the specic ways that war
relies on gender-based violence to target those same groups.
As individuals who belong to those identities, prioritizing
resistance to intercommunal harm in the antiwar movement
is also about centering our own protection in the struggle
to end state repression. Acknowledging the shortfalls of our
previous eorts—and our own imperfectness as organizers—
we wanted to shape new spaces where ghting sexual violence
and defending its targets was a core commitment, and where
sharpening our tools to do so was a collective practice.
As our inaugural contribution to Dissenters, we designed
a member handbook, or more of a zine, to be widely shared
throughout the organization. The handbook strived to
clearly outline the organization’s policies and best practices
surrounding consent and sexual violence, connect the work of
resisting gender-based violence back to the primary principles
of antiwar organizing, and recruit every member at every
level of the organization to commit to that work. Some key
themes emerged as we performed the complicated labor of
trying to imagine the very structures that we ourselves had
never actually seen, and that might have stopped previous
campaigns we’d been a part of from going o the rails.

## AN EXPERIMENT   /   357

## WE ARE ALL OF US AND NONE OF US EXPERTS

Even coming up with the name for our team took some trial
and error. We ultimately landed on Safety through Practice
and Accountability because we wanted to make two things
clear to the larger organization. For one, we are not experts,
because if any one individual had gured out how to end
sexual violence, our movements would have already eliminated
it. And second, we are not here to provide easy answers but
rather to oer resources, structures, and intentional spaces for
all members of the organization to practice exing their own
muscles in responding to sexual harm, and building chapters
where a commitment to ghting gender-based violence is
woven into every action and conversation.
Our aim here was to both set realistic expectations and
make our intentions explicit from the onset. When those
from marginalized identities experience violence in our own
spaces, there can be a deep disappointment layered on top of
the trauma, as we frequently arrived at those spaces because
we were eeing the violence of others—our families, our jobs,
our schools, and larger institutions. We can understandably
have higher expectations for how we will be treated in spaces
that are explicitly feminist, antiracist, and antiauthoritarian,
by their very nature promising us a vision of a better world.
When we experience the same harm there that we did in the
spaces we escaped, the feeling of betrayal can amplify the
pain of the harm itself.
What the handbook attempts to communicate is not, “You
will never experience harm here,” but instead, “If and when
harm likely does happen, here are the ways we are collectively

## 358 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

committing to responding to it.” We aren’t promising to have
answers or get it right every time; we’re promising to practice
together, give our best eorts, reect when we get it wrong,
and be accountable to one another in the process. The SPA
team is not a police force poised to punish those who break our
policies; it is a support system meant to infuse better practices
of accountability throughout the organization. To this end,
the handbook even includes a owchart that members can
follow to determine whether a conict or miscommunication
requires them to reach out to the SPA team, or if there are
already methods and resources at their disposal to help them
address it on their own.
We hope this honest framing will help to avoid future
letdowns and disillusionment, while demonstrating that we are
dedicated to thinking through our responses to gender-based
and sexual violence from the jump, not merely after violence
occurs. We also hope this will make explicit that while none
of us as individuals have all the answers, collectively we have
hundreds of experiences of preventing, resisting, and healing
from violence that are the true fodder to help us build out
new structures. We trust this will facilitate a shift away from
looking to a core of “experts” who must answer all of our
questions and solve our problems for us, to our movements
assuming collective responsibility for the ghting of gender-
based violence, to diving into the messy work and becoming
more expert as we experiment together.

## BOUNDARIES ARE NOT BORDERS

Dissenters coach Dylan Rodriguez, an author and scholar,
teaches us that “a boundary is not a border.”2 A theme we
noticed in organizing spaces—particularly those involving
youths—is that a commitment to tearing down oppressive
structures can sometimes unintentionally result in the erosion
of norms and expectations that are crucial to reinforcing
relationships of trust.
An example of this might be a group declaring, in a
genuine attempt to ght adultism, that adults and young
people are completely equal within the organization. While
this might seem just and even radical at the onset, it can often
lead to dynamics where the real social power that adults have
over youths is denied, making it easier for older members to
manipulate and pressure young people into unhealthy or even
violent relationship dynamics. Much like the insistence on
not “seeing” race, denying the existence of racism, ableism,
sexism, and other forms of systemic violence doesn’t make
them go away but rather frequently allows them to ourish.
As the SPA team, one of our guiding beliefs is that borders
control us, but boundaries protect us. Anarchist feminist
politics do not teach us to reject all structure. They invite us to
imagine structures that are shaped by and intended to protect
the autonomy of the most vulnerable versus the interests of
the most powerful.
To avoid these dynamics and embody these aspirations, we

came up with some hard-and-fast rules. The handbook makes
it specically clear that adult members of the organization are
prohibited from entering into romantic or sexual relationships
with Dissenters students. But it also attempts to stay dynamic
and grapple with gray areas; for instance, it doesn’t ban or
discourage any substance use but instead oers honest reec-
tions on the ways substances inherently complicate consent,
and tips for avoiding inappropriate behavior when altered.
There’s even a section with specic tools for communicating
boundaries and responding with reection in place of defen-
siveness when someone communicates a boundary to us.

DESTIGMATIZING THE OWNING OF HARM,
## WHILE NOT NORMALIZING HARM ITSELF

Another of our movement mentors, grassroots organizer and
author Mariame Kaba, reminds us that you cannot actually
hold anyone accountable.3 We set ourselves up for all types
of futile power struggles as well as deep heartbreak when we
enter the work of transformative justice with this expectation.
Within the handbook, we talked about how it is on each of
us as individuals to hold ourselves accountable when another
member of our collective comes to us and expresses we’ve
done something that hurt them. What the collective can do is
to help foster the conditions and create the containers within
which individuals who have caused harm—which will likely be
every one of us eventually—can willingly take responsibility
for the consequences of their actions.
We tried to oer a framework for this in our handbook,

with Mariame Kaba” (podcast), April 10, 2019.

## AN EXPERIMENT   /   361

starting with the notion that if we accept that sexual violence
is pervasive because we are all shaped by and participating in
various ways in a culture that allows its proliferation, then the
confrontation of gender-based violence requires that we all
change everyday aspects of how we interact with one another.
Many who have experienced violence in radical spaces can
attest that the initial harm is often only part of the damage
that caused them to walk away from organizations and
campaigns. It is equally the individual who caused the harm’s
inability to own what they did and acknowledge how hurtful
their actions were—or even that the harm happened. What
can hurt even more is the community leaping to defend harm
doers in ways that they were unwilling or unable to defend the
person who was exposed to the harm in the rst place.
So much of changing this internal culture is actually not
about promising perfect communities—something we make
sure not to do in the handbook. Even under the most ideal
conditions and with our best intentions, we will continue to
mess up, miscommunicate, and hurt each other. Rather, the
goal is to change the ways we respond when violence takes
place. If we want people to own their harmful behavior, we
have to be willing to create spaces for them to do so, and
not merely push them out of community when they make a
mistake. If we want others to believe in our capacity to change
our own behavior, to hold ourselves to account when we have
caused harm, we have to be willing to do the same for others.
This puts us in a tricky position, which we tried hard to
wrestle with in the handbook. On the one hand, we are
sincere when we say we want to end sexual violence in our
spaces. On the other hand, we can only achieve this if we

## 362 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

successfully foster a culture in which the knee-jerk reaction
of those accused of violence isn’t defensiveness and denial.
We are, in other words, charged with both destigmatizing
the act of coming forward and owning up to harm while not
trivializing the harm itself.
Acknowledging the ubiquitousness of gender-based vio-
lence means recognizing that it has nothing to do with “good”
and “bad” people, “perpetrators” and “victims.” It is about a
culture of violence in which we are all actively participating.
We must own our role in perpetuating cycles if we are serious
about stopping them. In doing so, we have to model taking
responsibility for harmful behavior, removing as much of the
fear of owning up to violence as possible, without falling into
the trap of minimizing the violence itself. This complicated
task is a gift to our future selves, as we should all expect to be
in the position of taking responsibility for hurt we’ve caused
at some point. It is about both refocusing on rooting out the
harm while alleviating the shame of taking responsibility for
that harm, reframing accountability as a form of healing as
much for the harm doer as the recipient.

## THE HEART OF THE EXPERIMENT

As members of the SPA team, we initially presented our
handbook and some of the philosophies and guidelines
outlined here at Dissenters’ rst in-person convening since
the start of the pandemic, the Tidal Wave Convergence in
September 2022, with over sixty member-leaders from across
our chapters and campaigns in attendance. The reception
was earnest, warm, and even exciting. Many of the students
and youths present expressed that they had never had

## AN EXPERIMENT   /   363

---

frank conversations about sexual violence in an organizing
space before, and were grateful for Dissenters’ intentional
acknowledgment of the subject and transparent approach to
its procedures.
We tried to stress the same thing to them that I hope to
emphasize here: this is an experiment. Like all experiments,
there’s a chance it won’t work. We should expect that some
of these policies and practices may result in real victories
in terms of changing our internal movement culture, while
others may fall at or even lead to the exact same dynamics
we set out to eliminate. It was great to get so much positive
feedback on a document that was years in the making,
especially on procedures that we ourselves spent months
critiquing, redrafting, and troubleshooting. Yet as much as
we have attempted to be proactive, our best planning may be
for naught when we are actually faced with real instances of
sexual violence within Dissenters—the likelihood of which has
been diminished due to the sheer newness of the organization
and the pandemic’s demand for remote organizing.
But even in uncertainty, we continue forward with one
nal core reection: more than any policy or procedure, it is
our social relationships that determine our sense of security.
Whereas the state tells us that it is strangers who mean us
harm, and police, militaries, prisons, and borders that will
protect us, we know that in actuality, both violence and safety
are much more likely to originate with those closest to us. It
is the nature of our relationships and the commitments we
actively foster therein that either maintain cultures of harm
or generate structures of safety.
Ultimately, this handbook and the team that created it

## 364 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

are meant to help the organization foster strong, interwoven
relationships predicated on ghting gender-based violence,
practicing stronger communication, respecting each other’s
boundaries, and recognizing and taking responsibility for harm
when it inevitably occurs, all while simultaneously training up
and supporting erce, eective antimilitarist campaigners and
organizers. Though it may be an experiment, we see it—like
the handbook itself—as more than a mere attempt at shifting
behavior. Our zine—and the practices it hopefully cultivates—
is a love letter to our people, our collective struggles, and a
world free from sexual violence that we believe is on its way.

## ABORTION

## BAY L A ( A K A BAY ) O S T R AC H

It’s July 22, 2002, in Eugene, Oregon. The busy trac owing
down the wide one-way stretch of West Eleventh Boulevard
near the University of Oregon campus was accustomed to
seeing protesters on the sidewalk outside the abortion clinic
on Wednesdays, but this crowd was dierent. Even the usual
antiabortion zealots arriving with their tired misogynist signs
were caught o guard when they found clinic employees
out front, picketing the clinic, rather than inside debrieng
patients who’d just walked past the Far-Right gauntlet.
Today, however, we were decrying the abrupt closure of the
city’s only independent abortion clinic, loss of our jobs as its
employees, and lack of notice to our patients, some of whom
had appointments that day.
Long home to an organization called the Federation of
Feminist Women’s Health Centers, Eugene had also hosted
one of the federation’s member clinics since 1991—an
explicitly feminist abortion clinic where lay health workers
were collectively charged with coordinating all care. We
made decisions largely by consensus, and treated the rotating
physicians as hired techs with no greater inherent power
or status than a front desk person or pregnancy options
counselor.1 Yet now this clinic had suddenly closed, just the
day before, with no advance warning to us—the workers—or
our patients. Along with a small cluster of loyal volunteers,
we’d been called into the area where sta meetings were held
and peremptorily advised the clinic was closing, eective
immediately; we were told to get our checks and turn in keys.

 1. Though the language used at the time was not inclusive, the self-
avowed feminist clinics that were part of the federation, including the
one mentioned here, were early sources of queer- and trans-friendly
health care in the 1980s and 1990s.

Stunned, we began asking obvious questions, “What about
the patients scheduled for tomorrow? One of them is almost
fteen weeks!” “What about the thirteen-year-old coming
from the coast? We just gured out her transportation!” “What
about the patient coming in for a follow-up because she’s
been bleeding for two weeks?” “Where are people supposed
to go now?” The uncomfortable administrator who’d been
sent to deal with us by our “sister” clinic in Portland, where
leadership had become increasingly corporate, couldn’t
or wouldn’t answer our queries, including the biggest one:
“Why?”
In indignant shock, we scrambled to grab everything we
could on our way out. Someone saved a binder of Federation
of Feminist Women’s Health Clinics archival news clippings,
someone else grabbed sta and volunteer phone numbers,
and another person had the presence of mind to photocopy
the schedule for the rest of the week—with patients’ names
and phone numbers. Others thought to stash folders into their
bags with key protocols for patient care. And some gathered
sentimental mementos such as pieces of art given to us by past
patients or keepsakes from our desks. Decades of hard-won
feminist health care wisdom and knowledge was collectively
salvaged in our harried exit.
Instinctively, we headed to our oce-away-from-the-clinic,
a nearby brewery with picnic tables where we frequently
went to decompress after a long clinic day. This time, our
lengthy day was just beginning. Without saying much, we
pulled out clunky cell phones, and started to go down the sta
and volunteer list, calling the few friends and coworkers who
hadn’t been there with us to be red in person. A half hour or

## 370 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

so later, one of us had the sudden thought, “Does X know?!”
Our medical director—the person legally responsible for the
quality of care and physical well-being of our patients—and
also, as it happened, the county medical director, was away
on vacation and so had not been present at the meeting. We
scanned the contact list for her cell phone number. I called her.
The torrent of surprised expletives was audible to everyone
at the table on that sunny patio. Somehow that made the
magnitude of what was happening even greater: the feminist
abortion clinic administration, a hundred miles or so up the
freeway, had shut down the only independent abortion clinic
between Northern California and Portland and terminated
all of its sta without consulting the medical director.
Truth be told, at the time we had been organizing a union.
All the Eugene clinic sta had signed union cards, but we
had yet to le them with the National Labor Relations Board,
much to my chagrin. We gured this was why we were red.
Yet closing the clinic, thereby risking the health of current
patients and access to abortion for the entire region, seemed
a drastic tactic. In fact, we later learned the then executive
director had been embezzling funds from payroll tax
deductions and feared our union election would bring this
to light. But given this assumption at the time, the next step
seemed obvious: we’d picket.
From Tuesday afternoon to the next morning—Wednesday,
normally a busy abortion clinic day with patients scheduled
every thirty minutes from 7:45 a.m. to 3:30 or 4:00 p.m.—
we reached out to every sympathetic soul we could think of
along with every friendly news outlet, every local feminist
entity, local progressives, and even the then mayor, a known

## COLLECTIVELY FUNDING ABORTION   /   371

---

supporter of abortion. We ran to a copy shop to get large card
stock and then went to someone’s basement to letter picket
signs. We negotiated our messaging and talked about our
goals, seeking to reach consensus. Obviously, we wanted to
force the clinic to reopen, but were we simply asking for our
jobs back, or did we want to take over the Eugene clinic? Did
we want to separate from the Portland administration and run
it ourselves? Big discussions were in the air.
In that rst twelve hours, we coalesced into a collective;
(now ex) clinic workers, volunteers, and former sta who
rushed to be at our sides all organically mobilized together
with shared purpose. Sure, righteous indignation was a
powerful uniting force, and we were angry on behalf of
ourselves and each other as we looked up how to apply for
unemployment, called our union organizers, and spoke of
contacting a lawyer. Yet the majority of our pooled energy
revolved around people in need of abortions and other
care. (The clinic had also oered gynecologic care, testing
for pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, options
counseling, contraceptives, naturopathy appointments, and
even sliding-scale community acupuncture.)
We became laser-focused on people in rural southern
Oregon, on the South Coast, from Northern California, in the
high desert as well as small, economically depressed former
mill towns, working at ski resorts and rodeos, or in casinos and
oce buildings—all the pregnant people in all the situations
we’d seen over the seven years the clinic had been open. How
many of them, often already driving two, three, or four hours
to reach us, could drive the two additional hours to Portland?
How many of them could take another day or two o work?

## 372 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

Get additional childcare? Find someone to loan them a
working vehicle for that much longer or pay for that much
more gas money? For many of us workers and volunteers
who’d just been abruptly cut o from the clinic, these weren’t
abstract questions; many of us had rst walked in as patients,
then later volunteered, and then become an employee. I will
always remember one person in particular because I gave
her the results of her pregnancy test on my birthday one
year, assisted with her abortion, took her volunteer
application when she handed it in soon after, and the day
the clinic was shut down, was learning to do ultrasounds
alongside her as a coworker.
We were enraged that our clinic had been pulled out
from under us, but equally from our community, the region,
and all the pregnant people who relied on it. So when
rush-hour trac steadily streamed by us that next morning,
and the befuddled antiabortion protesters showed up to nd
us in their usual spot, what motorists and demonstrators alike
saw was a united collective of experienced feminist activists
ready to do whatever it took to ensure abortion access—clinic
or no clinic.
We didn’t stop at that morning’s picket line. Facing
the glaring gap in safe, high-quality abortion services for
pregnant people from Northern California to Portland,
our crew of suddenly disenfranchised clinic employees and
volunteers continued to mobilize. First we explored what it
would take to compel the clinic to reopen, including through
an unemployment or wrongful termination suit against the
administrators. We talked with a labor lawyer about whether
the fact that our signed union cards predated when we

## COLLECTIVELY FUNDING ABORTION   /   373

---

were red would carry any weight with the Labor Relations
Board. We had grand notions of running a reopened clinic
ourselves as a collective. But we quickly encountered a
sobering set of barriers to this aspiration, not the least of
which was that the Eugene clinic was only one location within
a larger 501(c)(3) organization based in Portland. Crucially,
it wasn’t clear the Eugene clinic could generate enough
revenue to stay open as a stand-alone site—so we pivoted to
the idea of forming a grassroots abortion referral network
and fund. Each of these discussions operated based on a
model of consent and consensus, with everyone taking turns
facilitating meetings, each person having a chance to speak
and share their thoughts, and all decisions reecting a process
of respectful, collective cocreation.
At now-regular meetings in various former coworkers’
homes, gatherings in backyards and basements, or on porches,
we shared stories of what we’d routinely seen as the greatest
needs among our patients and their support people when our
clinic was open. Then we collectively identied what folks in
most of Oregon and Northern California would immediately
need now that our site was closed:

- Guidance on which other clinics oered safe,
high-quality care, up to what gestations, at what
cost, and over how many days
- Access to existing nancing for transportation,
lodging, childcare, and the cost of abortion
procedures
- New sources of funding now that many people
would have to travel farther and likely go to clinics
that cost more than had our feminist one

## 374 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

We knew that among us, with our combined years of
experience in the recently closed clinic and others, we already
had a lot of this information or knew where to nd it—and
we were ready to take on the challenge of creating a new
abortion fund for pregnant people in Oregon. Or so we
thought anyway.
While we did not explicitly discuss, to my memory, a
guiding political principle on which to found our sexual and
reproductive health organization along with the referral
network and fund that it would administer (other than fem-
inism and what would now be called reproductive justice),
the ethos and practical processes we used followed the
fundamental anarchist feminist ethics of collective care
and informed consent. Having ourselves lost not only a key
means of income but also social connection, we channeled
our frustration as well as our concern for those who
would have been our patients into an unprecedented mutual
aid project in the region: the Network for Reproductive
Options (NRO).
At the time that the NRO and larger organizing eort that
enabled it began, those of us involved explicitly envisioned
and understood it as a nonhierarchical collective that facil-
itated practical access to safe, high-quality abortion care for
and with those in need. Though few involved in the creation
of the fund may have called themselves anarchists at the
time, we were all committed to ideals of consensus, informed
consent, feminist solidarity, and collective support for each
other and the people we sought to support with referrals
and funding. There were frequent, long, and late meetings
lled with interminable discussions about decision-making

## COLLECTIVELY FUNDING ABORTION   /   375

---

processes. Not everyone on that rst picket line stayed engaged
through the rst year of the formal organization. Yet our goal
remained steadfast, as did our process: collective care via
grassroots abortion funding and referrals, made possible by
grassroots feminist organizing to replace what was taken from
us and our community.
In the early years (to be honest, for about ten years), this
practically speaking looked like a shared cell phone (a ip
phone!) that served as the referral hotline, a binder with
contact information for clinics in Portland that someone in
the NRO could personally vouch for, hard-copy contact sheets
for recording our callers’ info, and a shared backpack that
held all of this and could be handed o weekly among us—
all now volunteers, though eventually the NRO had a budget
and funding enough to hire paid sta. Fundraising happened
through a combination of impressive major donor and grant-
writing work by indomitable middle-aged cis women who
remembered life before Roe as well as the experiences of
their friends and loved ones (or themselves) who’d obtained
underground abortions, and creative community events.
But everyone involved discussed and agreed on what we
considered deal breakers: our hard lines around funders
we’d never accept money from (for example, traditional
reproductive health and contraception funding sources with
histories or principles uncomfortably close to eugenics).
The NRO certainly was not—and still is not—the only
grassroots abortion referral and funding organization to
operate on principles of collective decision-making and col-
lective care. According to comrades still working in the eld,
the Frontera Fund (Texas) and the Richmond Reproductive

## 376 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

Freedom Project (Virginia), for instance, also operate as
collectives. Yet the project has continued for nearly twenty
years, with the original referral line and fund recently
merging with a similar organization in Washington to result
in what is now the largest independent abortion fund in the
United States: the Northwest Abortion Access Fund, based
in the Pacic Northwest, but serving people coming to the
West Coast for abortions from all over the United States.
And over that time, it has remained committed to respectful,
collaborative, shared decision-making with informed consent
and reproductive justice at the heart of the work.

While those who trust in states and politicians call for
legislative measures to protect reproductive freedom, a net-
work of organizations in Europe has taken a more direct
approach, eectively demonstrating feminist anarchist ethics
by creating an infrastructure of communal care. Like its name
makes clear, Abortion without Borders stretches across nation-
state lines, bringing together the Abortion Dream Team and
Kobiety W Sieci (Women on the Web) in Poland, Ciocia Basia
in Germany, the Abortion Network Amsterdam and Women
Help Women in the Netherlands, and the Abortion Support
Network in the United Kingdom.1
Asia, an anarchist activist from Poland who relocated to
Amsterdam to work with Women Help Women, recalls how
these groups met in 2017 on the initiative of one person from
the United Kingdom who saw that they were all doing similar
work, but separately, and suggested they join forces. “The
idea was to gure out ways to get later abortions, especially
for people living in places where there was no easy access to
abortion services, and spread information,” says Asia.
Poland is at the heart of that eort, given that its abortion
laws are among the strictest in Europe. A now-famous phone
number connects people seeking abortions to the Abortion
without Borders’ helpline. The helpline is staed by Kobiety
W Sieci, which counsels callers on their options and connects
them with other groups in the network according to their

needs. If someone in Poland wants to travel abroad to
terminate a pregnancy, for instance, counselors refer them to
Ciocia Basia, a queer feminist grassroots collective in Berlin
dedicated to building structures of support for people coming
to that city for abortion access. Or those who prefer to opt for
a pharmacological abortion at home can order the necessary
pills from Women Help Women’s global telehealth service.
Abortion law has a complicated history in this traditionally
Roman Catholic country. With the fall of Communism in
the early 1990s, the church began to push for new legislation
to restrict abortion access. Since 1932, the procedure had
been legal in cases of rape and threats to maternal health,
with a 1956 law expanding legal justications for abortion
to include “dicult living conditions.” The newly elected
non-Communist government passed legislation in 1993 that
disqualied social and nancial factors as a justication,
leaving rape or incest, threats to maternal health, and fetal
impairment as the only cases in which abortion was legal. In
April 2016, Polish antiabortion organizations proposed a bill
to ban the procedure in all cases except where the pregnant
person’s life was in danger, and the following September, the
Sejm (one of the houses of Poland’s Parliament) passed the
bill. But the next month, after tens of thousands of people
raged against the proposed legislation in decentralized
demonstrations collectively known as the “Czarny Protest”
(Black Protest) in cities across Poland, the other house of the
Polish Parliament voted to reject the law.
On October 22, 2020, however, the Constitutional Tri-
bunal eectively banned abortion almost entirely, ruling
that terminating a pregnancy because of fetal defect was

## 382 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

unconstitutional. This sparked mass demonstrations in which
over four hundred thousand people took to the streets to
protest the decision and the ruling right-wing Law and Justice
Party. According to an ocial tally from the Ministry of
Health, 1,074 out of the 1,110 legal abortions performed in
Poland the year before the ruling were obtained due to fetal
impairment or life-threatening disease. Yet the number of
legal terminations oers little indication of how many Polish
people terminate a pregnancy in any given year. Tens of
thousands do so annually by ordering abortion pills through
the mail or traveling outside the country to undergo procedural
abortions in clinics.
Because of the obstacles to obtaining the procedure legally,
people in Poland have largely defaulted to these options even
in cases where they have a legally recognized right to have an
abortion. For example, to terminate a pregnancy that is the
result of a crime, a pregnant person needs a certied letter
from a public prosecutor conrming that they were raped.
Such bureaucratic obstacles can make it impossible to access
abortion services before one is twelve-weeks pregnant, after
which abortion is prohibited under any circumstances.
The collectives participating in the Abortion without
Borders network noticed an immediate increase in interest
in the services they provide following the October 2020
ruling. “We could absolutely feel the impact of the decision,”
notes Asia. “This was really devastating, on the one hand,
but on the other hand, it also brought incredible amounts of
solidarity and grassroots organizing, and organizing that went
beyond the grassroots. … It really aected the whole society.
Also, there were huge demonstrations and protests that were,

## ABORTION WITHOUT BORDERS   /   383

---

I would say, counterproductive to what is the hope of people
in power in Poland.”
“Every attempt by the right-wing and conservative Polish
government (and the antichoice organizations and hierarchs
of the Catholic Church supporting it) was followed by a social
upsurge, which translated into increased activity by feminist
and anarchist circles, but also by people who had never done
anything activist before,” recalls Adrianna of the Abortion
Dream Team.
“The struggle denitely strengthened the feminist move-
ment in Poland and beyond,” says one member of Ciocia
Basia. That wave of demos, they add, “was the rst encounter
with feminist demands for some, and a kind of resurrection
for others,” and provided “an eye-opening momentum for
people not connected to feminism in any way.”
Adrianna notes that the 2016 protests against the proposed
abortion ban were what inspired her to focus on bodily
autonomy. She comes from a small town in Poland where
she says the word abortion was never uttered in her family. “I
didn’t know such a thing existed until my early twenties, and
then I think I was really against abortion,” she says. “Then,
step by step, becoming a feminist, I had to deal with this
abortion issue. I realized it was about having control over
your body. It really was a long journey from being a person
who was against abortion to being a person who is totally,
100 percent proabortion right now.” Adrianna explains that
the 2016 demonstrations “brought together a great many
communities, especially feminist and queer with anarchist”
ones too. At the time, however, the actions of feminist queer
groups were “harshly judged” by anarchist circles. “According

## 384 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

to some, the actions from this period were only supercial,
hardly revolutionary, and the potential of the Black Protest
was not used as ‘something stronger’ that could lead to further
change. In any case, it took several years to see how strong
the community really was.” She says the role of the Abortion
Dream Team, which increased its visibility and activities after
2016, was invaluable here. “The collective has become a
reference point for many activists, but also one of the most
important sources of knowledge and inspiration in Poland.”
Today, Adrianna is part of a group of twelve people who
support the Abortion Dream Team by answering questions
on social media from people seeking abortions. “In Poland,
because of this abortion stigma, it’s very important to just
spread the news,” she asserts, “to let people know they will
not be punished for taking abortion pills or going outside the
country to get a procedural abortion.”
The Abortion Dream Team’s mission is to change the
narrative on abortion, destigmatizing and dispelling myths
about the procedure while spreading information about self-
managed abortion, which involves terminating a pregnancy
with the medicines mifepristone and misoprostol and does
not require medical supervision. “The abortion pills give
you power,” remarks Adrianna. People can contact the
team, via email, Facebook Messenger, or Instagram. First,
volunteers inquire if the person has taken a test to be sure
they are pregnant, and arm that they want an abortion
and need pills. Abortion Dream Team volunteers then
instruct them on how to order abortion pills from Women
Help Women in the Netherlands and share the link to that
organization’s order form.

Rather than purchasing these pills, the person ordering
them makes a donation of seventy-ve euros (about eighty
US dollars), although they can give more if they’re able. “If
you don’t have the money, as many people under eighteen
who write us don’t, we can ask the organization to waive the
donation,” Adrianna says, adding that “for people in Poland,
it’s a steep amount of money. Many of the women already
have kids and can’t aord to donate.” The pills, which take a
maximum of twenty days to arrive, are discreetly packaged,
with only the recipient’s name and address, as they travel
across the border. The Abortion Dream Team provides
instructions via email and social media regarding how to
take them, and volunteers are available to advise and answer
questions throughout the process. The person taking the pills
can also call the Abortion without Borders helpline to receive
support from the Kobiety W Sieci team.
The Abortion Dream Team stays in touch after the
pharmacological abortion is over too. “Usually, people want
to go to the doctor to make sure everything is OK,” explains
Adrianna. “But the vagina is such a great organ that it will
clear itself without even checking.” She says people often write
to the team afterward to thank it and express how happy they
are. “The stigma of abortion is such a big thing in Poland,
they usually cannot tell even their partners or friends. So I
think the most important role we have is that we are giving
the support. We are with you, you are not alone, and this is
your decision. This is a good decision.”
Activists in the Abortion without Borders network agree
that the rst thing that changed in the wake of Poland’s near-
total abortion ban was that an atmosphere of fear gripped

## 386 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

doctors, nurses, and patients. Asia of Women Help Women
observes that the most heartbreaking eect is that many
people taking abortion pills are concerned they might not
get adequate medical support in the event of complications,
and that doctors might treat them as if they’ve committed a
crime. Since the ban took eect in January 2021, at least three
women have died of sepsis in Polish hospitals as a result of
doctors refusing to perform a lifesaving abortion or caesarean
section. “Someone who is taking abortion pills is not breaking
the law,” Asia says, “but doctors don’t know it.”
Coming from Poland’s anarchist punk scene and queer
feminist movement, Asia moved to Amsterdam to work with
Women Help Women because of the limitations on what kind
of support she could provide to those seeking abortions in
Poland due to the legal restrictions. Women Help Women is
a formal organization located in dierent areas around the
world, but “we are not a huge organization,” Asia explains.
“We focus on the countries where there is not access to
safe abortion services.” Women Help Women also operates
along a horizontal organizational culture, which Asia points
out requires “constant conversation” about what it means
to organize nonhierarchically. And “we try to change the
narrative and promote a supportive, nonjudgmental, nor-
malizing-of-abortion approach,” she says.
All the collectives in the network share the goal of not only
decriminalizing but also demedicalizing abortion. “Abortion
pills are something that you can do on your own. You can
decide when you want to have this abortion, how to do it,”
Adrianna underscores, noting that sadly, “like every area of
life,” people’s decision-making power is frequently “taken by
politicians or men in power.”

## ABORTION WITHOUT BORDERS   /   387

“For me, this is actually the feminist revolution,” says Asia.
She explains that the idea of the procedure as something
ethically controversial and prohibitively complicated is a
construct that has nothing to do with reality. “It’s not really
about safety because the safety of it is proven. It’s about control
and keeping this atmosphere of dependency of people.”
In Germany, one of the countries where Abortion without
Borders helps people from Poland to access abortion services,
the procedure is controlled by the state. While it is illegal to
terminate a pregnancy in Germany, the law makes exceptions
for medically necessary abortions and cases where the
pregnancy is the result of rape. It also does not prosecute
abortions in the rst trimester, as long as people rst submit
to mandatory counseling with a state-licensed social worker
(which laws require to be biased toward dissuading the person
from having an abortion), followed by a compulsory three-
day waiting period. Abortions in Germany can be surgical or
pharmacological, but must always be performed in a clinic;
one cannot simply order the pills and take them at home.
Ciocia Basia, the collective that supports people from
Poland who choose to obtain abortions in Berlin, has always
been small, informal, and self-organized, according to
one member. It was initiated in 2015 by two people, one
German and one Polish, who wanted to help bring people
who were seeking abortions from Poland to the neighboring
countries. The organizers started to make connections and
formed their rst partnership with a clinic that had aordable
fees. After they began to receive phone calls from people in
Poland seeking assistance, they decided to name the collective
Ciocia Basia, which means “Auntie Basia” in Polish. Basia is

## 388 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

a common name in Poland, so people can save the group’s
number on their phones without raising suspicion.
People in Poland seeking an abortion sometimes nd Ciocia
Basia through an article or interview in the course of searching
for resources, or else through prochoice groups in Poland
that distribute propaganda in the streets and media. One
collective member reports that they try to be visible, going to
demonstrations in Poland to pass out stickers and yers. Every
week, two members take regular shifts answering the phone
number and email account via which people contact them.
Once a person reaches out, members help them to decide
whether coming to Germany for the procedure is an option.
Ordering pills for a pharmaceutical abortion costs less money,
so if this seems like a better route for the person, members
refer them to the website for Women Help Women and stay
involved in case they have questions.
Because Ciocia Basia strongly values self-determination,
it is important that the pregnant person decide whether
the abortion will be pharmacological or surgical, regardless
of the practicalities for them or the group members. “We
try not to put people with less or no money in the position
where something is being decided for them only because
their nancial situation forces them to use our help,” one
member says.
The collective works with a network of people living in
Berlin who host those coming to the city for an abortion.
Collective members meet people at the train station and
transport them to the place they will be staying, and from
there to the clinic. According to one member, the activists
don’t host people themselves because it is too draining to

## ABORTION WITHOUT BORDERS   /   389

---

be doing the logistical work as well. When someone needs
a place to stay, members of the collective email a pool of
volunteers to see who can host, explaining how many people
will be coming and how many nights they need to stay, and
hosts write back to answer whether they have room available.
In some cases, Ciocia Basia pays for a hostel or simply directs
people to hostels. The group also partners with volunteer
translators to support those who don’t speak German.
“We work as a grassroots collective with consensus deci-
sion-making process, task rotation, and some conict resolu-
tion procedures,” a member explains. “We have no formal
hierarchy, and constantly try to notice and address the informal
ones.” The funding the group receives from local individual
supporters covers all the costs of procedures, including
transportation, allowing them to be nancially independent.
“In Berlin, people love organizing parties to raise funds and
often approach us saying they want to do that for us, so we
don’t have to organize it by ourselves,” they say. “This work
requires having money, having access to money. You need
many people so you don’t get burned out. This is emotional
work.” Ciocia Basia practices collective care internally as well
as externally. This manifests in bimonthly online meetings
where “we try to check the workload, share the dicult
moments. We also use chat in between the meetings. Taking a
break is a common practice.”
While a person still cannot be prosecuted for having
an abortion in Poland, anyone who supports someone in
obtaining one can, and the authorities appear to be sending a
message to those who would do so. In November 2021, Abor-
tion Dream Team cofounder Justyna Wydrzyńska became

## 390 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

the rst activist in Europe to face criminal charges for aiding
an abortion. Justyna, who has been supporting people seeking
abortions for fteen years, sent a packet of abortion pills
she had kept for her personal use to a woman who said her
abusive partner was preventing her from leaving Poland to get
the procedure. After the woman’s partner found the package
of pills and reported her and Justyna to the police, Justyna
was arrested and faced up to three years in prison. The
next year and a half saw the Abortion Dream Team, wider
abortion rights movement, and human rights organizations
such as Amnesty International rally behind her, afraid of the
dangerous precedent a conviction in her case would set. On
March 14, 2023, the Warsaw court convicted Justyna and
sentenced her to thirty hours of community service a month
for eight months, sparking outrage worldwide. Justyna’s
lawyers plan to appeal the verdict, while she and the Abortion
Dream Team remain determined to continue their work to
destigmatize abortion.
Despite these new developments and their ominous eects,
proabortion activists in Poland remain encouraged by many
people’s response to the ban. “For me, what was really
beautiful and mind-blowing was the solidarity organizing that
happened after the court ruling,” remarks Asia, “and people
who started to declare that they did have abortions, they are
willing to support others, they know how to do it. I feel like
we need more and more of this, because it has such a power
of destigmatizing the procedure itself and changing that
narrative around it.”
Adrianna maintains that creating networks is critical to
this struggle. “I think in groups, we have power. You are not

## ABORTION WITHOUT BORDERS   /   391

---

ghting alone. Even for me as an activist, I feel safer and that
I have more possibilities when I’m in this network.”
As these collectives continue to spread feminist anarchist
ideals in the most powerful way possible—by demonstrating
their eectiveness through action—members hope more and
more people will take up the revolutionary work of meeting
each other’s needs directly. “I’m really impressed and grateful
for the grassroots organizing that is happening around this
topic, and I would love this to be spreading,” says Asia.
“Everyone can do it. It’s so easy. All the information is there
on the internet. Everyone can support someone with an
unwanted pregnancy and how to terminate it. I really hope
that people are going to take this opportunity to build more
support networks for each other.”
Regardless of what happens on the legislative front, the
groups that comprise Abortion without Borders remain
determined to continue their direct action. “The next step
has to come soon; it is about the law change,” notes a Ciocia
Basia member. “The resources that the movement has or
needs, however, will be still utilized—supporting people in
late pregnancies, nancial help, providing the information,
educating, etc. We will not disappear from one day to another.
And some of us will still have to face the repression. In this
patriarchal, racist, and capitalistic society, you have to rest
and recharge regularly, but you can’t quit the resistance
structures.”

The lie is that centralized, state solutions are easy, ecient,
and better in terms of supplying people with what they
need. In truth, bureaucracy just keeps the messiness out of
the spotlight—until you try to get something done. Then,
alongside the direct violence of the state, one experiences
death by a million paper cuts while trying to get insurance
coverage, food stamps, unemployment, or name changes, or
death by the abandonment of already unreliable resources.
This is increasingly clear right now, as the state ups its attacks
on bodily autonomy, using policies and courts to eviscerate
trans-arming care and abortion access.
As anarchists, in contrast, the way we do things—bottom
up, not top down—is about living: how we choose to relate
to each other, how we choose love and relationships over
individualized endeavor and competition, how we choose to
care even when that means working in the cracks and gray
areas. Such “care work” is often done by feminized people,
and as feminist organizers have long pointed out, frequently
neglected, made invisible, or not seen as the real work of
movements. Yet it is—and always has been—a crucial form of
direct action, just as militant and risky as confronting police,
fascists, and other coercive infrastructure in the streets.
In the current context, such direct action looks like informal
networks of trans communities that get people hormones and
take them to clinics, or regional abortion funds and doula
collectives that get people abortions either at home or in a
clinic. It’s not merely direct action because these groups typically
operate within the gray areas of the law, and not simply
because the work is in confrontation with the current arms
of the state trying to end bodily autonomy for trans people

## TR ANSITION AND AUTONOMY   /   397

and pregnant people—though these are both good reasons
to name it as such. Even more, this care work is direct action
because it’s operating outside the structures of the state in a
pregurative manner, outside the feelings of scarcity that the
state imposes and anarchists themselves frequently reproduce.
Partially in response to the attack on access to trans-
arming care, then, and the general diculty and expense
of getting hormones through institutional medical channels,
various groups across the so-called United States are making
their own estrogen, whether topical, injectable, or oral.
This isn’t necessarily new. There’s a history within trans
communities of sharing hormones given that people’s ability
to procure them can be inconsistent based on insurance and
nances. Currently, Boobs Not Bombs is one name given to
decentralized networks of mutual aid groups making and
distributing estrogen. And the Northeastern Fairy Wings
chapter and other regional groups have recently written zines
containing recipes for making your own estrogen at home,
including options for sourcing the materials.
Estrogen is not a controlled substance, and so this DIY
hormone process is ostensibly legal.1 But with the generally
hostile atmosphere toward trans people as well as the
propensity of both the state and medical-industrial complex
to get involved in regulating access and thus making it harder
for people to care for themselves, the groups have deemed
it best to call as little attention to themselves as possible—
even as they attempt to form open points of access for any

    1. Testosterone, on the other hand, is a controlled substance and
therefore making it is illegal. It’s possible that people are doing this,
though, or nding black market testosterone.

trans person to have hormones. Groups are able to distribute
six- to ten-month individual supplies at house shows, radical
bookfairs and bookstores, community spaces, and more, along
with pertinent information for making and taking hormones.
Using decentralized groups to make and distribute
hormones helps respond to the general unevenness of access
and attack state by state, since people in states with easier
access and more room to maneuver can connect with groups
in more oppressive states, thereby bypassing the restrictions.
This model is replicable wherever people are, and so it’s
possible to keep multiplying the locations where hormones
can be handed out, even in surprising places. That said, one
organizer with Fairy Wings worries that “the distribution of
DIY hormones could get stuck in subcultural spaces, like
trans/anarchist/punk communities, which can leave out
younger people in more highly surveilled family situations or
states where access to care has been criminalized.”
Still, even the possibility of DIY hormones can completely
alter our understanding of transition. If hormones can be
freely acquired outside the medical-industrial complex, then
anyone can transition based on their own desires. This promise
can help lessen the stigma around transition, which relies
on pseudoscientic misinformation to back it up. Common
discourse treats transition like an irreversible and potentially
dangerous decision, even though in practice, people often go
on and o hormones for various reasons. With groups like
Boobs Not Bombs, someone could get a vial, tube, or bottle
of estrogen, try it out, and gure out if it’s what they want.
Boobs Not Bombs follows the informed consent model, which
is how precious few clinics that provide trans health care also

work. Rather than needing a diagnosis, the person getting
hormones is given information about potential risks and
allowed to make their own decision. The Fairy Wings chapter
includes links to further information about the best practices
of taking estrogen in its zine, with extensive documentation
for dierent questions. One of the members mentioned that
trans patients and trans researchers usually know more than
many medical gatekeepers about the science behind hormone
therapy, and frequently have to educate their doctors about
not only surgery and hormones but all aspects of their
lives and bodies as well. Many doctors fall prey to the same
misinformation and bad science that besets the general public.
This misinformation within the medical-industrial complex is
tied to prot too, and so doesn’t produce good studies on trans
care, whether because of a lack of interest/protability or
simply transphobia.
Like with abortion, transition has been individualized and
privatized. The medicalized version of transition, which has
become dominant, was developed to make it harder for people
to do so in order to protect the liability of doctors against
patients’ potential regrets. It involves a person rst nding a
doctor who is willing to provide gender-arming care such as
hormones and surgeries. And even if one nds such a doctor,
there are more obstacles to overcome in terms of proving to
the caregiver that one is really trans (something there is no test
for). This “proof ” could be through diagnosis by a mental
health professional, and used to involve the “real-life test” of
living as your desired gender for a certain amount of time
before being able to access hormones or surgery. Historically,
people weren’t only judged based on their tting the diagnosis

## 400 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

of transsexual as a medical and mental condition; they were
often judged based on their willingness to participate in the
reproduction of cisheterosexual norms in terms of how they
dressed, whom they dated, and so on.
Just to say it again, because it bears repeating with dierent
emphasis: with DIY hormones, anyone can transition when-
ever they want. This means you can experiment. It means
you can stop. It means transition can become multiple, plural,
and deindividualized. Not only can you access hormones
in community with other trans people—something we have
always done—but you can nd more people and networks
to run your questions by, and there’s now more room to
experiment. The groups are mainly oriented toward helping
people nd ways to replicate the production process on their
own. Groups are also organizing communal shot-taking
events, partially in response to the fear that some people have
of injections and the need for support in administering them.
Shots of testosterone and estrogen can be taken as part of ritual
and celebration. And of course, this goes for other methods
of receiving exogenous hormones too. When trans existence
is under such extensive threat, these collective moments of
transition are in themselves a direct action against the world
that wants to erase us.
Though Fairy Wings specically focuses on increasing
access to free DIY estrogen, one member of the group
with experience organizing community care thinks the
model has wider implications: “We can collectively and
intentionally think about what ways we actually need to rely
on the medical system and what ways we don’t, and solving
as many problems as we can outside that. What contributes

## TR ANSITION AND AUTONOMY   /   401

---

to people’s health is mostly not doctors” but instead lling
needs for housing, food, and freedom of movement, not to
mention the relative health of air and water. Just as anarchist
biohacking groups like the Four Thieves Vinegar Collective
are spreading free mifepristone (a drug taken orally to
induce abortion) and instructions on how to make it, there
are collectives making insulin. A Fairy Wings member asks,
“What if we had the ten most commonly used drugs readily
available in a community pharmacy? This could reduce our
reliance on state institutions, and remove points of contact
with these institutions for people criminalized through race,
gender, sexuality, citizenship, participation in sex work, and
so on.” Additionally, readily accessible medicines help us nd
communal care outside the privatized, isolated arrangements
of normative families and couples.
Of course, we aren’t currently in the position to do away
with the medical system itself. Many people rely on complex
medications embedded in present-day supply chains; others
depend on medical equipment that is hard to manufacture.
But it’s simply a colonialist, ableist, scarcity, and antifeminist
mentality that limits our revolutionary horizons from
imagining ways to provide care to all who need it. Too much
of the time, when we collectively envision liberated futures,
disabled, trans, and chronically ill people are left behind, or
erased altogether from the picture. In providing abortions,
transition, and other medicines, collective care projects show
us that we can take matters into our own hands. We can also
imagine recruiting more scientists and doctors to help share
knowledge and resources, and divert top-down institutional
power toward increasing and disseminating access. Ultimately,

## 402 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

as one comrade suggests, “we can dare to take over the
hospitals and form people’s clinics.” And we’ll need people
who can help run them.
When it comes to abortion care, community clinics are
something that abolitionist and abortion doula Ash Williams
is thinking about. In the wake of the Dobbs decision that
overturned Roe v. Wade, he has not wavered in his commitment
to help anyone who wants an abortion to get one regardless of
where it has to be done due to criminalization or how much
it costs. While he acknowledges that “we need to ght to keep
the existing clinics open,” Ash asks, “What will it look like
outside the clinic? … I keep returning to the idea that the
clinic isn’t the best place for people to have an abortion.” As
Ash underscores, just as for trans care, the clinics are limited
in what they perceive as medically relevant and therefore
narrowly dene best practices. Add to that the way that
antiabortion and transphobic policies attack providers at the
point of their liability, and so as to avoid punishment, many
clinics overcompensate by limiting care. But even worse, the
state in many cases has recruited providers, doctors, and
nurses to inform on people who have abortions and/or access
transition care. In fact, Ash contends that this threat might be
one of the biggest dangers for people living in criminalizing
states, over and beyond the actual police.
According to Ash, we can imagine and practice “models
for access to care not governed by what the state says is legal
or possible or medically relevant.” We can create community
abortion and transition clinics (if we want to continue using
that word) that honor the autonomy and self-determination
of the people seeking care, believing that people might be

## TR ANSITION AND AUTONOMY   /   403

---

in the best position to decide for themselves what care they
want. On the negative side, we’re in a situation where, as Ash
notes, “the state is failing to provide care,” and even more
so, we’re seeing the “criminalization of the care that is being
oered”—from criminalizing the act of doing an abortion
and the support for those abortions, to criminalizing mutual
aid eorts or the act of simply giving people free food or
money in public, to criminalizing people trying to defend the
earth, such as in the Stop Cop City movement in the Atlanta
forest. So Ash warns that we need “to be mindful and skilled
with the support that we give” so that we aren’t merely giving
care but instead oering “care and safety.”
As Black feminist reproductive justice organizers tell us, Roe
was never enough, and within a few years the Hyde Amend-
ment limited federal resources for abortion, eectively making
it inaccessible to all but the wealthy, thus disproportionately
aecting Black women and other women of color. Roe was
decided on the grounds of privacy, not bodily autonomy or
collective care. This individualization of the issue helped spell
its downfall. Similarly, the access to professional medical care
for trans people was dictated by the doctors who deigned to
treat trans people as an individualized matter, with signicant
trials and obstacles put up to make sure that only a few people
could access hormones or surgery (and limit liability for any
hypothetical regrets people would have after transition).
Both in the struggle for reproductive autonomy and trans
care, there is an unwritten and continuous legacy of
organizing that occurs out of the spotlight. The most well-
known historical examples might be the Jane Collective, an
underground network of women in Chicago from 1969 to

## 404 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

1973 that performed over ten thousand abortions during
that time, and the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries,
a short-lived group formed by Sylvia Rivera and Marsha
P. Johnson that worked toward the survival of young trans
street kids of color and sex workers, particularly by forming
the STAR House, a communal living space. These two (trans)
feminist action groups emerged during the height of the
liberation movements of the long 1960s, and along with the
decline and repression of those movements, the visibility of
radical experiments faded in the neoliberal blur of draining
state resources, increased policing and incarceration, and a
worsening daily grind of mere survival. These are the times
we live in now, surrounded by constant reminders that climate
catastrophe is here, not in some near future. Many of us today
look at these earlier groups with admiration and perhaps even
envy that they were able to pull o such powerful actions.
When the major talking points around issues like abortion
or hormones and surgery now focus on individual access,
we can easily overlook the communal impact of the assaults
on bodily autonomy: the isolation, fear, and mistrust that
arises, and loss of comrades from burnout, despair, or worse.
One major dierence between us organizers today and the
collectives of the 1960s and 1970s is the further atomization
of communities in general, along with a heightened sense
of scarcity for survival. But the relative lack of attention
on communal forms of underground organizing has also
allowed groups to work, and with good success, in the cracks.
Abortion funds and doula collectives raise money, give people
rides to clinics—even across state lines—distribute medical
abortions, and provide the emotional support that pregnant

## TR ANSITION AND AUTONOMY   /   405

---

people need when considering terminating a pregnancy.
Trans groups raise money for surgeries and basic daily needs,
make and distribute or share hormones, get people to their
appointments, support trans people who are incarcerated,
and create new rituals together.
Working in the cracks often draws criticism for supposedly
further enabling the neoliberal withdrawal of resources.
And indeed, sometimes the state doesn’t criminalize mutual
aid but rather commends it for helping people in areas
where the state has clearly failed. Yet the mutual aid direct
action groups providing abortions and hormones are doing
something beyond lling the gaps and enabling the system to
continue on its pathway toward megadestruction. They crack
open the professionalization and medicalization of care,
including abortion and transition, and aid us in glimpsing
a reorganization of what care might look like—oering a
transfeminist and anarchistic alternative.
Boobs Not Bombs, Fairy Wings, abortion doula collectives,
and other “gray area” projects, alongside all else they do,
contribute to expanding our sense of care beyond these
immediate criminalized eorts, making sure that we include
disabled people, chronically ill people, youths and children,
parents, incarcerated people, unhoused people, sex workers,
and more—people who currently have to organize their own
alternatives to the dominant forms of care. In this wisdom
are the seeds for growing better networks. We can use the
patchwork of the state as we need right now, while organizing
for a takeover through decentralized groups that prioritize the
people receiving care in determining their own needs through
mutualistic direct action.

The most beautiful thing I ever saw does not, to my knowledge,
have any photographic record. It was early in the morning,
some weekday in mid-July 2018. It was an hour before my
shift doing data entry in a big oce building in Center City,
Philadelphia, giving me time to check in with the OccupyICE
encampment outside City Hall. When I arrived that morn-
ing, however, I didn’t nd the mess of police barricades,
improvised kitchen equipment, propaganda and handwritten
signs, plastic totes, and trash bags as well as bedding arranged
underneath the massive, dumpstered billboards we used as
canopy.
Instead, I saw a forest.
The night before, the city had done some landscaping
around City Hall, and the activists who were occupying full
time had gathered branches and other refuse, then lovingly
arranged them on, inside, and across the city’s trac bollards
and barricades, in and through the tents, poles, and tables.
Early morning sunlight diused through the fog rising from
the concrete after a light summer rain. Though it was already
after 7:00 a.m., the camp was slumbering peacefully as I
entered this suddenly ethereal, unfamiliar space.
In the shadow of the enormous monument to state power
that is Philadelphia City Hall, under a jerry-rigged awning

Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Donald Trump, and wasn’t
ready to give up the public pretense to #resistance, so he
had agreed that if we didn’t block sidewalk trac, the police
wouldn’t interfere with our encampment. Until the eviction,
he broke this promise exactly once: that morning. The cops
forced the encampment to take down the forest. The sight of
liberation terries the police.
The upsurge of movement, solidarity, and organizing
across the 2010s accelerated in anxiety and urgency under
Trump. The George Floyd Rebellion looms large over the
entire decade, but even the airport shutdowns, antifascist
militancy, Indigenous resistance, mutual aid, org building, and
prison struggles of those years overshadow the OccupyICE
movement.
The movement—in which activists encircled and built street
occupations around urban ICE headquarters in an attempt
to shut down that distinctly American gestapo—appeared in
over a dozen cities, yet even its longest-running incarnations
were over within a few months of their appearance. The
tactic of tent-based occupations seemed to emerge out of the
past, as both its promises and limits had been thoroughly met
in the “Movement of the Squares” cycle of 2011–14, and
policing and state agencies had a good idea of how to counter
this movement style.
But the movement is more than just a footnote in a decade
of struggle, at least here in Philadelphia. OccupyICE not
only won a major concession from the city—the end of the
information-sharing agreement between city bureaucracies
and ICE known as PARS; it also forged a community of
unhoused organizers and housing advocates that would go on

## 412 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

to seed a number of future movements in the city. And trans
women—both housed and unhoused—played the crucial role
in keeping OccupyICE going.
After weeks of planning, a coalition of radical groups in
Philadelphia held a rally outside City Hall on July 2, 2018.
Hundreds showed up, marching to ICE oces at Eighth
and Cherry Streets, where an occupation was spontaneously
set up. At rst protesters barricaded the streets around the
building, but the organizers, who seemed surprised by the
success of the demonstration, negotiated with the police to
take down the blockade and remain on the sidewalk. This
moment, in which activists in high-visibility vests were seen
dismantling the barricades at the cops’ demand—and an
altercation between the “ocial” organizers and anarchists
frustrated by their action—was a sign of things to come.
Still, the space was held, and an occupation with tents and
umbrellas was established, blocking ICE.
The days that followed were marked by intense heat, police
violence, eviction attempts, and increasingly hostile sectarian
conict, both between anarchists and socialists (anarchists
were physically ejected from the camp by socialists because
they refused to take o their masks and then published a
pamphlet calling the socialist organizers wannabe cops) as
well as within the encampment, where democratic processes
were never initiated and power devolved upward to the
“experienced” organizers.
When, on July 5, police came in swinging clubs, making
arrests, and destroying what was left of the encampment
infrastructure, the movement’s energy seemed spent, and
there was little ght left to rebuild.

## MOVEMENT MIDWIFERY   /   413

That might have been the end of it, except that a group of
autonomous activists had constructed the beginnings of a new
encampment ten blocks away, on the sidewalk outside City
Hall. This new encampment featured no high-vis vests and
few of the organizers of the original demo. Many of the initial
organizers were burned out, and while they continued to have
meetings (and fundraise for themselves!) around OccupyICE,
they were basically absent from this second camp.
Instead, a steady trickle of folks, housed and unhoused,
started to gather daily and build out this new encampment.
The organizers of this new encampment were majority Black
and unhoused, and a surprisingly high percentage of the
activists, housed and unhoused, white and Black, were trans
femmes and nonbinary people.
The City Hall encampment never reached the numbers
or resources of the previous one, and I wasted much of my
own time trying to get the originating orgs to see that the
movement continued, going to endless meetings in their
spaces, oering good faith encouragements, and attempting
to develop relationships—all to no avail. These orgs only
came back to the camp in force once, on the day that Mayor
Kenney announced the end of PARS—for a photo op. I
would nd out months later that the entire time, the initial
organizers were talking shit in Facebook groups and Signal
threads, and cravenly continuing to accept donations raised
on the backs of the activism of Black unhoused trans folks. So
much for today’s would-be Lenins.
On the ground, though, over the span of a couple of
weeks, the encampment went through a slow but steady
transformation from the kind of chaotic, service-oriented

structure that would be familiar to people who’ve worked in
nonprot-type movement eorts, into an intensely politicized
space of immigrant solidarity and resistance. Many young
and idealistic organizers, well-intentioned yet unconsciously
bringing these nonprot models of activism, couldn’t deal with
the concentrated “drama” of drug use, explosive conicts,
mental health crises, criminal proximities, and dicult
personalities, and dropped out. But sticking through it all, a
handful of organizers, mostly trans femmes and nonbinary
folks, did the unseen and uncelebrated work of weaving a
community out of a group of angry and dispossessed people.
A trans woman bottom-lined the kitchen, streamlining
both donation acceptance and meal prep with the help of
an unhoused person in their twenties who would go on to
transition herself after her experience in the movement,
which she cited as inspiring her to do so. Another trans
woman, only recently housed and personally familiar with
many of the folks living at the camp, acted as a de facto
conict moderator and de-escalator. A third girl, with the
help of other activists, lled a table with propaganda, and
encouraged a focus on political language and messaging to
passersby in this central downtown location—a task joyfully
taken up by a few unhoused folks, one elder woman in
particular, who spent hours on a megaphone and quickly
became a lead organizer in the group. A nonbinary organizer
began holding and facilitating meetings in the camp, while
two other nonbinary folks took regular dumpster diving trips
for materials to expand the physical infrastructure.

disadvantaged, and oppressed folks turned into a ghting
force, the encampment at City Hall would not have survived.
Instead, within two weeks, it had become a space from which
direct actions—including street-taking marches, antifascist
interventions, and support marches for other activist groups
working in the city—emerged “spontaneously.” And the
movement grew strong enough to force the mayor’s hand,
compelling him to acquiesce to the demand that the city end its
data sharing with ICE. In 2020, organizers who met through
OccupyICE would found the unhoused encampments that
would capture signicant numbers of houses and resources
from the Philadelphia Housing Association, and help change
the face of housing politics in the city—encampments that
were once again disproportionately supported and organized
by trans folks.
This exhausting and thankless reproductive labor is one
of the core concerns of feminist theory and action. But in
spaces of the multiply marginalized and dispossessed, trans
and gender-nonconforming folks’ capacity to “stay with the
trouble,” as feminist scholar Donna Haraway puts it, often
facilitates the completion of this labor.1 This capacity is
frequently hard-won through the experience of transness,
both internally and socially.
To hold onto a truth that bosses, families, and friends
want to question or reject, that doctors and the state want to
medicalize and control, a truth that goes against your own
intense internalized distrust, ignorance, misinformation, and
transphobia, and to still come out and be your fabulous self

requires an ability to ght through a great thicket of contra-
dictory and confusing needs and desires. To hold your pre- and
posttransition experiences as your own personal experiences, to
be able to code switch, pass, or stealth as survival and personal
circumstances require, to have a clear vision of gendered
experiences and expectations that are entirely invisible to the
vast majority of cis people, who likely as not treat you like
you’re paranoid or crazy for recognizing them, in fact to be
blamed both within queer and activist communities as well as
the greater world for the existence of these contradictions—
this is the psychic burden of transphobia and gender on us.
And while this horric psychic violence is a travesty that our
struggle aims to abolish, it also gives many of us a wisdom,
persistence, strength, and power of insight that although it
came at much too great a cost, can be used to help others
go through the confusing and dicult processes of personal
change, growth, and transformation. The trans person knows,
better than anyone, that we can only act from where we stand,
that what we say, do, and know to be true can shape the world
around us, but only if we get our hands dirty in the messy
facts of everyday life.
Trans people are thus particularly attuned to holding
space for people’s pain, exhaustion, contradictory tendencies,
and even reactionary views; not giving up on struggles or
movements because they fail to emerge fully formed and
perfect; hanging onto a truth in the face of repression,
disagreement, and incongruities; and ghting for that truth
while bringing others alongside them in the ght. Trans
anarchic feminism takes the ocuts, prunings, and refuse of
this world, and makes a beautiful forest for our ourishing,
pleasure, rest, and joy.

At the moment of this writing, in 2023, trans people
are organizing hormone exchanges, DIY medical support,
abortion access, and logistical networks to get trans folks
out of US states and cities dominated by transphobic
policies. But these practices have long existed in our
communities, here and elsewhere; they’ve simply become
more urgent, more visible, and more organized. And while
these movements and groups may be easier to name as “trans
feminism,” trans women have been at the center of all the
movements of the last decade, quietly practicing the world-
building that will abolish this terrible nightmare we nd
ourselves in. That world will be built bric-a-brac from the
products of this one, through a movement that recognizes
the possibilities inherent in all of us, and promises, slowly,
carefully, but fearlessly, to bring out such beauty that the
police, bootlickers, patriarchs, and fascists will run, terried,
from our irresistibly radiant freedom.

A NEW ANARCHA GROUP
## IN LJUBLJANA

## ČR N E M AČK E

How to write a collective reection in a place without electricity during
a time when we’d run out of wood for our heater and our car-battery-
powered lights were constantly, slowly dying out.

## HOW IT STARTED

In 2020, some parts of the antiauthoritarian movement in
slovenia (re-, re-, re)recognized the need to create space to
address feminist issues more thoroughly.1 At the time, the
clerofascist government had taken power after the previous
prime minister resigned just as the COVID epidemic was
declared in our territory. Dierent groups and individuals
(anarchists, communists, various antigentrication fronts, and
the two ljubljana squats in existence then) came together at an
assembly to form an anticapitalist bloc and call for a broader
mobilization to join in protests every Friday. Through these
mobilizations, we, the anticapitalists, saw the opportunity to
focus on issues that extended further but also correlated with
the rise of fascism around us. We addressed deadly neoliberal
politics, the ineectiveness of the state’s health care system,
the ever-so-aggravated and volatile impending ecological ar-
mageddon, and the rise of wars and conicts around the globe.
At this same assembly, people decided that the anticap-
italist bloc should write and release a statement about the
antiabortion situation in poland, and a working group was
created to carry out the task. We don’t remember if it was a
coincidence (probably it wasn’t), but the group that formed
was all female. After the statement was written, our working

group felt the urge to meet more often among ourselves. So
we circled up to reect on feminist topics together as well
as oer each other emotional support as women involved in
anarchist struggles. We sat together drinking tea and talking
about everything from our broader organizing eorts along
with our own need for separate actions and involvement, but
also highly personal issues relating to relationship trauma,
sexual harassment, reproductive health with an emphasis on
our distrust of the gynecology eld, and our witchy self-help
tricks and tips.
Soon we recognized the need to take our discussion circle
to the level of organized activism. We quickly engaged in
our rst action, from which our rst “solo” statement arose,
and decided to sign it as “črne mačke” (black cats). Almost
immediately, though, some of our comrades confronted us,
asking what it meant that we’d signed this statement as a
group. Some people oered arguments against us being able to
call ourselves a name that appeared to be a collective because
we were as they called us “a newly formed initiative.” Most
of the mansplaining about what the dierences of a group,
collective, and initiative are came from our male comrades.
We felt like it was an attempt to discourage us from forming
something we believed was going to last. We retaliated: we
decided to keep the name and not be forced to explain the
status of our newly formed coalition of anarcha-feminists
looking for our own space to be able to organize.
We kept exploring issues that we felt were not being
addressed through the broader mobilization, which we
are all still very much a part of to this day. We dedicated
banner drops, statements, protests, and demonstrations to

## 422 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

the issues of rape, sexual harassment, femicides, the church,
and antiabortion movements, but also to struggles against the
elites, gentrication, wars, apartheid, and border regimes.
We continued to concentrate on anticapitalist and antistatist
eorts, yet through the lens of ghting patriarchy, which we
see as the basis of our oppression.

## SPACE

In the beginning, črne mačke gathered on the second oor of
the Autonomous Factory Rog in a small space that had been
occupied and renovated by one of our members, who made it
into a cozy hideout for witches and herbalists. On the rooftop
of this squat, she’d set up a small garden and always provided
self-picked teas for our meetings.
At 7:00 a.m. on January 19, 2021, in the midst of a cold
winter and during the peak of the second wave of the COVID
pandemic, the municipality of ljubljana along with support of
the police decided to violently evict the Autonomous Factory
Rog. The loss of this huge factory space meant that a lot of
groups now found themselves displaced in the city. New self-
organized spaces seemed impossible to establish given that
the police and security guards were controlling every step of
those who did not obey the government’s COVID restrictions,
which were mostly just a pretext for imposing authoritarian
policies rather than protecting the populace. This hostile
environment prevented us from gathering and traveling. After
the eviction, the city authority and private property owners
even began to control and protect abandoned buildings from
potential squatters.
All over the region, squats had already started disappearing

## HOW WE PERSISTED   /   423

---

in the years prior to the demolition of Rog, and specically
in ljubljana, which in recent years became a tourist hub.
The city has been transformed by tourism. Prots became
priority number one. Prices of living spaces went up, and
the city center switched from focusing on the needs of its
inhabitants to catering to tourists. Alternative venues that
oered entertainment for visitors got municipal support, and
of course many of those spaces eventually went mainstream
in order to survive. The lack of autonomous space became a
big problem, not just for us, but the wider community as well.
For a while, then, we didn’t have a stable organizing place,
until some comrades from an anarchist collective oered to
let us share their space. Coexisting in what felt like the only
radical spot left in gentried ljubljana was not always easy,
and led to multiple conicts and tensions. We were extremely
grateful for the existence of that place, and still are, but soon
we realized that we needed to open a new squat. It took a
while. At the time, we were still dealing with the aftermath of
the Rog eviction and trying to cultivate good relations with
our new hosts/roommates while ghting for our own space in
what frequently felt like a manarchist place.

## MAČJAK

A year and a half after losing our beloved Autonomous Factory
Rog, we changed the locks on an empty building, now known
as mačjak. Mačjak oered us an opportunity to learn how
to build a space from the ground up on our own terms and
liberate ourselves from the previous arrangements. Opening
a squat allowed us to become more autonomous, have space
to think collectively, apply tactics we’d already developed, and
establish new ones to solve problems we identied within the
system and our movement.
Occupying mačjak changed a lot for us. It gave us inde-
pendence from the collective that we shared the previous
space with. It supplied us with new condence to organize
exactly how we wanted to, without the need for or feeling
like we had to explain ourselves to anyone. It gave us a fresh
perspective on power dynamics, putting us in the position of
having a space and deciding whom to invite to organize in it.
This not only inuenced our relationships on the outside but
also on the inside, within us. Since opening mačjak, we still
struggle with the distribution of the care work that has to be
put into the space and our collective. As a previously more
or less street-oriented collective, we sometimes feel impatient
and stuck when most of our energy is used for maintaining
a place, sometimes leaving little capacity for outside actions.
One of the important questions related to mačjak was
the notion of safe space—safe for whom, and from whom.
Collectively we never felt comfortable with understanding
safety on the basis of identity. Our struggle against patriarchy,
which has always been at the core of our organizing, and later
on “moving away” from the “oh so united anarchist movement

## HOW WE PERSISTED   /   425

---

against all forms of oppression” that sometimes couldn’t
recognize (and reect on) its own sexist patterns, was read as
a separatist move. So we decided to claim separatism as one
of our strategies. We decided to dene mačjak as an anarcha-
queer space based on zero tolerance for sexism, machismo,
racism, xenophobia, and any other forms of discriminatory
tendencies. The basis of organizing in mačjak is therefore in
political anity, not some essentialist identity.

## HOW TO ORGANIZE

In the two years since we formed, our collective has gone
through numerous changes in ideology and group dynamics,
which sometimes we’ve tackled well and sometimes less
eectively. As a feminist group, we are “experts” in self-care
and excellent reproductive workers, yet we keep failing when
trying to put these ideas into practice.
Looking at already established anarchist and feminist
groups in our geographies, we felt that the rst didn’t
recognize the importance of antisexist work, and the latter
adopted neoliberal approaches in their ght against (gender)
oppression. That’s why we decided at rst to forge our own
organizing path based on our own values, wants, and capac-
ities, and not focus too much on how to connect with other
groups from the start.
Yet when there were fractures within our collective, and
especially after we lost a number of members, we decided
not to aim at expanding, even though we keep returning to
this question at dierent points in our organizing. As a small
group, it’s easier to address conicts and nd common ground.
Trust can be built and tended to more easily. We seek to nd

## 426 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

ideological consensus between ourselves while concentrating
on what it means in terms of our social relations with each
other to stick together as a working collective, including so we
can always also reach out for support when the time comes or
when we want to organize more broadly.
So far, we’ve managed to point out many structures and
behaviors we don’t want to reproduce among ourselves and
our movements. We’ve noticed that even in radical circles,
especially at assemblies, people are “forced” to develop
patriarchal patterns to be accepted and respected. Having
to be loud and articulate to be heard and taken seriously
are some of those attitudes that we want to question. Being
patient with people who can’t form their opinions quickly,
encouraging those who do not speak often, and leaving space
are some of the strategies we want to further develop. We
aim to recognize and dismantle informal hierarchies, not
be competitive with each other, to actively listen, and to be
able to take critique as a sign of growth. Many times, we’ve
noticed that certain ideas are not questioned at all, since the
person bringing them up has an already established position
within the movement. If questioning occurred, it was some-
times taken personally or even defensively, and instead of
providing arguments for the idea, the person would defend
their own ego, not wrestle generatively together with ways of
how to move forward. We decided to take a stance against
individualism because we feel that a person’s political prestige
has no place in collective organizing. So we’re experimenting
with new forms of collectivity, because the established ways
of doing things and perspectives within our circles sometimes
have to be questioned in order to reveal new ways of thinking
and praxis suited to the times and challenges we face.

## HOW WE PERSISTED   /   427

## FEMINISTS ON DUTY

When engaged in organizing beyond our collective in var-
ious struggles, we’ve often felt like the “feminists on duty.”
When there was an issue connected to abortion or rape, for
instance, it was assigned to us; when addressing war, it was
not assumed that we would even be interested. We recognize,
however, that war and its repercussions have an inherently
feminist dimension. Macho traits like pride in connection
to patriotism, physical strength, and its association with
weapons, competition, and binarism are all features that drive
people to start wars or join armies in the rst place. We see it
as necessary to talk about “nonconventional” weapons used
during wars, such as rape. On the practical side, there is a
need to maintain spaces where people who desert and ee can
nd shelter; there is much care work to be done for people
who’ve experienced war and the violence connected to it, not
to mention dealing with rape victims.
While we see broader societal issues such as war through the
lens of patriarchy, we also look at “typicial” feminist themes
through the lens of other hierarchical systems. For example,
access to abortion in slovenia cannot be seen as just an
individualist, liberal issue of “my body, my choice.” The right
to abortion is (for now) guaranteed, with some exceptions that
can be tied to a range of capitalist and nationalist rationales.
Even though abortion is considered basic health care in
slovenia, people who do not have the right papers that the
state imposes can’t access it freely. Meaning that lots of people
on the move or those who are seeking asylum are excluded,
and even with the “correct” citizenship, abortion and health

## 428 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

care aren’t as self-evident to access as it might seem. Lately,
too, nding a personal doctor is like looking for a needle in a
haystack—especially for younger adults. To be able to abort,
you must have a personal gynecologist or otherwise you need
to pay for it (and not such a small amount for most of us).

## WE HAVE TO STAY OPEN

From our beginnings onward, we’ve questioned the women-
only constellation and romanticized the idea of being viewed
as a queer collective, even though we as collective members
are generally read as heteronormative women by those who do
not know us personally. One of the reasons why we opted for
the queer label was also not to push away potential members
who didn’t identify as women. Yet this turned out to be not
only an ideological struggle but a generational one too. We’ve
been inuenced in our thinking and organizing by dierent
streams of oppressed peoples’ movements—from our sisters
organizing for women’s rights in the balkan region, to our
western comrades experimenting with living together in
squats and housing projects, and from historical revolutionary
movements to the more recent ones. Our older members have
taken more inspiration from Indigenous women’s struggles on
other continents, while our younger ones relate more to the
queer movements here in europe. We’ve all drawn inspiration
from the Rojava women’s autonomous organizing, and thus
have embraced the need for women-only and all-oppressed-
genders or FLINTA (female, lesbian, intersex, trans, and
agender) groups, believing that they can coexist in parallel
with mixed-group organizing, while also supporting men-only
congurations within our movement.

## HOW WE PERSISTED   /   429

---

We’ve tried and continue to strive for ways to establish
a broader feminist platform that would involve as many
people as possible in addressing social issues through a
feminist lens. Should that be a general meeting, gathering,
or communication channel? We’re still not sure. For a while,
we were involved in intergenerational feminist meetings,
and after that we tried to have an open feminist gathering
by inviting our friends, colleagues, and other people close to
us who might be interested in feminist organizing. We also
invited those who hadn’t organized before. The outcomes
of our eorts were always a bit dierent than planned, but
still, a wider platform for organizing on feminist issues has
formed, and there’s now another active feminist collective
here in ljubljana.
We are aware that oppressed groups of people frequently
need to rst establish space on their own to empower
themselves and be able to organize without their oppressors,
including as preparation to act as a stable group within a
larger movement. But it is still an open question for us: how to
develop and sustain our politics while creating a collaborative
space for all oppressed persons. At this point in our growth
process, we’re involved with a FLINTA initiative that centers
mainly on issues related to feminism, and we host a critical
masculinity group. We host meetings and assemblies that are
mixed in an attempt to connect our separate struggles and
establish a mutual support system in our little city.
Through the process of writing this short reection, a lot
has changed for us.
We were confronted by our younger comrades about what
they feel are generational hierarchies based on experience. We

## 430 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

---

were challenged about various aspects of being gatekeepers
of a space we tried to make and keep open for our sisters.
We struggled with dynamics within our own collective and
in connection with other collectives. We fought our declining
mental health—some of us together, and others on their own.
We traveled and met people, and hosted groups and
individuals here in our space that inspired us. We organized
assemblies, protests, and direct actions on dierent topics. We
failed to nd the time and energy to keep new initiatives and
projects going, and neglected care work. We started and quit
jobs, nished our studies and started studying other topics,
started new relationships and ended old ones. We made
mistakes and tried to x them. We left projects that frustrated
us and moved away from struggles that overwhelmed us. We
connected with groups that fell apart. We lost contacts, saw
networks dying and could not nd the energy to maintain
them, and yet also formed new connections.
We felt excited. We got tired and burned out. We got
arrested. We put ourselves and others in danger. We were
sometimes depressed, and at other times manic. We were
happy, and in other moments, disappointed. We hosted
parties and concerts. We felt alive. We felt like our organizing
was pointless. We hosted a big international event. We opened
a new squat for our comrades from dierent territories and
found space to connect again. We gave and felt love. We saw
the point again. We reected. We retaliated.
We persisted.

To Danuta, Tess, and all of you standing face-to-face with
fascists, cops, or other violent men and not backing down.
To all of those who still carry the new world in their hearts.

To whoever has read this far.
I hope this letter nds you well.
I am writing to you in the desire that you will share a moment
of cheerful nostalgia with me. When the times are dicult, to
say the least, I sometimes try to get ahold of what put us on
this path in the rst place and why. It helps me feel closer to
the things that make my heart beat a bit faster. It helps me
feel closeness to you. Perhaps you remember the feeling that
we shared when going to the rst demonstration after a spring
of quarantining and worrying about COVID-19, expecting a
crowd of three hundred, but being greeted by three thousand.
The feeling of something ice cold slowly melting. Like when
I think back on the memory of Riikka stealing the hat of an
infamous racist You Tuber and then tripping when running
away, yet nevertheless making it to safety, it still evokes a
whole range of emotions in me. A little fear, and a lot of joy
and laughter. There is so much to be done. A lot has already
happened.
I have some confessions to make. I am secretly impressed
by the determination of the schoolgirl who sat alone in front
of the Parliament to protest climate change until she wasn’t
alone anymore, and hundreds of thousands of kids and
teenagers all around the world joined her. I love all the kids
who got inspired, especially the ve-year-olds in Tampere,
carrying picket signs of animals facing extinction, depicting
animals the same size as them. I love each and every one
of you!
I adore the grandmas and grandpas who were among the
rst to climb the riot fence in Göteborg in 2017, after which
almost ten thousand people followed their lead and blocked

the route of the Nazi march. I still feel touched when I see
the pictures from that day, just as I feel moved every time
I watch the dierent “Un violador en tu camino” videos
from many continents after the Chilean feminist collective
Las Tesis created this song and dance, and it spread around
the globe along with its nal line, “The rapist is you!” With
these street performance-protests, you really managed to
show the world that when it comes to patriarchy, no one is
innocent, and everyone should take the time to analyze their
own behavior as well as the institutions around them and then
act accordingly. And I get a warm feeling thinking of Nelli
throwing the ripe tomato—with the prociency of someone
who has done nothing but throw tomatoes all of her life—that
hit the Nazi leader on the head at the perfect second in front
of a big crowd in Turku.
To this day, I can still recall the words of the Johannesburg
Fees Must Fall activist who even when behind bars, said that
the future looks so bright, he needs sunglasses. That attitude
is something one needs in order to nd the courage of the
fteen or so women who protested in front of a march of sixty
thousand nationalists and fascists in Poland. I hope to one
day gather enough faith and reckless abandon to follow their
example, if the situation comes to that.
Love from Helsinki to Hong Kong to the persons who rst
tried to put out a tear gas grenade with a trac cone, and
all the others who continued tirelessly after that; you will go
down in history. Love to the kids bloc in Malmö, the mom
bloc in Portland, and all the tractor blocs ever.
Loukanikos, you wild riot dog, you took everything to a
new level on the streets of Greece and put a big smile on

our faces worldwide. May you rest in power! I wish a lot of
smelly sausages, betting your nickname, for you wherever
you are! We will make sure that the memory of you outlasts
the companies making the tear gas that weakened your
lungs. Loldiers of Odin, you wild clowns, you managed
to put an even bigger smile on our faces while sticking by
migrants in Finland, and without cute animals at that. It’s
quite an achievement in today’s online world, where cats
reign supreme.
I salute the no-longer-captive beavers who built a tunnel
to break out of the Ähtäri Zoo. I also salute the humans who
follow the principle of “be water,” most likely utterly unaware
of these beavers.
On a sunny day in 2015 when people in Istanbul disobeyed
the ban on the Pride parade and the police attacked them
with water cannons, the sun and water created a rainbow
over the protesters. That moment! That moment is when you
know that not only your friends will have your back but also
the universe itself. In that same spirit, I send warm thoughts
the way of the neighbors who put up red signs on their doors
in Hamburg during the G20 to show where protesters could
nd solidarity. The red signs were not in the shape of hearts
per se but they were hearts nonetheless.
Just as I have tried to share some special memories with you,
I hope you will take the time to think back on the situations
when you felt collective dignity and strength. When your
mind and gut screamed with excitement. Remember them,
and embrace your desire for more. In our neighborhood, and
on a planetary scale.
As friends have pointed out, we’re like a mix of magnif-

## 438 / CONSTELL ATIONS OF C ARE

icent things that those working against us have diculty
understanding. They can’t imagine erceness and care
inhabiting the same person, much less a social body that
ghts to dismantle hierarchies according to ethical principles
of shared power. Love is not keeping your hands clean; love
is courage.
When an event with people with strollers and walkers
gets attacked, anyone who rushes to absorb the rst blows
and actively defend them, despite the consequences that
might continue for one, two, four, seven, or even ten years, is
defending love.
Anyone who dances Kurdish halay to keep up spirits and
calm their friends while the police search their bus, home, or
squat do so with an air of elegant resistance. Zap, zap, zapê!
But to be honest, the other reason I am writing to you is
because it becomes more and more clear to me every day that
we belong together, in one way or another. And I want you
to remember that even though you sometimes, and perhaps
often, feel lonely, you are loved!
I am certain of this. I know it deep down.
That is why I am writing to you, from the many places
where I know it to be true. From the moments and movements
where I have experienced and felt it to be true. Love as a
constant practice.
From the oor of my house where I frequently lay down to
gather strength and where I am now thinking of you. A oor
that has supported so many others too.
From the friend, who happens to get their hands on two
hundred vegan pizzas and calls to ask if you’d like some,
and you feel that it’s not only your political productivity that

matters but that your body is being cared for too.
From the streets, every time you shout the chant “Jin! Jiyan!
Azadî! / Women! Life! Freedom!” and you feel humble in the
face of history and grateful for the path that is opening, on
which you can journey with a bit more dignity.
From the eight-year-old who taught us a Tik Tok dance to
the tune of the antifascist “Bella Ciao.” Ylva, you are right,
any event or revolution needs dancing, and we are honored to
dance with you.
From the hangout after the biweekly meeting in spring
2020 where we rst heard about what was going on in Seattle.
When you made Capitol Hill an autonomous zone, it made
us feel something we haven’t felt in a long time, something we
can’t quite formulate yet. Not to mention the sacking of the
Third Precinct in Minneapolis.
From the comradeship that can start to deepen through
direct and honest communication. When we develop and dare
to use tools and structures to solve, and even more important,
prevent conicts that cause crises in our communities, long-
term relationships can begin to take shape.
From the care given by one to many, such as from Oscar,
who regularly brought home, washed, and folded the towels
of a shared social space for ve years, without being asked to
do it. We see the work you do and we love you.
From the meeting in the woods that becomes possible
when the equipment from a juicery is repurposed into a eld
kitchen to cater for eighty people. First you learn to cook for
two people. Then fteen, a hundred, and even six thousand
new friends.

From the territory that starts to form when Taneli from
the other radical space in the neighborhood pops in and asks
if he can clean our windows, and we catch the rst glimpse
of the love that will surround us when we inhabit the whole
neighborhood instead of two little storefronts. Taneli, we wish
we would have had more than decent coee and enthusiastic
visions to oer you in return.
From writing you this letter, and rereading our beautiful
shared history of resistance and compassion. From noticing
that I miss you and wondering what you’re up to. In the words
of our friends, organizing ourselves has never been anything
else than loving each other.
From the campre where people tell stories about victorious
battles in order to raise everyone’s ghting spirit or the porch
where people share the wonder of seeing shooting stars while
someone can be overheard singing the Bangles. A whole life
so lonely, and then we come together and ease the pain. Am I
only dreaming? Or is this burning an eternal ame?
Do you feel the same?

## Forever yours, Vilja

PS
This letter is an assemblage of words and situations created
by friends and comrades around the world. Despite having
one writer, it is a collaboration of many, not only because
of the borrowed words, but due to all the shared magic and
intense discussions. As you already should know, I love all of
you very much!

to be with you, wherever you are and wherever there is even a
tiny spark. Vilja nds it important to appreciate and celebrate
our big and small victories throughout history, and never
