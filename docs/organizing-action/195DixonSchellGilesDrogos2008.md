Although the study of police–civilian relations has recently entered the intergroup communication arena, there are no studies of actual interactions between these social categories. In part to rectify that stark omission and guided by communication accommodation theory, 313 randomly sampled video recordings from police cars on traffic stops in Cincinnati, Ohio were content analyzed. The study revealed 3 key differences as a function of the officers' and drivers' races: (a) Black drivers were more likely to experience extensive policing during the stop; (b) the communication quality of White drivers was, on average, more positive than that of the Black drivers; and (c) officers' communication behavior was more positive when the officer and driver were of the same race. These findings are consistent with public opinion data and their implications for theory are discussed.

Perceived injustices involving interracial police–civilian interactions during traffic stops have led to many destructive urban disturbances in the United States. For example, the 1992 Los Angeles riots were sparked by the acquittal of four White policemen involved in the videotaped beating of Black motorist Rodney King (Jacobs, 1996). The disturbances lasted almost 6 days and led to over 2,300 injuries, 8,000 arrests, and 51 deaths (Bergesen & Herman, 1998). Almost 9 years after the Los Angeles, California urban unrest, White Officer Roach of the Cincinnati Police Department (CPD) shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old African American male who was fleeing arrest in Cincinnati, Ohio (Olzak, Shanahan, & Mc Eneaney, 1996). Three days of civil unrest ensued.

Each of the above examples raises questions about the nature of police–civilian interactions, and how they may differ as a function of race. Past research has shown

Corresponding author: Travis L. Dixon; e-mail: tldixon@uiuc.edu how different intercultural verbal and nonverbal norms can potentially lead to miscommunication between ethnic minority civilians and police officers. For instance, Hammer and Rogan (2002) found that Indochinese immigrants to the United States tended to not elaborate or defend their position when confronted by police officers who questioned their activities. In addition, they found that Latinos' communicative styles could disadvantage them when being interrogated by officers. For example, one respondent claimed that ''when the police officers heard the Spanish accent, he asked my friend for his immigration documents . It seems he was looking for a problem because of the accent'' (p. 565).

Similarly, although many Whites perceive Black complaints about police mistreatment as exaggerations, many African Americans see police misconduct as real examples of the cost of being Black in America (Bergesen & Herman, 1998; Cochran, 2001; Kinnon, 1999; Olzak et al., 1996). However, these opinions are based largely on anecdotes and personal experiences not in observations of actual incidents. The goal of the current study was to move beyond casual assumptions to systematically investigate the extent to which the race of interactants might influence the nature of police–civilian communication. We accomplish this by analyzing a random sample of the most common type of police–community interaction, routine traffic stops. Given that Cincinnati keeps recordings of all stops, and because of the city's recent history of racial tension, it is an excellent place to study racial differences in police– citizen interactions.

#### Intergroup communication

Research in communication, linguistics, and psychology has focused on the processes governing interactions between individuals, documenting that individual behavior can be understood only as part of a reciprocal, dynamic process between the participants. Verbal and nonverbal cues transmit personal expectations during an interaction constantly interpreted by each participant. This is especially true when contrasting social identities are involved (Harwood & Giles, 2005). These interpretations determine behavior, and these behaviors then affect the responses of the other party (Darley & Fazio, 1980; Giles & Smith, 1979). Interactions that result in conflict can often be traced to verbal and nonverbal cues that a participant interprets (or misinterprets) as distrust, disrespect, or anger (e.g., Mehrabian, 1968; Schlenker & Leary, 1982). Neither individual may be solely to blame for a conflict. Instead, each person sees his or her own behavior as a reasonable and justified reaction to the situation. Nevertheless, changes in interpersonal interaction may have prevented the conflict.

These interpersonal dynamics may be complicated by group identity and racial differences. Several scholars have focused on the division between Whites and African Americans and have argued that cultural differences/psychological mechanisms may contribute to communication problems (Fazio, 1986; Hecht, Jackson, & Ribeau, 2003). The racial unrest mentioned above might be an outgrowth of these factors. Intercultural research often frames in-group–out-group communication and power differentials as underlying racial strife. The power differential and racial disparities common in police–civilian dyads may highlight these issues.

# Communication accommodation and police traffic stops

Differences in communication accommodation may serve as an empirical measure of the interracial communication dynamics that occur during police–civilian interactions. Communication accommodation theory (CAT) has often been used to assess the dynamics of intercultural communication and has more recently been extended to the study of police–civilian interaction patterns (Giles, 2002; Giles, Coupland, & Coupland, 1991; Giles, Willemyns, Gallois, & Anderson, 2007b). Among others, CAT invokes two main processes that underlie communication interaction. The first of these (accommodative) processes is convergence. Convergence explains what occurs in an interaction when individuals adapt to each other's behaviors and speech patterns. The second (nonaccommodative) process is divergence, which relates to ways speakers differentiate their behaviors and speech patterns.

Convergence is a means of identifying with a certain communication pattern. A person who is converging their communication is actively associating their identity with this particular linguistic pattern of speech. When a speaker feels the need to gain a target's approval, there is a higher chance for convergence to occur. Giles et al. (2006; 2007a) have shown that the more officers are perceived to accommodate civilians, the more civilians positively evaluate police and their services. More recently, Hajek et al. (2006) showed that perceptions of officers' accommodation led to increased trust and reported compliance with officers. Hence, in the present context, less dissatisfaction and shorter traffic stops should occur when mutual accommodation prevailed in a traffic stop.

Power relations are an important dynamic in CAT (Giles et al., 1991). For example, Stanback and Pearce (1981) note that Blacks typically converge more to Whites, assuming an imbalance of power between the two groups due to socioeconomic status. Layering another level of innate power imbalance—that of a police and civilian interaction—creates an even more interesting paradigm of communication convergence (or ''accommodation'' as we shall refer to it hereafter to comport to popular usage; Giles, 2002). In a traffic stop, where police officers have the authority to exert control, demand compliance, and affect penalties on civilians, CAT would predict more accommodation from drivers to officers than vice-versa. However, an uneven power differential between interactants does not guarantee communication accommodation. For instance, when group-based discrimination is expected, interactants may choose not to accommodate; as might Black drivers who feel that their racial identities are, illegitimately, the direct cause of most decisions to stop and extensively search them and their vehicles.

Divergence occurs when a speaker actively works in opposition to communicative patterns associated with a relevant out-group. People inherently make intergroup social comparisons in which they compare their in-group to out-groups on certain traits (Tajfel, 1982). Communication patterns and dialect are often part of ethnic group identity (Giles et al., 1991).

Divergence may complicate communication between two speakers who are purposefully diverging to authenticate their identity to one another. For this reason, divergence (as well as other forms of nonaccommodation) is typically associated with negative reactions and can often be attributed as rude, insulting, and even hostile. Hence, dyadic interactions between two members of different groups with strong identity attachments may create an intergroup, rather than an interindividual, context. These interactions tend to reflect two groups communicating rather than two individuals. Moreover, increased group identity with a lower status stigmatized group increases the propensity for an individual to be sensitized to injustice toward the group and, therefore, against the self. This can lead to communication apprehension (Major, 2006) and may emerge in African American suspects' divergent communications during traffic stops.

All this notwithstanding, CAT contends that nonaccommodation may not always hinge on situations being inherently construed as hostile (see Street & Giles, 1982). Traffic stops are known, by police officers, as being among the most dangerous situations they can encounter with members of the public (Pinizzotto, Davis, & Miller, 1997). In other words, officers are often ''on their guard''—even under the most mundane circumstances—and are trained to resist temptations toward complacency and vulnerability; officer accommodativeness (especially when violations of the law are on the cards) is, therefore, not a ''natural'' communicative strategy. Indeed, resistance to accommodativeness might be accentuated when encountering members of a social category that have more stigmatic associations with crime than others (Dixon, 2007; Giles, 2001). All this is compounded given that accommodative officers are the ones most liable to be victims of lethal force from members of the public in traffic stops. In this regard, and from interviews with victims' peers and supervisors, slain officers are often described as ''friendly to everyone, well-liked . and tend to look for 'good' in others'' (Pinizzotto et al., 1997, p. 12).

## Communication accommodation, stigma, and group identity

Communication between stigmatized and nonstigmatized individuals can create high levels of anxiety within both parties that leads to ''awkward'' moments (Hebl, Tickle, & Heatherton, 2000). This anxiety may produce high levels of uncertainty, hesitance, and nonaccommodative tactics. Such anxiety may cause nonstigmatized individuals to be verbally accepting of the stigmatized individual, yet display negative nonverbal communication. This anxiety also affects the stigmatized individual in that they begin to think most nonstigmatized individuals view them negatively. This can lead to stigmatized individuals viewing all ambiguousness within an interaction as negative (Hebl et al., 2000). The party that is stigmatized is often ambiguous in some intergroup contexts. For instance, Molloy and Giles (2002) argued that police officers can be stigmatized by some and revered by others.

Moreover, stigmatization often accompanies a power imbalance. When those in higher status groups speak to those in lower status groups, they frequently ''talk down'' to the lower status group individuals by over accommodating and engaging in patronizing talk (Ruscher, 2001). In engaging in this ''controlling talk'' pattern, the higher status group member is presuming the incompetence of the listener. Frequently, the higher status member will try to control the interaction through interruption or using oversimplified language. Therefore, one possibility is that White officers may view Black suspects as lower status and engage in such interaction patterns. In addition, White officers may unwittingly rely on stereotypes of Black criminality during the interaction and engage in more extensive policing and divergent communication patterns (Dixon, 2006; Eberhardt, Goff, Purdie, & Davies, 2004).

## Study overview and hypotheses

Information from vehicle-mounted video and audio recordings can shed light on the origins of police–community conflict and dissatisfaction as borne out by communication accommodation patterns. Our analysis of the audio and video records of traffic stops is designed to shed light on how these interactions between police and community members unfold. The goal was to conduct a study that describes how these interactions differ as a function of the race of both the officer and the driver. In addition, we have identified aspects of the traffic stops that are associated with counterproductive or dissatisfying interactions. Finally, the analysis describes how typical police–motorist interactions occur as a function of race.

Based on the research reviewed above, we test two hypotheses:

H1: Black drivers will experience more extensive policing compared to White drivers as evidenced by video recordings of traffic stops.

As noted above, stigmatized and nonstigmatized group interactions containing power differentials often lead to behavioral mistreatment of the stigmatized group member. Prior research has shown that Blacks are a stigmatized group who are stereotypically associated with excessive crime and violence and are more likely to be targeted by law enforcement (Delgado, 1994; Dixon, 2006; Eberhardt et al., 2004). Moreover, Blacks constitute a disproportionately large number of arrests and suspect descriptions in Cincinnati, and neighborhood-level crime rates are positively associated with the proportion of Black residents (Riley et al., 2005). We would expect that these issues would manifest in the current study.

H2: Interracial communication will be less accommodative than same-race accommodation as evidenced by video recordings of traffic stops.

As described above, intergroup relations may be strained even when the participants do not believe that they harbor racial prejudice (Hecht et al., 2003) or even when, objectively, the messages exchanged can be measured just as efficiently as intraethnic communication. The stress related to traffic stops, as well as a widespread belief of racial bias among Black residents (Riley et al., 2005), may exacerbate this problem. Nonetheless, the following interaction effect is predicted to qualify this effect.

H3: Black drivers will be less accommodative (especially with White officers) than White drivers, and they will also be less accommodative the more they experience extensive policing.

Black drivers are more likely than Whites to feel that the trigger for their being stopped was a function of their racial identity and especially so in interracial traffic stops. These feelings should be exacerbated the more they experience extensive policing (e.g., longer stops).

# Method

# Sample of interactions

The current study was originally conducted by the RAND Corporation as part of a larger report on police–civilian relations in Cincinnati (Riley et al., 2005). The study was funded by the City of Cincinnati as part of the settlement of a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The scope of the research was jointly determined by the City, the ACLU, the Police officers' union, and RAND. This content analysis was conducted on a stratified random sample of video records (n = 313) received from the CPD.

The sampling frame for the study was defined by contact card data that was filled out by police officers. These cards must be filled out for every traffic stop, regardless of the outcome or offense, and include the officer's assessment of the race of the vehicle occupants. Our overall sampling frame included all incidents that (a) had a contact card data associated with the incident, (b) involved a motor vehicle stop, (c) had a driver's race that the officer assessed as either ''White'' or ''Black,'' (d) had an officer's race that was reported as either ''White'' or ''Black'' in CPD records, and (e) occurred between September 1, 2004, and December 31, 2004.

Four sampling strata were created based on the officer and driver races: Black officer/Black driver, Black officer/White driver, White officer/Black driver, and White officer/White driver. Incidents were randomly sampled within each of these four strata using a computer-generated random number. In order to best achieve the goals of this task, an equal number of incidents were requested from each of the four strata. This provides the maximum analytic power for describing racial differences in the interactions. Thus, the aggregate sample is not a representative sample of all incidents involving the CPD, but it is a representative sample of incidents within each of the four strata. The stratified random sampling method employed resulted in the strongest possible sample for the goals of the study, avoiding problems associated with convenience samples or correlated observations in interpersonal communication studies. This process yielded a total sample of 313 incidents for analysis, with 75 incidents per strata.

However, in approximately one third of the recordings, either the video or the audio was of poor quality (e.g., camera was not aimed so that driver and officer were in the field of view). Approximately 9% of the incidents have poor video quality. In 27% of the interactions, the officer's voice is not clearly audible, whereas the driver's voice is not audible in 32% of the interactions. For these problematic interactions, variables that could not be measured were treated as missing. In approximately 15% of the cases, the video record was incomplete (e.g., the camera was turned off or ran out of tape before the driver or officer left the scene). The incomplete records and poor audio or video records did not vary by the race of interactants.

The sample size for variables requiring audible audio for both officer and civilian is 194—divided nearly equally across the racial strata—which results in slightly less analytic power for communication outcome analyses than for the stop characteristic outcomes. For the full sample, the cell sizes for the interactions were as follows: (Black officer, Black driver = 77), (Black officer, White driver = 83), (White officer, Black driver = 75), and (White officer, White driver = 77). For the interactions in which all the communication variables were analyzable, the cell sizes for the interactions were as follows: (Black officer, Black driver = 43), (Black officer, White driver = 55), (White officer, Black driver = 44), and (White officer, White driver = 77).

#### Codebook development and coder training

The key to this analysis is the conversion of raw video and audio records into theoretically meaningful measurements through content analysis coding. The process of codebook development began with identifying the specific constructs that we wanted to measure followed by cycles of empirical tests to determine if those constructs could be reliably measured on the actual recordings. When multiple coders could not agree on the correct measurement for a given construct or when a high proportion of tapes were judged to not be codable for that construct (e.g., facial expressions), the coding measures and instructions were revised. In this way, the training of the coders occurred during the process of codebook development.

#### Codebook development and testing

Four academically strong graduate students worked as coders during the codebook development. Individuals were recruited from the Communication Department at a large university in the Midwestern United States. The coders were from the Midwest region, and the racial diversity of the coders mirrors the diversity in the recordings to be coded. To serve as a coder, students had to master all aspects of the codebook.

Initial training was accomplished with approximately 30 hours of instruction in a small seminar class setting on coding interpersonal interactions, followed by extensive practice with the incident recordings. Throughout the entire training and codebook development process, coders regularly practiced applying the measures defined in the codebook by coding incidents. Feedback on these practice sessions was provided individually and to the group of coders.

## Coding procedures and reliability testing

Once training was complete, each of the 313 incidents was randomly assigned to a coder. Coders were not given information about the race of the officer or driver from the contact cards. However, racial information was usually available from the tape itself at some point during the incident. Coders viewed each recording alone and could watch the entire incident, or any segment of it, as many times as necessary to make the required coding judgments. For this reason, it was essential to demonstrate that the coding process maintained a strong and consistent level of performance over time in order to ensure reliability of the data. To assess this, all coders were asked to code a total of 58 incidents over several points during the coding process. By looking at the agreement among coders on these incidents, we monitored the ongoing reliability of the coding procedure and checked for fatigue.

The coding scheme contains both dichotomous and interval measures. As a result, the reliability calculations for each were done separately. The reliability for interval and ratio communication measures used intraclass correlations that are considered a standard reliability technique for the continuous assessment of verbal and nonverbal behaviors (Fleiss, 1981). For dichotomous measures, we employed a proportional reduction of error technique, which relies on Cohen's Kappa (Wimmer & Dominick, 2000). Cohen's Kappa is commonly viewed as a version of Scott's Pi that corrects for chance error in the consistency ratings of multiple coders, and it is considered a standard proportional reduction of error technique in content analysis.

The reliability on each of the variables was quite high as indicated by the overall median range of agreement that ranged from .60 to 1.0. The average coefficient was .89. Out of the 143 variables, less than 8% (12) failed to reach conventional levels of reliability (.70). Individual measures that failed to reach a median of .70 were maintained in the analysis only if they were combined with other items having higher reliabilities as part of a scale.

#### Content analysis measures

Based on the goals of the study and the behavioral science literature on interracial interactions, we identified two broad classes of measures that we wanted to include in the project: (a) objective characteristics of the stop and (b) verbal and nonverbal communication behavior that provides clues to the attitudes and accommodation of the officer and driver.

Several verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication were identified for measurement. These are drawn from prior research on interpersonal communication and intergroup interaction (e.g., Devine & Vasquez, 1998; Dovido, Ellyson, Keating, Heltman, & Brown, 1988). Based on this research, we expected that these communication factors would line up along a dimension that represents the desired social distance between the officer and the driver. The overall quality of the communication for each participant can vary from negative, distant, or divergent (e.g., disrespectful, dismissive) to positive, close, or accommodative (e.g., pleasant, respectful) depending on each individual's desired level of social distance from his or her interlocutor. The measures used to create these constructs are described below, with item-level interrater reliabilities indicated in parentheses.

# Stop characteristics

A series of variables assessed various objective aspects of the videotaped interaction. These included the total time the driver was detained (.98), the time of day (.99), the amount of traffic (.75) during the stop, and whether the tape ended (.96) before the stop was finished. It also included the justification for the stop (e.g., moving violation or equipment infraction) (.87) and the outcome of the interaction (e.g., warning, citation) (.92).

# Vehicle and occupant search variables

These variables were used as further descriptors of what took place during the interaction. They included the total number of officers at the scene (.90), whether there was a physical vehicle search (.93), whether the officer asks the driver if they possess drugs or weapons (.92), and whether the driver was asked to leave the vehicle (.86). We also assessed the number of occupants (.84), and whether the occupants were searched (.85).

# Demographic characteristics

The primary police officer was the one who first approached the vehicle. The coders made judgments regarding officer sex (.95), officer age (.81), driver sex (.93), and driver age (.85). The race of the officer was identified using departmental records, and the race of the driver was reported by the officer on the contact card.

#### Communication accommodation variables

CAT suggests that individuals use communication in order to indicate their attitudes toward each other and it is a barometer of the level of social distance between them. These variables were assessed using interval level scales. They each varied from 0 to 10 with higher scores representing more friendly, pleasant, and personal communication behavior. For example, the variable for officer respect and politeness had the following coder instructions:

In general how respectful and polite was the primary officer toward the driver? Does the officer show regard for the civilian through speech, manners, and behavior? An exceptionally polite officer will attempt to make sure that the driver feels comfortable during the interaction by using both verbal and nonverbal messages.

The coders were then given examples of what a highly respectful and polite officer may do and/or say. The coders were also given examples of what a highly disrespectful and rude officer may do and/or say. Coders were asked to rate the officer's respect and politeness on a numerical Likert-type scale of equal variance with endpoints anchored by 0 not at all respectful/polite and 10 very respectful/polite. Using these measures afforded us greater statistical power for the detection of communication differences compared to the traditional nominal scale items used in many content analyses (Cohen, 1988). This is important because the interaction differences between racial group members (including paralanguage and nonverbal behavior) during police stops are most likely small. A complete list of all variables and coding instructions is available online at: http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical\_reports/TR333/.

Communication accommodation for officers included the following variables: the officer's approachability (.69), overall officer listening (.65), officer respect and politeness (.70), as well as officer dismissiveness (.70), indifference (.68), and air of superiority (.75). Driver accommodation included the driver's: pleasantness (.71), respect and politeness (.60), courteousness (.68), apologetic disposition (.83), and belligerence (.91).

## Analysis plan

The basic analyses are designed to describe how a range of possible outcomes measured from the recordings were related to (a) the officer's race, (b) the driver's race, and (c) the similarity between the races of the officer and driver. The objective characteristics of the stop (e.g., duration, number of vehicle occupants) were analyzed individually, whereas the communication items were grouped into scales. This helps to limit the number of statistical tests—and thus limit exposure to false positive statistical errors. Two scales were created:

Officer Communication Quality is the average of the 20 items that measure the officers' communication accommodation and nonaccommodation. The 10 items that represent negative or distancing communication behavior were reverse scored prior to computing the average (M = 6.41, SD = 1.00; Cronbach's a = .81).

Driver Communication Quality is the average of the 21 items that measure the drivers' communication accommodation and nonaccommodation. The 11 items that represent negative or distancing communication behavior were reverse scored prior to computing the average (M = 6.81, SD = 0.87; Cronbach's a = .80).

## Results

#### Driver's race and extensive policing

Our first hypothesis stated that African American drivers would experience more extensive policing compared to White drivers. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined the circumstances of the motor vehicle stop as a function of the driver's race (see Table 1). Results revealed that Black drivers were, on average, carrying more passengers, driving older vehicles, and were more likely to be stopped at night. In addition, a lower proportion of the stops of Black drivers occurred due to moving violations. The likelihood of being stopped for a nonmoving violation (e.g., expired registration) was twice as high for Black drivers as for White drivers.

There were also several differences in the characteristics of the stop itself for White relative to Black drivers. The stops of Black drivers took an average of

Table 1 Differences in Stop Characteristics as a Function of Driver Race

| | Black Drivers | White Drivers | | |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-----|----------------------|
| | % or Mean | % or Mean | N | Significant<br>Value |
| Mean number of passengers | 0.55 | 0.23 | 285 | ,.001 |
| Mean vehicle age (years) | 8.1 | 6.8 | 309 | ,.05 |

2.6 minutes longer than for White drivers, and they were more likely to involve multiple police officers. In addition, Black drivers and their vehicles were more likely to be investigated for illegal items. Relative to White drivers, Blacks were between three and five times more likely to (a) be asked if they were carrying drugs or weapons, (b) be asked to leave the vehicle, (c) be searched, (d) have a passenger searched, and (e) have the vehicle physically searched. These results appear to provide support for Hypothesis 1: Blacks were more likely than Whites to experience extensive policing.

We found no significant differences in officers' age or gender or the drivers' age or gender as a function of the drivers' race. We also found no significant differences in the stop characteristics as a function of officer's race or similarity between officer and driver race.

#### Communication accommodation, race, and police–civilian interactions

Our second hypothesis stated that interracial communication would be less accommodative than same-race accommodation. In order to assess these differences, we predicted both the Officers' Communication Quality (while controlling for the Drivers' Communication Quality) and the Drivers' Communication Quality (while controlling for the Officers' Communication Quality) using 2 (officer race) 3 2 (driver race) analyses of covariance.

Communication difference as a function of officer and driver racial similarity

We expected that interracial police–civilian interactions would be less accommodative compared to same-race interactions. Although we did not find differences in the characteristics of stops as a direct function of the officers' race, the officer's communication quality was most positive in same race (M = 6.67, SD = 0.88) versus different race (M = 6.29, SD = 1.06) interactions, F(1, 189) = 11.20, p , .01.

In order to better understand the observed racial difference in Officers' Communication Quality, we reanalyzed the data to determine if the less positive communication in interracial interactions would persist after controlling for the stop characteristics, individual characteristics, and data quality variables. Specifically, we looked at the average level of officers' communication quality while controlling for drivers' sex, officers' sex, drivers' age, officers' age, drivers' communication quality, day versus night stop, anyone arrested, any citation issued, moving versus equipment violation, number of occupants, any illicit items found, any individual search, vehicle search, number of officers, total time of the stop, and if the video record was complete. The size of the difference in officer communication quality across same-race and interracial interactions was not diminished in size after controlling for all these factors.

In order to better describe what this effect implies in terms of specific communication behavior, we looked at the 20 individual items that are combined to create the Officers' Communication Quality scale to determine which specific items contribute the most to the observed difference. This analysis revealed that, relative to samerace interactions, officers in interracial interactions displayed more indifference to comments of the driver, were less approachable, were more dismissive of driver comments, showed a more pronounced appearance of superiority, gave less respect, and did less listening (see Table 2).

We did not find a parallel race interaction effect when predicting the Drivers' Communication Quality, F(1, 189) = 1.10, p , .25. In summary, we appear to have obtained some support for our second hypothesis, interracial police–civilian interactions were less accommodative compared to same-race interactions. However, the hypothesized effect was found only in the officers' communication behavior.

Communication differences as a function of driver's race

Our third hypothesis predicted that Black drivers would be less accommodative than White drivers, and that they would be less accommodative the more they experience extensive policing. Using the same analysis procedures as described above, we found that driver's communication behavior did significantly differ as a function of race. Specifically, Black drivers had less positive communication quality (i.e., more communication nonaccommodativeness) than did White drivers while controlling for the officers' communication quality (M = 6.67, SDs = 0.95, 6.93, and 0.77, respectively), F(1, 189) = 4.70, p , .05. We again reanalyzed the data to determine if the Black drivers' less positive communication would persist after controlling for the stop characteristics, individual characteristics, and data quality variables. The size of the difference between White and Black drivers' communication quality was not significantly diminished in size after controlling for all these factors and remained significant at the p , .05 level.

We also looked at the 21 individual items that are combined to create the Drivers' Communication Quality scale to determine which items contributed the most to the observed scale difference. This analysis showed that, relative to White drivers, Black drivers were less apologetic, less courteous, less pleasant, more belligerent, and less respectful (see Table 2). This appears to provide support for the first part of our hypothesis; Black drivers were on average less accommodative than White drivers. In order to test the second part of the hypothesis, we ran a partial correlation between one of the strongest predictors of extensive policing (e.g., length of stop) and driver communication quality. After controlling for officer's communication quality, we found a negative relationship between these two variables, r(187) = 2.15, p , .05. This provides support for the second part of Hypothesis 3, driver communication quality appears to be negatively related to extensive policing.

#### Other supplemental statistical tests

In contrast to this, driver race effect on Drivers' Communication Quality, a Driver Race main effect was not found on Officer's Communication Quality. Moreover, when averaging over equal numbers of Black and White officers and controlling for Drivers' Communication Quality, there was no significant difference in the Officer's Communication Quality when interacting with White versus Black drivers. Stop comparisons between Black and White officers revealed no significant differences on either the communication quality of the officer, F(1, 189) = 0.03, p , .80, or driver, F(1, 189) = 0.34, p , .50.

#### Discussion

The current study was a content analysis of 313 randomly sampled video records of police–civilian interactions. This analysis revealed three key differences as a function of the officers' and drivers' races. First, Black drivers were more likely to experience extensive policing during the stop, resulting in longer stops that were significantly more likely to involve searches. Second, the communication quality of White drivers was more positive than of the Black drivers—specifically, it was more apologetic and courteous. In addition, there was a negative relationship between Black driver's communication quality and the length of the stop. Third, officers' communication behavior was more positive when the officer and driver were of the same race. Below, we describe the implications and the limitations of this research.

# Implications for communication accommodation

The current study expands our application of CAT to police–citizen interactions, something that researchers have been imploring scholars to do (Giles, 2002; Giles et al., 2006). As predicted by CAT, we find that accommodation is more likely to occur in intraracial rather than interracial circumstances. In addition, nonaccommodative actions (including divergence) appear to materialize with Black drivers, perhaps due to their low status, which may engender stereotyping and extensive policing. The benefit of the current study is that it examines actual ''routine'' police–civilian interactions. CAT might also call for us to examine and compare the accommodative behavior of officers and drivers regardless of race. Unfortunately, we did not collect identical information about officers and drivers. In addition, such a comparison might also be difficult because of the scripted nature of police–civilian interactions. Nevertheless, this area should be pursued in future research.

Another potential area for future research regarding the application of CAT to police–civilian interactions might be to explore whether driver accommodativeness during traffic stops leads to more positive outcomes for drivers as indicated by length of stop and the severity of the imposed penalty. Again, this is, a direct and basic prediction from CAT in that accommodation usually results in favorable outcomes for those interactively involved. However, we could not explore this in the current study because it was unclear from our data whether accommodative behavior either preceded or followed the imposition of officer penalties. A future study needs to be conducted which combines both survey data and videotaped interactions in order to examine this possibility. Moreover, additional research is needed to adequately understand the relationship between accommodative behaviors and police–civilian interactions.

#### Extensive policing and the ''angry'' black driver

The random sample of video records analyzed in this study shed light on the nature of ordinary interactions between Cincinnati's citizens and its police. One key finding is that Black drivers are more likely to exhibit less accommodative communication compared to White drivers. This outcome might best be explained in light of public opinion data of a representative sample of 3,000 Cincinnati residents. In it, Blacks were more likely than Whites to report that the police were less effective, less polite, and more likely to use racial profiling than did White residents (Ridgeway, Schell, Riley, Turner, & Dixon, 2006). Thus, drivers' communication behaviors appear to be a manifestation of a broad dissatisfaction with the police among Blacks.

Our data also suggest possible mechanisms that could lead to, or exacerbate, these negative attitudes among Black residents. Specifically, Black residents experience far more invasive and long-lasting traffic stops, which are likely to reinforce negative attitudes about the police. Our finding is not direct evidence that the Cincinnati Police are racially profiling. A more comprehensive analysis of CPD records revealed very strong neighborhood differences in the likelihood of vehicle searches and the length of stops, but little evidence of systematic racial profiling (Riley et al., 2005). Both White and Black motorists are much more likely to be searched in predominantly Black, high-crime neighborhoods, whereas both are unlikely to be searched in predominantly White suburbs. Although ''neighborhood'' based profiling is legally distinct from targeting specific drivers based on their race, it may have many of the same detrimental effects on public opinion. Longer, more invasive traffic stops Black drivers regularly experience may contribute to a more negative attitude in future interactions.

It is also possible that the racial differences in drivers' communication could reflect different cultural standards of expression, even when underlying attitudes are quite similar (e.g., Hecht et al., 2003). For example, Whites could be more likely than Blacks to apologize for behavior (e.g., speeding) that they do not, in fact, regret. Similarly, Blacks' communication styles may be less likely to use honorific terms (e.g., ''sir''), which could make it harder to communicate effectively their respect for the officer. Finally, the association between drivers' race and drivers' communication may not reflect any causal influence of race. It may reflect the influence of neighborhood-level attitudes toward police or the number of times the driver has been stopped in the past. The current data do not allow us to choose among these explanations.

## Same-race interactions and intergroup communication

White officers used the most positive communication when they talked to White drivers, and Black officers used the most positive communication when they were talking to Black drivers. In same-race interactions, officers appear to have given the impression that they were interested in hearing the drivers' comments, relative to interracial interactions. Although these differences are about the same magnitude for White and Black officers, the aggregate effect may not be symmetrical because there are many more White officers than Black officers in the CPD. Approximately twothirds of all traffic stops of Black motorists are interracial interactions, whereas one third of White motorists stops are interracial.

In some respects, these difficulties in interracial communication may be a reflection of the level of racial tension in the community. However, interracial interactions are often strained even in the absence of any prejudice. Nonprejudiced individuals can appear anxious, uncomfortable, and self-conscious in interracial interactions precisely because they are concerned about appearing prejudiced (Leary & Atherton, 1986; Schlenker & Leary, 1982). Similarly, minorities who are interacting with majority group members may feel stress from concern that they are being judged on their race, not their behavior (e.g., Crocker & Major, 1989). They may have low expectations of a positive interaction that results in a less positive interaction and more social distancing (Darley & Fazio, 1980; Street & Giles, 1982).

Although this study presents no evidence that the observed differences in officer communication are legally inappropriate, we do believe that they represent a barrier to good police–community relations and to good race relations in general. Such effects make interracial contact stressful and unpleasant, which may lead to a cycle of worsening relations rather than improvement (e.g., Stephan, 1987). Motor vehicle stops are one of the most common interactions between officers and the community. If this contact reinforces negative racial expectations of the officers and drivers, it may make subsequent interactions less likely to be positive.

Finally, we did not find similar intergroup effects on drivers' communication. Although this is a relatively large study, it did not have the power to guarantee that all effects of theoretical interest would be detected. Specifically, it was designed to have an 83% chance of detecting a race effect (p , .05; two-tailed) when the true difference is half of 1 SD, a medium effect size (Cohen, 1988). It is reasonable to think that many effects of theoretical interest (e.g., an effect of matched race on the decision to search a vehicle) would have small effect sizes in the real world and thus be unlikely to be detected in the current study.

Our findings do imply that from the drivers' perspective, the officers' identity as a police officer is far more important than their own racial identity. The power the officer holds over the interaction is unrelated to their race, and this may effectively create a perception of conflicting group identities regardless of racial similarity. In contrast, the police officer may stop several motorists a day and generally controls the outcome of the interaction. In that context, group memberships such as race may be more important to the officers' behavior than to the drivers'.

#### Limitations

There are a number of limitations to our analysis of the audio–video records. One primary limitation is that it uses observational data. These methods allow us to describe what typically occurs in these interactions, but we cannot know definitively why it happens. However, the strength of the current study is that the sampling method greatly strengthens the ability of the study to describe accurately what typically occurs in motor vehicle stops.

Nevertheless, the video records observed are restricted to the CPD. It is very likely that police–civilian interactions might vary geographically (Jacobs, 1996; Kinnon, 1999). There are also several possible threats to the representativeness of the sample due to the limited number of months sampled. Policing patterns might differ depending upon time of year (Jacobs, 1996; Olzak et al., 1996). Future studies should take this into account.

One other possible limitation is that our findings may be largely the result of coder bias. Coders may have been more inclined to view the police, particularly White ones, as having a propensity to profile innocent Black drivers. However, there are three reasons why coder bias probably does not play a significant role in our findings. First, if coders were more likely to anticipate police bias, they would have been more likely to report it in cases with White officers and Black drivers. However, as we reported in the results, officer communication quality did not vary as a function of the driver's race. Second, coders were never explicitly made aware of the study hypotheses. Third, we employed a diverse set of coders, and our coders had very different perspectives about police–community relations. Potter and Levine-Donnerstein (1999) note that this form of diversity in coders increases one's confidence about the validity of coding.

## Implications and conclusion

Paradoxically given the above findings, communication skills are given short shrift in police officer training. Approximately, 98% of such training in the United States is devoted to officer safety through acquiring arrest, control, defensive, and weapon techniques. An interesting empirical question is to what extent the use of physical force could be avoided or attenuated, if appropriate accommodative skills were used (Giles et al., 2006). The importance of officer safety through training regarding the use of physical skills cannot be underestimated. However, our findings regarding the importance of officers' accommodative practices in easing police–civilian interactions suggest that far more attention should be directed at elaborating communication skills. In addition, if police–community relations are to improve, then intervention programs and training focused on mutual accommodation and trust need to be bilateral. Civilians can benefit from and understand the complexities, tensions, challenges, and emotions involved in police work, as well as the potential consequences of aggressive or distancing communication during interactions with police.
