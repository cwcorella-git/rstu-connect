                The End of Arrogance:
## Decentralization and Anarchist
## Organizing
                Author: Curious George Brigade

## 13–16 minutes

## For too long, anarchist projects have been mismanaged by
## arrogant fantasies of mass. We have unconsciously adopted
                the Statist, Capitalist and Authoritarian belief that “bigger
                equals better” and that we must tailor our actions and groups
## towards this end. Despite our intuitive understandings that
                large organizations rarely accomplish more than small, tight
                groups working together, the desire for mass remains strong.
## We must re-examine how we organize projects in order to
## awake from the nightmare of over-structure that inevitably
                leads to bureaucracy, centralization and ineffective anarchist
                work. This article suggests a few ideas on how anarchists can
                reject the trap of mass and reinvent ourselves, our groups and
                our work: from local community activities to large
## revolutionary mobilizations. The rejection of mass
                organizations as the be-all, end-all of organizing is vital for the
                creation and rediscovery of possibilities for empowerment and
## effective anarchist work.

## The Tyranny of Structure

                Most mass structures are a result of habit, inertia and the lack
## of creative critique. Desire for mass is accepted as common
## sense in the same way it is ‘common sense’ that groups must
                have leaders, or that that they must make decisions by voting.
                Even anarchists have been tricked into accepting the necessity
## of super structures and large organizations for the sake of
                efficiency, mass, or unity. These super structures have become
                a badge of legitimacy and they are often the only conduits by
                which outsiders, whether the media, the police or other leftists,
## can understand us. The result is an alphabet soup of megagroups which largely exist to propagate themselves and, sadly,
                do little else. Unfortunately, we haven’t just been tricked into
                accepting superstructures as the overriding venue of our work:
                many of us have gone along willingly, because the promise of
## mass is a seductive one.

                Large coalitions and super-structures have become the coin of
                the realm not only for leftist groups in general but also for
## anarchist enterprises. They appeal to activists’ arrogant
                fantasies of mass: the authoritarian impulse to be leading (or
                at least be part of) a large group of people that reinforce and
                legitimize our deeply held ideologies and beliefs. Even our best
                intentions and wildest dreams are often crowded out by visions
## of the black clad mob storming the Bastille or the IMF
## headquarters.

                The price of the arrogant dream of mass is appallingly high and
## the promised returns never come. Super-structures, which
## include federations, centralized networks and mass

## organizations, demand energy and resources to survive. They
## are not perpetual motion machines which produce more
## energy than what is poured into them. In a community of
                limited resources and energy like ours, a super-structure can
## consume most of these available resources and energies,
                rendering the group ineffective. Mainstream non-profits have
                recently illustrated this tendency. Large organizations like the
## Salvation Army commonly spend 2/3 of their monies (and even
## larger amounts of its labor) on simply maintaining its
                existence: officers, outreach, meetings and public appearance.
                At best, only 1/3 of their output actually goes to their stated
## goals. The same trend is replicated in our political
## organizations.

## We all know that most large coalitions and super-structures
                have exceedingly long meetings. Here’s a valuable exercise:
                The next time you find yourself bored by an overlong meeting,
                count the number of people in attendance. Then multiply that
                number by how long the meeting lasts: this will give you the
## number of person-hours devoted to keeping the organization
                alive. Factor in travel time, outreach time and the propaganda
## involved in promoting the meeting and that will give you a
## rough estimate of the amount of activist hours consumed by
## greedy maw of the superstructure. After that nightmarish
## vision, stop and visualize how much actual work could be
## accomplished if this immense amount of time and energy were
## actually spent on the project at hand instead of what is so
## innocently referred to as ‘organizing’.

## Affinity or Bust
