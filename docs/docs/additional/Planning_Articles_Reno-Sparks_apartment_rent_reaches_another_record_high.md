         Reno-Sparks’ apartment sector closed the ﬁrst half of the year with record numbers yet
         again, posting the highest average rent ever seen for the area, according to two separate
         reports.
         Real estate appraisal and consulting ﬁrm Johnson Perkins Griﬀin reported an average rent of
         $1,680 for the second quarter, beating the record set during the previous quarter of $1,633.
         Rents have increased in 12 of the last 14 quarters since 2019 — 10 of which were record
         highs.

         A second report from the Nevada State Apartment Association, meanwhile, saw average rent
         in Reno-Sparks reach $1,550 for the same period. The rent is also the highest ever reported
         by the apartment association for Reno-Sparks, although still lower than the national average
         of $1,640. Both reports cover the quarter from April to June.
         The higher rent is bad news for people such as service industry workers, whose incomes have
         failed to keep pace with the rising cost of housing. As recently as early 2015, the average rent
         in Reno-Sparks was below $900, according to Johnson Perkins Griﬀin. Since then, rents have
         jumped by 89%. The median household income in the greater Reno metro area, however, has
         gone up by 18% during the same time frame, according to census data.
         The housing situation in Reno reﬂects an income divide between the residents who work in
         traditional industries that once served as the backbone of the area economy and the new,
         higher-paying sectors that have attracted people from outside the state.
         “There is a large demographic in Reno-Sparks that is struggling … and people are saying that
         it’s hard to ﬁnd a place that’s aﬀordable,” said Susy Vazquez, executive director of the
         Nevada State Apartment Association. “You have the population that can aﬀord the rents and
         then the other half that can’t.”
         Although apartment rents are at record highs, they are increasing at a slower clip in the last
         year — a sign of moderating rents, according to Vazquez.

         The Nevada State Apartment Association was initially forecasting rents to increase by 7%
         year-over-year before reducing its forecast down to 5%. In the last 12 months, rent growth
         also stood at 4.1%. The number is signiﬁcantly down from the all-time high rent increase of
         13.3% seen in mid-2021.

         Another potential factor is the demand for single-family homes, which can impact the
         apartment market. Reno recently topped a Realtor.com analysis for cities with the highest
         number of home listing price reductions as rising interest rates have priced potential buyers
         out of the market and led to a decrease in demand.
         Reno-Sparks is also in the middle of an apartment construction boom, which will add much-
         needed supply to the market. The NVSAA has identiﬁed 4,500 new apartment units under
         construction, which would represent an 11% increase in overall supply, according to the
         association.
         Johnson Perkins Griﬀin, meanwhile, is reporting more than 5,500 apartment units currently
         under construction and just under 5,100 units in the planning stages in Reno-Sparks.
         “We’re back to where we were (with the rate of increase for rent) pre-pandemic and supply is
         coming in a little hotter than demand so that’s good news because we’ll see some
         stabilization in the market,” Vazquez said.
         “Will (rent) go backwards? Probably not. I think most landlords will rather push move-in
         specials or oﬀer a free month of rent, which essentially reduces rents, even if it’s not at face
         value.”

         Whether or not the Reno-Sparks apartment market will see more concessions largely depends
         on the vacancy rate. The NVSAA is reporting a vacancy rate of 6%, up slightly from 5.8% in
         the ﬁrst quarter and 5.2% during the second quarter last year.
         “A vacancy rate of 5% to 6% is normal and 7% to 8% is when landlords start to worry and
         start oﬀering more move-in specials,” Vazquez said.
         The Johnson Perkins Griﬀin report, meanwhile, typically reports a lower vacancy rate
         compared to the apartment association, even though overall trends in both reports are
         similar.
         After hitting near-zero multiple times in recent years, including 1.17% during the second
         quarter of 2017, the vacancy rate has bounced up and down — even nearly reaching 4% in
         late 2019 — before settling at 2.66% for the last two quarters.
         The number of apartments oﬀering concessions also fell in the second quarter, according to
         the Johnson Perkins Griﬀin report.
         Just under 6% of apartments surveyed oﬀered concessions, down from just under 18% in the
         ﬁrst quarter and more than 19% in the fourth quarter of last year when vacancies exceeded
         3%. Apartments in the Johnson Perkins Griﬀin report typically start oﬀering more concessions
         once vacancies reach 3%.
         The most common concessions involve either a free month of rent or reduced rent with a 12-
         month lease. Some apartments are also actively wooing employees working at the

         Gigafactory.
         “A majority of the properties now oﬀering concessions are oﬀering a discount to Tesla and
         other Tahoe Reno Industrial Center employees,” according to Johnson Perkins Griﬀin.
