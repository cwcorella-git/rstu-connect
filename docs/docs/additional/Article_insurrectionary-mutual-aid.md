            From Mobilizations to Insurrectory Mutual Aid
              While too many anarchists wring their hands about the end of the rollicking
            anti-globalization mobilizations of the last decade, others are conspiring a
            resistance of direct action in places where we have a chance to win. The truth
            is that while we learned many valuable organizational and tactical lessons
            during the years after Seattle, most of our energy was spent on largely
            symbolic actions. The real strength of these mobilizations was actually in the
            organizing: the ability to awaken many people to the possibility of resistance
            to global capitalism, as well as providing a catalyst for regional and
            international networks. At no point did these mobilizations actually threaten
            to end world capitalism or seriously challenge State power. or even liberate
            any socio-geographical territory. As anarchists, now is not the time to mourn
            the death of “anti-globe” mobilizations, but move to the next phase of our
            resistance — Insurrectory Mutual Aid.
                  Insurrection — an organized rebellion aimed at overthrowing a
                  constituted government through the use of subversion, sabotage
                  and direct resistance -calling in question the legitimacy and eﬀicacy
## of the government.

              It is through acting and learning to act that we will open a path to
            insurrection. Propaganda does have a role, but that role is limited to clarifying
            actions not inciting them, since its context is dependent on the actions of
            people. Simply put: waiting only teaches waiting; in acting one learns to act.
              The force of an insurrection is not the state’s military response, but the
            social upheaval it generates. Beyond the surface of the armed clash, the
            importance of any particular revolt should be evaluated by how it managed to
            expand the paralysis of normality in a given area and beyond. The Zapatistas
            are a recent example of this. Their limited military clash, less than ten days
            long and 150 people killed, with the government at San Cristobal on New
            Year’s day 1994 was an example of insurrection. It was a success, not because
            of a stunning military victory, but because it was able to disrupt normality in
            Chiapas which is still going on to this day. Recently the Zapatistas have used
            this base in Chiapas to launch a new challenge to the legitimacy of the

            Mexican State and have expanded beyond Chiapas.
               It is this potential expansion that gives an insurrection its power and drives
            the fear behind the state’s reaction. In a crisis or emergency situation, fortune
            favors the rebel, since, crises are by nature (if only temporarily) beyond the
            control of government forces. Governments have numerous contingencies to
            deal with a variety of “acceptable variations” [actual term used in FEMA
            documents] however they lack imagination and the lumbering bureaucracy
            that dominates all governments make it diﬀicult to react to new situations. If
            it falls outside their imaginations they are at a loss to improvise. It can be a
            short step from emergency to the emergence of self-organized resistance.
            Argentina is one recent example of how an economic crisis can transform
            itself into a real counter-force to capitalism and the state.
                  Mutual Aid — a voluntary giving or lending of resources, labor or
## goods to others in a shared community/communities with the
## expectation that the entire community will in turn beneﬁt.

              Mutual Aid is a concept that is familiar to many anarchists, but often not
            fully understood. Mutual aid is not charity nor is it some baroque bartering
            system. It rejects the “tit-for-tat” psychology of modern capitalism while
            challenging the nightmare of communist distribution. Mutual aid is freely
            given help (in the form of services and resources) to others in our community.
            The idea is that as individuals in the community help each other the entire
            community beneﬁts and that in turn supports the individuals own goals. It is
            not dissimilar to the simple concept of sharing. Mutual aid , like charity,
            central communism and capitalism, promotes a speciﬁc ideological system. In
            the case of mutual aid it supports a libertarian ideology where individuals are
            trusted to make economic decisions that promote the entire community.
              The state and its ﬂunkies work from a position that charity is an eﬀective
            tool to re-establish the status quo. In its most recent report on Katrina, FEMA
            summarized the state’s logic on providing assistance to aﬀected people: “All
            aid should be used strategically. The use of sustainable supplies must be
            administered in such a way to maximize compliance with the emergency plan.
            Unfortunately, this may delay some aid but the primacy of maintaining control
            in the ﬁrst few days can not be underestimated.”
              It comes as no surprise that our leaders are willing to let us die while they
            implement their misguided plans to maintain law and order. It is during this
            period of government hesitation that we need to be on the ground providing
            real solidarity for those the state is afraid of and indiﬀerent to. Solidarity is
            more than holding protests, organizing fundraisers and ﬁling indymedia
            reports. Real solidarity requires commitment, risk and preparedness. Mutual
            aid is a direct challenge to the government and the associated NGOs and
            religious institutions that monopolize “helping people.” Mutual aid by
            necessity promotes an egalitarian relationship between individuals and
            groups, where charity and government aid have buttress hierarchical
            relationships of dependence (at best) and oppression (more often). Through
            the solidarity of mutual aid, we can show our commitment to those excluded
            by the government emergency managers and truly reclaim the tactic of
            Propaganda by the Deed.
              However, to be eﬀective we need to prepare now. The inﬂux of supplies and
2 of 5 8/29/25, 11:06 AM Insurrectionary Mutual Aid https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/curious-george-b...
            labor to locally aﬀected communities — that we share aﬀinity with — could
            mean the diﬀerence between the streets of Argentina and the stadiums of
            Louisiana. We must be prepared if a crisis happens tomorrow. A crisis is not
            the time to have fundraisers to get initial supplies. We need to be work on
            getting these things now, so when an emergency occurs, we can act
            immediately.
              Showing up during a crisis is not like summit hopping. Any insurrectionist
            needs to be self-suﬀicient in the basics and have ready access to extra
            supplies of: food, water, medications, power, communications and shelter. It
            should be obvious in emergency situations one can not simply arrive and
            expect to plug-in to an already organized network. Unprepared radicals can
            actually put a strain on scarce resources by showing up unprepared. When
            hundreds of well-intentioned college kids ﬂooded New Orleans during their
            spring break; it did not turn out to be the boon organizers ﬁrst had hopped
            for. The students came without adequate clothes, food, water, shelter and so
            on. One organizer spent an entire afternoon tracking down some medication
            for a student who had assumed they could they important prescription ﬁlled
            at a local drugstore. The organizers were swamped with the logistics of
            supporting these hundreds of volunteers and organizing them to do
            meaningful and much needed work. The Food Not Bombs people provide a
            positive example on how groups of people can organize themselves and be
            adequately prepared enough so the focus can be on the work that needs to be
            done. In the weeks following the hurricane more than a hundred Food Not
            Bomb and related volunteers served thousands of meals to those in need.
            They had their own shelter, communications and supplies. The local
            communities did not need to waste limited energy and resources on these
            volunteers.
              An insurrectionary must also be prepared to deal with real risk. AntiGlobalization mobilizations did a good job of training and preparing us for
            possible arrests and police brutality. Even though the majority of protesters
            were never arrested or beaten with billy-clubs, the very real possibility of
            state violence allowed one to decide what levels of risk one was willing to
            engage in with their aﬀinity groups. We need to be just as honest and talk
            with those in our aﬀinity groups about what level of risk we are willing to
            crisis mobilizations. During emergencies all sorts of laws change and the risk
            of arrests are greatly heightened along with real violence from the state and
            others. Real solidarity is taking similar risks as those most aﬀected, not just
            sitting on the side-lines wishing they luck.
              Insurrectory Mutual Aid is diﬀicult high risk activity that requires a
            substantial of resources and preparedness. It is reasonable to ask if this
            tactics is worth it. As anarchists, the revolution is our constant point of
            reference, precisely because it is a concrete event; it must be built daily
            through more modest attempts which do not have all the liberating
            characteristics of the social revolution in the true sense. These more modest
            attempts are insurrections. In them the uprising of the most exploited and
            excluded of society and the most politically sensitized minority opens the way
            to the possible involvement of increasingly wider strata of exploited on a ﬂux
            of rebellion which could lead to revolution. It is never possible to see the
            outcome of a speciﬁc struggle in advance. Even a limited struggle can have
3 of 5 8/29/25, 11:06 AM Insurrectionary Mutual Aid https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/curious-george-b...
            the most unexpected consequences. The passage from the various
            insurrections — limited and circumscribed — to revolution can never be
            guaranteed in advance by any method.
              Below are some advantages and diﬀiculties involved in practicing
            Insurrectory Mutual Aid:
            The Advantages of Insurrectory Mutual Aid

               - Crisis allows us to refocus and put our energies back into direct action.

               - Connects us with folks that may have never heard about anarchism.

               - Challenge the State and the capitalists on a more even playing ﬁeld.

               - Allow us to test out our assumptions about how societies can be
## organized along anarchist principles.

               - Reinvigorate our anarchist networks by coming together for crisis
## mobilizations.

               - Provide more permanent socio-geographic areas for further resistance.

## • Access to public exposure.

## • Fighting for something, instead of against things.

               - Learn a new skill set that may be more appropriate for wide-spread
## militant resistance.

            Diﬀiculties

               - The stakes are much higher; people could get into serious trouble.

               - The events are spontaneous (as oppose to scheduled events) so it is
## harder to plan for.

## • Requires greater mobility

               - Requires decisiveness. There is often only a small window of opportunity.

               - Greater demand on a functioning inter-network communications system.
                 Issurectionaries need to develop a real-time multiply redundant
## communications system beyond just the internet.

## • Often requires complex logistics.

               - Means working in areas that may have entrenched and baroque internal
                 interests and politics — which we may know very little about.

## • Greater need for self-suﬀiciency.
