``` About us We are the Reno-Sparks Tenants Union, a tenant organization fighting for safe
      and secure housing for all in the
        Reno-Sparks area. We are an
      organization run by tenants, for
                 tenants.
    About us
We believe… Housing is a human right
• Regardless of income level, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, immigration
status, and ability
• Everyone deserves a safe, stable, and comfortable home, regardless of circumstance
• We oppose any laws and policies that criminalize houselessness or target unhoused
people for harassment
                  We fight for tenants, not for housing.

Legislation Governor Lombardo vetoed legislation

• Offering one-year rent stabilization for seniors

• That reformed rental application fees, increased security deposit transparency, and
required rental agreements to include a grace period for late rent payments
• That would halt evictions for up to 60 days for renters who have pending
applications for rental assistance
• Allow local incorporated governments to pass ordinances that would limit the
amount that landlords can demand for the leasing of a home or renewing a lease
• That would change Nevada’s summary eviction process, requiring the landlord to
initiate the eviction process with the court ![Figure from page 10](images/page_010_content/img-000.png) Evictions In Nevada Nevada has a rapid summary eviction process
 • In most states, the landlord must file an
eviction lawsuit with the court
 • In Nevada, if a tenant receives a 7-day
eviction notice, the tenant must file an aﬀidavit with the court
 • If they do not, the tenant is evicted

The eviction process in Nevada places extraordinary burdens on the tenant
                          and favors the landlords
