                 The name given to a principle or theory of life and conduct under
                 which society is conceived without government—harmony in such a
                 society being obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to
## any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the
                 various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for
                 the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction
                 of the inﬁnite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being.

## Basically, if you’re not a utopianist, you’re a schmuck.

## Jonothon Feldman (Indigenous Planning Times)

               What follows are a series of thoughts, sketches of potential theories, and
            tiny manifestos—all meant to oﬀer a glimpse at the outline of a body of radical
            theory that does not actually exist, though it might possibly exist at some
            point in the future.
               Since there are very good reasons why an anarchist anthropology really
            ought to exist, we might start by asking why one doesn’t—or, for that matter,
            why an anarchist sociology doesn’t exist, or an anarchist economics, anarchist
            literary theory, or anarchist political science.
            Why are there so few anarchists in the academy?
               It’s a pertinent question because, as a political philosophy, anarchism is
            veritably exploding right now. Anarchist or anarchist-inspired movements are
            growing everywhere; traditional anarchist principles—autonomy, voluntary
            association, self-organization, mutual aid, direct democracy—have gone from
            the basis for organizing within the globalization movement, to playing the
            same role in radical movements of all kinds everywhere. Revolutionaries in
            Mexico, Argentina, India, and elsewhere have increasingly abandoned even
            talking about seizing power, and begun to formulate radically diﬀerent ideas
            of what a revolution would even mean. Most, admittedly, fall shy of actually
            using the word “anarchist.” But as Barbara Epstein has recently pointed out
            anarchism has by now largely taken the place Marxism had in the social
            movements of the ‘60s: even those who do not consider themselves anarchists
            feel they have to deﬁne themselves in relation to it, and draw on its ideas.
               Yet all this has found almost no reﬂection in the academy. Most academics
            seem to have only the vaguest idea what anarchism is even about; or dismiss
            it with the crudest stereotypes. (“Anarchist organization! But isn’t that a
            contradiction in terms?”) In the United States there are thousands of
            academic Marxists of one sort or another, but hardly a dozen scholars willing
            openly to call themselves anarchists.
               So are academics just behind the curve here? It’s possible. Perhaps in a few
            years the academy will be overrun by anarchists. But I’m not holding my
            breath. It does seem that Marxism has an aﬀinity with the academy that
            anarchism never will. It was, after all, the only great social movement that
            was invented by a Ph.D., even if afterwards, it became a movement intending
            to rally the working class. Most accounts of the history of anarchism assume
            it was basically similar: anarchism is presented as the brainchild of certain
            nineteenth-century thinkers—Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, etc.—it then
            went on to inspire working-class organizations, became enmeshed in political
            struggles, divided into sects... Anarchism, in the standard accounts, usually
            comes out as Marxism’s poorer cousin, theoretically a bit ﬂat-footed but
            making up for brains, perhaps, with passion and sincerity. But in fact, the
            analogy is strained at best. The nineteenth-century “founding ﬁgures” did not
            think of themselves as having invented anything particularly new. The basic
            principles of anarchism— self-organization, voluntary association, mutual aid
2 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            — referred to forms of human behavior they assumed to have been around
            about as long as humanity. The same goes for the rejection of the state and of
            all forms of structural violence, inequality, or domination (anarchism literally
            means “without rulers”), even the assumption that all these forms are
            somehow related and reinforce each other. None of it was presented as some
            startling new doctrine. And in fact it was not: one can ﬁnd records of people
            making similar arguments throughout history, despite the fact there is every
            reason to believe that in most times and places, such opinions were the ones
            least likely to be written down. We are talking less about a body of theory,
            then, than about an attitude, or perhaps one might even say a faith: the
            rejection of certain types of social relations, the conﬁdence that certain others
            would be much better ones on which to build a livable society, the belief that
            such a society could actually exist.
               Even if one compares the historical schools of Marxism, and anarchism, one
            can see we are dealing with a fundamentally diﬀerent sort of project. Marxist
            schools have authors. Just as Marxism sprang from the mind of Marx, so we
            have Leninists, Maoists, Trotksyites, Gramscians, Althusserians... (Note how
            the list starts with heads of state and grades almost seamlessly into French
            professors.) Pierre Bourdieu once noted that, if the academic ﬁeld is a game
            in which scholars strive for dominance, then you know you have won when
            other scholars start wondering how to make an adjective out of your name. It
            is, presumably, to preserve the possibility of winning the game that
            intellectuals insist, in discussing each other, on continuing to employ just the
            sort of Great Man theories of history they would scoﬀ at in just about any
            other context: Foucault’s ideas, like Trotsky’s, are never treated as primarily
            the products of a certain intellectual milieu, as something that emerged from
            endless conversations and arguments involving hundreds of people, but
            always, as if they emerged from the genius of a single man (or, very
            occasionally, woman). It’s not quite either that Marxist politics organized itself
            like an academic discipline or that it has become a model for how radical
            intellectuals, or increasingly, all intellectuals, treated one another; rather, the
            two developed somewhat in tandem. From the perspective of the academy,
            this led to many salutary results—the feeling there should be some moral
            center, that academic concerns should be relevant to people’s lives—but also,
            many disastrous ones: turning much intellectual debate into a kind of parody
            of sectarian politics, with everyone trying to reduce each others’ arguments
            into ridiculous caricatures so as to declare them not only wrong, but also evil
            and dangerous—even if the debate is usually taking place in language so
            arcane that no one who could not aﬀord seven years of grad school would
            have any way of knowing the debate was going on.
               Now consider the diﬀerent schools of anarchism. There are AnarchoSyndicalists, Anarcho-Communists, Insurrectionists, Cooperativists,
            Individualists, Platformists... None are named after some Great Thinker;
            instead, they are invariably named either after some kind of practice, or most
            often, organizational principle. (Signiﬁcantly, those Marxist tendencies which
            are not named after individuals, like Autonomism or Council Communism, are
            also the ones closest to anarchism.) Anarchists like to distinguish themselves
            by what they do, and how they organize themselves to go about doing it. And
            indeed this has always been what anarchists have spent most of their time
3 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            thinking and arguing about. Anarchists have never been much interested in
            the kinds of broad strategic or philosophical questions that have historically
            preoccupied Marxists—questions like: Are the peasants a potentially
            revolutionary class? (Anarchists consider this something for the peasants to
            decide.) What is the nature of the commodity form? Rather, they tend to argue
            with each other about what is the truly democratic way to go about a meeting,
            at what point organization stops being empowering and starts squelching
            individual freedom. Or, alternately, about the ethics of opposing power: What
            is direct action? Is it necessary (or right) to publicly condemn someone who
            assassinates a head of state? Or can assassination, especially if it prevents
            something terrible, like a war, be a moral act? When is it okay to break a
            window?
              To sum up then:

              1. Marxism has tended to be a theoretical or analytical discourse about
## revolutionary strategy.

              2. Anarchism has tended to be an ethical discourse about revolutionary
## practice.

              Obviously, everything I’ve said has been something of a caricature (there
            have been wildly sectarian anarchist groups, and plenty of libertarian,
            practice-oriented Marxists including, arguably, myself). Still, even so stated,
            this does suggest a great deal of potential complementarity between the two.
            And indeed there has been: even Mikhail Bakunin, for all his endless battles
            with Marx over practical questions, also personally translated Marx’s Capital
            into Russian. But it also makes it easier to understand why there are so few
            anarchists in the academy. It’s not just that anarchism does not tend to have
            much use for high theory. It’s that it is primarily concerned with forms of
            practice; it insists, before anything else, that one’s means must be consonant
            with one’s ends; one cannot create freedom through authoritarian means; in
            fact, as much as possible, one must oneself, in one’s relations with one’s
            friends and allies, embody the society one wishes to create. This does not
            square very well with operating within the university, perhaps the only
            Western institution other than the Catholic Church and British monarchy that
            has survived in much the same form from the Middle Ages, doing intellectual
            battle at conferences in expensive hotels, and trying to pretend all this
            somehow furthers revolution. At the very least, one would imagine being an
            openly anarchist professor would mean challenging the way universities are
            run—and I don’t mean by demanding an anarchist studies department, either
            —and that, of course, is going to get one in far more trouble than anything
            one could ever write.
            This does not mean anarchist theory is impossible.
               This doesn’t mean anarchists have to be against theory. After all, anarchism
            is, itself, an idea, even if a very old one. It is also a project, which sets out to
            begin creating the institutions of a new society “within the shell of the old,” to
            expose, subvert, and undermine structures of domination but always, while
4 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            doing so, proceeding in a democratic fashion, a manner which itself
            demonstrates those structures are unnecessary. Clearly any such project has
            need of the tools of intellectual analysis and understanding. It might not need
            High Theory, in the sense familiar today. Certainly it will not need one single,
            Anarchist High Theory. That would be completely inimical to its spirit. Much
            better, I think, something more in the spirit of anarchist decision-making
            processes, employed in anything from tiny aﬀinity groups to gigantic
            spokescouncils of thousands of people. Most anarchist groups operate by a
            consensus process which has been developed, in many ways, to be the exact
            opposite of the high-handed, divisive, sectarian style so popular amongst
            other radical groups. Applied to theory, this would mean accepting the need
            for a diversity of high theoretical perspectives, united only by certain shared
            commitments and understandings. In consensus process, everyone agrees
            from the start on certain broad principles of unity and purposes for being for
            the group; but beyond that they also accept as a matter of course that no one
            is ever going to convert another person completely to their point of view, and
            probably shouldn’t try; and that therefore discussion should focus on concrete
            questions of action, and coming up with a plan that everyone can live with and
            no one feels is in fundamental violation of their principles. One could see a
            parallel here: a series of diverse perspectives, joined together by their shared
            desire to understand the human condition, and move it in the direction of
            greater freedom. Rather than be based on the need to prove others’
            fundamental assumptions wrong, it seeks to ﬁnd particular projects on which
            they reinforce each other. Just because theories are incommensurable in
            certain respects does not mean they cannot exist or even reinforce each other,
            any more than the fact that individuals have unique and incommensurable
            views of the world means they cannot become friends, or lovers, or work on
            common projects.
              Even more than High Theory, what anarchism needs is what might be called
            Low Theory: a way of grappling with those real, immediate questions that
            emerge from a transformative project. Mainstream social science actually
            isn’t much help here, because normally in mainstream social science this sort
            of thing is generally classiﬁed as “policy issues,” and no self-respecting
            anarchist would have anything to do with these.
                 against policy (a tiny manifesto):
                 The notion of “policy” presumes a state or governing apparatus
                 which imposes its will on others. “Policy” is the negation of politics;
                 policy is by deﬁnition something concocted by some form of elite,
                 which presumes it knows better than others how their aﬀairs are to
                 be conducted. By participating in policy debates the very best one
                 can achieve is to limit the damage, since the very premise is
## inimical to the idea of people managing their own aﬀairs.

              So in this case, the question becomes: What sort of social theory would
            actually be of interest to those who are trying to help bring about a world in
            which people are free to govern their own aﬀairs?
              This is what this pamphlet is mainly about.
              For starters, I would say any such theory would have to begin with some
5 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            initial assumptions. Not many. Probably just two. First, it would have to
            proceed from the assumption that, as the Brazilian folk song puts it, “another
            world is possible.” That institutions like the state, capitalism, racism and male
            dominance are not inevitable; that it would be possible to have a world in
            which these things would not exist, and that we’d all be better oﬀ as a result.
            To commit oneself to such a principle is almost an act of faith, since how can
            one have certain knowledge of such matters? It might possibly turn out that
            such a world is not possible. But one could also make the argument that it’s
            this very unavailability of absolute knowledge which makes a commitment to
            optimism a moral imperative: Since one cannot know a radically better world
            is not possible, are we not betraying everyone by insisting on continuing to
            justify, and reproduce, the mess we have today? And anyway, even if we’re
            wrong, we might well get a lot closer.
                 against anti-utopianism (another tiny manifesto):
                 Here of course one has to deal with the inevitable objection: that
                 utopianism has lead to unmitigated horror, as Stalinists, Maoists,
                 and other idealists tried to carve society into impossible shapes,
## killing millions in the process.

              This argument belies a fundamental misconception: that imagining better
            worlds was itself the problem. Stalinists and their ilk did not kill because they
            dreamed great dreams—actually, Stalinists were famous for being rather
            short on imagination—but because they mistook their dreams for scientiﬁc
            certainties. This led them to feel they had a right to impose their visions
            through a machinery of violence. Anarchists are proposing nothing of the sort,
            on either count. They presume no inevitable course of history and one can
            never further the course of freedom by creating new forms of coercion. In fact
            all forms of systemic violence are (among other things) assaults on the role of
            the imagination as a political principle, and the only way to begin to think
            about eliminating systematic violence is by recognizing this.
              And of course one could write very long books about the atrocities
            throughout history carried out by cynics and other pessimists...
              So that’s the ﬁrst proposition. The second, I’d say, is that any anarchist
            social theory would have to reject self-consciously any trace of vanguardism.
            The role of intellectuals is most deﬁnitively not to form an elite that can arrive
            at the correct strategic analyses and then lead the masses to follow. But if not
            that, what? This is one reason I’m calling this essay “Fragments of an
            Anarchist Anthropology”—because this is one area where I think anthropology
            is particularly well positioned to help. And not only because most actuallyexisting self-governing communities, and actually-existing non-market
            economies in the world have been investigated by anthropologists rather than
            sociologists or historians. It is also because the practice of ethnography
            provides at least something of a model, if a very rough, incipient model, of
            how nonvanguardist revolutionary intellectual practice might work. When one
            carries out an ethnography, one observes what people do, and then tries to
6 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            tease out the hidden symbolic, moral, or pragmatic logics that underlie their
            actions; one tries to get at the way people’s habits and actions makes sense in
            ways that they are not themselves completely aware of. One obvious role for a
            radical intellectual is to do precisely that: to look at those who are creating
            viable alternatives, try to ﬁgure out what might be the larger implications of
            what they are (already) doing, and then oﬀer those ideas back, not as
            prescriptions, but as contributions, possibilities—as gifts. This is more or less
            what I was trying to do a few paragraphs ago when I suggested that social
            theory could refashion itself in the manner of direct democratic process. And
            as that example makes clear, such a project would actually have to have two
            aspects, or moments if you like: one ethnographic, one utopian, suspended in
            a constant dialogue.
              None of this has much to do with what anthropology, even radical
            anthropology, has actually been like over the last hundred years or so. Still,
            there has been a strange aﬀinity, over the years, between anthropology and
            anarchism which is in itself signiﬁcant.
            Graves, Brown, Mauss, Sorel
              It’s not so much that anthropologists embraced anarchism, or even, were
            consciously espousing anarchist ideas; it’s more that they moved in the same
            circles, their ideas tended to bounce oﬀ one another, that there was
            something about anthropological thought in particular—its keen awareness of
            the very range of human possibilities—that gave it an aﬀinity to anarchism
            from the very beginning.
              Let me start with Sir James Frazer, even though he was the furthest thing
            from an anarchist. Frazer, chair of anthropology in Cambridge at the turn of
            the (last) century, was a classic stodgy Victorian who wrote accounts of
            savage customs, based mainly on the results of questionnaires sent out to
            missionaries and colonial oﬀicials. His ostensible theoretical attitude was
            utterly condescending—he believed almost all magic, myth and ritual was
            based on foolish logical mistakes—but his magnum opus, The Golden Bough,
            contained such ﬂorid, fanciful, and strangely beautiful descriptions of tree
            spirits, eunuch priests, dying vegetation gods, and the sacriﬁce of divine
            kings, that he inspired a generation of poets and literati. Among them was
            Robert Graves, a British poet who ﬁrst became famous for writing bitingly
            satirical verse from the trenches of World War I. At the end of the war, Graves
            ended up in a hospital in France where he was cured of shell shock by W. H.
            R. Rivers, the British anthropologist famous for the Torres Straits Expedition,
            who doubled as a psychiatrist. Graves was so impressed by Rivers that he was
            later to suggest professional anthropologists be placed in charge of all world
            governments. Not a particularly anarchist sentiment, certainly—but Graves
            tended to dart about between all sorts of odd political positions. In the end, he
            was to abandon “civilization”—industrial society—entirely and spend the last
            ﬁfty years or so of his life in a village on the Spanish island of Majorca,
            supporting himself by writing novels, but also producing numerous books of

            love poetry, and a series of some of the most subversive essays ever written.
              Graves’ thesis was, among other things, that greatness was a pathology;
            “great men” were essentially destroyers and “great” poets not much better
            (his arch-enemies were Virgil, Milton and Pound), that all real poetry is and
            has always been a mythic celebration of an ancient Supreme Goddess, of
            whom Frazer had only confused glimmerings, and whose matriarchal
            followers were conquered and destroyed by Hitler’s beloved Aryan hoards
            when they emerged from the Ukrainian Steppes in the early Bronze Age
            (though they survived a bit longer in Minoan Crete). In a book called The
            White Goddess: An Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth, he claimed to map out
            the rudiments of her calendar rites in diﬀerent parts of Europe, focusing on
            the periodic ritual murder of the Goddess’ royal consorts, among other things
            a sureﬁre way of guaranteeing would-be great men do not get out of hand,
            and ending the book with a call for an eventual industrial collapse. I say
            “claimed” advisedly here. The delightful, if also confusing, thing about
            Graves’ books is that he’s obviously having so much fun writing them,
            throwing out one outrageous thesis after another, that it’s impossible to tell
            how much of it is meant to be taken seriously. Or whether that’s even a
            meaningful question. In one essay, written in the ‘50s, Graves invents the
            distinction between “reasonableness” and “rationality” later made famous by
            Stephen Toulmin in the ‘80s, but he does it in the course of an essay written
            to defend Socrates’ wife, Xanthippe, from her reputation as an atrocious nag.
            (His argument: imagine you had been married to Socrates.)
              Did Graves really believe that women are always superior to men? Did he
            really expect us to believe he had solved one mythical problem by falling into
            an “analeptic trance” and overhearing a conversation about ﬁsh between a
            Greek historian and Roman oﬀicial in Cyprus in 54 CE? It’s worth wondering,
            because for all their current obscurity, in these writings, Graves essentially
            invented two diﬀerent intellectual traditions which were later to become
            major theoretical strains in modern anarchism—if admittedly, generally
            considered two of the most outré. On the one hand, the cult of the Great
            Goddess has been revived and become a direct inspiration for Pagan
            Anarchism, hippyish performers of spiral dances who are always welcome at
            mass actions because they do seem to have rather a knack for inﬂuencing the
            weather; on the other, Primitivists, whose most famous (and extreme) avatar
            is John Zerzan, who has taken Graves’ rejection of industrial civilization and
            hopes for general economic collapse even further, arguing that even
            agriculture was a great historical mistake. Both the Pagans and the
            Primitivists, curiously, share exactly that ineﬀable quality which makes
            Graves’ work so distinctive: it’s really impossible to know on what level one is
            supposed to read it. It’s both ridiculous self-parody, and terribly serious, at
            the same time.
              There have also been anthropologists—among them, some of the founding
            ﬁgures of the discipline— who have themselves dabbled with anarchist, or
            anarchistic, politics.
              The most notorious case was that of a turn of the century student named Al
            Brown, known to his college friends as “Anarchy Brown.” Brown was an
            admirer of the famous anarchist Prince (he of course renounced his title),
            Peter Kropotkin, arctic explorer and naturalist, who had thrown social
8 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            Darwinism into a tumult from which it still has never quite recovered by
            documenting how the most successful species tend to be those which
            cooperate the most eﬀectively. (Sociobiology for instance was basically an
            attempt to come up with an answer to Kropotkin.) Later, Brown was to begin
            aﬀecting a cloak and a monocle, adopting a fancy mock-aristocratic
            hyphenated name (A. R. Radcliﬀe-Brown), and ultimately, in the 1920s and
            ‘30s, becoming the master theorist of British social anthropology. The older
            Brown didn’t like to talk too much about his youthful politics, but it’s probably
            no coincidence that his main theoretical interest remained the maintenance of
            social order outside the state.
              Perhaps the most intriguing case though is that of Marcel Mauss, RadcliﬀeBrown’s contemporary, and the inventor of French anthropology. Mauss was a
            child of Orthodox Jewish parents who had the mixed blessing of also being the
            nephew of Emile Durkheim, the founder of French sociology. Mauss was also a
            revolutionary socialist. For much of his life, he managed a consumer coop in
            Paris, and was constantly writing screeds for socialist newspapers, carrying
            out projects of research on coops in other countries, and trying to create links
            between coops in order to build an alternative, anti-capitalist, economy. His
            most famous work was written in response to the crisis of socialism he saw in
            Lenin’s reintroduction of the market in the Soviet Union in the ‘20s: If it was
            impossible to simply legislate the money economy away, even in Russia, the
            least monetarized society in Europe, then perhaps revolutionaries needed to
            start looking at the ethnographic record to see what sort of creature the
            market really was, and what viable alternatives to capitalism might look like.
            Hence his “Essay on the Gift,” written in 1925, which argued (among other
            things) that the origin of all contracts lies in communism, an unconditional
            commitment to another’s needs, and that despite endless economic textbooks
            to the contrary, there has never been an economy based on barter: that
            actually-existing societies which do not employ money have instead been gift
            economies in which the distinctions we now make between interest and
            altruism, person and property, freedom and obligation, simply did not exist.
              Mauss believed socialism could never be built by state ﬁat but only
            gradually, from below, that it was possible to begin building a new society
            based on mutual aid and self-organization “in the shell of the old”; he felt that
            existing popular practices provided the basis both for a moral critique of
            capitalism and possible glimpses of what that future society would be like. All
            of these are classic anarchist positions. Still, he did not consider himself an
            anarchist. In fact, he never had anything good to say about them. This was, it
            appears, because he identiﬁed anarchism mainly with the ﬁgure of Georges
            Sorel, an apparently quite personally distasteful French anarcho-syndicalist
            and anti-Semite, now mainly famous for his essay Reﬂections sur le Violence.
            Sorel argued that since the masses were not fundamentally good or rational,
            it was foolish to make one’s primary appeal to them through reasoned
            arguments. Politics is the art of inspiring others with great myths. For
            revolutionaries, he proposed the myth of an apocalyptic General Strike, a
            moment of total transformation. To maintain it, he added, one would need a
            revolutionary elite capable of keeping the myth alive by their willingness to
            engage in symbolic acts of violence—an elite which, like the Marxist vanguard
            party (often somewhat less symbolic in its violence), Mauss described as a
9 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            kind of perpetual conspiracy, a modern version of the secret political men’s
            societies of the ancient world.
               In other words, Mauss saw Sorel, and hence anarchism, as introducing an
            element of the irrational, of violence, and of vanguardism. It might seem a bit
            odd that among French revolutionaries of the time, it should have been the
            trade unionist emphasizing the power of myth, and the anthropologist
            objecting, but in the context of the ‘20s and ‘30s, with fascist stirrings
            everywhere, it’s understandable why a European radical-—especially a Jewish
            one-—might see all this as just a little creepy. Creepy enough to throw cold
            water even on the otherwise rather appealing image of the General Strike—
            which is after all about the least violent possible way to imagine an
            apocalyptic revolution. By the ‘40s, Mauss concluded his suspicions had
            proved altogether justiﬁed.
               To the doctrine of the revolutionary vanguard, he wrote, Sorel added a
            notion originally culled from Mauss’ own uncle Durkheim: a doctrine of
            corporatism, of vertical structures glued together by techniques of social
            solidarity. This he said was a great inﬂuence on Lenin, by Lenin’s own
            admission. From there it was adopted by the Right. By the end of his life,
            Sorel himself had become increasingly sympathetic with fascism; in this he
            followed the same trajectory as Mussolini (another youthful dabbler with
            anarcho-syndicalism) and who, Mauss believed, took these same
            Durkheimian/Sorelian/Leninist ideas to their ultimate conclusions. By the end
            of his life, Mauss became convinced even Hitler’s great ritual pageants, torchlit parades with their chants of “Seig Heil!,” were really inspired by accounts
            he and his uncle had written about totemic rituals of Australian aborigines.
            “When we were describing how ritual can create social solidarity, of
            submerging the individual in the mass,” he complained, “it never occurred to
            us that anyone would apply such techniques in the modern day!” (In fact,
            Mauss was mistaken. Modern research has shown Nuremberg rallies were
            actually inspired by Harvard pep rallies. But this is another story.) The
            outbreak of war destroyed Mauss, who had never completely recovered from
            losing most of his closest friends in the First World War. When the Nazis took
            Paris he refused to ﬂee, but sat in his oﬀice every day with a pistol in his desk,
            waiting for the Gestapo to arrive. They never did, but the terror, and weight of
            his feelings of historical complicity, ﬁnally shattered his sanity.
            The anarchist anthropology that almost already does
            exist
              In the end, though, Marcel Mauss has probably had more inﬂuence on
            anarchists than all the other ones combined. This is because he was
            interested in alternative moralities, which opened the way to thinking that
            societies without states and markets were the way they were because they
            actively wished to live that way. Which in our terms means, because they were
            anarchists. Insofar as fragments of an anarchist anthropology do, already,
            exist, they largely derive from him.
              Before Mauss, the universal assumption had been that economies without
            money or markets had operated by means of “barter”; they were trying to
10 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            engage in market behavior (acquire useful goods and services at the least cost
            to themselves, get rich if possible...), they just hadn’t yet developed very
            sophisticated ways of going about it. Mauss demonstrated that in fact, such
            economies were really “gift economies.” They were not based on calculation,
            but on a refusal to calculate; they were rooted in an ethical system which
            consciously rejected most of what we would consider the basic principles of
            economics. It was not that they had not yet learned to seek proﬁt through the
            most eﬀicient means. They would have found the very premise that the point
            of an economic transaction—at least, one with someone who was not your
            enemy—was to seek the greatest proﬁt deeply oﬀensive.
              It is signiﬁcant that the one (of the few) overtly anarchist anthropologists of
            recent memory, another Frenchman, Pierre Clastres, became famous for
            making a similar argument on the political level. He insisted political
            anthropologists had still not completely gotten over the old evolutionist
            perspectives that saw the state primarily as a more sophisticated form of
            organization than what had come before; stateless peoples, such as the
            Amazonian societies Clastres studied, were tacitly assumed not to have
            attained the level of say, the Aztecs or the Inca. But what if, he proposed,
            Amazonians were not entirely unaware of what the elementary forms of state
            power might be like—what it would mean to allow some men to give everyone
            else orders which could not be questioned, since they were backed up by the
            threat of force—and were for that very reason determined to ensure such
            things never came about? What if they considered the fundamental premises
            of our political science morally objectionable?
              The parallels between the two arguments are actually quite striking. In gift
            economies there are, often, venues for enterprising individuals: But
            everything is arranged in such a way they could never be used as a platform
            for creating permanent inequalities of wealth, since self-aggrandizing types
            all end up competing to see who can give the most away. In Amazonian (or
            North American) societies, the institution of the chief played the same role on
            a political level: the position was so demanding, and so little rewarding, so
            hedged about by safeguards, that there was no way for power-hungry
            individuals to do much with it. Amazonians might not have literally whacked
            oﬀ the ruler’s head every few years, but it’s not an entirely inappropriate
            metaphor.
              By these lights these were all, in a very real sense, anarchist societies. They
            were founded on an explicit rejection of the logic of the state and of the
            market.
                 They are, however, extremely imperfect ones. The most common
                 criticism of Clastres is to ask how his Amazonians could really be
                 organizing their societies against the emergence of something they
                 have never actually experienced. A naive question, but it points to
## something equally naive in Clastres’ own approach. Clastres
                 manages to talk blithely about the uncompromised egalitarianism of
                 the very same Amazonian societies, for instance, famous for their
                 use of gang rape as a weapon to terrorize women who transgress
                 proper gender roles. It’s a blind spot so glaring one has to wonder
                 how he could possibly miss out on it; especially considering it
11 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
                 provides an answer to just that question. Perhaps Amazonian men
                 understand what arbitrary, unquestionable power, backed by force,
                 would be like because they themselves wield that sort of power over
                 their wives and daughters. Perhaps for that very reason they would
## not like to see structures capable of inﬂicting it on them.

                 It’s worth pointing out because Clastres is, in many ways, a naive
                 romantic. Fom another perspective, though, there’s no mystery here
                 at all. After all, we are talking about the fact that most Amazonians
                 don’t want to give others the power to threaten them with physical
                 injury if they don’t do as they are told. Maybe we should better be
                 asking what it says about ourselves that we feel this attitude needs
## any sort of explanation.

            toward a theory of imaginary counterpower
               This is what I mean by an alternative ethics, then. Anarchistic societies are
            no more unaware of human capacities for greed or vainglory than modern
            Americans are unaware of human capacities for envy, gluttony, or sloth; they
            would just ﬁnd them equally unappealing as the basis for their civilization. In
            fact, they see these phenomena as moral dangers so dire they end up
            organizing much of their social life around containing them.
               If this were a purely theoretical essay I would explain that all this suggests
            an interesting way of synthesizing theories of value and theories of resistance.
            For present purposes, suﬀice it to say that I think Mauss and Clastres have
            succeeded, somewhat despite themselves, in laying the groundwork for a
            theory of revolutionary counterpower.
               I’m afraid this is a somewhat complicated argument. Let me take it one step
            at a time.
               In typical revolutionary discourse a “counterpower” is a collection of social
            institutions set in opposition to the state and capital: from selfgoverning
            communities to radical labor unions to popular militias. Sometimes it is also
            referred to as an “anti-power.” When such institutions maintain themselves in
            the face of the state, this is usually referred to as a “dual power” situation. By
            this deﬁnition most of human history is actually characterized by dual power
            situations, since few historical states had the means to root such institutions
            out, even assuming that they would have wanted to. But Mauss and Clastres’
            argument suggests something even more radical. It suggests that
            counterpower, at least in the most elementary sense, actually exists where the
            states and markets are not even present; that in such cases, rather than being
            embodied in popular institutions which pose themselves against the power of
            lords, or kings, or plutocrats, they are embodied in institutions which ensure
            such types of person never come about. What it is “counter” to, then, is a
            potential, a latent aspect, or dialectical possibility if you prefer, within the
            society itself.
               This at least would help explain an otherwise peculiar fact; the way in which
            it is often particularly the egalitarian societies which are torn by terrible inner
            tensions, or at least, extreme forms of symbolic violence.
               Of course, all societies are to some degree at war with themselves. There
12 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            are always clashes between interests, factions, classes and the like; also,
            social systems are always based on the pursuit of diﬀerent forms of value
            which pull people in diﬀerent directions. In egalitarian societies, which tend
            to place an enormous emphasis on creating and maintaining communal
            consensus, this often appears to spark a kind of equally elaborate reaction
            formation, a spectral nightworld inhabited by monsters, witches or other
            creatures of horror. And it’s the most peaceful societies which are also the
            most haunted, in their imaginative constructions of the cosmos, by constant
            specters of perennial war. The invisible worlds surrounding them are literally
            battlegrounds. It’s as if the endless labor of achieving consensus masks a
            constant inner violence— or, it might perhaps be better to say, is in fact the
            process by which that inner violence is measured and contained—and it is
            precisely this, and the resulting tangle of moral contradiction, which is the
            prime font of social creativity. It’s not these conﬂicting principles and
            contradictory impulses themselves which are the ultimate political reality,
            then; it’s the regulatory process which mediates them.
              Some examples might help here:
              Case 1: The Piaroa, a highly egalitarian society living along tributaries of
            the Orinoco which ethnographer Joanna Overing herself describes as
            anarchists. They place enormous value on individual freedom and autonomy,
            and are quite selfconscious about the importance of ensuring that no one is
            ever at another person’s orders, or the need to ensure no one gains such
            control over economic resources that they can use it to constrain others’
            freedom. Yet they also insist that Piaroa culture itself was the creation of an
            evil god, a two-headed cannibalistic buﬀoon. The Piaroa have developed a
            moral philosophy which deﬁnes the human condition as caught between a
            “world of the senses,” of wild, pre-social desires, and a “world of thought.”
            Growing up involves learning to control and channel in the former through
            thoughtful consideration for others, and the cultivation of a sense of humor;
            but this is made inﬁnitely more diﬀicult by the fact that all forms of technical
            knowledge, however necessary for life are, due to their origins, laced with
            elements of destructive madness. Similarly, while the Piaroa are famous for
            their peaceableness—murder is unheard of, the assumption being that anyone
            who killed another human being would be instantly consumed by pollution
            and die horribly—they inhabit a cosmos of endless invisible war, in which
            wizards are engaged in fending oﬀ the attacks of insane, predatory gods and
            all deaths are caused by spiritual murder and have to be avenged by the
            magical massacre of whole (distant, unknown) communities.
              Case 2: The Tiv, another notoriously egalitarian society, make their homes
            along the Benue River in central Nigeria. Compared to the Piaroa, their
            domestic life is quite hierarchical: male elders tend to have many wives, and
            exchange with one another the rights to younger women’s fertility; younger
            men are thus reduced to spending most of their lives chilling their heels as
            unmarried dependents in their fathers’ compounds. In recent centuries the
            Tiv were never entirely insulated from the raids of slave traders; Tivland was
            also dotted with local markets; minor wars between clans were occasionally
            fought, though more often large disputes were mediated in large communal
            “moots.” Still, there were no political institutions larger than the compound;
            in fact, anything that even began to look like a political institution was
13 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            considered intrinsically suspect, or more precisely, seen as surrounded by an
            aura of occult horror. This was, as ethnographer Paul Bohannan succinctly put
            it, because of what was seen to be the nature of power: “men attain power by
            consuming the substance of others.” Markets were protected, and market
            rules enforced by charms which embodied diseases and were said to be
            powered by human body parts and blood. Enterprising men who managed to
            patch together some sort of fame, wealth, or clientele were by deﬁnition
            witches. Their hearts were coated by a substance called tsav, which could only
            be augmented by the eating of human ﬂesh. Most tried to avoid doing so, but
            a secret society of witches was said to exist which would slip bits of human
            ﬂesh in their victims’ food, thus incurring a “ﬂesh debt” and unnatural
            cravings that would eventually drive those aﬀected to consume their entire
            families. This imaginary society of witches was seen as the invisible
            government of the country. Power was thus institutionalized evil, and every
            generation, a witch-ﬁnding movement would arise to expose the culprits, thus,
            eﬀectively, destroying any emerging structures of authority.
               Case 3: Highland Madagascar, where I lived between 1989 and 1991, was a
            rather diﬀerent place. The area had been the center of a Malagasy state— the
            Merina kingdom—since the early nineteenth century, and afterwards endured
            many years of harsh colonial rule. There was a market economy and, in
            theory, a central government—during the time I was there, largely dominated
            by what was called the “Merina bourgeoisie.” In fact this government had
            eﬀectively withdrawn from most of the countryside and rural communities
            were eﬀectively governing themselves. In many ways these could also be
            considered anarchistic: most local decisions were made by consensus by
            informal bodies, leadership was looked on at best with suspicion, it was
            considered wrong for adults to be giving one another orders, especially on an
            ongoing basis; this was considered to make even institutions like wage labor
            inherently morally suspect. Or to be more precise, unmalagasy—this was how
            the French behaved, or wicked kings and slaveholders long ago. Society was
            overall remarkably peaceable. Yet once again it was surrounded by invisible
            warfare; just about everyone had access to dangerous medicine or spirits or
            was willing to let on they might; the night was haunted by witches who
            danced naked on tombs and rode men like horses; just about all sickness was
            due to envy, hatred, and magical attack. What’s more, witchcraft bore a
            strange, ambivalent relation to national identity. While people made rhetorical
            reference to Malagasy as equal and united “like hairs on a head,” ideals of
            economic equality were rarely, if ever, invoked; however, it was assumed that
            anyone who became too rich or powerful would be destroyed by witchcraft,
            and while witchcraft was the deﬁnition of evil, it was also seen as peculiarly
            Malagasy (charms were just charms but evil charms were called “Malagasy
            charms”). Insofar as rituals of moral solidarity did occur, and the ideal of
            equality was invoked, it was largely in the course of rituals held to suppress,
            expel, or destroy those witches who, perversely, were the twisted embodiment
            and practical enforcement of the egalitarian ethos of the society itself.
               Note how in each case there’s a striking contrast between the cosmological
            content, which is nothing if not tumultuous, and social process, which is all
            about mediation, arriving at consensus. None of these societies are entirely
            egalitarian: there are always certain key forms of dominance, at least of men
14 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            over women, elders over juniors. The nature and intensity of these forms vary
            enormously: in Piaroa communities the hierarchies were so modest that
            Overing doubts one can really speak of “male dominance” at all (despite the
            fact that communal leaders are invariably male); the Tiv appear to be quite
            another story. Still, structural inequalities invariably exist, and as a result I
            think it is fair to say that these anarchies are not only imperfect, they contain
            with them the seeds of their own destruction. It is hardly a coincidence that
            when larger, more systematically violent forms of domination do emerge, they
            draw on precisely these idioms of age and gender to justify themselves.
               Still, I think it would be a mistake to see the invisible violence and terror as
            simply a working out of the “internal contradictions” created by those forms
            of inequality. One could, perhaps, make the case that most real, tangible
            violence is. At least, it is a somewhat notorious thing that, in societies where
            the only notable inequalities are based in gender, the only murders one is
            likely to observe are men killing each other over women. Similarly, it does
            seem to be the case, generally speaking, that the more pronounced the
            diﬀerences between male and female roles in a society, the more physically
            violent it tends to be. But this hardly means that if all inequalities vanished,
            then everything, even the imagination, would become placid and untroubled.
            To some degree, I suspect all this turbulence stems from the very nature of
            the human condition. There would appear to be no society which does not see
            human life as fundamentally a problem. However much they might diﬀer on
            what they deem the problem to be, at the very least, the existence of work,
            sex, and reproduction are seen as fraught with all sorts of quandaries; human
            desires are always ﬁckle; and then there’s the fact that we’re all going to die.
            So there’s a lot to be troubled by. None of these dilemmas are going to vanish
            if we eliminate structural inequalities (much though I think this would
            radically improve things in just about every other way). Indeed, the fantasy
            that it might, that the human condition, desire, mortality, can all be somehow
            resolved seems to be an especially dangerous one, an image of utopia which
            always seems to lurk somewhere behind the pretentions of Power and the
            state. Instead, as I’ve suggested, the spectral violence seems to emerge from
            the very tensions inherent in the project of maintaining an egalitarian society.
            Otherwise, one would at least imagine the Tiv imagination would be more
            tumultuous than the Piaroa.
                 That the state emerged from images of an impossible resolution of
                 the human condition was Clastres’ point as well. He argued that
                 historically, the institution of the state could not have possibly
                 emerged from the political institutions of anarchist societies, which
                 were designed to ensure this never happened. Instead, it could only
                 have been from religious institutions: he pointed to the Tupinamba
                 prophets who led the whole population on a vast migration in search
                 of a “land without evil.” Of course, in later contexts, what Peter
## Lamborn Wilson calls “the Clastrian machine,” that set of
                 mechanisms which oppose the emergence of domination, what I’m
                 calling the apparatus of counterpower, can itself become caught in
## such apocalyptic fantasies.

              Now, at this point the reader may be objecting, “Sure, but what does any of
15 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            this have to do with the kind of insurrectionary communities which
            revolutionary theorists are normally referring to when they use the word
            ‘counterpower’?”
              Here it might be useful to look at the diﬀerence between the ﬁrst two cases
            and the third— because the Malagasy communities I knew in 1990 were living
            in something which in many ways resembled an insurrectionary situation.
            Between the nineteenth century and the twentieth, there had been a
            remarkable transformation of popular attitudes. Just about all reports from
            the last century insisted that, despite widespread resentment against the
            corrupt and often brutal Malagasy government, no one questioned the
            legitimacy of the monarchy itself, or particularly, their absolute personal
            loyalty to the Queen. Neither would anyone explicitly question the legitimacy
            of slavery. After the French conquest of the island in 1895, followed
            immediately by the abolition of both the monarchy and slavery, all this seems
            to have changed extremely quickly. Before a generation was out, one began to
            encounter the attitude that I found to be well-nigh universal in the
            countryside a hundred years later: slavery was evil, and monarchs were seen
            as inherently immoral because they treated others like slaves. In the end, all
            relations of command (military service, wage labor, forced labor) came to be
            fused together in people’s minds as variations on slavery; the very institutions
            which had previously been seen as beyond challenge were now the deﬁnition
            of illegitimacy, and this, especially among those who had the least access to
            higher education and French Enlightenment ideas. Being “Malagasy” came to
            be deﬁned as rejecting such foreign ways. If one combines this attitude with
            constant passive resistance to state institutions, and the elaboration of
            autonomous, and relatively egalitarian modes of self-government, one could
            see what happened as a revolution. After the ﬁnancial crisis of the ‘80s, the
            state in much of the country eﬀectively collapsed, or anyway devolved into a
            matter of hollow form without the backing of systematic coercion. Rural
            people carried on much as they had before, going to oﬀices periodically to ﬁll
            out forms even though they were no longer paying any real taxes, the
            government was hardly providing services, and in the event of theft or even
            murder, police would no longer come. If a revolution is a matter of people
            resisting some form of power identiﬁed as oppressive, identifying some key
            aspect of that power as the source of what is fundamentally objectionable
            about it, and then trying to get rid of one’s oppressors in such a way as to try
            to eliminate that sort of power completely from daily life, then it is hard to
            deny that, in some sense, this was indeed a revolution. It might not have
            involved an actual uprising, but it was a revolution nonetheless.
              How long it would last is another question; it was a very fragile, tenuous
            sort of freedom. Many such enclaves have collapsed—in Madagascar as
            elsewhere. Others endure; new ones are being created all the time. The
            contemporary world is riddled with such anarchic spaces, and the more
            successful they are, the less likely we are to hear about them. It’s only if such
            a space breaks down into violence that there’s any chance outsiders will even
            ﬁnd out that it exists.
              The puzzling question is how such profound changes in popular attitudes
            could happen so fast? The likely answer is that they really didn’t; there were
            probably things going on even under the nineteenthcentury kingdom of which
16 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            foreign observers (even those long resident on the island) were simply
            unaware. But clearly, too, something about the imposition of colonial rule
            allowed for a rapid reshuﬄing of priorities. This, I would argue, is what the
            ongoing existence of deeply embedded forms of counterpower allows. A lot of
            the ideological work, in fact, of making a revolution was conducted precisely
            in the spectral nightworld of sorcerers and witches; in redeﬁnitions of the
            moral implications of diﬀerent forms of magical power. But this only
            underlines how these spectral zones are always the fulcrum of the moral
            imagination, a kind of creative reservoir, too, of potential revolutionary
            change. It’s precisely from these invisible spaces—invisible, most of all, to
            power—whence the potential for insurrection, and the extraordinary social
            creativity that seems to emerge out of nowhere in revolutionary moments,
            actually comes.
              To sum up the argument so far, then:
              1) Counterpower is ﬁrst and foremost rooted in the imagination; it emerges
            from the fact that all social systems are a tangle of contradictions, always to
            some degree at war with themselves. Or, more precisely, it is rooted in the
            relation between the practical imagination required to maintain a society
            based on consensus (as any society not based on violence must, ultimately, be)
            —the constant work of imaginative identiﬁcation with others that makes
            understanding possible—and the spectral violence which appears to be its
            constant, perhaps inevitable corollary.
              2) In egalitarian societies, counterpower might be said to be the
            predominant form of social power. It stands guard over what are seen as
            certain frightening possibilities within the society itself: notably against the
            emergence of systematic forms of political or economic dominance.
              2a) Institutionally, counterpower takes the form of what we would call
            institutions of direct democracy, consensus and mediation; that is, ways of
            publicly negotiating and controlling that inevitable internal tumult and
            transforming it into those social states (or if you like, forms of value) that
            society sees as the most desirable: conviviality, unanimity, fertility, prosperity,
            beauty, however it may be framed.
              3) In highly unequal societies, imaginative counterpower often deﬁnes itself
            against certain aspects of dominance that are seen as particularly obnoxious
            and can become an attempt to eliminate them from social relations
            completely. When it does, it becomes revolutionary.
              3a) Institutionally, as an imaginative well, it is responsible for the creation
            of new social forms, and the revalorization or transformation of old ones, and
            also,
              4) in moments of radical transformation—revolutions in the old-fashioned
            sense—this is precisely what allows for the notorious popular ability to
            innovate entirely new politics, economic, and social forms. Hence, it is the
            root of what Antonio Negri has called “constituent power,” the power to
            create constitutions.
              Most modern constitutional orders see themselves as having been created
            by rebellions: the American revolution, the French revolution, and so on. This
            has, of course, not always been the case. But this leads to a very important
            question, because any really politically engaged anthropology will have to
            start by seriously confronting the question of what, if anything, really divides
17 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            what we like to call the “modern” world from the rest of human history, to
            which folks like the Piaroa, Tiv or Malagasy are normally relegated. This is as
            one might imagine a pretty vexed question but I am afraid it can’t be avoided,
            since otherwise, many readers might not be convinced there’s any reason to
            have an anarchist anthropology to begin with.
            Blowing Up Walls
              As I remarked, an anarchist anthropology doesn’t really exist. There are
            only fragments. In the ﬁrst part of this essay I tried to gather some of them,
            and to look for common themes; in this part I want to go further, and imagine
            a body of social theory that might exist at some time in the future.
            obvious objections
               Before being able to do so I really do need to address the usual objection to
            any project of this nature: that the study of actually-existing anarchist
            societies is simply irrelevant to the modern world. After all, aren’t we just
            talking about a bunch of primitives?
               For anarchists who do know something about anthropology, the arguments
            are all too familiar. A typical exchange goes something like this:
               Skeptic: Well, I might take this whole anarchism idea more seriously if you
            could give me some reason to think it would work. Can you name me a single
            viable example of a society which has existed without a government?
               Anarchist: Sure. There have been thousands. I could name a dozen just oﬀ
            the top of my head: the Bororo, the Baining, the Onondaga, the Wintu, the
            Ema, the Tallensi, the Vezo...
               Skeptic: But those are all a bunch of primitives! I’m talking about
            anarchism in a modern, technological society.
               Anarchist: Okay, then. There have been all sorts of successful experiments:
            experiments with worker’s self-management, like Mondragon; economic
            projects based on the idea of the gift economy, like Linux; all sorts of political
            organizations based on consensus and direct democracy...
               Skeptic: Sure, sure, but these are small, isolated examples. I’m talking
            about whole societies.
               Anarchist: Well, it’s not like people haven’t tried. Look at the Paris
            Commune, the revolution in Republican Spain...
               Skeptic: Yeah, and look what happened to those guys! They all got killed!
               The dice are loaded. You can’t win. Because when the skeptic says “society,”
            what he really means is “state,” even “nation-state.” Since no one is going to
            produce an example of an anarchist state—that would be a contradiction in
            terms—what we’re really being asked for is an example of a modern nationstate with the government somehow plucked away: a situation in which the
            government of Canada, to take a random example, has been overthrown, or
            for some reason abolished itself, and no new one has taken its place but
            instead all former Canadian citizens begin to organize themselves into
            libertarian collectives. Obviously this would never be allowed to happen. In
            the past, whenever it even looked like it might—here, the Paris commune and
18 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            Spanish civil war are excellent examples—the politicians running pretty much
            every state in the vicinity have been willing to put their diﬀerences on hold
            until those trying to bring such a situation about had been rounded up and
            shot.
              There is a way out, which is to accept that anarchist forms of organization
            would not look anything like a state. That they would involve an endless
            variety of communities, associations, networks, projects, on every conceivable
            scale, overlapping and intersecting in any way we could imagine, and possibly
            many that we can’t. Some would be quite local, others global. Perhaps all they
            would have in common is that none would involve anyone showing up with
            weapons and telling everyone else to shut up and do what they were told. And
            that, since anarchists are not actually trying to seize power within any
            national territory, the process of one system replacing the other will not take
            the form of some sudden revolutionary cataclysm—the storming of a Bastille,
            the seizing of a Winter Palace—but will necessarily be gradual, the creation of
            alternative forms of organization on a world scale, new forms of
            communication, new, less alienated ways of organizing life, which will,
            eventually, make currently existing forms of power seem stupid and beside
            the point. That in turn would mean that there are endless examples of viable
            anarchism: pretty much any form of organization would count as one, so long
            as it was not imposed by some higher authority, from a klezmer band to the
            international postal service.
              Unfortunately, this kind of argument does not seem to satisfy most skeptics.
            They want “societies.” So one is reduced to scouring the historical and
            ethnographic record for entities that look like a nation-state (one people,
            speaking a common language, living within a bounded territory,
            acknowledging a common set of legal principles...), but which lack a state
            apparatus (which, following Weber, one can deﬁne roughly as: a group of
            people who claim that, at least when they are around and in their oﬀicial
            capacity, they are the only ones with the right to act violently). These, too, one
            can ﬁnd, if one is willing to look at relatively small communities far away in
            time or space. But then one is told they don’t count for just this reason.
              So we’re back to the original problem. There is assumed to be an absolute
            rupture between the world we live in, and the world inhabited by anyone who
            might be characterized as “primitive,” “tribal,” or even as “peasants.”
            Anthropologists are not to blame here: we have been trying for decades now
            to convince the public that there’s no such thing as a “primitive,” that “simple
            societies” are not really all that simple, that no one ever existed in timeless
            isolation, that it makes no sense to speak of some social systems as more or
            less evolved; but so far, we’ve made very little headway. It is almost
            impossible to convince the average American that a bunch of Amazonians
            could possibly have anything to teach them—other than, conceivably, that we
            should all abandon modern civilization and go live in Amazonia—and this
            because they are assumed to live in an absolutely diﬀerent world. Which is,
            oddly enough, again because of the way we are used to thinking about
            revolutions.
              Let me take up the argument I began to sketch out in the last section and
            try to explain why I think this is true:
19 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
                 a fairly brief manifesto concerning the concept of revolution:

## The term “revolution” has been so relentlessly cheapened in
## common usage that it can mean almost anything. We have
                 revolutions every week now: banking revolutions, cybernetic
                 revolutions, medical revolutions, an internet revolution every time
## someone invents some clever new piece of software.

                 This kind of rhetoric is only possible because the commonplace
                 deﬁnition of revolution has always implied something in the nature
                 of a paradigm shift: a clear break, a fundamental rupture in the
                 nature of social reality after which everything works diﬀerently, and
                 previous categories no longer apply. It is this which makes it
                 possible to, say, claim that the modern world is derived from two
                 “revolutions”: the French revolution and the Industrial revolution,
                 despite the fact that the two had almost nothing else in common
                 other than seeming to mark a break with all that came before. One
                 odd result is that, as Ellen Meskins Wood has noted, we are in the
                 habit of discussing what we call “modernity” as if it involved a
## combination of English laissez faire economics, and French
                 Republican government, despite the fact that the two never really
                 occurred together: the industrial revolution happened under a
                 bizarre, antiquated, still largely medieval English constitution, and
## nineteenth-century France was anything but laissez faire.

                 (The one-time appeal of the Russian revolution for the “developing
                 world” seems to derive from the fact it’s the one example where
                 both sorts of revolution did seem to coincide: a seizure of national
                 power which then led to rapid industrialization. As a result almost
                 every twentieth-century government in the global south determined
                 to play economic catch-up with the industrial powers had also to
## claim to be a revolutionary regime.)

                 If there is one logical error underlying all this, it rests on imagining
                 that social or even technological change takes the same form of
## what Thomas Kuhn has called “the structure of scientiﬁc
                 revolutions.” Kuhn is referring to events like the shift from a
                 Newtonian to Einsteinian universe: suddenly there is an intellectual
                 breakthrough and afterwards, the universe is diﬀerent. Applied to
                 anything other than scientiﬁc revolutions, it implies that the world
                 really was equivalent to our knowledge of it, and the moment we
                 change the principles on which our knowledge is based, reality
                 changes too. This is just the sort of basic intellectual mistake
                 developmental psychologists say we’re supposed to get over in early
## childhood, but it seems few of us really do.

## In fact, the world is under no obligation to live up to our
                 expectations, and insofar as “reality” refers to anything, it refers to
                 precisely that which can never be entirely encompassed by our
                 imaginative constructions. Totalities, in particular, are always
20 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
                 creatures of the imagination. Nations, societies, ideologies, closed
                 systems... none of these really exist. Reality is always inﬁnitely
                 messier than that—even if the belief that they exist is an undeniable
                 social force. For one thing, the habit of thought which deﬁnes the
                 world, or society, as a totalizing system (in which every element
                 takes on its signiﬁcance only in relation to the others) tends to lead
                 almost inevitably to a view of revolutions as cataclysmic ruptures.
                 Since, after all, how else could one totalizing system be replaced by
                 a completely diﬀerent one than by a cataclysmic rupture? Human
                 history thus becomes a series of revolutions: the Neolithic
                 revolution, the Industrial revolution, the Information revolution,
                 etc., and the political dream becomes to somehow take control of
                 the process; to get to the point where we can cause a rupture of this
                 sort, a momentous breakthrough that will not just happen but result
                 directly from some kind of collective will. “The revolution,” properly
## speaking.

                 If so it’s not surprising that the moment radical thinkers felt they
                 had to give up this dream, their ﬁrst reaction was to redouble their
                 eﬀorts to identify revolutions happening anyway, to the point where
                 in the eyes of someone like Paul Virilio, rupture is our permanent
                 state of being, or for someone like Jean Baudrillard, the world now
                 changes completely every couple years, whenever he gets a new
## idea.

                 This is not an appeal for a ﬂat-out rejection of such imaginary
                 totalities—even assuming this were possible, which it probably isn’t,
                 since they are probably a necessary tool of human thought. It is an
                 appeal to always bear in mind that they are just that: tools of
                 thought. For instance, it is indeed a very good thing to be able to
## ask “after the revolution, how will we organize mass
                 transportation?,” “who will fund scientiﬁc research?,” or even,
                 “after the revolution, do you think there will still be fashion
                 magazines?” The phrase is a useful mental hinge; even if we also
                 recognize that in reality, unless we are willing to massacre
                 thousands of people (and probably even then), the revolution will
                 almost certainly not be quite such a clean break as such a phrase
## implies.

                 What will it be, then? I have already made some suggestions. A
                 revolution on a world scale will take a very long time. But it is also
                 possible to recognize that it is already starting to happen. The
                 easiest way to get our minds around it is to stop thinking about
                 revolution as a thing—“the” revolution, the great cataclysmic break
                 —and instead ask “what is revolutionary action?” We could then
                 suggest: revolutionary action is any collective action which rejects,
                 and therefore confronts, some form of power or domination and in
                 doing so, reconstitutes social relations—even within the collectivity
                 —in that light. Revolutionary action does not necessarily have to aim
                 to topple governments. Attempts to create autonomous communities
21 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
                 in the face of power (using Castoriadis’ deﬁnition here: ones that
## constitute themselves, collectively make their own rules or
                 principles of operation, and continually reexamine them), would, for
                 instance, be almost by deﬁnition revolutionary acts. And history
                 shows us that the continual accumulation of such acts can change
                 (almost) everything.
              I’m hardly the ﬁrst to have made an argument like this—some such vision
            follows almost necessarily once one is no longer thinking in terms of the
            framework of the state and seizure of state power. What I want to emphasize
            here is what this means for how we look at history.
            a thought experiment, or, blowing up walls
               What I am proposing, essentially, is that we engage in a kind of thought
            experiment. What if, as a recent title put it, “we have never been modern”?
            What if there never was any fundamental break, and therefore, we are not
            living in a fundamentally diﬀerent moral, social, or political universe than the
            Piaroa or Tiv or rural Malagasy?
               There are a million diﬀerent ways to deﬁne “modernity.” According to some
            it mainly has to do with science and technology, for others it’s a matter of
            individualism; others, capitalism, or bureaucratic rationality, or alienation, or
            an ideal of freedom of one sort or another. However they deﬁne it, almost
            everyone agrees that at somewhere in the sixteenth, or seventeenth, or
            eighteenth centuries, a Great Transformation occurred, that it occurred in
            Western Europe and its settler colonies, and that because of it, we became
            “modern.” And that once we did, we became a fundamentally diﬀerent sort of
            creature than anything that had come before.
               But what if we kicked this whole apparatus away? What if we blew up the
            wall? What if we accepted that the people who Columbus or Vasco da Gama
            “discovered” on their expeditions were just us? Or certainly, just as much “us”
            as Columbus and Vasco da Gama ever were?
               I’m not arguing that nothing important has changed over the last ﬁve
            hundred years, any more than I’m arguing that cultural diﬀerences are
            unimportant. In one sense everyone, every community, every individual for
            that matter, lives in their own unique universe. By “blowing up walls,” I mean
            most of all, blowing up the arrogant, unreﬂecting assumptions which tell us
            we have nothing in common with 98% of people who ever lived, so we don’t
            really have to think about them. Since, after all, if you assume the
            fundamental break, the only theoretical question you can ask is some
            variation on “what makes us so special?” Once we get rid of those
            assumptions, decide to at least entertain the notion we aren’t quite so special
            as we might like to think, we can also begin to think about what really has
            changed and what hasn’t.
                 An example:

## There has long been a related debate over what particular
                 advantage “the West,” as Western Europe and its settler colonies
22 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
                 have liked to call themselves, had over the rest of the world that
                 allowed them to conquer so much of it in the four hundred years
                 between 1500 and 1900. Was it a more eﬀicient economic system? A
                 superior military tradition? Did it have to do with Christianity, or
                 Protestantism, or a spirit of rationalistic inquiry? Was it simply a
                 matter of technology? Or did it have to do with more individualistic
                 family arrangements? Some combination of all these factors? To a
                 large extent, Western historical sociology has been dedicated to
                 solving this problem. It is a sign of how deeply embedded the
                 assumptions are that it is only quite recently that scholars have
                 come to even suggest that perhaps, Western Europe didn’t really
                 have any fundamental advantage at all. That European technology,
                 economic and social arrangements, state organization, and the rest
                 in 1450 were in no way more “advanced” than what prevailed in
                 Egypt, or Bengal, or Fujian, or most any other urbanized part of the
                 Old World at the time. Europe might have been ahead in some areas
                 (e.g., techniques of naval warfare, certain forms of banking), but
                 lagged signiﬁcantly behind in others (astronomy, jurisprudence,
                 agricultural technology, techniques of land warfare). Perhaps there
                 was no mysterious advantage. Perhaps what happened was just a
                 coincidence. Western Europe happened to be located in that part of
                 the Old World where it was easiest to sail to the New; those who
                 ﬁrst did so had the incredible luck to discover lands full of enormous
## wealth, populated by defenseless stone-age peoples who
                 conveniently began dying almost the moment they arrived; the
                 resultant windfall, and the demographic advantage from having
                 lands to siphon oﬀ excess population was more than enough to
                 account for the European powers’ later successes. It was then
                 possible to shut down the (far more eﬀicient) Indian cloth industry
                 and create the space for an industrial revolution, and generally
                 ravage and dominate Asia to such an extent that in technological
                 terms—particularly industrial and military technology—it fell
## increasingly behind.

## A number of authors (Blaut, Goody, Pommeranz, Gunder Frank)
                 have been making some variation of this argument in recent years.
                 It is at root a moral argument, an attack on Western arrogance. As
                 such it is extremely important. The only problem with it, in moral
                 terms, is that it tends to confuse means and inclination. That is, it
                 rests on the assumption that Western historians were right to
                 assume that whatever it was that made it possible for Europeans to
                 dispossess, abduct, enslave, and exterminate millions of other
                 human beings, it was a mark of superiority and that therefore,
                 whatever it was, it would be insulting to non-Europeans to suggest
                 they didn’t have it too. It seems to me that it is far more insulting to
                 suggest anyone would ever have behaved like Europeans of the
## sixteenth or seventeenth centuries—e.g., depopulating large
                 portions of the Andes or central Mexico by working millions to death
                 in the mines, or kidnapping a signiﬁcant chunk of the population of
23 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
                 Africa to work to death on sugar plantations— unless one has some
                 actual evidence to suggest they were so genocidally inclined. In fact
                 there appear to have been plenty of examples of people in a position
                 to wreak similar havoc on a world scale—say, the Ming dynasty in
                 the ﬁfteenth century—but who didn’t, not so much because they
                 scrupled to, so much as because it would never have occurred to
## them to act this way to begin with.

                 In the end it all turns, oddly enough, on how one chooses to deﬁne
                 capitalism. Almost all the authors cited above tend to see capitalism
## as yet another accomplishment which Westerners arrogantly
## assume they invented themselves, and therefore deﬁne it (as
                 capitalists do) as largely a matter of commerce and ﬁnancial
                 instruments. But that willingness to put considerations of proﬁt
## above any human concern which drove Europeans to depopulate
                 whole regions of the world in order to place the maximum amount of
                 silver or sugar on the market was certainly something else. It seems
                 to me it deserves a name of its own. For this reason it seems better
                 to me to continue to deﬁne capitalism as its opponents prefer, as
                 founded on the connection between a wage system and a principle
                 of the never-ending pursuit of proﬁt for its own sake. This in turn
                 makes it possible to argue this was a strange perversion of normal
                 commercial logic which happened to take hold in one, previously
## rather barbarous, corner of the world and encouraged the
## inhabitants to engage in what might otherwise have been
                 considered unspeakable forms of behavior. Again, all this does not
                 necessarily mean that one has to agree with the premise that once
                 capitalism came into existence, it instantly became a totalizing
                 system and that from that moment, everything else that happened
                 can only be understood in relation to it. But it suggests one of the
                 axes on which one can begin to think about what really is diﬀerent
## nowadays.

              Let us imagine, then, that the West, however deﬁned, was nothing special,
            and further, that there has been no one fundamental break in human history.
            No one can deny there have been massive quantitative changes: the amount
            of energy consumed, the speed at which humans can travel, the number of
            books produced and read, all these numbers have been rising exponentially.
            But let us imagine for the sake of argument that these quantitative changes
            do not, in themselves, necessarily imply a change in quality: we are not living
            in a fundamentally diﬀerent sort of society than has ever existed before, we
            are not living in a fundamentally diﬀerent sort of time, the existence of
            factories or microchips do not mean political or social possibilities have
            changed in their basic nature: Or, to be more precise, the West might have
            introduced some new possibilities, but it hasn’t canceled any of the old ones
            out.
              The ﬁrst thing one discovers when one tries to think this way is that it is
            extremely diﬀicult to do so. One has to cut past the endless host of intellectual
            tricks and gimmicks that create the wall of distance around “modern”
            societies. Let me give just one example. It is common to distinguish between
24 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            what are called “kinship-based societies” and modern ones, which are
            supposed to be based on impersonal institutions like the market or the state.
            The societies traditionally studied by anthropologists have kinship systems.
            They are organized into descent groups— lineages, or clans, or moieties, or
            ramages—which trace descent to common ancestors, live mainly on ancestral
            territories, are seen as consisting of similar “kinds” of people—an idea usually
            expressed through physical idioms of common ﬂesh, or bone, or blood, or
            skin. Often kinship systems become a basis of social inequality as some
            groups are seen as higher than others, as for example in caste systems;
            always, kinship establishes the terms for sex and marriage and the passing of
            property over the generations.
               The term “kin-based” is often used the way people used to use the word
            “primitive”; these are exotic societies which are in no way like our own.
            (That’s why it is assumed we need anthropology to study them; entirely
            diﬀerent disciplines, like sociology and economics, are assumed to be
            required to study modern ones.) But then the exact same people who make
            this argument will usually take it for granted that the main social problems in
            our own, “modern” society (or “postmodern”: for present purposes it’s exactly
            the same thing) revolve around race, class, and gender. In other words,
            precisely from the nature of our kinship system.
               After all, what does it mean to say most Americans see the world as divided
            into “races”? It means they believe that it is divided into groups which are
            presumed to share a common descent and geographical origin, who for this
            reason are seen as diﬀerent “kinds” of people, that this idea is usually
            expressed through physical idioms of blood and skin, and that the resulting
            system regulates sex, marriage, and the inheritance of property and therefore
            creates and maintains social inequalities. We are talking about something
            very much like a classic clan system, except on a global scale. One might
            object that there is a lot of interracial marriage going on, and even more
            interracial sex, but then, this is only what we should expect. Statistical studies
            always reveal that, even in “traditional” societies like the Nambikwara or
            Arapesh, at least 5–10% of young people marry someone they’re not supposed
            to. Statistically, the phenomena are of about equal signiﬁcance. Social class is
            slightly more complicated, since the groups are less clearly bounded. Still, the
            diﬀerence between a ruling class and a collection of people who happen to
            have done well is, precisely, kinship: the ability to marry one’s children oﬀ
            appropriately, and pass one’s advantages on to one’s descendants. People
            marry across class lines too, but rarely very far; and while most Americans
            seem to be under the impression that this is a country of considerable class
            mobility, when asked to adduce examples all they can usually come up with is
            a handful of rags to riches stories. It is almost impossible to ﬁnd an example
            of an American who was born rich and ended up a penniless ward of the state.
            So all we are really dealing with then is the fact, familiar to anyone who’s
            studied history, that ruling elites (unless polygamous) are never able to
            reproduce themselves demographically, and therefore always need some way
            to recruit new blood (and if they are polygamous, of course, that itself
            becomes a mode of social mobility).
## Gender relations are of course the very fabric of kinship.

            what would it take to knock down these walls?
               I’d say a lot. Too many people have too much invested in maintaining them.
            This includes anarchists, incidentally. At least in the United States, the
            anarchists who do take anthropology the most seriously are the Primitivists, a
            small but very vocal faction who argue that the only way to get humanity back
            on track is to shuck oﬀ modernity entirely. Inspired by Marshall Sahlins’ essay
            “The Original Aﬄuent Society,” they propose that there was a time when
            alienation and inequality did not exist, when everyone was a huntergathering
            anarchist, and that therefore real liberation can only come if we abandon
            “civilization” and return to the Upper Paleolithic, or at least the early Iron
            Age. In fact we know almost nothing about life in the Paleolithic, other than
            the sort of thing that can be gleaned from studying very old skulls (i.e., in the
            Paleolithic people had much better teeth; they also died much more
            frequently from traumatic head wounds). But what we see in the more recent
            ethnographic record is endless variety. There were huntergatherer societies
            with nobles and slaves, there are agrarian societies that are ﬁercely
            egalitarian. Even in Clastres’ favored stomping grounds in Amazonia, one
            ﬁnds some groups who can justly be described as anarchists, like the Piaroa,
            living alongside others (say, the warlike Sherente) who are clearly anything
            but. And “societies” are constantly reforming, skipping back and forth
            between what we think of as diﬀerent evolutionary stages.
               I do not think we’re losing much if we admit that humans never really lived
            in the garden of Eden. Knocking the walls down can allow us to see this
            history as a resource to us in much more interesting ways. Because it works
            both ways. Not only do we, in industrial societies, still have kinship (and
            cosmologies); other societies have social movements and revolutions. Which
            means, among other things, that radical theorists no longer have to pore
            endlessly over the same scant two hundred years of revolutionary history.
                 Between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries the west coast of
                 Madagascar was divided into a series of related kingdoms under the
                 Maroansetra dynasty. Their subjects were collectively known as the
                 Sakalava. In northwest Madagascar there is now an “ethnic group”
                 ensconced in a somewhat diﬀicult, hilly back country referred to as
                 the Tsimihety. The word literally means “those who do not cut their
                 hair.” This refers to a Sakalava custom: when a king died, his male
                 subjects were all expected to crop oﬀ their hair as a sign of
## mourning. The Tsimihety were those who refused, and hence
                 rejected the authority of the Sakalava monarchy; to this day they
                 are marked by resolutely egalitarian social organization and
                 practices. They are, in other words, the anarchists of northwest
                 Madagascar. To this day they have maintained a reputation as
                 masters of evasion: under the French, administrators would
                 complain that they could send delegations to arrange for labor to
                 build a road near a Tsimihety village, negotiate the terms with
                 apparently cooperative elders, and return with the equipment a
                 week later only to discover the village entirely abandoned—every
                 single inhabitant had moved in with some relative in another part of
26 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...

## the country.

               What especially interests me here is the principle of “ethnogenesis,” as it’s
            called nowadays. The Tsimihety are now considered a foko—a people or
            ethnic group— but their identity emerged as a political project. The desire to
            live free of Sakalava domination was translated into a desire—one which came
            to suﬀuse all social institutions from village assemblies to mortuary ritual—to
            live in a society free of markers of hierarchy. This then became
            institutionalized as a way of life of a community living together, which then in
            turn came to be thought of as a particular “kind” of people, an ethnic group—
            people who also, since they tend to intermarry, come to be seen as united by
            common ancestry. It is easier to see this happening in Madagascar where
            everyone pretty much speaks the same language. But I doubt it is that
            unusual. The ethnogenesis literature is a fairly new one, but it is becoming
            increasingly clear that most of human history was characterized by continual
            social change. Rather than timeless groups living for thousands of years in
            their ancestral territories, new groups were being created, and old ones
            dissolving, all the time. Many of what we have come to think of as tribes, or
            nations, or ethnic groups were originally collective projects of some sort. In
            the Tsimihety case we are talking about a revolutionary project, at least
            revolutionary in that sense I have been developing here: a conscious rejection
            of certain forms of overarching political power which also causes people to
            rethink and reorganize the way they deal with one another on an everyday
            basis. Most are not. Some are egalitarian, others are about promoting a
            certain vision of authority or hierarchy. Still, one is dealing with something
            very much along the lines of what we’d think of as a social movement; it is
            just that, in the absence of broadsides, rallies and manifestos, the media
            through which one can create and demand new forms of (what we’d call)
            social, economic or political life, to pursue diﬀerent forms of value, were
            diﬀerent: one had to work through literally or ﬁguratively sculpting ﬂesh,
            through music and ritual, food and clothing, and ways of disposing of the
            dead. But in part as a result, over time, what were once projects become
            identities, even ones continuous with nature. They ossify and harden into selfevident truths or collective properties.
               A whole discipline could no doubt be invented to understand precisely how
            this happens: a process in only some ways analogous to Weber’s
            “routinization of charisma,” full of strategies, reversals, diversions of energy...
            Social ﬁelds which are, in their essence, arenas for the recognition of certain
            forms of value can become borders to be defended; representations or media
            of value become numinous powers in themselves; creation slips into
            commemoration; the ossiﬁed remains of liberatory movements can end up,
            under the grip of states, transformed into what we call “nationalisms” which
            are either mobilized to rally support for the state machinery or become the
            basis for new social movements opposed to them.
               The critical thing here, it seems to me, is that this petriﬁcation does not
            only apply to social projects. It can also happen to the states themselves. This
            is a phenomenon theorists of social struggle have rarely fully appreciated.
                 When the French colonial administration established itself in
                 Madagascar it duly began dividing the population up into a series of
27 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
                 “tribes”: Merina, Betsileo, Bara, Sakalava, Vezo, Tsimihety, etc.
                 Since there are few clear distinctions of language, it is easier here,
                 than in most places, to discern some of the principles by which
                 these divisions came about. Some are political. The Sakalava are
                 noted subjects of the Maroantsetra dynasty (which created at least
                 three kingdoms along the West coast). The Tsimihety are those who
                 refused allegiance. Those called the “Merina” are those highland
## people originally united by allegiance to a king named
                 Andrianampoinimerina; subjects of other highland kingdoms to the
                 south, who the Merina conquered almost immediately thereafter,
## are referred to collectively as Betsileo.

                 Some names have to do with where people live or how they make a
                 living: the Tanala are “forest people” on the east coast; on the west
                 coast, the Mikea are hunters and foragers and the Vezo, ﬁsherfolk.
                 But even here there are usually political elements: the Vezo lived
                 alongside the Sakalava monarchies but like the Tsimihety, they
                 managed to remain independent of them because, as legend has it,
                 whenever they learned royal representatives were on the way to
                 visit them, they would all get in their canoes and wait oﬀshore until
                 they went away. Those ﬁshing villages that did succumb became
## Sakalava, not Vezo.

                 The Merina, Sakalava, and Betsileo are by far the most numerous
                 however. So most Malagasy, then, are deﬁned, not exactly by their
                 political loyalties, but by the loyalties their ancestors had sometime
                 around 1775 or 1800. The interesting thing is what happened to
                 these identities once the kings were no longer around. Here the
                 Merina and Betsileo seem to represent two opposite possibilities.

## Many of these ancient kingdoms were little more than
                 institutionalized extortion systems; insofar as ordinary folk actually
                 participated in royal politics, it was through ritual labor: building
                 royal palaces and tombs, for example, in which each clan was
                 usually assigned some very speciﬁc honoriﬁc role. Within the
                 Merina kingdom this system ended up being so thoroughly abused
                 that by the time the French arrived, it had been almost entirely
                 discredited and royal rule became, as I mentioned, identiﬁed with
                 slavery and forced labor; as a result, the “Merina” now mainly exist
                 on paper. One never hears anyone in the countryside referring to
                 themselves that way except perhaps in essays they have to write in
                 school. The Sakalava are quite another story. Sakalava is still very
                 much a living identity on the West coast, and it continues to mean,
                 followers of the Maroantsetra dynasty. But for the last hundred and
                 ﬁfty years or so, the primary loyalties of most Sakalava have been to
                 the members of this dynasty who are dead. While living royalty are
                 largely ignored, the ancient kings’ tombs are still continually rebuilt
                 and redecorated in vast communal projects and this is what being
                 Sakalava is seen largely to be about. And dead kings still make their
## wishes known—through spirit mediums who are usually elderly

## women of commoner descent.

              In many other parts of Madagascar as well, it often seems that no one really
            takes on their full authority until they are dead. So perhaps the Sakalava case
            is not that extraordinary. But it reveals one very common way of avoiding the
            direct eﬀects of power: if one cannot simply step out of its path, like the Vezo
            or Tsimihety, one can, as it were, try to fossilize it. In the Sakalava case the
            ossiﬁcation of the state is quite literal: the kings who are still worshipped take
            the physical form of royal relics, they are literally teeth and bones. But this
            approach is probably far more commonplace than we would be given to
            suspect.
              Kajsia Eckholm for example has recently made the intriguing suggestion
            that the kind of divine kingship Sir James Frazer wrote about in The Golden
            Bough, in which kings were hedged about with endless ritual and taboo (not
            to touch the earth, not to see the sun...), was not, as we normally assume, an
            archaic form of kingship, but in most cases, a very late one.
              She gives the example of the Kongo monarchy, which when the Portugese
            ﬁrst showed up in the late ﬁfteenth century doesn’t seem to have been
            particularly more ritualized than the monarchy in Portugal or Spain at the
            same time. There was a certain amount of court ceremonial, but nothing that
            got in the way of governing. It was only later, as the kingdom collapsed into
            civil war and broke into tinier and tinier fragments, that its rulers became
            increasingly sacred beings. Elaborate rituals were created, restrictions
            multiplied, until by the end we read about “kings” who were conﬁned to small
            buildings, or literally castrated on ascending the throne. As a result they ruled
            very little; most BaKongo had in fact passed to a largely self-governing
            system, though also a very tumultuous one, caught in the throes of the
            slavetrade.
              Is any of this relevant to contemporary concerns? Very much so, it seems to
            me. Autonomist thinkers in Italy have, over the last couple decades,
            developed a theory of what they call revolutionary “exodus.” It is inspired in
            part by particularly Italian conditions—the broad refusal of factory work
            among young people, the ﬂourishing of squats and occupied “social centers”
            in so many Italian cities... But in all this Italy seems to have acted as a kind of
            laboratory for future social movements, anticipating trends that are now
            beginning to happen on a global scale.
              The theory of exodus proposes that the most eﬀective way of opposing
            capitalism and the liberal state is not through direct confrontation but by
            means of what Paolo Virno has called “engaged withdrawal,” mass defection
            by those wishing to create new forms of community. One need only glance at
            the historical record to conﬁrm that most successful forms of popular
            resistance have taken precisely this form. They have not involved challenging
            power head on (this usually leads to being slaughtered, or if not, turning into
            some—often even uglier—variant of the very thing one ﬁrst challenged) but
            from one or another strategy of slipping away from its grasp, from ﬂight,
            desertion, the founding of new communities. One Autonomist historian, Yann
            Moulier Boutang, has even argued that the history of capitalism has been a
            series of attempts to solve the problem of worker mobility—hence the endless
            elaboration of institutions like indenture, slavery, coolie systems, contract
29 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            workers, guest workers, innumerable forms of border control—since, if the
            system ever really came close to its own fantasy version of itself, in which
            workers were free to hire on and quit their work wherever and whenever they
            wanted, the entire system would collapse. It’s for precisely this reason that
            the one most consistent demand put forward by the radical elements in the
            globalization movement—from the Italian Autonomists to North American
            anarchists—has always been global freedom of movement, “real
            globalization,” the destruction of borders, a general tearing down of walls.
              The kind of tearing down of conceptual walls I’ve been proposing here
            makes it possible for us not only to conﬁrm the importance of defection, it
            promises an inﬁnitely richer conception of how alternative forms of
            revolutionary action might work. This is a history which has largely yet to be
            written, but there are glimmerings. Peter Lamborn Wilson has produced the
            brightest of these, in a series of essays which include reﬂections, on, among
            other things, the collapse of the Hopewell and Mississippian cultures through
            much of eastern North America. These were societies apparently dominated
            by priestly elites, castebased social structures, and human sacriﬁce—which
            mysteriously disappeared, being replaced by far more egalitarian hunter/
            gathering or horticultural societies. He suggests, interestingly enough, that
            the famous Native American identiﬁcation with nature might not really have
            been a reaction to European values, but to a dialectical possibility within their
            own societies from which they had quite consciously run away. The story
            continues through the defection of the Jamestown settlers, a collection of
            servants abandoned in the ﬁrst North American colony in Virginia by their
            gentleman patrons, who apparently ended up becoming Indians, to an endless
            series of “pirate utopias,” in which British renegades teamed up with Muslim
            corsairs, or joined native communities from Hispaniola to Madagascar, hidden
            “triracial” republics founded by escaped slaves at the margins of European
            settlements, Antinomians, and other little-known libertarian enclaves that
            riddled the continent even before the Shakers and Fourierists and all the
            betterknown nineteenth-century “intentional communities.”
              Most of these little utopias were even more marginal than the Vezo or
            Tsimihety were in Madagascar; all of them were eventually gobbled up. Which
            leads to the question of how to neutralize the state apparatus itself, in the
            absence of a politics of direct confrontation. No doubt some states and
            corporate elites will collapse of their own dead weight; a few already have;
            but it’s hard to imagine a scenario in which they all will. Here, the Sakalava
            and BaKongo might be able to provide us some useful suggestions. What
            cannot be destroyed can, nonetheless, be diverted, frozen, transformed, and
            gradually deprived of its substance—which in the case of states, is ultimately
            their capacity to inspire terror. What would this mean under contemporary
            conditions? It’s not entirely clear. Perhaps existing state apparati will
            gradually be reduced to window-dressing as the substance is pulled out of
            them from above and below: i.e., both from the growth of international
            institutions, and from devolution to local and regional forms of
            selfgovernance. Perhaps government by media spectacle will devolve into
            spectacle pure and simple (somewhat along the lines of what Paul Lafargue,
            Marx’s West Indian son-in-law and author of The Right to Be Lazy, implied
            when he suggested that after the revolution, politicians would still be able to

            fulﬁll a useful social function in the entertainment industry). More likely it will
            happen in ways we cannot even anticipate. But no doubt there are ways in
            which it is happening already. As Neoliberal states move towards new forms
            of feudalism, concentrating their guns increasingly around gated
            communities, insurrectionary spaces open up that we don’t even know about.
            The Merina rice farmers described in the last section understand what many
            would-be revolutionaries do not: that there are times when the stupidest thing
            one could possibly do is raise a red or black ﬂag and issue deﬁant
            declarations. Sometimes the sensible thing is just to pretend nothing has
            changed, allow oﬀicial state representatives to keep their dignity, even show

            them.
            Tenets of a Non-existent Science
             Let me outline a few of the areas of theory an anarchist anthropology might
            wish to explore:
            1) A THEORY OF THE STATE
              States have a peculiar dual character. They are at the same time forms of
            institutionalized raiding or extortion, and utopian projects. The ﬁrst certainly
            reﬂects the way states are actually experienced, by any communities that
            retain some degree of autonomy; the second however is how they tend to
            appear in the written record.
              In one sense states are the “imaginary totality” par excellence, and much of
            the confusion entailed in theories of the state historically lies in an inability or
            unwillingness to recognize this. For the most part, states were ideas, ways of
            imagining social order as something one could get a grip on, models of
            control. This is why the ﬁrst known works of social theory, whether from
            Persia, or China, or ancient Greece, were always framed as theories of
            statecraft. This has had two disastrous eﬀects. One is to give utopianism a
            bad name. (The word “utopia” ﬁrst calls to mind the image of an ideal city,
            usually, with perfect geometry—the image seems to harken back originally to
            the royal military camp: a geometrical space which is entirely the emanation
            of a single, individual will, a fantasy of total control.) All this has had dire
            political consequences, to say the least. The second is that we tend to assume
            that states, and social order, even societies, largely correspond. In other
            words, we have a tendency to take the most grandiose, even paranoid, claims
            of world-rulers seriously, assuming that whatever cosmological projects they
            claimed to be pursuing actually did correspond, at least roughly, to something
            on the ground. Whereas it is likely that in many such cases, these claims
            ordinarily only applied fully within a few dozen yards of the monarch in any
            direction, and most subjects were much more likely to see ruling elites, on a
            day-to-day basis, as something much along the lines of predatory raiders.
              An adequate theory of states would then have to begin by distinguishing in
            each case between the relevant ideal of rulership (which can be almost
            anything, a need to enforce military style discipline, the ability to provide
31 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            perfect theatrical representation of gracious living which will inspire others,
            the need to provide the gods with endless human hearts to fend oﬀ the
            apocalypse...), and the mechanics of rule, without assuming that there is
            necessarily all that much correspondence between them. (There might be. But
            this has to be empirically established.) For example: much of the mythology of
            “the West” goes back to Herodotus’ description of an epochal clash between
            the Persian Empire, based on an ideal of obedience and absolute power, and
            the Greek cities of Athens and Sparta, based on ideals of civic autonomy,
            freedom and equality. It’s not that these ideas—especially their vivid
            representations in poets like Aeschylus or historians like Herodotus—are not
            important. One could not possibly understand Western history without them.
            But their very importance and vividness long blinded historians to what is
            becoming the increasingly clear reality: that whatever its ideals, the
            Achmaenid Empire was a pretty light touch when it came to the day-to-day
            control of its subjects’ lives, particularly in comparison with the degree of
            control exercised by Athenians over their slaves or Spartans over the
            overwhelming majority of the Laconian population, who were helots.
            Whatever the ideals, the reality, for most people involved, was much the other
            way around.
               One of the most striking discoveries of evolutionary anthropology has been
            that it is perfectly possible to have kings and nobles and all the exterior
            trappings of monarchy without having a state in the mechanical sense at all.
            One should think this might be of some interest to all those political
            philosophers who spill so much ink arguing about theories of “sovereignty”—
            since it suggests that most sovereigns were not heads of state and that their
            favorite technical term actually is built on a near-impossible ideal, in which
            royal power actually does manage to translate its cosmological pretensions
            into genuine bureaucratic control of a given territorial population. (Something
            like this started happening in Western Europe in the sixteenth and
            seventeenth centuries, but almost as soon as it did, the sovereign’s personal
            power was replaced by a ﬁctive person called “the people,” allowing the
            bureaucracy to take over almost entirely.) But so far as I’m aware, political
            philosophers have as yet had nothing to say on the subject. I suspect this is
            largely due to an extremely poor choice of terms. Evolutionary
            anthropologists refer to kingdoms which lack full-ﬂedged coercive
            bureaucracies as “chiefdoms,” a term which evokes images more of Geronimo
            or Sitting Bull than Solomon, Louis the Pious, or the Yellow Emperor. And of
            course the evolutionist framework itself ensures that such structures are seen
            as something which immediately precedes the emergence of the state, not an
            alternative form, or even something a state can turn into. To clarify all this
            would be a major historical project.
            2) A THEORY OF POLITICAL ENTITIES THAT ARE
            NOT STATES
              So that’s one project: to reanalyze the state as a relation between a utopian
            imaginary, and a messy reality involving strategies of ﬂight and evasion,
            predatory elites, and a mechanics of regulation and control.
32 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
               All this highlights the pressing need for another project: one which will ask,
            If many political entities we are used to seeing as states, at least in any
            Weberian sense, are not, then what are they? And what does that imply about
            political possibilities?
               In a way it’s kind of amazing that such a theoretical literature doesn’t
            already exist. It’s yet another sign, I guess, of how hard it is for us to think
            outside the statist framework. An excellent case in point: one of the most
            consistent demands of “anti-globalization” activists has been for the
            elimination of border restrictions. If we’re to globalize, we say, let’s get
            serious about it. Eliminate national borders. Let people come and go as they
            please, and live wherever they like. The demand is often phrased in terms of
            some notion of global citizenship. But this inspires immediate objections:
            doesn’t a call for “global citizenship” mean calling for some kind of global
            state? Would we really want that? So then the question becomes how do we
            theorize a citizenship outside the state. This is often treated as a profound,
            perhaps insurmountable, dilemma; but if one considers the matter historically,
            it’s hard to understand why it should be. Modern Western notions of
            citizenship and political freedoms are usually seen to derive from two
            traditions, one originating in ancient Athens, the other primarily stemming
            from medieval England (where it tends to be traced back to the assertion of
            aristocratic privilege against the Crown in the Magna Carta, Petition of Right,
            etc., and then the gradual extension of these same rights to the rest of the
            population). In fact there is no consensus among historians that either
            classical Athens or medieval England were states at all—and moreover,
            precisely for the reason that citizens’ rights in the ﬁrst, and aristocratic
            privilege in the second, were so well established. It is hard to think of Athens
            as a state, with a monopoly of force by the state apparatus, if one considers
            that the minimal government apparatus which did exist consisted entirely of
            slaves, owned collectively by the citizenry. Athens’ police force consisted of
            Scythian archers imported from what’s now Russia or Ukraine, and something
            of their legal standing might be gleaned from the fact that, by Athenian law, a
            slave’s testimony was not admissible as evidence in court unless it was
            obtained under torture.
               So what do we call such entities? “Chiefdoms”? One might conceivably be
            able to describe King John as a “chief” in the technical, evolutionary sense,
            but applying the term to Pericles does seem absurd. Neither can we continue
            to call ancient Athens a “city-state” if it wasn’t a state at all. It seems we just
            don’t have the intellectual tools to talk about such things. The same goes for
            the typology of types of state, or state-like entities in more recent times: an
            historian named Spruyt has suggested that in the sixteenth and seventeenth
            centuries the territorial nation-state was hardly the only game in town; there
            were other possibilities (Italian city-states, which actually were states; the
            Hanseatic league of confederated mercantile centers, which involved an
            entirely diﬀerent conception of sovereignty) which didn’t happen to win out—
            at least, right away—but were no less intrinsically viable. I have myself
            suggested that one reason the territorial nation-state ended up winning out
            was because, in this early stage of globalization, Western elites were trying to
            model themselves on China, the only state in existence at the time which
            actually seemed to conform to their ideal of a uniform population, who in
33 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            Confucian terms were the source of sovereignty, creators of a vernacular
            literature, subject to a uniform code of laws, administered by bureaucrats
            chosen by merit, trained in that vernacular literature... With the current crisis
            of the nation-state and rapid increase in international institutions which are
            not exactly states, but in many ways just as obnoxious, juxtaposed against
            attempts to create international institutions which do many of the same things
            as states but would be considerably less obnoxious, the lack of such a body of
            theory is becoming a genuine crisis.
            3) YET ANOTHER THEORY OF CAPITALISM
               One is loathe to suggest this but the endless drive to naturalize capitalism
            by reducing it to a matter of commercial calculation, which then allows one to
            claim it is as old as Sumer, just screams out for it. At the very least we need a
            proper theory of the history of wage labor, and relations like it. Since after all,
            it is in performing wage labor, not in buying and selling, that most humans
            now waste away most of their waking hours and it is that which makes them
            miserable. (Hence the IWW didn’t say they were “anti-capitalist,” much
            though they were; they got right to the point and said they were “against the
            wage system.”) The earliest wage labor contracts we have on record appear
            to be really about the rental of slaves. What about a model of capitalism that
            sets out from that? Where anthropologists like Jonathan Friedman argue that
            ancient slavery was really just an older version of capitalism, we could just as
            easily—actually, a lot more easily—argue that modern capitalism is really just
            a newer version of slavery. Instead of people selling us or renting us out we
            rent out ourselves. But it’s basically the same sort of arrangement.
            4) POWER/IGNORANCE, or POWER/STUPIDITY
               Academics love Michel Foucault’s argument that identiﬁes knowledge and
            power, and insists that brute force is no longer a major factor in social
            control. They love it because it ﬂatters them: the perfect formula for people
            who like to think of themselves as political radicals even though all they do is
            write essays likely to be read by a few dozen other people in an institutional
            environment. Of course, if any of these academics were to walk into their
            university library to consult some volume of Foucault without having
            remembered to bring a valid ID, and decided to enter the stacks anyway, they
            would soon discover that brute force is really not so far away as they like to
            imagine—a man with a big stick, trained in exactly how hard to hit people
            with it, would rapidly appear to eject them.
               In fact the threat of that man with the stick permeates our world at every
            moment; most of us have given up even thinking of crossing the innumerable
            lines and barriers he creates, just so we don’t have to remind ourselves of his
            existence. If you see a hungry woman standing several yards away from a
            huge pile of food—a daily occurrence for most of us who live in cities—there is
            a reason you can’t just take some and give it to her. A man with a big stick will
            come and very likely hit you. Anarchists, in contrast, have always delighted in
            reminding us of him. Residents of the squatter community of Christiana,
34 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            Denmark, for example, have a Christmastide ritual where they dress in Santa
            suits, take toys from department stores and distribute them to children on the
            street, partly just so everyone can relish the images of the cops beating down
            Santa and snatching the toys back from crying children.
              Such a theoretical emphasis opens the way to a theory of the relation of
            power not with knowledge, but with ignorance and stupidity. Because
            violence, particularly structural violence, where all the power is on one side,
            creates ignorance. If you have the power to hit people over the head
            whenever you want, you don’t have to trouble yourself too much ﬁguring out
            what they think is going on, and therefore, generally speaking, you don’t.
            Hence the sure-ﬁre way to simplify social arrangements, to ignore the
            incredibly complex play of perspectives, passions, insights, desires, and
            mutual understandings that human life is really made of, is to make a rule and
            threaten to attack anyone who breaks it. This is why violence has always been
            the favored recourse of the stupid: it is the one form of stupidity to which it is
            almost impossible to come up with an intelligent response. It is also of course
            the basis of the state.
              Contrary to popular belief, bureaucracies do not create stupidity. They are
            ways of managing situations that are already inherently stupid because they
            are, ultimately, based on the arbitrariness of force.
              Ultimately this should lead to a theory of the relation of violence and the
            imagination. Why is it that the folks on the bottom (the victims of structural
            violence) are always imagining what it must be like for the folks on top (the
            beneﬁciaries of structural violence), but it almost never occurs to the folks on
            top to wonder what it might be like to be on the bottom? Human beings being
            the sympathetic creatures that they are this tends to become one of the main
            bastions of any system of inequality—the downtrodden actually care about
            their oppressors, at least, far more than their oppressors care about them—
            but this seems itself to be an eﬀect of structural violence.
            5) AN ECOLOGY OF VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS
              What kinds exist? In what environments do they thrive? Where did the
            bizarre notion of the “corporation” come from anyway?
            6) A THEORY OF POLITICAL HAPPINESS
              Rather than just a theory of why most contemporary people never
            experience it. That would be easy.
            7) HIERARCHY
              A theory of how structures of hierarchy, by their own logic, necessarily
            create their own counterimage or negation. They do, you know.
            8) SUFFERING AND PLEASURE: ON THE
35 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            PRIVATIZATION OF DESIRE
              It is common wisdom among anarchists, autonomists, Situationists, and
            other new revolutionaries that the old breed of grim, determined, selfsacriﬁcing revolutionary, who sees the world only in terms of suﬀering will
            ultimately only produce more suﬀering himself. Certainly that’s what has
            tended to happen in the past. Hence the emphasis on pleasure, carnival, on
            creating “temporary autonomous zones” where one can live as if one is
            already free. The ideal of the “festival of resistance” with its crazy music and
            giant puppets is, quite consciously, to return to the late medieval world of
            huge wickerwork giants and dragons, maypoles and morris dancing; the very
            world the Puritan pioneers of the “capitalist spirit” hated so much and
            ultimately managed to destroy. The history of capitalism moves from attacks
            on collective, festive consumption to the promulgation of highly personal,
            private, even furtive forms (after all, once they had all those people dedicating
            all their time to producing stuﬀ instead of partying, they did have to ﬁgure out
            a way to sell it all); a process of the privitization of desire. The theoretical
            question: how to reconcile all this with the disturbing theoretical insight of
            people like Slavoj Zizek: that if one wishes to inspire ethnic hatred, the
            easiest way to do so is to concentrate on the bizarre, perverse ways in which
            the other group is assumed to pursue pleasure. If one wishes to emphasize
            commonality, the easiest way is to point out that they also feel pain.
            9) ONE OR SEVERAL THEORIES OF ALIENATION
              This is the ultimate prize: what, precisely, are the possible dimensions of
            non-alienated experience? How might its modalities be catalogued, or
            considered? Any anarchist anthropology worth its salt would have to pay
            particular attention to this question because this is precisely what all those
            punks, hippies, and activists of every stripe most look to anthropology to
            learn. It’s the anthropologists, so terriﬁed of being accused of romanticizing
            the societies they study that they refuse to even suggest there might be an
            answer, who leave them no recourse but to fall into the arms of the real
            romanticizers. Primitivists like John Zerzan, who in trying to whittle away
            what seems to divide us from pure, unmediated experience, end up whittling
            away absolutely everything. Zerzan’s increasingly popular works end up
            condemning the very existence of language, math, time keeping, music, and
            all forms of art and representation. They are all written oﬀ as forms of
            alienation, leaving us with a kind of impossible evolutionary ideal: the only
            truly non-alienated human being was not even quite human, but more a kind
            of perfect ape, in some kind of currently-unimaginable telepathic connection
            with its fellows, at one with wild nature, living maybe about a hundred
            thousand years ago. True revolution could only mean somehow returning to
            that. How it is that aﬀicionados of this sort of thing still manage to engage in
            eﬀective political action (because it’s been my experience that many do quite
            remarkable work) is itself a fascinating sociological question. But surely, an
            alternative analysis of alienation might be useful here.
              We could start with a kind of sociology of micro-utopias, the counterpart of
36 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            a parallel typology of forms of alienation, alienated and nonalienated forms of
            action... The moment we stop insisting on viewing all forms of action only by
            their function in reproducing larger, total, forms of inequality of power, we
            will also be able to see that anarchist social relations and non-alienated forms
            of action are all around us. And this is critical because it already shows that
            anarchism is, already, and has always been, one of the main bases for human
            interaction. We self-organize and engage in mutual aid all the time. We always
            have. We also engage in artistic creativity, which I think if examined would
            reveal that many of the least alienated forms of experience do usually involve
            an element of what a Marxist would call fetishization. It is all the more
            pressing to develop such a theory if you accept that (as I have frequently
            argued) revolutionary constituencies always involve a tacit alliance between
            the least alienated and the most oppressed.

                 Q: How many voters does it take to change a light bulb?
                 A: None. Because voters can’t change anything.
              There is of course no single anarchist program—nor could there really be—
            but it might be helpful to end by giving the reader some idea about current
            directions of thought and organizing.
            (1) Globalization and the Elimination of North-South
            Inequalities
              As I’ve mentioned, the “anti-globalization movement” is increasingly
            anarchist in inspiration. In the long run the anarchist position on globalization
            is obvious: the eﬀacement of nation-states will mean the elimination of
            national borders. This is genuine globalization. Anything else is just a sham.
            But for the interim, there are all sorts of concrete suggestions on how the
            situation can be improved right now, without falling back on statist,
            protectionist, approaches. One example:
              Once during the protests before the World Economic Forum, a kind of
            junket of tycoons, corporate ﬂacks and politicians, networking and sharing
            cocktails at the Waldorf Astoria, pretended to be discussing ways to alleviate
            global poverty. I was invited to engage in a radio debate with one of their
            representatives. As it happened the task went to another activist but I did get
            far enough to prepare a three-point program that I think would have taken
            care of the problem nicely:

               - an immediate amnesty on international debt (An amnesty on personal
                 debt might not be a bad idea either but it’s a diﬀerent issue.)

               - an immediate cancellation of all patents and other intellectual property
## rights related to technology more than one year old

               - the elimination of all restrictions on global freedom of travel or residence

              The rest would pretty much take care of itself. The moment the average
            resident of Tanzania, or Laos, was no longer forbidden to relocate to
            Minneapolis or Rotterdam, the government of every rich and powerful country
            in the world would certainly decide nothing was more important than ﬁnding
            a way to make sure people in Tanzania and Laos preferred to stay there. Do
            you really think they couldn’t come up with something?
              The point is that despite the endless rhetoric about “complex, subtle,
            intractable issues” (justifying decades of expensive research by the rich and
            their well-paid ﬂunkies), the anarchist program would probably have resolved
            most of them in ﬁve or six years. But, you will say, these demands are entirely
            unrealistic! True enough. But why are they unrealistic? Mainly, because those
            rich guys meeting in the Waldorf would never stand for any of it. This is why
            we say they are themselves the problem.
            (2) The Struggle Against Work
              The struggle against work has always been central to anarchist organizing.
            By this I mean, not the struggle for better worker conditions or higher wages,
            but the struggle to eliminate work, as a relation of domination, entirely. Hence
            the IWW slogan “against the wage system.” This is a long-term goal of course.
            In the shorter term, what can’t be eliminated can at least be reduced. Around
            the turn of the century, the Wobblies and other anarchists played the central
            role in winning workers the 5-day week and 8-hour day.
              In Western Europe social democratic governments are now, for the ﬁrst time
            in almost a century, once again reducing the working week. They are only
            instituting triﬂing changes (from a 40-hour week to 35), but in the US no
            one’s even discussing that much. Instead they are discussing whether to
            eliminate timeand-a-half for overtime. This despite the fact that Americans
            now spend more hours working than any other population in the world,
            including Japan. So the Wobblies have reappeared, with what was to be the
            next step in their program, even back in the ‘20s: the 16-hour week. (“4-day
            week, 4-hour day.”) Again, on the face of it, this seems completely unrealistic,
            even insane. But has anyone carried out a feasibility study? After all, it has
            been repeatedly demonstrated that a considerable chunk of the hours worked
            in America are only actually necessary to compensate for problems created by
            the fact that Americans work too much. (Consider here such jobs as all-night
            pizza deliveryman or dog-washer, or those women who run nighttime day care
            centers for the children of women who have to work nights providing child
            care for businesswomen...not to mention the endless hours spent by
            specialists cleaning up the emotional and physical damage caused by
            overwork, the injuries, suicides, divorces, murderous rampages, producing
            the drugs to pacify the children...)
              So what jobs are really necessary?
              Well, for starters, there are lots of jobs whose disappearance, almost
            everyone would agree, would be a net gain for humanity. Consider here
            telemarketers, stretch-SUV manufacturers, or for that matter, corporate
            lawyers. We could also eliminate the entire advertising and PR industries, ﬁre
            all politicians and their staﬀs, eliminate anyone remotely connected with an
38 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            HMO, without even beginning to get near essential social functions. The
            elimination of advertising would also reduce the production, shipping, and
            selling of unnecessary products, since those items people actually do want or
            need, they will still ﬁgure out a way to ﬁnd out about. The elimination of
            radical inequalities would mean we would no longer require the services of
            most of the millions currently employed as doormen, private security forces,
            prison guards, or SWAT teams—not to mention the military. Beyond that, we’d
            have to do research. Financiers, insurers, and investment bankers are all
            essentially parasitic beings, but there might be some useful functions in these
            sectors that could not simply be replaced with software. All in all we might
            discover that if we identiﬁed the work that really did need to be done to
            maintain a comfortable and ecologically sustainable standard of living, and
            redistribute the hours, it may turn out that the Wobbly platform is perfectly
            realistic. Especially if we bear in mind that it’s not like anyone would be
            forced to stop working after four hours if they didn’t feel like it. A lot of
            people do enjoy their jobs, certainly more than they would lounging around
            doing nothing all day (that’s why in prisons, when they want to punish
            inmates, they take away their right to work), and if one has eliminated the
            endless indignities and sadomasochistic games that inevitably follow from topdown organization, one would expect a lot more would. It might even turn out
            that no one will have to work more than they particularly want to.
                 minor note:
                 Admittedly, all of this presumes the total reorganization of work, a
                 kind of “after the revolution” scenario which I’ve argued is a
                 necessary tool to even begin to think about human possibilities,
                 even if revolution will probably never take such an apocalyptic form.
                 This of course brings up the “who will do the dirty jobs?” question—
                 one which always gets thrown at anarchists or other utopians. Peter
                 Kropotkin long ago pointed out the fallacy of the argument. There’s
                 no particular reason dirty jobs have to exist. If one divided up the
                 unpleasant tasks equally, that would mean all the world’s top
                 scientists and engineers would have to do them too; one could
                 expect the creation of self-cleaning kitchens and coal-mining robots
## almost immediately.

              All this is something of an aside though because what I really want to do in
            this ﬁnal section is focus on:
            (3) DEMOCRACY
              This might give the reader a chance to have a glance at what anarchist, and
            anarchist-inspired, organizing is actually like—some of the contours of the
            new world now being built in the shell of the old—and to show what the
            historical-ethnographic perspective I’ve been trying to develop here, our nonexistent science, might be able to contribute to it.
              The ﬁrst cycle of the new global uprising— what the press still insists on
            referring to, increasingly ridiculously, as “the anti-globalization movement”—
39 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            began with the autonomous municipalities of Chiapas and came to a head
            with the asambleas barreales of Buenos Aires, and cities throughout
            Argentina. There is hardly room here to tell the whole story: beginning with
            the Zapatistas’ rejection of the idea of seizing power and their attempt
            instead to create a model of democratic self-organization to inspire the rest of
            Mexico; their initiation of an international network (People’s Global Action, or
            PGA) which then put out the calls for days of action against the WTO (in
            Seattle), IMF (in Washington, Prague...) and so on; and ﬁnally, the collapse of
            the Argentine economy, and the overwhelming popular uprising which, again,
            rejected the very idea that one could ﬁnd a solution by replacing one set of
            politicians with another. The slogan of the Argentine movement was, from the
            start, que se vayan todas—get rid of the lot of them. Instead of a new
            government they created a vast network of alternative institutions, starting
            with popular assemblies to govern each urban neighborhood (the only
            limitation on participation is that one cannot be employed by a political
            party), hundreds of occupied, worker-managed factories, a complex system of
            “barter” and newfangled alternative currency system to keep them in
            operation—in short, an endless variation on the theme of direct democracy.
              All of this has happened completely below the radar screen of the corporate
            media, which also missed the point of the great mobilizations. The
            organization of these actions was meant to be a living illustration of what a
            truly democratic world might be like, from the festive puppets to the careful
            organization of aﬀinity groups and spokescouncils, all operating without a
            leadership structure, always based on principles of consensus-based direct
            democracy. It was the kind of organization which most people would have,
            had they simply heard it proposed, written oﬀ as a pipe-dream; but it worked,
            and so eﬀectively that the police departments of city after city were
            completely ﬂummoxed with how to deal with them. Of course, this also had
            something to do with the unprecedented tactics (hundreds of activists in fairy
            suits tickling police with feather dusters, or padded with so many inﬂatable
            inner tubes and rubber cushions they seemed to roll along like the Michelin
            man over barricades, incapable of damaging anyone else but also pretty much
            impervious to police batons...), which completely confused traditional
            categories of violence and nonviolence.
              When protesters in Seattle chanted “this is what democracy looks like,”
            they meant to be taken literally. In the best tradition of direct action, they not
            only confronted a certain form of power, exposing its mechanisms and
            attempting literally to stop it in its tracks: they did it in a way which
            demonstrated why the kind of social relations on which it is based were
            unnecessary. This is why all the condescending remarks about the movement
            being dominated by a bunch of dumb kids with no coherent ideology
            completely missed the mark. The diversity was a function of the decentralized
            form of organization, and this organization was the movement’s ideology.
              The key term in the new movement is “process,” by which is meant,
            decision-making process. In North America, this is almost invariably done
            through some process of ﬁnding consensus. This is as I mentioned much less
            ideologically stiﬂing than it may sound because the assumption behind all
            good consensus process is that one should not even try to convert others to
            one’s overall point of view; the point of consensus process is to allow a group
40 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            to decide on a common course of action. Instead of voting proposals up and
            down, then, proposals are worked and reworked, scotched or reinvented, until
            one ends up with something everyone can live with. When it comes to the ﬁnal
            stage, actually “ﬁnding consensus,” there are two levels of possible objection:
            one can “stand aside,” which is to say “I don’t like this and won’t participate
            but I wouldn’t stop anyone else from doing it,” or “block,” which has the eﬀect
            of a veto. One can only block if one feels a proposal is in violation of the
            fundamental principles or reasons for being of a group. One might say that
            the function which in the US constitution is relegated to the courts, of striking
            down legislative decisions that violate constitutional principles, is here
            relegated to anyone with the courage to actually stand up against the
            combined will of the group (though of course there are also ways of
            challenging unprincipled blocks).
              One could go on at length about the elaborate and surprisingly
            sophisticated methods that have been developed to ensure all this works; of
            forms of modiﬁed consensus required for very large groups; of the way
            consensus itself reinforces the principle of decentralization by ensuring one
            doesn’t really want to bring proposals before very large groups unless one has
            to, of means of ensuring gender equity and resolving conﬂict... The point is
            this is a form of direct democracy which is very diﬀerent than the kind we
            usually associate with the term-—or, for that matter, with the kind usually
            employed by European or North American anarchists of earlier generations,
            or still employed, say, in urban Argentine asambleas. In North America,
            consensus process emerged more than anything else through the feminist
            movement, as part of broad backlash against some of the more obnoxious,
            self-aggrandizing macho leadership styles of the ‘60s New Left. Much of the
            procedure was originally adopted from the Quakers, and Quakerinspired
            groups; the Quakers, in turn, claim to have been inspired by Native American
            practice. How much the latter is really true is, in historical terms, diﬀicult to
            determine. Nonetheless, Native American decision-making did normally work
            by some form of consensus. Actually, so do most popular assemblies around
            the world now, from the Tzeltal or Tzotzil or Tojolobal-speaking communities
            in Chiapas to Malagasy fokon’olona. After having lived in Madagascar for two
            years, I was startled, the ﬁrst time I started attending meetings of the Direct
            Action Network in New York, by how familiar it all seemed—the main
            diﬀerence was that the DAN process was so much more formalized and
            explicit. It had to be, since everyone in DAN was just ﬁguring out how to
            make decisions this way, and everything had to be spelled out; whereas in
            Madagascar, everyone had been doing this since they learned to speak.
              In fact, as anthropologists are aware, just about every known human
            community which has to come to group decisions has employed some
            variation of what I’m calling “consensus process”—every one, that is, which is
            not in some way or another drawing on the tradition of ancient Greece.
            Majoritarian democracy, in the formal, Roberts Rules of Ordertype sense
            rarely emerges of its own accord. It’s curious that almost no one,
            anthropologists included, ever seems to ask oneself why this should be.

## An hypothesis.

                 Majoritarian democracy was, in its origins, essentially a military
41 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...

## institution.

                 Of course it’s the peculiar bias of Western historiography that this is
                 the only sort of democracy that is seen to count as “democracy” at
                 all. We are usually told that democracy originated in ancient Athens
                 —like science, or philosophy, it was a Greek invention. It’s never
                 entirely clear what this is supposed to mean. Are we supposed to
                 believe that before the Athenians, it never really occurred to
                 anyone, anywhere, to gather all the members of their community in
                 order to make joint decisions in a way that gave everyone equal say?
## That would be ridiculous. Clearly there have been plenty of
                 egalitarian societies in history— many far more egalitarian than
## Athens, many that must have existed before 500 BCE—and
                 obviously, they must have had some kind of procedure for coming to
                 decisions for matters of collective importance. Yet somehow, it is
                 always assumed that these procedures, whatever they might have
## been, could not have been, properly speaking, “democratic.”

                 Even scholars with otherwise impeccable radical credentials,
## promoters of direct democracy, have been known to bend
                 themselves into pretzels trying to justify this attitude. Non-Western
                 egalitarian communities are “kin-based,” argues Murray Bookchin.
                 (And Greece was not? Of course the Athenian agora was not itself
                 kin-based but neither is a Malagasy fokon’olona or Balinese seka. So
## what?) “Some might speak of Iroquois or Berber democracy,”
                 argued Cornelius Castoriadis, “but this is an abuse of the term.
                 These are primitive societies which assume the social order is
                 handed to them by gods or spirits, not self-constituted by the people
                 themselves as in Athens.” (Really? In fact the “League of the
                 Iroquois” was a treaty organization, seen as a common agreement
                 created in historical times, and subject to constant renegotiation.)
                 The arguments never make sense. But they don’t really have to
                 because we are not really dealing with arguments at all here, so
## much as with the brush of a hand.

                 The real reason for the unwillingness of most scholars to see a
                 Sulawezi or Tallensi village council as “democratic”—well, aside
                 from simple racism, the reluctance to admit anyone Westerners
                 slaughtered with such relative impunity were quite on the level as
                 Pericles—is that they do not vote. Now, admittedly, this is an
                 interesting fact. Why not? If we accept the idea that a show of
                 hands, or having everyone who supports a proposition stand on one
                 side of the plaza and everyone against stand on the other, are not
                 really such incredibly sophisticated ideas that they never would
                 have occurred to anyone until some ancient genius “invented” them,
                 then why are they so rarely employed? Again, we seem to have an
                 example of explicit rejection. Over and over, across the world, from
                 Australia to Siberia, egalitarian communities have preferred some
## variation on consensus process. Why?

42 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
                 The explanation I would propose is this: it is much easier, in a face-
## to-face community, to ﬁgure out what most members of that
                 community want to do, than to ﬁgure out how to convince those who
                 do not to go along with it. Consensus decision-making is typical of
                 societies where there would be no way to compel a minority to
                 agree with a majority decision—either because there is no state with
                 a monopoly of coercive force, or because the state has nothing to do
                 with local decision-making. If there is no way to compel those who
                 ﬁnd a majority decision distasteful to go along with it, then the last
                 thing one would want to do is to hold a vote: a public contest which
                 someone will be seen to lose. Voting would be the most likely means
                 to guarantee humiliations, resentments, hatreds, in the end, the
                 destruction of communities. What is seen as an elaborate and
                 diﬀicult process of ﬁnding consensus is, in fact, a long process of
                 making sure no one walks away feeling that their views have been
## totally ignored.

## Majority democracy, we might say, can only emerge when two
                 factors coincide:

                    1. a feeling that people should have equal say in making group
## decisions, and

                    2. a coercive apparatus capable of enforcing those decisions.

                 For most of human history, it has been extremely unusual to have
                 both at the same time. Where egalitarian societies exist, it is also
                 usually considered wrong to impose systematic coercion. Where a
                 machinery of coercion did exist, it did not even occur to those
                 wielding it that they were enforcing any sort of popular will.
                 It is of obvious relevance that Ancient Greece was one of the most
                 competitive societies known to history. It was a society that tended
## to make everything into a public contest, from athletics to
                 philosophy or tragic drama or just about anything else. So it might
                 not seem entirely surprising that they made political decisionmaking into a public contest as well. Even more crucial though was
                 the fact that decisions were made by a populace in arms. Aristotle,
                 in his Politics, remarks that the constitution of a Greek city-state
                 will normally depend on the chief arm of its military: if this is
                 cavalry, it will be an aristocracy, since horses are expensive. If
                 hoplite infantry, it will have an oligarchy, as all could not aﬀord the
                 armor and training. If its power was based in the navy or light
                 infantry, one could expect a democracy, as anyone can row, or use a
                 sling. In other words if a man is armed, then one pretty much has to
                 take his opinions into account. One can see how this worked at its
                 starkest in Xenophon’s Anabasis, which tells the story of an army of
                 Greek mercenaries who suddenly ﬁnd themselves leaderless and
                 lost in the middle of Persia. They elect new oﬀicers, and then hold a
                 collective vote to decide what to do next. In a case like this, even if
43 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
                 the vote was 60/40, everyone could see the balance of forces and
                 what would happen if things actually came to blows. Every vote was,
## in a real sense, a conquest.

                 Roman legions could be similarly democratic; this was the main
                 reason they were never allowed to enter the city of Rome. And when
                 Machiavelli revived the notion of a democratic republic at the dawn
                 of the “modern” era, he immediately reverted to the notion of a
## populace in arms.

                 This in turn might help explain the term “democracy” itself, which
                 appears to have been coined as something of a slur by its elitist
                 opponents: it literally means the “force” or even “violence” of the
                 people. Kratos, not archos. The elitists who coined the term always
                 considered democracy not too far from simple rioting or mob rule;
                 though of course their solution was the permanent conquest of the
                 people by someone else. And ironically, when they did manage to
                 suppress democracy for this reason, which was usually, the result
                 was that the only way the general populace’s will was known was
## precisely through rioting, a practice that became quite
                 institutionalized in, say, imperial Rome or eighteenthcentury
## England.

                 All this is not to say that direct democracies— as practiced, for
                 example, in medieval cities or New England town meetings—were
                 not normally orderly and digniﬁed procedures; though one suspects
                 that here too, in actual practice, there was a certain baseline of
                 consensus-seeking going on. Still, it was this military undertone
                 which allowed the authors of the Federalist Papers, like almost all
                 other literate men of their day, to take it for granted that what they
                 called “democracy”—by which they meant, direct democracy—was
                 in its nature the most unstable, tumultuous form of government, not
                 to mention one which endangers the rights of minorities (the
                 speciﬁc minority they had in mind in this case being the rich). It was
## only once the term “democracy” could be almost completely
                 transformed to incorporate the principle of representation—a term
## which itself has a very curious history, since as Cornelius
                 Castoriadis notes, it originally referred to representatives of the
                 people before the king, internal ambassadors in fact, rather than
## those who wielded power in any sense themselves—that it was
                 rehabilitated, in the eyes of well-born political theorists, and took on
## the meaning it has today.

              In a sense then anarchists think all those rightwing political theorists who
            insist that “America is not a democracy; it’s a republic” are quite correct. The
            diﬀerence is that anarchists have a problem with that. They think it ought to
            be a democracy. Though increasing numbers have come to accept that the
            traditional elitist criticism of majoritarian direct democracy is not entirely
            baseless either.
              I noted earlier that all social orders are in some sense at war with
44 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            themselves. Those unwilling to establish an apparatus of violence for
            enforcing decisions necessarily have to develop an apparatus for creating and
            maintaining social consensus (at least in that minimal sense of ensuring
            malcontents can still feel they have freely chosen to go along with bad
            decisions); as an apparent result, the internal war ends up projected outwards
            into endless night battles and forms of spectral violence. Majoritarian direct
            democracy is constantly threatening to make those lines of force explicit. For
            this reason it does tend to be rather unstable: or more precisely, if it does last,
            it’s because its institutional forms (the medieval city, New England town
            council, for that matter gallup polls, referendums...) are almost invariably
            ensconced within a larger framework of governance in which ruling elites use
            that very instability to justify their ultimate monopoly of the means of
            violence. Finally, the threat of this instability becomes an excuse for a form of
            “democracy” so minimal that it comes down to nothing more than insisting
            that ruling elites should occasionally consult with “the public”—in carefully
            staged contests, replete with rather meaningless jousts and tournaments—to
            reestablish their right to go on making their decisions for them.
               It’s a trap. Bouncing back and forth between the two ensures it will remain
            extremely unlikely that one could ever imagine it would be possible for people
            to manage their own lives, without the help of “representatives.” It’s for this
            reason the new global movement has begun by reinventing the very meaning
            of democracy. To do so ultimately means, once again, coming to terms with
            the fact that “we”—whether as “the West” (whatever that means), as the
            “modern world,” or anything else—are not really as special as we like to think
            we are; that we’re not the only people ever to have practiced democracy; that
            in fact, rather than disseminating democracy around the world, “Western”
            governments have been spending at least as much time inserting themselves
            into the lives of people who have been practicing democracy for thousands of
            years, and in one way or another, telling them to cut it out.
               One of the most encouraging things about these new, anarchist-inspired
            movements is that they propose a new form of internationalism. Older,
            communist internationalism had some very beautiful ideals, but in
            organizational terms, everyone basically ﬂowed one way. It became a means
            for regimes outside Europe and its settler colonies to learn Western styles of
            organization: party structures, plenaries, purges, bureaucratic hierarchies,
            secret police... This time—the second wave of internationalism one could call
            it, or just, anarchist globalization—the movement of organizational forms has
            largely gone the other way. It’s not just consensus process: the idea of mass
            non-violent direct action ﬁrst developed in South Africa and India; the current
            network model was ﬁrst proposed by rebels in Chiapas; even the notion of the
            aﬀinity group came out of Spain and Latin America. The fruits of ethnography
            —and the techniques of ethnography—could be enormously helpful here if
            anthropologists can get past their—however understandable—hesitancy,
            owing to their own often squalid colonial history, and come to see what they
            are sitting on not as some guilty secret (which is nonetheless their guilty
            secret, and no one else’s) but as the common property of humankind.
            ANTHROPOLOGY (in which the author
45 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            somewhat reluctantly bites the hand that feeds
            him)
              The ﬁnal question—one that I’ve admittedly been rather avoiding up to now
            —is why anthropologists haven’t, so far? I have already described why I think
            academics, in general, have rarely felt much aﬀinity with anarchism. I’ve
            talked a little about the radical inclinations in much early twentieth-century
            anthropology, which often showed a very strong aﬀinity with anarchism, but
            that seemed to largely evaporate over time. It’s all a little odd.
            Anthropologists are after all the only group of scholars who know anything
            about actually-existing stateless societies; many have actually lived in corners
            of the world where states have ceased to function or at least temporarily
            pulled up stakes and left, and people are managing their own aﬀairs
            autonomously; if nothing else, they are keenly aware that the most
            commonplace assumptions about what would happen in the absence of a state
            (“but people would just kill each other!”) are factually untrue.
              Why, then?
              Well, there are any number of reasons. Some are understandable enough. If
            anarchism is, essentially, an ethics of practice, then meditating on
            anthropological practice tends to kick up a lot of unpleasant things.
            Particularly if one concentrates on the experience of anthropological
            ﬁeldwork—-which is what anthropologists invariably tend to do when they
            become reﬂexive. The discipline we know today was made possible by horriﬁc
            schemes of conquest, colonization, and mass murder—much like most modern
            academic disciplines, actually, including geography, and botany, not even to
            mention ones like mathematics, linguistics or robotics, which still are, but
            anthropologists, since their work tends to involve getting to know the victims
            personally, have ended up agonizing over this in ways that the proponents of
            other disciplines have almost never done. The result has been strangely
            paradoxical: anthropological reﬂections on their own culpability has mainly
            had the eﬀect of providing non-anthropologists who do not want to be
            bothered having to learn about 90% of human experience with a handy two or
            three sentence dismissal (you know: all about projecting one’s sense of
            Otherness into the colonized) by which they can feel morally superior to those
            who do.
              For the anthropologists themselves, the results have been strangely
            paradoxical as well. While anthropologists are, eﬀectively, sitting on a vast
            archive of human experience, of social and political experiments no one else
            really knows about, that very body of comparative ethnography is seen as
            something shameful. As I mentioned, it is treated not as the common heritage
            of humankind, but as our dirty little secret. Which is actually convenient, at
            least insofar as academic power is largely about establishing ownership rights
            over a certain form of knowledge and ensuring that others don’t really have
            much access to it. Because as I also mentioned, our dirty little secret is still
            ours. It’s not something one needs to share with others.
              There’s more to it though. In many ways, anthropology seems a discipline
            terriﬁed of its own potential. It is, for example, the only discipline in a position
            to make generalizations about humanity as a whole—since it is the only
46 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            discipline that actually takes all of humanity into account, and is familiar with
            all the anomalous cases. (“All societies practice marriage, you say? Well that
            depends on how you deﬁne ‘marriage.’ Among the Nayar...”) Yet it resolutely
            refuses to do so. I don’t think this is to be accounted for solely as an
            understandable reaction to the right-wing proclivity to make grand arguments
            about human nature to justify very particular, and usually, particularly nasty
            social institutions (rape, war, free market capitalism)—though certainly that is
            a big part of it. Partly it’s just the vastness of the subject matter. Who really
            has the means, in discussing, say, conceptions of desire, or imagination, or the
            self, or sovereignty, to consider everything Chinese or Indian or Islamic
            thinkers have had to say on the matter in addition to the Western canon, let
            alone folk conceptions prevalent in hundreds of Oceanic or Native American
            societies as well? It’s just too daunting. As a result, anthropologists no longer
            produce many broad theoretical generalizations at all—instead, turning over
            the work to European philosophers who usually have absolutely no problem
            discussing desire, or the imagination, or the self, or sovereignty, as if such
            concepts had been invented by Plato or Aristotle, developed by Kant or
            DeSade, and never meaningfully discussed by anyone outside of elite literary
            traditions in Western Europe or North America. Where once anthropologists’
            key theoretical terms were words like mana, totem, or taboo, the new
            buzzwords are invariably derived from Latin or Greek, usually via French,
            occasionally German.
               So while anthropology might seem perfectly positioned to provide an
            intellectual forum for all sorts of planetary conversations, political and
            otherwise, there is a certain built-in reluctance to do so.
               Then there’s the question of politics. Most anthropologists write as if their
            work has obvious political signiﬁcance, in a tone which suggests they consider
            what they are doing quite radical, and certainly left of center. But what does
            this politics actually consist of? It’s increasingly hard to say. Do
            anthropologists tend to be anti-capitalist? Certainly it’s hard to think of one
            who has much good to say about capitalism. Many are in the habit of
            describing the current age as one of “late capitalism,” as if by declaring it is
            about to end, they can by the very act of doing so hasten its demise. But it’s
            hard to think of an anthropologist who has, recently, made any sort of
            suggestion of what an alternative to capitalism might be like. So are they
            liberals? Many can’t pronounce the word without a snort of contempt. What
            then? As far as I can make out the only real fundamental political commitment
            running through the entire ﬁeld is a kind of broad populism. If nothing else,
            we are deﬁnitely not on the side of whoever, in a given situation, is or fancies
            themselves to be the elite. We’re for the little guys. Since in practice, most
            anthropologists are attached to (increasingly global) universities, or if not,
            end up in jobs like marketing consultancies or jobs with the UN-—positions
            within the very apparatus of global rule—what this really comes down to is a
            kind of constant, ritualized declaration of disloyalty to that very global elite of
            which we ourselves, as academics, clearly form one (admittedly somewhat
            marginal) fraction.
               Now, what form does this populism take in practice? Mainly, it means that
            you must demonstrate that the people you are studying, the little guys, are
            successfully resisting some form of power or globalizing inﬂuence imposed on
47 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            them from above. This is, anyway, what most anthropologists talk about when
            the subject turns to globalization—which it usually does almost immediately,
            nowadays, whatever it is you study. Whether it is advertising, or soap operas,
            or forms of labor discipline, or state-imposed legal systems, or anything else
            that might seem to be crushing or homogenizing or manipulating one’s
            people, one demonstrates that they are not fooled, not crushed, not
            homogenized; indeed they are creatively appropriating or reinterpreting what
            is being thrown at them in ways that its authors would never have
            anticipated. Of course, to some extent all this is true. I would certainly not
            wish to deny it is important to combat the—still remarkably widespread—
            popular assumption that the moment people in Bhutan or Irian Jaya are
            exposed to MTV, their civilization is basically over. What’s disturbing, at least
            to me, is the degree to which this logic comes to echo that of global
            capitalism. Advertising agencies, after all, do not claim to be imposing
            anything on the public either. Particularly in this era of market segmentation,
            they claim to be providing material for members of the public to appropriate
            and make their own in unpredictable and idiosyncratic ways. The rhetoric of
            “creative consumption” in particular could be considered the very ideology of
            the new global market: a world in which all human behavior can be classiﬁed
            as either production, exchange, or consumption; in which exchange is
            assumed to be driven by basic human proclivities for rational pursuit of proﬁt
            which are the same everywhere, and consumption becomes a way to establish
            one’s particular identity (and production is not discussed at all if one can
            possibly avoid it). We’re all the same on the trading ﬂoor; it’s what we do with
            the stuﬀ when we get home that makes us diﬀerent. This market logic has
            become so deeply internalized that, if, say, a woman in Trinidad puts together
            some outrageous get-up and goes out dancing, anthropologists will
            automatically assume that what she’s doing can be deﬁned as “consumption”
            (as opposed to, say, showing oﬀ or having a good time), as if what’s really
            important about her evening is the fact that she buys a couple drinks, or
            maybe, because the anthropologist considers wearing clothes itself to be
            somehow like drinking, or maybe, because they just don’t think about it at all
            and assume that whatever one does that isn’t working is “consumption”
            because what’s really important about it is that manufactured products are
            involved. The perspective of the anthropologist and the global marketing
            executive have become almost indistinguishable.
              It’s not that diﬀerent on the political level. Lauren Leve has recently warned
            that anthropologists risk, if they are not careful, becoming yet another cog in
            a global “identity machine,” a planet-wide apparatus of institutions and
            assumptions that has, over the last decade or so, eﬀectively informed the
            earth’s inhabitants (or at least, all but the very most elite) that, since all
            debates about the nature of political or economic possibilities are now over,
            the only way one can now make a political claim is by asserting some group
            identity, with all the assumptions about what identity is (i.e., that group
            identities are not ways of comparing one group to each other but constituted
            by the way a group relates to its own history, that there is no essential
            diﬀerence in this regard between individuals and groups...) established in
            advance. Things have come to such a pass that in countries like Nepal even
            Theravada Buddhists are forced to play identity politics, a particularly bizarre
48 of 51 10/1/25, 7:44 PM Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-fr...
            spectacle since they are essentially basing their identity claims on adherence
            to a universalistic philosophy that insists identity is an illusion.
              Many years ago a French anthropologist named Gerard Althabe wrote a
            book about Madagascar called Oppression et Liberation dans l’Imaginaire. It’s
            a catchy phrase. I think it might well be applied to what ends up happening in
            a lot of anthropological writing. For the most part, what we call “identities”
            here, in what Paul Gilroy likes to call the “over-developed world,” are forced
            on people. In the United States, most are the products of ongoing oppression
            and inequality: someone who is deﬁned as Black is not allowed to forget that
            during a single moment of their existence; his or her own self-deﬁnition is of
            no signiﬁcance to the banker who will deny him credit, or the policeman who
            will arrest him for being in the wrong neighborhood, or the doctor who, in the
            case of a damaged limb, will be more likely to recommend amputation. All
            attempts at individual or collective self-fashioning or self-invention have to
            take place entirely within those extremely violent sets of constraints. (The
            only real way that could change would be to transform the attitudes of those
            who have the privilege of being deﬁned as “White”—ultimately, probably, by
            destroying the category of Whiteness itself.) The fact is though that nobody
            has any idea how most people in North America would chose to deﬁne
            themselves if institutional racism were to actually vanish—if everyone really
            were left free to deﬁne themselves however they wished. Neither is there
            much point in speculating about it. The question is how to create a situation
            where we could ﬁnd out.
              This is what I mean by “liberation in the imaginary.” To think about what it
            would take to live in a world in which everyone really did have the power to
            decide for themselves, individually and collectively, what sort of communities
            they wished to belong to and what sort of identities they wanted to take on—
            that’s really diﬀicult. To bring about such a world would be almost
            unimaginably diﬀicult. It would require changing almost everything. It also
            would meet with stubborn, and ultimately violent, opposition from those who
            beneﬁt the most from existing arrangements. To instead write as if these
            identities are already freely created—or largely so—is easy, and it lets one
            entirely oﬀ the hook for the intricate and intractable problems of the degree
            to which one’s own work is part of this very identity machine. But it no more
            makes it true than talking about “late capitalism” will itself bring about
            industrial collapse or further social revolution.

                 In case it’s not clear what I am saying here, let me return for a
                 moment to the Zapatista rebels of Chiapas, whose revolt on New
                 Year’s day, 1994, might be said to have kicked oﬀ what came to be
## known as the globalization movement. The Zapatistas were
                 overwhelmingly drawn from Tzeltal, Tzotzil and Tojolobal Maya-
## speaking communities that had established themselves in the
## Lacandon rain forest—some of the poorest and most exploited
                 communities in Mexico. The Zapatistas do not call themselves
                 anarchists, quite, or even, quite autonomists; they represent their
                 own unique strand within that broader tradition; indeed, they are
                 trying to revolutionize revolutionary strategy itself by abandoning

                 any notion of a vanguard party seizing control of the state, but
                 instead battling to create free enclaves that could serve as models
                 for autonomous self-government, allowing a general reorganization
## of Mexican society into a complex overlapping network of
## selfmanaging groups that could then begin to discuss the
                 reinvention of political society. There was, apparently, some
                 diﬀerence of opinion within the Zapatista movement itself over the
                 forms of democratic practice they wished to promulgate. The Mayaspeaking base pushed strongly for a form of consensus process
                 adopted from their own communal traditions, but reformulated to be
                 more radically egalitarian; some of the Spanish-speaking military
                 leadership of the rebellion were highly skeptical of whether this
                 could really be applied on the national level. Ultimately, though,
                 they had to defer to the vision of those they “led by obeying,” as the
## Zapatista saying went. But the remarkable thing was what
                 happened when news of this rebellion spread to the rest of the
                 world. It’s here we can really see the workings of Leve’s “identity
                 machine.” Rather than a band of rebels with a vision of radical
                 democratic transformation, they were immediately redeﬁned as a
                 band of Mayan Indians demanding indigenous autonomy. This is
                 how the international media portrayed them; this is what was
                 considered important about them from everyone from humanitarian
                 organizations to Mexican bureaucrats to human rights monitors at
                 the UN. As time went on, the Zapatistas—whose strategy has from
                 the beginning been dependent on gaining allies in the international
                 community— were increasingly forced to play the indigenous card
                 as well, except when dealing with their most committed allies.
                 This strategy has not been entirely ineﬀective. Ten years later, the
                 Zapatista Army of National Liberation is still there, without having
                 hardly had to ﬁre a shot, if only because they have been willing, for
                 the time being, to downplay the “National” part in their name. All I
                 want to emphasize is exactly how patronizing—or, maybe let’s not
                 pull punches here, how completely racist—the international reaction
                 to the Zapatista rebellion has really been. Because what the
                 Zapatistas were proposing to do was exactly to begin that diﬀicult
                 work that, I pointed out, so much of the rhetoric about “identity”
                 eﬀectively ignores: trying to work out what forms of organization,
                 what forms of process and deliberation, would be required to create
                 a world in which people and communities are actually free to
                 determine for themselves what sort of people and communities they
                 wish to be. And what were they told? Eﬀectively, they were informed
                 that, since they were Maya, they could not possibly have anything to
                 say to the world about the processes through which identity is
                 constructed; or about the nature of political possibilities. As Mayas,
                 the only possible political statement they could make to non-Mayas
                 would be about their Maya identity itself. They could assert the
                 right to continue to be Mayan. They could demand recognition as
                 Mayan. But for a Maya to say something to the world that was not

                 simply a comment on their own Maya-ness would be inconceivable.
              And who was listening to what they really had to say?
              Largely, it seems, a collection of teenage anarchists in Europe and North
            America, who soon began besieging the summits of the very global elite to
            whom anthropologists maintain such an uneasy, uncomfortable, alliance.
              But the anarchists were right. I think anthropologists should make common
            cause with them. We have tools at our ﬁngertips that could be of enormous
            importance for human freedom. Let’s start taking some responsibility for it.
