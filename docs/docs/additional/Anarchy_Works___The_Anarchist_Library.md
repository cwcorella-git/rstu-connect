               Dedicated to the wonderful people of RuinAmalia, La
               Revoltosa, and the Kyiv infoshop, for making anarchy work.
               Although this book started out as an individual project, in the
               end a great many people, most of whom prefer to remain
               anonymous, helped make it possible through proofreading,
               fact-checking, recommending sources, editing, and more. To
               acknowledge only a small part of this help, the author would
               like to thank John, Jose, Vila Kula, aaaa!, L, J, and G for providing
               computer access throughout a year of moves, evictions,
               crashes, viruses, and so forth. Thanks to Jessie Dodson and
               Katie Clark for helping with the research on another project,
               that I ended up using for this book. Also thanks to C and E, for
               lending their passwords for free access to the databases of
               scholarly articles available to university students but not to the
               rest of us.

               There are hidden stories all around us,
               growing in abandoned villages in the mountains
               or vacant lots in the city,
               petrifying beneath our feet in the remains
               of societies like nothing we’ve known,
               whispering to us that things could be different.
               But the politician you know is lying to you,
               the manager who hires and fires you,
               the landlord who evicts you,
               the president of the bank that owns your house,
               the professor who grades your papers,
               the cop who rolls your street,
               the reporter who informs you,
               the doctor who medicates you,
               the husband who beats you,
               the mother who spanks you,
               the soldier who kills for you,
               and the social worker who fits your past and future into a folder
               in a filing cabinet
               all ask
               “WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITHOUT US?
               It would be anarchy.”

               *****

               And the daughter who runs away from home,
               the bus driver on the picket line,
               the veteran who threw back his medal but holds on to his rifle,
               the boy saved from suicide by the love of his friends,
               the maid who must bow to those who can’t even cook for
               themselves,

               the immigrant hiking across a desert to find her family on the
               other side,
               the kid on his way to prison because he burned down a
               shopping mall they were building over his childhood dreams,
               the neighbor who cleans up the syringes from the vacant lot,
               hoping someone will turn it into a garden,
               the hitchhiker on the open road,
               the college dropout who gave up on career and health
               insurance and sometimes even food so he could write
               revolutionary poetry for the world,
               maybe all of us can feel it:
               our bosses and tormentors are afraid of what they would do
               without us,
               and their threat is a promise —
               the best parts of our lives are anarchy already.
               Introduction
               Anarchy Would Never Work
               Anarchism is the boldest of revolutionary social movements to
               emerge from the struggle against capitalism — it aims for a
               world free from all forms of domination and exploitation. But at
               its heart is a simple and convincing proposition: people know
               how to live their own lives and organize themselves better than
               any expert could. Others cynically claim that people do not
               know what is in their best interests, that they need a
               government to protect them, that the ascension of some
               political party could somehow secure the interests of all
               members of society. Anarchists counter that decision-making
3 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               should not be centralized in the hands of any government, but
               instead power should be decentralized: that is to say, each
               person should be the center of society, and all should be free to
               build the networks and associations they need to meet their
               needs in common with others.
               The education we receive in state-run schools teaches us to
               doubt our ability to organize ourselves. This leads many to
               conclude anarchy is impractical and utopian: it would never
               work. On the contrary, anarchist practice already has a long
               record, and has often worked quite well. The official history
               books tell a selective story, glossing over the fact that all the
               components of an anarchist society have existed at various
               times, and innumerable stateless societies have thrived for
               millennia.
               How would an anarchist society compare to statist and
               capitalist societies? It is apparent that hierarchical societies
               work well according to certain criteria. They tend to be
               extremely effective at conquering their neighbors and securing
               vast fortunes for their rulers. On the other hand, as climate
               change, food and water shortages, market instability, and
               other global crises intensify, hierarchical models are not
               proving to be particularly sustainable. The histories in this book
               show that an anarchist society can do much better at enabling
               all its members to meet their needs and desires.
               The many stories, past and present, that demonstrate how
               anarchy works have been suppressed and distorted because of
               the revolutionary conclusions we might draw from them. We
               can live in a society with no bosses, masters, politicians, or
               bureaucrats; a society with no judges, no police, and no
4 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               criminals, no rich or poor; a society free of sexism,
               homophobia, and transphobia; a society in which the wounds
               from centuries of enslavement, colonialism, and genocide are
               finally allowed to heal. The only things stopping us are the
               prisons, programming, and paychecks of the powerful, as well
               as our own lack of faith in ourselves.
               Of course, anarchists do not have to be practical to a fault. If
               we ever win the freedom to run our own lives, we’ll probably
               come up with entirely new approaches to organization that
               improve on these tried and true forms. So let these stories be a
               starting point, and a challenge.
               What exactly is anarchism?
               Volumes have been written in answer to this question, and
               millions of people have dedicated their lives to creating,
               expanding, defining, and fighting for anarchy. There are
               countless paths to anarchism and countless beginnings:
               workers in 19th century Europe fighting against capitalism and
               believing in themselves instead of the ideologies of
               authoritarian political parties; indigenous peoples fighting
               colonization and reclaiming their traditional, horizontal
               cultures; high school students waking up to the depth of their
               alienation and unhappiness; mystics from China one thousand
               years ago or from Europe five hundred years ago, Daoists or
               Anabaptists, fighting against government and organized
               religion; women rebelling against the authoritarianism and
               sexism of the Left. There is no Central Committee giving out
               membership cards, and no standard doctrine. Anarchy means
5 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               different things to different people. However, here are some
               basic principles most anarchists agree on.
               Autonomy and Horizontality: All people deserve the
               freedom to define and organize themselves on their own
               terms. Decision-making structures should be horizontal rather
               than vertical, so no one dominates anyone else; they should
               foster power to act freely rather than power over others.
               Anarchism opposes all coercive hierarchies, including
               capitalism, the state, white supremacy, and patriarchy.
               Mutual Aid: People should help one another voluntarily;
               bonds of solidarity and generosity form a stronger social glue
               than the fear inspired by laws, borders, prisons, and armies.
               Mutual aid is neither a form of charity nor of zero-sum
               exchange; both giver and receiver are equal and
               interchangeable. Since neither holds power over the other,
               they increase their collective power by creating opportunities
               to work together.
               Voluntary Association: People should be free to cooperate
               with whomever they want, however they see fit; likewise, they
               should be free to refuse any relationship or arrangement they
               do not judge to be in their interest. Everyone should be able to
               move freely, both physically and socially. Anarchists oppose
               borders of all kinds and involuntary categorization by
               citizenship, gender, or race.
               Direct Action: It is more empowering and effective to
               accomplish goals directly than to rely on authorities or
               representatives. Free people do not request the changes they
               want to see in the world; they make those changes.

               Revolution: Today’s entrenched systems of repression cannot
               be reformed away. Those who hold power in a hierarchical
               system are the ones who institute reforms, and they generally
               do so in ways that preserve or even amplify their power.
               Systems like capitalism and white supremacy are forms of
               warfare waged by elites; anarchist revolution means fighting to
               overthrow these elites in order to create a free society.
               Self-Liberation: “The liberation of the workers is the duty of
               the workers themselves,” as the old slogan goes. This applies
               to other groups as well: people must be at the forefront of their
               own liberation. Freedom cannot be given; it must be taken.
               A note on inspiration
               Pluralism and freedom are not compatible with orthodox
               ideologies. The historical examples of anarchy do not have to
               be explicitly anarchist. Most of the societies and organizations
               that have successfully lived free of government have not called
               themselves “anarchist”; that term originated in Europe in the
               19th century, and anarchism as a self-conscious social
               movement is not nearly as universal as the desire for freedom.
               It is presumptuous to assign the label “anarchist” to people
               who have not chosen it; instead, we can use a range of other
               terms to describe examples of anarchy in practice. “Anarchy” is
               a social situation free of government and coercive hierarchies
               held together by self-organized horizontal relationships;
               “anarchists” are people who identify themselves with the
               social movement or philosophy of anarchism. Anti-
               authoritarians are people who expressly want to live in a
7 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               society without coercive hierarchies, but do not, to the best of
               our knowledge, identify as anarchists — either because the
               term was not available to them or because they do not see the
               specifically anarchist movement as relevant to their world.
               After all, the anarchist movement as such emerged from
               Europe and it inherited a worldview in accordance with this
               background; meanwhile there are many other struggles
               against authority that spring from different worldviews and
               have no need to call themselves “anarchist.” A society that
               exists without a state, but does not identify itself as anarchist,
               is “stateless”; if that society is not stateless by chance, but
               consciously works to prevent the emergence of hierarchies and
               identifies with its egalitarian characteristics, one might
               describe it as “anarchistic.”[1]
               The examples in this book have been selected from a wide
               range of times and places — about ninety altogether. Thirty are
               explicitly anarchist; the rest are all stateless, autonomous, or
               consciously anti-authoritarian. More than half of the examples
               are from present-day Western society, a third are drawn from
               stateless societies that provide a view of the breadth of human
               possibility outside of Western civilization, and the remaining
               few are classical historical examples. Some of these, such as
               the Spanish Civil War, are cited multiple times because they
               are well documented and offer a wealth of information. The
               number of examples included makes it impossible to explore
               each one in the detail it deserves. Ideally the reader will be
               inspired to pursue these questions herself, distilling further
               practical lessons from the attempts of those who came before.
               It will become apparent throughout this book that anarchy
8 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               exists in conflict with the state and capitalism. Many of the
               examples given here were ultimately crushed by police or
               conquering armies, and it is in large part due to this systematic
               repression of alternatives that there have not been more
               examples of anarchy working. This bloody history implies that,
               to be thoroughgoing and successful, an anarchist revolution
               would have to be global. Capitalism is a global system,
               constantly expanding and colonizing every autonomous
               society it encounters. In the long run, no one community or
               country can remain anarchist while the rest of the world is
               capitalist. An anti-capitalist revolution must destroy capitalism
               totally, or else be destroyed. This does not mean that
               anarchism must be a single global system. Many different
               forms of anarchist society could coexist, and these in turn
               could coexist with societies that were not anarchist, so long as
               the latter were not confrontationally authoritarian or
               oppressive. The following pages will show the great diversity of
               forms anarchy and autonomy can take.
               The examples in this book show anarchy working for a period
               of time, or succeeding in a specific way. Until capitalism is
               abolished, all such examples will necessarily be partial. These
               examples are instructive in their weaknesses as well as their
               strengths. In addition to providing a picture of people creating
               communities and meeting their needs without bosses, they
               raise the question of what went wrong and how we could do
               better next time.
               To this end, here are some recurring themes that may be
               beneficial to reflect on in the course of reading this book:
               Isolation: Many anarchist projects work quite well, but only
9 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               make an impact in the lives of a tiny number of people. What
               engenders this isolation? What tends to contribute to it, and
               what can offset it?
               Alliances: In a number of examples, anarchists and other anti-
               authoritarians were betrayed by supposed allies who
               sabotaged the possibility of liberation in order to gain power for
               themselves. Why did anarchists choose these alliances, and
               what can we learn about what kind of alliances to make today?
               Repression: Autonomous communities and revolutionary
               activities have been stopped cold by police repression or
               military invasion time after time. People are intimidated,
               arrested, tortured, and killed, and the survivors must go into
               hiding or drop out of the struggle; communities that had once
               provided support withdraw in order to protect themselves.
               What actions, strategies, and forms of organization best equip
               people to survive repression? How can those on the outside
               provide effective solidarity?
               Collaboration: Some social movements or radical projects
               choose to participate in or accommodate themselves to
               aspects of the present system in order to overcome isolation,
               be accessible to a greater range of people, or avoid repression.
               What are the advantages and pitfalls of this approach? Are
               there ways to overcome isolation or avoid repression without
               it?
               Temporary gain: Many of the examples in this book no longer
               exist. Of course, anarchists are not trying to create permanent
               institutions that take on lives of their own; specific
               organizations should come to an end when they are no longer
10 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               helpful. Realizing that, how can we make the most of bubbles
               of autonomy while they last, and how can they continue to
               inform us after they have ceased to be? How can a series of
               temporary spaces and events be linked to create a continuity
               of struggle and community?
               The tricky topic of representation
               In as many cases as was possible, we sought direct feedback
               from people with personal experience in the struggles and
               communities described in this book. With some examples this
               was impossible, due to unnavigable chasms of distance or
               time. In these cases we had to rely exclusively on written
               representations, generally recorded by outside observers. But
               representation is not at all a neutral process, and outside
               observers project their own values and experiences onto what
               they are observing. Of course, representation is an inevitable
               activity in human discourse, and moreover outside observers
               can contribute new and useful perspectives.
               However, our world is not that simple. As European civilization
               spread and dominated the rest of the planet, the observers it
               sent out were generally the surveyors, missionaries, writers,
               and scientists of the ruling order. On a world scale, this
               civilization is the only one with the right to interpret itself and
               all other cultures. Western systems of thought were forcibly
               spread around the world. Colonized societies were cut up and
               exploited as slave labor, economic resources, and ideological
               capital. Non-Western peoples were represented back to the
               West in ways that would confirm the Western worldview and
               sense of superiority, and justify the ongoing imperial project as

               necessary for the good of the peoples being forcibly civilized.
               As anarchists trying to abolish the power structure responsible
               for colonialism and many other wrongs, we want to approach
               these other cultures in good faith, in order to learn from them,
               but if we’re not careful we could easily fall into the accustomed
               eurocentric pattern of manipulating and exploiting these other
               cultures for our own ideological capital. In cases where we
               could find no one from the community in question to review
               and criticize our own interpretations, we have tried to situate
               the storyteller in the telling, to subvert his or her objectivity
               and invisibility, to deliberately challenge the validity of our own
               information, and to propose representations that are flexible
               and humble. We don’t know exactly how to accomplish this
               balancing act, but our hope is to learn while trying.
               Some indigenous people whom we consider comrades in the
               struggle against authority feel that white people have no right
               to represent indigenous cultures, and this position is especially
               justified given that for five hundred years, Euro/American
               representations of indigenous peoples have been self-serving,
               exploitative, and connected to ongoing processes of genocide
               and colonization. On the other hand, part of our goal in
               publishing this book has been to challenge the historical
               eurocentrism of the anarchist movement and encourage
               ourselves to be open to other cultures. We could not do this by
               only presenting stories of statelessness from our own culture.
               The author and most of the people working on this book in an
               editorial capacity are white, and it is no surprise that what we
               write reflects our backgrounds. In fact, the central question this
               book seeks to address, whether anarchy could work, seems
12 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               itself to be eurocentric. Only a people who have obliterated the
               memory of their own stateless past could ask themselves
               whether they need the state. We recognize that not everyone
               shares this historical blindspot and that what we publish here
               may not be useful for people from other backgrounds. But we
               hope that by telling stories of the cultures and struggles of
               other societies, we can help correct the eurocentrism endemic
               to some of our communities and become better allies, and
               better listeners, whenever people from other cultures choose
               to tell us their own stories.
               Someone who read over this text pointed out to us that
               reciprocity is a fundamental value of indigenous worldviews.
               The question he posed to us was, if anarchists who are mostly
               Euro/American are going to take lessons from indigenous or
               other communities, cultures, and nations, what will we offer in
               return? I hope that wherever possible, we offer solidarity —
               widening the struggle and supporting other peoples who
               struggle against authority without calling themselves
               anarchists. After all, if we are inspired by certain other
               societies, shouldn’t we do more to recognize and aid their
               ongoing struggles?

               Research and Indigenous Peoples (London: Zed Books, 1999)

               1. Human Nature

               Anarchism challenges the typical Western conception of
               human nature by envisioning societies built on cooperation,
               mutual aid, and solidarity between people, rather than
               competition and survival of the fittest.
               Aren’t people naturally selfish?
               Everybody has a sense of self-interest, and the capability to act
14 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               in a selfish way at other people’s expense. But everyone also
               has a sense of the needs of those around them, and we are all
               capable of generous and selfless actions. Human survival
               depends on generosity. The next time someone tells you a
               communal, anarchistic society could not work because people
               are naturally selfish, tell him he should withhold food from his
               children pending payment, do nothing to help his parents have
               a dignified retirement, never donate to charities, and never
               help his neighbors or be kind to strangers unless he receives
               compensation. Would he be able to lead a fulfilling existence,
               taking the capitalist philosophy to its logical conclusions? Of
               course not. Even after hundreds of years of being suppressed,
               sharing and generosity remain vital to human existence. You
               don’t have to look to radical social movements to find
               examples of this. The United States may be, on a structural
               level, the most selfish nation in the world — it is the richest of
               “developed” countries, but has among the lowest life
               expectancies because the political culture would sooner let
               poor people die than give them healthcare and welfare. But
               even in the US it’s easy to find institutional examples of sharing
               that form an important part of the society. Libraries offer an
               interconnected network of millions of free books. PTA potlucks
               and neighborhood barbecues bring people together to share
               food and enjoy each other’s company. What examples of
               sharing might develop outside the restrictive bounds of state
               and capital?
               Currency-based economies have only existed a few thousand
               years, and capitalism has only been around a few hundred
               years. The latter has proven to work quite miserably, leading to
15 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               the greatest inequalities of wealth, the largest mass
               starvations, and the worst distribution systems in world history
               — though hats off, it’s produced a lot of wonderful gadgets. It
               might surprise people to learn how common other types of
               economies have been in earlier times, and how much they
               differed from capitalism.
               One economy developed over and over by humans on every
               continent has been the gift economy. In this system, if people
               have more than they need of anything, they give it away. They
               don’t assign value, they don’t count debts. Everything you
               don’t use personally can be given as a gift to someone else,
               and by giving more gifts you inspire more generosity and
               strengthen the friendships that keep you swimming in gifts too.
               Many gift economies lasted for thousands of years, and proved
               much more effective at enabling all of the participants to meet
               their needs. Capitalism may have drastically increased
               productivity, but to what end? On one side of your typical
               capitalist city someone is starving to death while on the other
               side someone is eating caviar.
               Western economists and political scientists initially assumed
               that many of these gift economies were actually barter
               economies: proto-capitalist exchange systems lacking an
               efficient currency: “I’ll give you one sheep for twenty loaves of
               bread.” In general, this is not how these societies described
               themselves. Later, anthropologists who went to live in such
               societies and were able to shed their cultural biases showed
               people in Europe that many of these were indeed gift
               economies, in which people intentionally kept no tally of who
               owed what to whom so as to foster a society of generosity and
16 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               sharing.
               What these anthropologists may not have known is that gift
               economies have never been totally suppressed in the West; in
               fact they surfaced frequently within rebellious movements.
               Anarchists in the US today also exemplify the desire for
               relationships based on generosity and the guarantee that
               everyone’s needs will be met. In a number of towns and cities,
               anarchists hold Really Really Free Markets — essentially, flea
               markets without prices. People bring goods they have made or
               things they don’t need anymore and give them away for free to
               passersby or other participants. Or, they share useful skills with
               one another. In one free market in North Carolina, every
               month:
               two hundred or more people from all walks of life gather at the
               commons in the center of our town. They bring everything
               from jewelry to firewood to give away, and take whatever they
               want. There are booths offering bicycle repair, hairstyling,
               even tarot readings. People leave with full-size bed frames and
               old computers; if they don’t have a vehicle to transport them,
               volunteer drivers are available. No money changes hands, no
               one haggles over the comparative worth of items or services,
               nobody is ashamed about being in need. Contrary to
               government ordinances, no fee is paid for the use of this public
               space, nor is anyone “in charge.” Sometimes a marching band
               appears; sometimes a puppetry troupe performs, or people
               line up to take a swing at a piñata. Games and conversations
               take place around the periphery, and everyone has a plate of
               warm food and a bag of free groceries. Banners hang from
               branches and rafters proclaiming “FOR THE COMMONS, NOT
17 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               LANDLORDS OR BUREAUCRACY” and “NI JEFES, NI
               FRONTERAS” and a king-size blanket is spread with radical
               reading material, but these aren’t essential to the event — this
               is a social institution, not a demonstration.
               Thanks to our monthly ‘Free Markets, everyone in our town has
               a working reference point for anarchist economics. Life is a
               little easier for those of us with low or no income, and
               relationships develop in a space in which social class and
               financial means are at least temporarily irrelevant.[2]
               The traditional society of the Semai, in Malaya, is based on gift-
               giving rather than bartering. We could not find any accounts of
               their society recorded by the Semai themselves, but they
               explained how it worked to Robert Dentan, a Western
               anthropologist who lived with them for a time. Dentan writes
               that the “system by which the Semai distribute food and
               services is one of the most significant ways in which members
               of a community are knit together... Semai economic exchanges
               are more like Christmas exchanges than like commercial
               exchanges.”[3] It was considered “punan,” or taboo, for
               members of Semai society to calculate the value of gifts given
               or received. Other commonly held rules of etiquette included
               the duty to share whatever they had that they did not
               immediately need, and the duty to share with guests and
               anyone who asked. It was punan not to share or to refuse a
               request, but also to ask for more than someone could give.
               Many other societies have also distributed and exchanged
               surpluses as gifts. Aside from the social cohesion and joy that is
               gained from sharing with your community without greedily
               keeping accounts, a gift economy can also be justified in terms
18 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               of personal interests. Often, a person cannot consume what
               they produce all by themselves. The meat from a day’s hunt
               will go bad before you can eat it all. A tool, like a saw, will lay
               unused most of the time if it is the property of a single person.
               It makes more sense to give away most of the meat or share
               your saw with your neighbors, because you are ensuring that
               in the future they will give extra food to you and share their
               tools with you — thus ensuring that you have access to more
               food and a wider range of tools, and you and your neighbors
               become richer without having to exploit anybody.
               From what we know, however, members of gift economies
               would probably not justify their actions with arguments of
               calculated self-interest, but with moral reasoning, explaining
               sharing as the right thing to do. After all, an economic surplus is
               the result of a certain way of looking at the world: it is a social
               choice and not a material certainty. Societies must choose,
               over time, to work more than they need to, to quantify value,
               or to only consume the minimum required for their survival and
               to surrender all the rest of their produce to a common
               storehouse controlled by a class of leaders. Even if a hunting
               party or a group of gatherers gets lucky and brings home a
               huge amount of food, there is no surplus if they consider it
               normal to share it with everyone else, glut themselves with a
               big feast, or invite a neighboring community to party until all
               the food is eaten. It’s certainly more fun that way than
               measuring out pounds of food and calculating what
               percentage we earned.
               As for loafers, even if people do not calculate the value of gifts
               and keep a balance sheet, they will notice if someone
19 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               consistently refuses to share or contribute to the group,
               violating the customs of the society and the sense of mutual
               aid. Gradually, such people will damage their relationships, and
               miss out on some of the nicer benefits of living in a society. It
               seems that in all known gift economies, even the laziest of
               people were never refused food — in stark contrast to
               capitalism — but feeding a few loafers is an insignificant drain
               on a society’s resources, especially when compared to
               pampering the voracious elite of our society. And losing this
               tiny amount of resources is far preferable to losing our
               compassion and letting people starve to death. In more
               extreme cases, if members of such a society were more
               aggressively parasitic, attempting to monopolize resources or
               force other people to work for them — in other words, acting
               like capitalists — they could be ostracized and even expelled
               from the society.
               Some stateless societies have chiefs who play ritual roles,
               often related to giving gifts and spreading resources. In fact,
               the term “chief” can be deceptive because there have been so
               many different human societies that have had what the West
               classifies as “chiefs,” and in each society the role entailed
               something a little different. In many societies chiefs held no
               coercive power: their responsibility was to mediate disputes or
               conduct rituals, and they were expected to be more generous
               than anyone else. Ultimately they worked harder and had less
               personal wealth than others. One study found that a common
               reason for the people to depose or expel a chief was if the chief
               was not considered generous enough.[4]

               Aren’t people naturally competitive?
               In Western society, competition is so normalized it’s no wonder
               we consider it the natural mode of human relations. From
               youth, we’re taught that we have to be better than everyone
               else to be worth anything ourselves. Corporations justify firing
               workers, depriving them of sustenance and healthcare, so the
               company can “stay competitive.” Fortunately, it does not have
               to be this way. Industrial capitalism is only one of thousands of
               forms of social organization humans have developed, and with
               any luck it won’t be the last. Obviously, humans are capable of
               competitive behavior, but it’s not hard to see how much our
               society encourages this and suppresses cooperative behavior.
               Countless societies throughout the world have developed
               cooperative forms of living that contrast greatly with the norms
               at work under capitalism. By now, nearly all of these societies
               have been integrated into the capitalist system through
               colonialism, slavery, warfare, or habitat destruction, but a
               number of accounts remain to document the great diversity of
               societies that have existed.
               The Mbuti hunter-gatherers of the Ituri Forest in central Africa
               have traditionally lived without government. Accounts by
               ancient historians suggest the forest-dwellers have lived as
               stateless hunter-gatherers during the time of the Egyptian
               pharoahs, and according to the Mbuti themselves they have
               always lived that way. Contrary to common portrayals by
               outsiders, groups like the Mbuti are not isolated or primordial.
               In fact they have frequent interactions with the sedentary
               Bantu peoples surrounding the forest, and they have had

               plenty of opportunities to see what supposedly advanced
               societies are like. Going back at least hundreds of years, Mbuti
               have developed relationships of exchange and gift-giving with
               neighboring farmers, while retaining their identity as “the
               children of the forest.”
               Today several thousand Mbuti still live in the Ituri Forest and
               negotiate dynamic relationships with the changing world of the
               villagers, while fighting to preserve their traditional way of life.
               Many other Mbuti live in settlements along the new roads.
               Coltan mining for cell phones is a chief financial incentive for
               the civil war and the habitat destruction that is ravaging the
               region and killing hundreds of thousands of inhabitants. The
               governments of Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda all want to
               control this billion dollar industry, that produces primarily for
               the US and Europe, while miners seeking employment come
               from all over Africa to set up camp in the region. The
               deforestation, population boom, and increase in hunting to
               provide bush meat for the soldiers and miners have depleted
               local wildlife. Lacking food and competing for territorial control,
               soldiers and miners have taken to carrying out atrocities,
               including cannibalism, against the Mbuti. Some Mbuti are
               currently demanding an international tribunal against
               cannibalism and other violations.
               Europeans travelling through central Africa during their
               colonization of that continent imposed their own moral
               framework on the Mbuti. Because they only encountered the
               Mbuti in the villages of the Bantu farmers surrounding the Ituri
               forest, they assumed the Mbuti were a primitive servant class.
               In the 1950s, the Mbuti invited Western anthropologist Colin
22 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Turnbull to live with them in the forest. They tolerated his rude
               and ignorant questions, and took the time to teach him about
               their culture. The stories he recounts describe a society far
               outside of what a Western worldview considers possible.
               Around the time that anthropologists, and subsequently,
               Western anarchists, began to argue about what the Mbuti
               “meant” for their respective theories, global economic
               institutions were elaborating a process of genocide that
               threatens to destroy the Mbuti as a people. Notwithstanding,
               various Western writers have already idealized or degraded the
               Mbuti to produce arguments for or against primitivism,
               veganism, feminism, and other political agendas.
               Therefore, perhaps the most important lesson to take from the
               story of the Mbuti is not that anarchy — a cooperative, free,
               and relatively healthy society — is possible, but that free
               societies are not possible so long as governments try to crush
               any pocket of independence, corporations fund genocide in
               order to manufacture cell phones, and supposedly sympathetic
               people are more interested in writing ethnographies than
               fighting back.
               In Turnbull’s perspective, the Mbuti were resolutely egalitarian,
               and many of the ways they organized their society reduced
               competition and promoted cooperation between members.
               Gathering food was a community affair, and when they hunted
               often the whole band turned out. One half would beat the bush
               in the direction of the other half, who waited with nets to snare
               any animals that had been flushed out. A successful hunt was
               the result of everyone working together effectively, and the
               whole community shared in the catch.

               Mbuti children were given a high degree of autonomy, and
               spent much of their days in a wing of the camp that was off-
               limits to adults. One game they frequently played involved a
               group of small children climbing up a young tree until their
               combined weight bent the tree towards the earth. Ideally, the
               children would let go all at once, and the supple tree would
               shoot upright. But if one child was not in synch and let go too
               late, the child would be launched through the trees and given a
               good scare. Such games teach group harmony over individual
               performance, and provide an early form of socialization into a
               culture of voluntary cooperation. The war games and
               individualized competition that characterize play in Western
               society provide a notably different form of socialization.
               The Mbuti also discouraged competition or even excessive
               distinction between genders. They did not use gendered
               pronouns or familial words — e.g., instead of “son” they say
               “child,” “sibling” instead of “sister” — except in the case of
               parents, in which there is a functional difference between one
               who gives birth or provides milk and one who provides other
               forms of care. An important ritual game played by adult Mbuti
               worked to undermine gender competition. As Turnbull
               describes it, the game began like a tug-of-war match, with the
               women pulling one end of a long rope or vine and the men
               pulling the other. But as soon as one side started to win,
               someone from that team would run to the other side, also
               symbolically changing their gender and becoming a member
               of the other group. By the end, the participants collapsed in a
               heap laughing, all having changed their genders multiple
               times. Neither side “won,” but that seemed to be the point.
24 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Group harmony was restored.
               The Mbuti traditionally viewed conflict or “noise” as a common
               problem and a threat to the harmony of the group. If the
               disputants could not resolve things on their own or with the
               help of friends, the entire band would hold an important ritual
               that often lasted all night long. Everyone gathered together to
               discuss, and if the problem still could not be solved, the youth,
               who often played the role of justice-seekers within their
               society, would sneak into the night and begin rampaging
               around the camp, blowing a horn that made a sound like an
               elephant, symbolizing how the problem threatened the
               existence of the whole band. For a particularly serious dispute
               that had disrupted the group’s harmony, the youth might give
               extra expression to their frustration by crashing through camp
               itself, kicking out fires and knocking down houses. Meanwhile,
               the adults would sing a two-part harmony, building up a sense
               of cooperation and togetherness.
               The Mbuti also underwent a sort of fission and fusion
               throughout the year. Often motivated by interpersonal
               conflicts, the band would break up into smaller, more intimate
               groups. People had the option to take space from one another
               rather than being forced by the larger community to suppress
               their problems. After travelling and living separately for a time,
               the smaller groups joined together again, once there had been
               time for conflicts to cool down. Eventually the whole band was
               reunited, and the process started over. It seems the Mbuti
               synchronized this social fluctuation with their economic
               activities, so their period of living together as an entire band
               coincided with the season in which the specific forms of
25 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               gathering and hunting require the cooperation of a larger
               group. The period of small, disparate groups coincided with the
               time of the year when the foods were in season that were best
               harvested by small groups spread throughout the whole forest,
               and the period when the whole band came together
               corresponded with the season in which hunting and gathering
               activities were better accomplished by big groups working
               together.
               Unfortunately for us, neither the economic, political, or social
               structures of Western society are conducive to cooperation.
               When our jobs and social status depend on outperforming our
               peers, with the “losers” being fired or ostracized without
               regard to how it hurts their dignity or their ability to feed
               themselves, it’s not surprising that competitive behaviors
               come to outnumber cooperative behaviors. But the ability to
               live cooperatively is not lost to people who live under the
               destructive influences of state and capitalism. Social
               cooperation is not restricted to societies like the Mbuti who
               inhabit one of the few remaining pockets of autonomy in the
               world. Living cooperatively is a possibility for all of us right now.
               Earlier this decade, in one of the most individualistic and
               competitive societies in human history, state authority
               collapsed for a time in one city. Yet in this period of catastrophe,
               with hundreds of people dying and resources necessary for
               survival sorely limited, strangers came together to assist one
               another in a spirit of mutual aid. The city in question is New
               Orleans, after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005. Initially, the
               corporate media spread racist stories of savagery committed
               by the mostly black survivors, and police and national guard
26 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               troops performing heroic rescues while fighting off roving
               bands of looters. It was later admitted that these stories were
               false. In fact, the vast majority of rescues were carried out not
               by police and professionals, but by common New Orleans
               residents, often in defiance of the orders of authorities.[5] The
               police, meanwhile, were murdering people who were salvaging
               drinking water, diapers, and other living supplies from
               abandoned grocery stores, supplies that would otherwise have
               been ultimately thrown away because contamination from
               floodwaters had made them unsalable.
               New Orleans is not atypical: everyone can learn cooperative
               behaviors when they have the need or desire to do so.
               Sociological studies have found that in nearly all natural
               disasters, cooperation and solidarity among people increase,
               and it is common people, not governments, who voluntarily do
               most of the work carrying out rescues and protecting one
               another throughout the crisis.[6]
               Haven’t humans always been patriarchal?
               One of the most ancient forms of oppression and hierarchy is
               patriarchy: the division of humans into two rigid gender roles
               and the domination of men over women. But patriarchy is not
               natural or universal. Many societies have had more than two
               gender categories, and have allowed their members to change
               gender. Some even created respected spiritual roles for those
               who did not fit into either of the primary genders. The majority
               of prehistoric art depicts people who are either of no
               determinate gender or people with ambiguous, exaggerated
               combinations of masculine and feminine traits. In such
27 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               societies, gender was fluid. It was something of a historic coup
               to enforce the notion of two fixed, idealized genders that we
               now consider natural. Speaking in strictly physical terms, many
               perfectly healthy people are born intersexed, with male and
               female physiological characteristics, showing that these
               categories exist on a fluid continuum. It makes no sense to
               make people who do not fit easily into one category feel as
               though they are unnatural.
               Even in our patriarchal society, in which everyone is
               conditioned to believe that patriarchy is natural, there has
               always been resistance. Much current resistance by queer
               people and transgender people takes a horizontal form. One
               organization in New York City, called FIERCE!, includes a wide
               spectrum of people excluded and oppressed by patriarchy:
               transgender, lesbian, gay, bisexual, two-spirit (an honored
               category in many Native American societies for people who are
               not identified as strictly men or women), queer, and
               questioning (people who have not made up their minds about
               their sexuality or gender identity, or who do not feel
               comfortable in any category). FIERCE! was founded in 2000,
               mostly by youth of color, and with anarchist participation. They
               uphold a horizontal ethic of “organizing by us, for us,” and they
               actively link resistance to patriarchy, transphobia, and
               homophobia with resistance to capitalism and racism. Their
               actions have included protesting police brutality against
               transgender and queer youth; education through documentary
               films, zines, and the internet; and organizing for fair healthcare
               and against gentrification, particularly where the latter
               threatens to destroy important cultural and social spaces for
28 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               queer youth.
               At the time of this writing they are particularly active in a
               campaign to stop the gentrification of the Christopher Street
               Pier, which has been one of the only safe public spaces for
               homeless and low-income queer youth of color to meet and
               build community. Since 2001, the city has been trying to
               develop the Pier, and police harassment and arrests have
               multiplied. The FIERCE! campaign has helped provide a rallying
               point for those who want to save the space, and changed the
               public debate so that other voices are heard besides those of
               the government and business owners. Our society’s attitudes
               about gender and sexuality have changed radically in the past
               centuries, largely because of groups like this taking direct
               action to create what is said to be impossible.
               Resistance to patriarchy goes back as far as we care to look. In
               the “good old days” when these gender roles were supposedly
               unchallenged and accepted as natural, we can find stories of
               utopia, that upset the assumption that patriarchy is natural,
               and the notion that civilized progress is bringing us steadily
               from our brutal origins towards more enlightened sensibilities.
               In fact the idea of total freedom has always played a role in
               human history.
               In the 1600s, Europeans were streaming to North America for a
               variety of reasons, building new colonies that exhibited a wide
               range of characteristics. They included plantation economies
               based on slave labor, penal colonies, trading networks that
               sought to compel the indigenous inhabitants to produce large
               quantities of animal skins, and fundamentalist religious utopias
               based on the total genocide of the native population. But just
29 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               as the plantation colonies had their slave rebellions, the
               religious colonies had their heretics. One noteworthy heretic
               was Anne Hutchinson. An anabaptist who came to New
               England to escape religious persecution in the old world, she
               began to hold women’s meetings in her house, discussion
               groups based on free interpretation of the Bible. As the
               popularity of these meetings spread, men began to participate
               as well. Anne won popular support for her well argued ideas,
               which opposed the slavery of Africans and Native Americans,
               criticized the church, and insisted that being born a woman
               was a blessing and not a curse.
               The religious leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony put her
               on trial for blasphemy, but at trial she stood by her ideas. She
               was heckled and called an instrument of the devil, and one
               minister said, “You have stepped out of your place, you have
               rather been a husband than a wife, a preacher than a hearer,
               and a magistrate than a subject.” Upon her expulsion Anne
               Hutchinson organized a group, in 1637, to form a settlement
               named Pocasset. They intentionally settled near to where
               Roger Williams, a progressive theologian, had founded
               Providence Plantations, a settlement based on the idea of total
               equality and freedom of conscience for all inhabitants, and
               friendly relations with the indigenous neighbors. These
               settlements were to become, respectively, Portsmouth and
               Providence, Rhode Island. Early on they joined to form the
               Rhode Island Colony. Both settlements allegedly maintained
               friendly relations with the neighboring indigenous nation, the
               Narragansett; Roger Williams’ settlement was gifted the land
               they built on, whereas Hutchinson’s group negotiated an
30 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               exchange to buy land.
               Initially, Pocasset was organized through elected councils and
               the people refused to have a governor. The settlement
               recognized equality between the sexes and trial by jury;
               abolished capital punishment, witchtrials, imprisonment for
               debt, and slavery; and granted total religious freedom. The
               second synagogue in North America was built in the Rhode
               Island colony. In 1651 one member of Hutchinson’s group
               seized power and got the government of England to bestow
               him governorship over the colony, but after two years the
               other people in the settlement kicked him out in a mini-
               revolution. After this incident, Anne Hutchinson realized that
               her religious beliefs opposed “magistracy,” or governmental
               authority, and in her later years she was said to have
               developed a political-religious philosophy very similar to
               individualist anarchism. One might say that Hutchinson and
               her colleagues were ahead of their times, but in every period of
               history there have been stories of people creating utopias,
               women asserting their equality, laypeople negating the
               religious leaders’ monopoly on truth.
               Outside of Western civilization we can find many examples of
               non-patriarchal societies. Some stateless societies
               intentionally preserve gender fluidity, like the Mbuti described
               previously. Many societies accept fixed genders and division of
               roles between men and women, but seek to preserve equality
               between these roles. Several of these societies allow
               transgender expressions — individuals changing their gender
               or adopting a unique gender identity. In hunter-gatherer
               societies “a sharp and hard division of labor between the sexes

               is not universal... [and in the case of one particular society]
               virtually every subsistence activity can be, and often is,
               performed by either men or women”.[7]
               The Igbo of western Africa had separate spheres of activity for
               men and women. Women were responsible for certain
               economic tasks and men for others, and each group held
               power autonomously over their sphere. These spheres
               designated who produced which goods, domesticated which
               animals, and took which responsibilities in the garden and
               market. If a man interfered in the women’s sphere of activity or
               abused his wife, the women had a ritual of collective solidarity
               that preserved the balance and punished the offender, called
               “sitting on a man.” All the women would assemble outside the
               man’s house, yelling at him and insulting him in order to cause
               him shame. If he did not come out to apologize the mob of
               women might destroy the fence around his house and his
               outlying storage buildings. If his offense were grievous enough,
               the women might even storm into his house, drag him out, and
               beat him up. When the British colonized the Igbo, they
               recognized men’s institutions and economic roles, but ignored
               or were blind to the corresponding women’s sphere of social
               life. When Igbo women responded to British indecency with the
               traditional practice of “sitting on a man,” the British, possibly
               mistaking it for a women’s insurrection, opened fire, putting an
               end to the gender-balancing ritual and cementing the
               institution of patriarchy in the society they had colonized.[8]
               The Haudennosaunne, called the Iroquois by Europeans, are a
               matrilineal egalitarian society of eastern North America. They
               traditionally use several means to balance gender relations.

               Whereas European civilization utilizes gender division to
               socialize people into rigid roles and to oppress women, queer,
               and transgendered people, the gendered division of labor and
               social roles among the Haudennosaunne functions to preserve
               a balance, assigning each group autonomous niches and
               powers, and allowing a greater degree of movement between
               genders than is considered possible in Western society. For
               hundreds of years the Haudennosaunne have coordinated
               between multiple nations using a federative structure, and at
               each level of organization there were women’s councils and
               men’s councils. At what might be called the national level,
               which concerned itself with matters of war and peace, the
               men’s council made the decisions, though the women held a
               veto power. At the local level, women held more influence. The
               basic socio-economic unit, the longhouse, was considered to
               belong to the women, and men had no council at this level.
               When a man married a woman, he moved into her house. Any
               man who did not behave could ultimately be kicked out of the
               longhouse by the women.
               Western society typically sees the “higher” levels of
               organization as being more important and powerful — even
               the language we use reflects this; but because the
               Haudennosaunne were egalitarian and decentralized, the
               lower or local levels of organization where the women had
               more influence were more important to daily life. In fact when
               there was no feud between the different nations the highest
               council might go a long time without meeting at all. However,
               their’s was not a “matriarchal” society: men were not exploited
               or devalued the way women are in patriarchal societies.

               Rather, each group had a measure of autonomy and means for
               preserving a balance. Despite centuries of colonization by a
               patriarchal culture, many groups of Haudennosaunne retain
               their traditional gender relations and still stand out in sharp
               contrast to the gender-oppressive culture of Canada and the
               United States.
               Aren’t people naturally warlike?
               Political philosophers like Thomas Hobbes and psychologists
               like Sigmund Freud assumed that civilization and government
               have a moderating effect on what they saw as people’s warlike
               and brutal instincts. Pop-culture representations of human
               origins, like the first scenes of the film 2001: A Space Odyssey
               or the illustrations in children’s books of hyper-masculine
               cavemen battling mammoths and sabertooth tigers, provide a
               picture that can be as convincing as memory: early humans
               had to fight one another and even battle nature to survive. But
               if early human life had been as bloody and warlike as our
               mythology has depicted it, humans would simply have died
               out. Any species with a reproductive cycle of 15–20 years that
               usually only produce one offspring at a time simply cannot
               survive if their chance for dying in any given year is more than
               a couple percent. It would have been mathematically
               impossible for Homo sapiens to have survived that imaginary
               battle against nature and against one another.
               Anarchists have long alleged that war is a product of the state.
               Some anthropological research has produced accounts of
               peaceful stateless societies, and of warfare among other
               stateless societies that was little more than a rough sport with
34 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               few casualties[9]. Naturally, the state has found its defenders,
               who have set out to prove that war is indeed inevitable and
               thus not the fault of specific oppressive social structures. In one
               monumental study, War Before Civilization, Lawrence Keeley
               showed that of an extensive sample of stateless societies, a
               large number had engaged in aggressive warfare, and a great
               majority had engaged at the very least in defensive warfare.
               Only a tiny minority had never encountered war, and a few fled
               their homelands to avoid war. Keeley was endeavoring to show
               that people are warlike, even though his results demonstrated
               that people could choose from a wide range of behaviors
               including being warlike, avoiding war but still defending
               against aggression, not knowing war at all, and disliking war so
               much they would flee their homeland rather than fight.
               Contrary to his title, Keeley was documenting war after
               civilization, not “before.” A major part of his data on non-
               Western societies came from the explorers, missionaries,
               soldiers, traders, and anthropologists who rode the waves of
               colonization around the world, bringing land conflicts and
               ethnic rivalries to previously unimaginable scales through
               mass enslavement, genocide, invasion, evangelism, and the
               introduction of new weapons, diseases, and addictive
               substances. Needless to say, the civilizing influence of the
               colonizers generated warfare at the margins.
               Keeley’s study characterizes as warlike societies that had been
               peaceful for a hundred years but were chased off their land
               and, given the options of starving to death or invading their
               neighbors’ territory for space to live, chose the latter. The fact
               that under these conditions of global colonialism, genocide,
35 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               and enslavement any societies remained peaceful at all proves
               that if people really want to, they can be peaceful even in the
               worst of circumstances. Not to say that in such circumstances
               there is anything wrong with fighting back against aggression!
               War may be the result of natural human behavior, but so is
               peace. Violence certainly existed before the state, but the state
               developed warfare and domination to unprecedented levels.
               As one of its great proponents pointed out, “war is the health of
               the state.” It is no mistake that the institutions of power in our
               civilization — media, academia, government, religions — have
               exaggerated the prevalence of war and understated the
               possibility for peace. These institutions are invested in ongoing
               wars and occupations; they profit from them, and attempts to
               create a more peaceful society threaten their existence.
               One such attempt is the Faslane Peace Camp, a land
               occupation outside Scotland’s Faslane Naval Base, which
               houses Trident nuclear missiles. The Peace Camp is a popular
               expression of the desire for a peaceful society, organized on
               anarchist and socialist lines. Faslane Peace Camp has been
               continuously occupied since June 1982 and is now well
               established, with hot water and bathroom facilities, a
               communal kitchen and living room, and 12 caravans housing
               permanent residents and space for visitors. The Peace Camp
               serves as a base area for protests in which people block the
               roads, shut down the gates, and even penetrate the base itself
               to carry out sabotage. Galvanized by the Peace Camp, there is
               widespread popular opposition to the naval base, and some of
               Scotland’s political parties have called for the base to be closed
               down. In September 1981, a group of Welsh women formed a
36 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               similar camp, the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp,
               outside an RAF base housing cruise missiles in Berkshire,
               England. The women were forcibly evicted in 1984 but
               immediately reoccupied the site, and in 1991 the last missiles
               were removed. The camp remained until 2000, when the
               women won permission to set up a commemorative memorial.
               These peace camps bear some similarity to the Life and Labor
               Commune, the largest of the Tolstoyan communes. It was an
               agricultural commune established near Moscow in 1921 by
               people following the pacifist and anarchist teachings of Leo
               Tolstoy. Its members, nearly one thousand at their peak, were
               at odds with the Soviet government on account of refusing to
               perform military service. For this reason, the commune was
               finally shut down by the authorities in 1930; but during its
               existence, the participants created a large self-organized
               community in peace and resistance.
               The Catholic Worker movement began in the United States in
               1933 as a response to the Great Depression, but today many of
               the 185 Catholic Worker communities throughout North
               America and Europe focus on opposing the militarism of the
               government and creating the foundations of a peaceful society.
               Inseparable from their opposition to war is their commitment
               to social justice, which manifests in the soup kitchens, shelters,
               and other service projects to help the poor that form a part of
               every Catholic Worker house. Although Christian, the Catholic
               Workers generally criticize church hierarchy and promote
               tolerance of other religions. They are also anti-capitalist,
               preaching voluntary poverty and “distributist
               communitarianism; self-sufficien[cy] through farming, crafting,
37 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               and appropriate technology; a radically new society where
               people will rely on the fruits of their own toil and labor;
               associations of mutuality, and a sense of fairness to resolve
               conflicts.”[10] Some Catholic Workers even call themselves
               Christian Anarchists. Catholic Worker communities, which
               function as communes or aid centers for the poor, often
               provide a base for protests and direct actions against the
               military. Catholic Workers have entered military bases to
               sabotage weaponry, though they waited for the police
               afterwards, intentionally going to jail as a further act of protest.
               Some of their communities also shelter victims of war, such as
               torture survivors fleeing the results of US imperialism in other
               countries.
               How peaceful a society could we create if we overcame the
               belligerence of governments and fostered new norms in our
               culture? The Semai, agriculturalists in Malaya, offer one
               indication. Their murder rate is only 0.56/100,000 per year,
               compared with 0.86 in Norway, 6.26 in the US, and 20.20 in
               Russia.[11] This may be related to their childrearing strategy:
               traditionally the Semai do not hit their children, and respect for
               their children’s autonomy is a normalized value in their society.
               One of the few occasions in which Semai adults will typically
               intervene is when children lose their tempers or fight one
               another, in which case nearby adults will snatch up the children
               and take them to their respective houses. The major forces
               that uphold Semai peacefulness seem to be an emphasis on
               learning self-control and the great importance accorded to
               public opinion in a cooperative society.
               According to Robert Dentan, a Western anthropologist who
38 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               lived with them, “little violence occurs within Semai society.
               Violence, in fact, seems to terrify the Semai. A Semai does not
               meet force with force, but with passivity or flight. Yet, he has no
               institutionalized way of preventing violence — no social
               controls, no police or courts. Somehow a Semai learns
               automatically always to keep tight rein over his aggressive
               impulses.”[12] The first time the Semai participated in a war
               was when the British conscripted them to fight against the
               Communist insurgency in the early 1950s. Clearly, warfare is
               not an inevitability and certainly not a human need: rather, it is
               a consequence of political, social, and economic
               arrangements, and these arrangements are ours to shape.
               Aren’t domination and authority natural?
               Nowadays, it is harder to make ideological justifications for the
               state. A massive body of research demonstrates that many
               human societies have been staunchly egalitarian, and that
               even within capitalism many people continue to form
               egalitarian networks and communities. In order to reconcile
               this with their view that evolution is a matter of fierce
               competition, some scientists have postulated a “human
               egalitarian syndrome,” theorizing that humans evolved to live
               in close-knit, homogenous groups, in which the passing on of
               members’ genes was not assured by the survival of the
               individual but by the survival of the group.
               According to this theory, cooperation and egalitarianism
               prevailed within these groups because it was in everyone’s
               genetic self-interest that the group survived. Genetic
               competition occurred between different groups, and the
39 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               groups that did the best job of taking care of their members
               were the ones to pass on their genes. Direct genetic
               competition between individuals was superseded by
               competition between different groups employing different
               social strategies, and humans evolved a whole host of social
               skills that allowed for greater cooperation. This would explain
               why, for most of human existence, we have lived in societies
               with little or no hierarchy, until certain technological
               developments allowed some societies to stratify and dominate
               their neighbors.
               This is not to say that domination and authority were
               unnatural, and that technology was a forbidden fruit that
               corrupted an otherwise innocent humanity. In fact, some
               hunter-gatherer societies were so patriarchal they used gang
               rape as a form of punishment against women, and some
               societies with agriculture and metal tools have been fiercely
               egalitarian. Some of the peoples in North America’s Pacific
               Northwest were sedentary hunter-gatherers and they had a
               heavily stratified society with a slave class. And at the far end
               of the technological spectrum, nomadic hunter-gatherer
               groups in Australia were dominated by male elders. Older men
               could have multiple wives, younger men had none, and
               women were evidently doled out like social property.[13]
               Humans are capable of both authoritarian and anti-
               authoritarian behavior. Horizontal societies that were not
               intentionally anti-authoritarian could easily have developed
               coercive hierarchies when new technologies made that
               possible, and even without a lot of technology they could make
               life hell for groups considered inferior. It seems that the most

               common forms of inequality among otherwise egalitarian
               societies were gender and age discrimination, which could
               accustom a society to inequality and create the prototype for a
               power structure — rule by male elders. This structure could
               become more powerful over time with the development of
               metal tools and weapons, surpluses, cities, and the like.
               The point, though, is that these forms of inequality were not
               inevitable. Societies that frowned on authoritarian behaviors
               consciously avoided the rise of hierarchy. In fact, many
               societies have given up centralized organization or
               technologies that allow for domination. This shows that history
               is not a one-way track. For example, the Moroccan Imazighen,
               or Berbers, did not form centralized political systems over the
               past several centuries, even while other societies around them
               did. “Establishing a dynasty is next to impossible,” wrote one
               commentator, “due to the fact that the chief is faced with
               constant revolt which ultimately becomes successful and
               returns the system to the old decentralized anarchic
               order.”[14]
               What is the factor that allows societies to avoid domination and
               coercive authority? A study by Christopher Boehm, surveying
               dozens of egalitarian societies on all continents, including
               peoples who lived as foragers, horticulturalists, agriculturalists,
               and pastoralists, found that the common factor is a conscious
               desire to remain egalitarian: an anti-authoritarian culture. “The
               primary and most immediate cause of egalitarian behavior is a
               moralistic determination on the part of a local group’s main
               political actors that no one of its members should be allowed to
               dominate the others.”[15] Rather than culture being
41 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               determined by material conditions, it seems that culture
               shapes the social structures that reproduce a people’s material
               conditions.
               In certain situations some form of leadership is inevitable, as
               some people have more skills or a more charismatic
               personality. Consciously egalitarian societies respond to these
               situations by not institutionalizing the position of leader, by not
               affording a leader any special privileges, or by fostering a
               culture that makes it shameful for that person to flaunt his or
               her leadership or try to gain power over others. Furthermore,
               leadership positions change from one situation to another,
               depending on the skills needed for the task at hand. The
               leaders during a hunt are different from the leaders during
               house-building or ceremonies. If a person in a leadership role
               tries to gain more power or dominate his or her peers, the rest
               of the group employs “intentional leveling mechanisms”:
               behaviors intended to bring the leader back down to earth. For
               example, among many anti-authoritarian hunter-gatherer
               societies, the most skillful hunter in a band faces criticism and
               ridicule if he is seen to brag and use his talents to boost his ego
               rather than for the benefit of the whole group.
               If these social pressures do not work, the sanctions escalate,
               and in many egalitarian societies in the final instance they will
               kick out or kill a leader who is incurably authoritarian, long
               before that leader is able to assume coercive powers. These
               “reverse dominance hierarchies,” in which the leaders must
               obey popular will because they are powerless to maintain their
               positions of leadership without support, have appeared in
               many different societies and functioned over long periods of

               time. Some of the egalitarian societies documented in
               Boehm’s survey have a chief or a shaman who plays a ritual
               role or acts as an impartial mediator in disputes; others appoint
               a leader in times of trouble, or have a peace chief and a war
               chief. But these positions of leadership are not coercive, and
               over hundreds of years have not developed into authoritarian
               roles. Often the people who fill these roles see them as a
               temporary social responsibility, which they wish to hand off
               swiftly because of the higher level of criticism and
               responsibility they face while occupying them.
               European civilization has historically demonstrated a much
               higher tolerance for authoritarianism than the egalitarian
               societies described in the survey. Yet as the political and
               economic systems that would become the modern state and
               capitalism were developing in Europe, there were a number of
               rebellions that demonstrate that even here authority was an
               imposition. One of the greatest of these rebellions was the
               Peasants War. In 1524 and 1525, as many as 300,000 peasant
               insurgents, joined by townsfolk and some lesser nobility, rose
               up against the property owners and church hierarchy in a war
               that left about 100,000 people dead throughout Bavaria,
               Saxony, Thüringen, Schwaben, Alsace, as well as parts of what
               are now Switzerland and Austria. The princes and clergy of the
               Holy Roman Empire had been steadily increasing taxes to pay
               for rising administrative and military costs, as government
               became more top-heavy. The artesans and workers of the
               towns were affected by these taxes, but the peasants received
               the heaviest burden. To increase their power and their revenue,
               princes forced free peasants into serfdom, and resurrected

               Roman Civil law, which instituted private ownership of land,
               something of a step backwards from the feudal system in
               which the land was a trust between peasant and lord that
               involved rights and obligations.
               Meanwhile, elements of the old feudal hierarchy, such as the
               knighthood and the clergy, were becoming obsolete, and
               conflicted with other elements of the ruling class. The new
               burgher mercantile class, as well as many progressive princes,
               opposed the privileges of the clergy and the conservative
               structure of the Catholic church. A new, less centralized
               structure that could base power in councils in the towns and
               cities, such as the system proposed by Martin Luther, would
               allow the new political class to ascend.
               In the years immediately prior to the War, a number of
               Anabaptist prophets began travelling around the region
               espousing revolutionary ideas against political authority,
               church doctrine, and even against the reforms of Martin Luther.
               These people included Thomas Dreschel, Nicolas Storch, Mark
               Thomas Stübner, and most famously, Thomas Müntzer. Some
               of them argued for total religious freedom, the end of non-
               voluntary baptism, and the abolition of government on earth.
               Needless to say they were persecuted by Catholic authorities
               and by supporters of Luther and banned from many cities, but
               they continued to travel around Bohemia, Bavaria, and
               Switzerland, winning supporters and stoking peasant
               rebelliousness.
               In 1524, peasants and urban workers met in the Schwarzwald
               region of Germany and drafted the 12 Articles of the Black
               Forest, and the movement they created quickly spread. The
44 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               articles, with Biblical references used as justification, called for
               the abolition of serfdom and the freedom of all people; the
               municipal power for people to elect and remove preachers; the
               abolition of taxes on cattle and inheritance; a prohibition on the
               privilege of the nobility to arbitrarily raise taxes; free access to
               water, hunting, fishing, and the forests; and the restoration of
               communal lands expropriated by the nobility. Another text
               printed and circulated in massive quantity by the insurgents
               was the Bundesordnung, the federal order, which expounded a
               model social order based on federated municipalities. Less
               literate elements of the movement were even more radical, as
               judged by their actions and the folklore they left behind; their
               goal was to wipe the nobility off the face of the earth and
               institute a mysticist utopia then and there.
               Social tension increased throughout the year, as authorities
               tried to prevent outright rebellion by suppressing rural
               gatherings such as popular festivals and weddings. In August
               1524, the situation finally errupted at Stühlingen in the Black
               Forest region. A countess demanded that the peasants render
               her a special harvest on a church holiday. Instead the peasants
               refused to pay all taxes and formed an army of 1200 people,
               under the leadership of a former mercenary, Hans Müller. They
               marched to the town of Waldshut and were joined by the
               townspeople, and then marched on the castle at Stühlingen
               and besieged it. Realizing they needed some kind of military
               structure, they decided to elect their own captains, sergeants,
               and corporals. In September they defended themselves from a
               Hapsburg army in an indecisive battle, and subsequently
               refused to lay down their arms and beg pardon when entreated

               to do so. That autumn peasant strikes, refusals to pay tithes,
               and rebellions broke out throughout the region, as peasants
               extended their politics from individual complaints to a unified
               rejection of the feudal system as a whole.
               With the spring thaw of 1525, fighting resumed with a ferocity.
               The peasant armies seized cities and executed large numbers
               of clergy and nobility. But in February the Schwabian League,
               an alliance of nobility and clergy in the region, achieved a
               victory in Italy, where they had been fighting on behalf of
               Charles V, and were able to bring their troops home and devote
               them to crushing the peasants. Meanwhile Martin Luther, the
               burghers, and the progressive princes withdrew all their
               support and called for the annihilation of the revolutionary
               peasants; they wanted to reform the system, not to destroy it,
               and the uprising had already sufficiently destabilized the
               power structure. Finally on May 15, 1525, the main peasant
               army was decisively defeated at Frankenhausen; Müntzer and
               other influential leaders were seized and executed, and the
               rebellion was put down. However, over the following years the
               Anabaptist movement spread throughout Germany,
               Switzerland, and the Netherlands, and peasant revolts
               continued to break out, in the hopes that one day the church
               and the state would be destroyed for good.
               Capitalism and modern democratic states succeeded in
               establishing themselves over the following centuries, but they
               have been forever haunted by the specter of rebellion from
               below. Within statist societies, the ability to organize without
               hierarchies still exists today, and the possibility remains to
               create anti-authoritarian cultures that can bring any would-be

               leaders back down to earth. Appropriately, much of the
               resistance against global authority is organized horizontally.
               The worldwide anti-globalization movement arose largely from
               the resistance of the Zapatistas in Mexico, autonomists and
               anarchists in Europe, farmers and workers in Korea, and
               popular rebellions against financial institutions like the IMF,
               occurring across the world from South Africa to India. The
               Zapatistas and autonomists especially are marked by their
               anti-authoritarian cultures, a marked break from the hierarchy
               of Marxist-Leninists who had dominated international struggles
               in previous generations.
               The anti-globalization movement proved itself to be a global
               force in June, 1999, when hundreds of thousands of people in
               cities from London, England to Port Harcourt, Nigeria took the
               streets for the J18 Carnival Against Capitalism; in November
               later that year, participants in the same movement shocked
               the world by shutting down the summit of the World Trade
               Organization in Seattle.
               The most remarkable thing about this global resistance is that
               it was created horizontally, by diverse organizations and
               affinity groups pioneering new forms of consensus. This
               movement had no leaders and fomented constant opposition
               to all forms of authority that developed within its ranks. Those
               who attempted to put themselves permanently in the role of
               chief or spokesperson were ostracized — or even treated to a
               pie in the face, as high profile organizer Medea Benjamin was
               at the US Social Forum in 2007.
               Lacking leadership, short on formal organization, and
               constantly critiquing internal power dynamics and studying
47 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               more egalitarian ways of organizing, anti-globalization activists
               went on to achieve further tactical victories. In Prague in
               September 2000, 15,000 protestors overcame the massive
               police presence and broke up the last day of the summit of the
               International Monetary Fund. In Quebec City in April, 2001,
               protestors breached the security fence around a summit
               planning the Free Trade Area of the Americas; police responded
               by filling the city with so much teargas that it even entered the
               building where the talks were taking place. Consequently
               many city residents came to favor the protestors. Police had to
               step up repression to contain the growing anti-globalization
               movement; they arrested 600 protestors and injured three with
               gunfire at the European Union summit in Sweden in 2001, and
               a month later they murdered anarchist Carlo Giuliani at the G8
               summit in Genoa, where 150,000 people had gathered to
               protest the conference of the eight most powerful world
               governments.
               The Dissent! Network arose out of the European anti-
               globalization movement to organize major protests against the
               G8 summit in Scotland in 2005. The Network also organized
               major protest camps and blockade actions against the G8
               summit in Germany in 2007, and helped with the mobilizations
               against the G8 summit in Japan in 2008. Without a central
               leadership or hierarchy, the network facilitated communication
               between groups located in different cities and countries, and
               organized major meetings to discuss and decide on strategies
               for upcoming actions against the G8. The strategies were
               intended to enable diverse approaches, so many affinity
               groups could organize mutually supportive actions within a
48 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               common framework rather than carrying out the orders of a
               central organization. For example, a blockade plan might
               designate one road leading to the summit site as a zone for
               people who prefer peaceful or theatrical tactics, while another
               entrance might be designated for people who wish to construct
               barricades and are willing to defend themselves against the
               police. These strategy meetings drew people from a dozen
               countries and included translations in multiple languages.
               Afterwards, fliers, announcements, position papers, and
               critiques were translated and uploaded to a website. The
               anarchist forms of coordination used by the protestors
               repeatedly proved effective at countering and sometimes even
               outmaneuvering the police and corporate media, which
               enjoyed teams of thousands of paid professionals, advanced
               communications and surveillance infrastructure, and resources
               far beyond what was available to the movement.
               The anti-globalization movement can be contrasted with the
               anti-war movement that arose in response to the so-called War
               on Terror. After September 11, 2001, world leaders sought to
               undercut the growing anti-capitalist movement by identifying
               terrorism as enemy number one, thus reframing the narrative
               of global conflict. Following the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and
               the end of the Cold War, they needed a new war and a new
               opposition. People had to view their options as a choice
               between hierarchical powers — statist democracy or
               fundamentalist terrorists — rather than between domination
               and freedom. In the conservative environment that followed
               September 11, the anti-war movement quickly came to be
               dominated by reformist and hierarchically-organized groups.

               Although the movement kicked off with the most widely
               attended day of protest in human history on February 15,
               2003, the organizers deliberately channeled the energy of the
               participants into rigidly controlled rituals that did not challenge
               the war machine. Within two years, the anti-war movement
               had completely squandered the momentum built up during the
               anti-globalization era.
               The anti-war movement could not stop the occupation of Iraq,
               or even sustain itself, because people are neither empowered
               nor fulfilled by passively participating in symbolic spectacles. In
               contrast, the effectiveness of decentralized networks can be
               seen in the many victories of the anti-globalization movement:
               the summits shut down, the collapse of the WTO and FTAA, the
               dramatic scaling back of the IMF and World Bank.[16] This non-
               hierarchical movement demonstrated that people desire to
               free themselves from domination, and that they have the
               ability to cooperate in an anti-authoritarian manner even in
               large groups of strangers from different nations and cultures.
               So from scientific studies of human history to protesters
               making history today, the evidence overwhelmingly
               contradicts the statist account of human nature. Rather than
               coming from a brutally authoritarian ancestry and later
               subsuming these instincts into a competitive system based on
               obedience to authority, humankind has not had one single
               trajectory. Our beginnings seem to have been characterized by
               a range between strict egalitarianism and small-scale
               hierarchy with a relatively equal distribution of wealth. When
               coercive hierarchies did appear, they did not spread
               everywhere immediately, and often provoked significant

               resistance. Even where societies are ruled by authoritarian
               structures, resistance is every much a part of the social reality
               as domination and obedience. Furthermore, the state and
               authoritarian civilization are not the last stops on the line. Even
               though a global revolution has yet to succeed, we have many
               examples of post-state societies, in which we can make out
               hints of a stateless future.
               Half a century ago, anthropologist Pierre Clastres concluded
               that the stateless and anti-authoritarian societies he studied in
               South America were not holdouts from a primordial era, as
               other Westerners had assumed. He argued that, on the
               contrary, they were well aware of the possible emergence of
               the state, and they were organizing themselves to prevent this.
               It turns out that many of them were in fact post-state societies
               founded by refugees and rebels who had fled from or
               overthrown earlier states. Similarly, anarchist Peter Lamborn
               Wilson hypothesized that anti-authoritarian societies in eastern
               North America formed in resistance to the hierarchical
               Hopewell mound-building societies, and recent research
               seems to be confirming this. What others had interpreted as
               ahistorical ethnicities were the end results of political
               movements.
               The Cossacks who inhabited the Russian frontiers provide
               another example of this phenomenon. Their societies were
               founded by people fleeing serfdom and other inconveniences
               of government oppression. They learned horsemanship and
               developed impressive martial skills to survive in the frontier
               environment and defend themselves against neighboring
               states. Eventually, they came to be viewed as a distinct
51 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               ethnicity with a privileged autonomy, and the tsar whom their
               ancestors renounced sought them out as military allies.
               According to Yale political scientist James C. Scott, everything
               about such societies — from the crops they grow to their
               kinship systems — can be read as anti-authoritarian social
               strategies. Scott documents the Hill People of Southeast Asia,
               an agglomeration of societies existing in rugged terrain where
               fragile state structures face a severe disadvantage. For
               hundreds of years, these people have resisted state
               domination, including frequent wars of conquest or
               extermination by the Chinese empire and periods of
               continuous attacks by slavers. Cultural and linguistic diversity
               is exponentially greater in the hills than in the state-controlled
               rice paddies of the valleys, where a monoculture holds sway.
               Hill People frequently speak multiple languages and belong to
               multiple ethnicities. Their social organization is suited for quick
               and easy dispersal and reunification, allowing them to escape
               assaults and wage guerrilla warfare. Their kinship systems are
               based on overlapping and redundant relationships that create
               a strong social network and limit the formalization of power.
               Their oral cultures are more decentralized and flexible than
               nearby literate cultures, in which reliance on the written word
               encourages orthodoxy and gives extra power to those with the
               resources to keep records.
               The Hill People have an interesting relationship with the
               surrounding states. The people of the valleys view them as
               “living ancestors,” even though they have formed as a
               response to the valley civilizations. They are post-state, not
               pre-state, but the ideology of the state refuses to recognize
52 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               such a category as “post-state” because the state supposes
               itself to be the pinnacle of progress. Subjects of the valley
               civilizations frequently “headed for the hills” to live more
               freely; however the narratives and mythologies of the Chinese,
               Vietnamese, Burmese, and other authoritarian civilizations in
               the centuries leading up to World War II seemed to be designed
               to prevent their members from “going back” to those they
               perceived as barbarians. According to some scholars, the Great
               Wall of China was built as much to keep the Chinese in as the
               barbarians out; yet in the valley civilizations of China and
               Southeast Asia, myths, language, and rituals that might
               explain such cultural defections were suspiciously lacking.
               Culture was used as another Great Wall to hold these fragile
               civilizations together. No wonder the “barbarians” gave up
               written language in favor of a more decentralized oral culture:
               without written records and a specialized class of scribes,
               history became common property, rather than a tool for
               indoctrination.
               Far from being a necessary social advancement that people
               readily accept, the state is an imposition that many people try
               to flee. A proverb from the Burmese encapsulates this: “It is
               easy for a subject to find a lord, but hard for a lord to find a
               subject.” In Southeast Asia, until recently, the primary goal of
               warfare was not to capture territory but to capture subjects, as
               people frequently ran for the hills to create egalitarian
               societies.[17] It is ironic that so many of us are convinced we
               have an essential need for the state, when in fact it is the state
               that needs us.

               A broader sense of self
               A hundred years ago, Peter Kropotkin, the Russian geographer
               and anarchist theorist, published his revolutionary book,
               Mutual Aid, which argues that the tendency of people to help
               one another reciprocally, in a spirit of solidarity, was a greater
               factor in human evolution than competition. We can see
               cooperative behaviors similarly playing a role in the survival of
               many species of mammals, birds, fish, and insects. Still, the
               belief persists that humans are naturally selfish, competitive,
               warlike, and male-dominated. This belief is founded upon a
               misrepresentation of so-called primitive peoples as brutal, and
               of the state as a necessary, pacifying force.
               Westerners who see themselves as the pinnacle of human
               evolution typically view hunter-gatherers and other stateless
               peoples as relics of the past, even if they are alive in the
               present. In doing so, they are presuming that history is an
               inevitable progression from less to more complex, and that
               Western civilization is more complex than other cultures. If
               history is organized into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age,
               Industrial Age, Information Age, and so on, someone who does
               not use metal tools must still be living in the Stone Age, right?
               But it is eurocentric, to say the least, to assume that a hunter-
               gatherer who knows the uses of a thousand different plants is
               less sophisticated than an operator at a nuclear power plant
               who knows how to push a thousand different buttons but
               doesn’t know where his food comes from.
               Capitalism may be capable of feats of production and
               distribution that have never been possible before, but at the
54 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               same time this society is tragically unable to keep everyone
               fed and healthy, and has never existed without gross
               inequalities, oppression, and environmental devastation. One
               might argue that members of our society are socially stunted,
               if not outright primitive, when it comes to being able to
               cooperate and organize ourselves without authoritarian
               control.
               A nuanced view of stateless societies shows them to have their
               own developed forms of social organization and their own
               complex histories, both of which contradict Western notions
               about “natural” human characteristics. The great diversity of
               human behaviors that are considered normal in different
               societies calls into question the very idea of human nature.
               Our understanding of human nature directly influences what
               we expect of people. If humans are naturally selfish and
               competitive, we cannot expect to live in a cooperative society.
               When we see how differently other cultures have characterized
               human nature, we can recognize human nature as a cultural
               value, an idealized and normative mythology that justifies the
               way a society is organized. Western civilization devotes an
               immense amount of resources to social control, policing, and
               cultural production reinforcing capitalist values. The Western
               idea of human nature functions as a part of this social control,
               discouraging rebellion against authority. We are taught from
               childhood that without authority human life would descend
               into chaos.
               This view of human nature was advanced by Hobbes and other
               European philosophers to explain the origins and purpose of
               the State; this marked a shift to scientific arguments at a time
55 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               when divine arguments no longer sufficed. Hobbes and his
               contemporaries lacked the psychological, historical,
               archaeological, and ethnographic data that we have today,
               and their thinking was still heavily influenced by a legacy of
               Christian teachings. Even now that we have access to an
               abundance of information contradicting Christian cosmology
               and statist political science, the popular conception of human
               nature has not changed dramatically. Why are we still so
               miseducated? A second question answers the first: who
               controls education in our society? Nonetheless, anyone who
               counters the authoritarian dogma faces an uphill battle against
               the charge of “romanticism.”
               But if human nature is not fixed, if it can encompass a wide
               range of possibilities, couldn’t we use a romantic dose of
               imagination in envisioning new possibilities? The acts of
               rebellion occurring within our society right now, from the
               Faslane Peace Camp to the Really Really Free Markets, contain
               the seeds of a peaceful and openhanded society. Popular
               responses to natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in
               New Orleans show that everyone has the potential to
               cooperate when the dominant social order is disrupted. These
               examples point the way to a broader sense of self — an
               understanding of human beings as creatures capable of a wide
               range of behaviors.
               One might say selfishness is natural, in that people inevitably
               live according to their own desires and experiences. But
               egoism need not be competitive or dismissive of others. Our
               relationships extend far beyond our bodies and our minds —
               we live in communities, depend on ecosystems for food and
56 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               water, and need friends, families, and lovers for our emotional
               health. Without institutionalized competition and exploitation,
               a person’s self-interest overlaps with the interests of her
               community and her environment. Seeing our relationships with
               our friends and nature as fundamental parts of ourselves
               expands our sense of connection with the world and our
               responsibility for it. It is not in our self-interest to be dominated
               by authorities, or to dominate others; in developing a broader
               sense of self, we can structure our lives and communities
               accordingly.

               2. Decisions

               Anarchy is the absence of rulers. Free people do not follow
               orders; they make their own decisions and come to
               agreements within their communities, and develop shared
               means for putting these decisions into practice.
               How will decisions be made?
               There should be no doubt that human beings can make
               decisions in non-hierarchical, egalitarian ways. The majority of
               human societies have been stateless, and many stateless
               societies have not been governed by the dictates of some “Big
               Man,” but by common assemblies using some form of
               consensus. Numerous consensus-based societies have
               survived thousands of years, even through European
               colonialism into the present day, in Africa, Australia, Asia, the
               Americas, and on the peripheries of Europe.
               People from societies in which decision-making power has
               been monopolized by the state and corporations may initially
               find it difficult to make decisions in an egalitarian way, but it
               gets easier with practice. Fortunately, we all have some
               experience with horizontal decision-making. Most of the
               decisions we make in daily life, with friends and hopefully with
               colleagues and family as well, we make on the basis of
               cooperation rather than authority. Friendship is precious
               because it is a space in which we interact as equals, where our
               opinions are valued regardless of our social status. Groups of
58 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               friends typically use informal consensus to decide how to
               spend time together, organize activities, assist one another,
               and respond to challenges in their daily lives. So most of us
               already understand consensus intuitively; it takes more
               practice to learn how to come to consensus with people who
               are significantly different from us, especially in large groups or
               when it is necessary to coordinate complex activities, but it is
               possible.
               Consensus is not the only empowering way to make decisions.
               In certain contingencies, groups that are truly voluntary
               associations can still be empowering for their members when
               they use majority decision-making. Or one person making her
               own decisions and acting alone can inspire dozens more
               people to take similar actions, or to support what she has
               started, thus avoiding the sometimes stifling weight of
               meetings. In creative or inspiring circumstances people often
               succeed in coordinating themselves spontaneously and
               chaotically, producing unprecedented results. The specific
               decision-making form is just a tool, and with consensus or
               individual action as with majority decision-making people can
               take an active part in using that tool as they see fit.
               Korean anarchists won an opportunity to demonstrate people’s
               ability to make their own decisions in 1929. The Korean
               Anarchist Communist Federation (KACF) was a huge
               organization at that time, with enough support that it could
               declare an autonomous zone in the Shinmin province. Shinmin
               was outside of Korea, in Manchuria, but two million Korean
               immigrants lived there. Using assemblies and a decentralized
               federative structure that grew out of the KACF, they created
59 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               village councils, district councils, and area councils to deal with
               matters of cooperative agriculture, education, and finance.
               They also formed an army spearheaded by the anarchist Kim
               Jwa-Jin, which used guerrilla tactics against Soviet and
               Japanese forces. KACF sections in China, Korea, and Japan
               organized international support efforts. Caught between the
               Stalinists and the Japanese imperial army, the autonomous
               province was ultimately crushed in 1931. But for two years,
               large populations had freed themselves from the authority of
               landlords and governors and reasserted their power to come to
               collective decisions, to organize their day-to-day life, pursue
               their dreams, and defend those dreams from invading armies.
               [18]
               One of the most well known anarchist histories is that of the
               Spanish Civil War. In July 1936, General Franco launched a
               fascist coup in Spain. From the standpoint of the elite, it was a
               necessary act; the nation’s military officers, landowners, and
               religious hierarchy were terrified by growing anarchist and
               socialist movements. The monarchy had already been
               abolished, but the workers and peasants were not content with
               representative democracy. The coup did not go smoothly.
               While in many areas Spain’s Republican government rolled
               over easily and resigned itself to fascism, the anarchist labor
               union (CNT) and other anarchists working autonomously
               formed militias, seized arsenals, stormed barracks, and
               defeated trained troops. Anarchists were especially strong in
               Catalunya, Aragon, Asturias, and much of Andalucia. Workers
               also defeated the coup in Madrid and Valencia, where the
               socialists were strong, and in much of the Basque country. In

               the anarchist areas, the government effectively ceased to
               function.
               In these stateless areas of the Spanish countryside in 1936,
               peasants organized themselves according to principles of
               communism, collectivism, or mutualism according to their
               preferences and local conditions. They formed thousands of
               collectives, especially in Aragon, Catalunya, and Valencia.
               Some abolished all money and private property; some
               organized quota systems to ensure that everyone’s needs
               were met. The diversity of forms they developed is a testament
               to the freedom they created themselves. Where once all these
               villages were mired in the same stifling context of feudalism
               and developing capitalism, within months of overthrowing
               government authority and coming together in village
               assemblies, they gave birth to hundreds of different systems,
               united by common values like solidarity and self-organization.
               And they developed these different forms by holding open
               assemblies and making decisions about their future in
               common.
               The town of Magdalena de Pulpis, for example, abolished
               money completely. One inhabitant reported, “Everyone works
               and everyone has the right to what he needs free of charge. He
               simply goes to the store where provisions and all other
               necessities are supplied. Everything is distributed free with
               only a notation of what he took.”[19] Recording what everyone
               took allowed the community to distribute resources equally in
               times of scarcity, and generally ensured accountability.
               Other collectives worked out their own systems of exchange.
               They issued local money in the form of vouchers, tokens,
61 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               rationing booklets, certificates, and coupons which carried no
               interest and were not negotiable outside of the issuing
               collective. Communities that had suppressed money paid
               workers in coupons according to the size of the family — a
               “family wage” based on the needs of the family rather than the
               productivity of its working members. Abundant local goods like
               bread, wine, and olive oil were distributed freely, while other
               items “could be obtained by means of coupons at the
               communal depot. Surplus goods were exchanged with other
               anarchist towns and villages.”[20] There was much
               experimentation with new monetary systems. In Aragon, there
               were hundreds of different kinds of coupon and money
               systems, so the Aragon Federation of Peasant Collectives
               unanimously decided to replace local currencies with a
               standard ration booklet — though each collective retained the
               power to decide how goods would be distributed and the
               amount of coupons workers would receive.
               All the collectives, once they had taken control of their villages,
               organized open mass assemblies to discuss problems and plan
               how to organize themselves. Decisions were made via voting
               or consensus. Village assemblies generally met between once
               a week and once a month; foreign observers surveying them
               remarked that participation was broad and enthusiastic. Many
               of the collectivized villages joined with other collectives in
               order to pool resources, aid one another, and arrange trade.
               The collectives in Aragon donated hundreds of tons of food to
               the volunteer militias who were holding back the fascists on
               the front, and also took in large numbers of refugees who had
               fled the fascists. The town of Graus, for example, with a
62 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               population of 2,600, took in and supported 224 refugees, only
               20 of whom could work.
               At assemblies, collectives discussed problems and proposals.
               Many collectives elected administrative committees, generally
               consisting of half a dozen people, to manage affairs until the
               next meeting. The open assemblies:
               allowed the inhabitants to know, to so understand, and to feel
               so mentally integrated in society, to so participate in the
               management of public affairs, in the responsibilities, that the
               recriminations, the tensions which always occur when the
               power of decision is entrusted to a few individuals... did not
               happen there. The assemblies were public, the objections, the
               proposals publicly discussed, everybody being free, as in the
               syndical assemblies, to participate in the discussions, to
               criticize, propose, etc. Democracy extended to the whole of
               social life. In most cases even the individualists [locals who had
               not joined the collective] could take part in the deliberations.
               They were given the same hearing as the collectivists.[21]
               If not every village inhabitant was a member of the collective,
               there might be a municipal council in addition to the collective
               assembly, so that no one would be excluded from decision-
               making.
               In many collectives they agreed that if a member violated a
               collective rule once, he was reprimanded. If it happened a
               second time, he was referred to the general assembly. Only the
               general assembly could expel a member from the collective;
               delegates and administrators were denied punitive power. The
               power of the general assembly to respond to transgressions
63 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               was also used to prevent people who had been delegated
               tasks from being irresponsible or authoritarian; delegates or
               elected administrators who failed to abide by collective
               decisions or usurped authority were suspended or removed by
               a general vote. In some villages that were split between
               anarchists and socialists, the peasants formed two collectives
               side by side, to allow for different ways of making and
               enforcing decisions rather than imposing one method on
               everybody.
               Gaston Leval described a general assembly in the village of
               Tamarite de Litera, in Huesca province, which the non-
               collective peasants were also allowed to attend. One problem
               brought up at the meeting was that several peasants who had
               not joined the collective left their elderly parents in the care of
               the collective while taking their parents’ land to farm as their
               own. The entire group discussed the matter, and eventually
               decided to adopt a specific proposal: they would not kick the
               elderly parents out of the collective, but they wanted to hold
               those peasants accountable, so they decided that the latter
               had to take care of their parents or else receive neither
               solidarity nor land from the collective. In the end, a resolution
               agreed to by an entire community will carry more legitimacy,
               and is more likely to be followed, than one handed down by a
               specialist or a government official.
               Important decisions also took place at work in the fields every
               day:
               The work of the collectives was conducted by teams of
               workers, headed by a delegate chosen by each team. The land
               was divided into cultivated zones. Team delegates worked like
64 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               the others. There were no special privileges. After the day’s
               work, delegates from all the work teams met on the job and
               made necessary technical arrangements for the next day’s
               work... The assembly made final decisions on all important
               questions and issued instructions to both the team delegates
               and the administrative commission.”[22]
               Many areas also had District Committees that pooled the
               resources of all the collectives in a district, basically acting as a
               clearinghouse to circulate surplus from the collectives that had
               it to other collectives that needed it. Hundreds of collectives
               joined federations organized through the CNT or UGT (the
               socialist labor union). The federations provided economic
               coordination, pooling resources to allow peasants to build their
               own fruit and vegetable canneries, gathering information
               about which items were in abundance and which were in short
               supply, and organizing uniform exchange systems. This
               collective form of decision-making proved effective for the
               approximately seven to eight million peasants involved in this
               movement. Half the land in anti-fascist Spain — three-quarters
               of the land in Aragon — was collectivized and self-organized.
               In August 1937, just over a year after anarchist and socialist
               peasants started forming collectives, the Republican
               government, under control of the Stalinists, had consolidated
               enough to move against the lawless zones of Aragon. The Karl
               Marx Brigade, units of the International Brigades, and other
               units disarmed and dissolved the collectives in Aragon,
               crushing any resistance and spiriting off numerous anarchists
               and libertarian socialists to the prisons and torture chambers
               the Stalinists had set up to use against their revolutionary

               allies.
               Brazil today bears a similarity with Spain in 1936, in that a tiny
               percentage of the population owns nearly half of all the land
               while millions of people are without land or sustenance. A
               major social movement has sprung up in response. The
               Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra (MST), or
               Landless Workers’ Movement, is made up of 1.5 million
               impoverished laborers who occupy unused land to set up
               farming collectives. Since its founding in 1984, the MST has
               won land titles for 350,000 families living in 2,000 different
               settlements. The basic unit of organization consists of a group
               of families living together in a settlement on occupied land.
               These groups retain autonomy and self-organize matters of
               day-to-day living. To participate in regional meetings they
               appoint two or three representatives, which in principle include
               a man and a woman though in practice this is not always the
               case. The MST has a federative structure; there are also State
               and National Coordinating Bodies. While most of the decision-
               making takes place at the grassroots level with land
               occupations, farming, and the establishment of settlements,
               the MST also organizes at higher levels to coordinate massive
               protests and highway blockades to pressure the government to
               give land titles to the settlements. The MST has shown a great
               deal of innovation and strength, organizing schools and
               protecting themselves against frequent police repression. They
               have developed practices of sustainable agriculture, including
               setting up seed banks for native seeds, and they have invaded
               and destroyed environmentally harmful eucalyptus forestry
               plantations and test grounds for genetically modified crops.

               Within the logic of democracy, 1.5 million people is considered
               simply too large a group for everyone to be allowed to
               participate directly in decision-making; the majority should
               entrust that power to politicians. But the MST holds an ideal in
               which all possible decision-making remains on the local level.
               In practice, however, they often do not meet this ideal. As a
               massive organization that does not seek to abolish capitalism
               or overthrow the state but rather to pressure it, the MST has
               been brought into the game of politics, in which all principles
               are for sale. Furthermore, a huge portion of their members
               come from extremely poor and oppressed communities that
               for generations had been controlled by a combination of
               religion, patriotism, crime, drug addiction, and patriarchy.
               These dynamics do not disappear when people enter into the
               movement, and they cause significant problems within the
               MST.
               Throughout the 80s and the 90s, new MST settlements were
               created by activists from the organization who would seek
               landless people in rural areas or especially in the favelas, the
               urban slums, who wanted to form a group and occupy land.
               They would go through a base-building period of two months,
               in which they would hold meetings and debates to try to build a
               sense of community, affinity, and political common ground.
               Then they would occupy a piece of unused land owned by a
               major landlord, choose representatives to federate with the
               larger organization, and begin farming. Activists working with
               the MST local would pass through periodically to see if the
               settlement needed help acquiring tools and materials,
               resolving internal disputes, or protecting themselves from
67 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               police, paramilitaries, or major landlords, all of whom
               frequently conspired to threaten and assassinate MST
               members.
               In part due to the autonomy of each settlement, they have met
               with a variety of outcomes. Leftists from other countries
               typically romanticize the MST while the Brazilian capitalist
               media portray them all as violent thugs who steal land and
               then sell it. In fact, the capitalist media portrayal is accurate in
               some cases, though by no means in a majority of cases. It is
               not unheard of for people in a new settlement to divide up the
               land and later fight over the allotments. Some might sell their
               allotment to a local landlord, or open a liquor store on their
               allotment and fuel alcoholism, or encroach on their neighbor’s
               allotment, and such boundary disputes are sometimes
               resolved with violence. The majority of settlements divide into
               completely individualized, separate homesteads rather than
               working the land collectively or communally. Another common
               weakness reflects the society from which these landless
               workers come — many of the settlements are dominated by a
               Christian, patriotic, and patriarchal culture.
               Though its weaknesses need to be addressed, the MST has
               achieved a long list of victories. The movement has won land
               and self-sufficiency for a huge number of extremely poor
               people. Many of the settlements they create enjoy a much
               higher standard of living than the slums they left behind, and
               are bound by a sense of solidarity and community. By any
               measure their accomplishment is a triumph for direct action:
               by disregarding legality or petitioning the powerful for change,
               over a million people have won themselves land and control

               over their lives by going out and doing it themselves. Brazilian
               society has not collapsed due to this wave of anarchy; on the
               contrary it has become healthier, although many problems
               remain, in the society at large and in the settlements. It largely
               comes down to circumstance whether a particular settlement
               is empowering and liberated or competitive and oppressive.
               According to an MST member who worked for several years in
               one of the most dangerous regions of Brazil, two months was
               simply not enough time in most cases to overcome people’s
               anti-social training and create a real sense of community, but it
               was much better than the prevalent pattern in the subsequent
               period. As the organization experienced a rush to grow, many
               activists began slapping together settlements by recruiting
               groups of strangers, promising them land, and sending them
               off into the regions with the poorest soil or most violent
               landlords, often contributing to deforestation in the process.
               Naturally, this emphasis on quantitative results amplified the
               worst characteristics of the organization and in many ways
               weakened it, even as its political power increased.[23]
               The context for this watershed in the MST was the election of
               President Lula of the Workers Party (PT) in 2003. Previously, the
               MST had been autonomous: they did not cooperate with
               political parties or allow politicians into the organization,
               although many organizers used the MST to launch political
               careers. But with the unprecedented victory of the progressive,
               socialist Workers Party, the leadership of the MST tried to forbid
               anyone in the organization from publicly speaking out against
               the government’s new agrarian policy. At the same time, the
               MST began receiving huge amounts of money from the
69 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               government. Lula had promised to give land to a certain
               number of families and the MST leadership rushed to fill this
               quota and engorge their own organization, abandoning their
               base and their principles. Many influential MST organizers and
               leaders, backed by the more radical settlements, criticized this
               collaboration with the government and pushed for a more anti-
               authoritarian stance, and in fact by 2005, when the PT’s
               agrarian program proved to be a disappointment, the MST
               began fiercely challenging the government again.
               In the eyes of anti-authoritarians the organization had lost its
               credibility and proven once again the predictable results of
               collaboration with the government. But within the movement
               there are still many causes for inspiration. Many of the
               settlements continue to demonstrate the ability of people to
               overcome their capitalist and authoritarian socialization, if they
               take it upon themselves to do so. Perhaps the best example are
               the Comunas da Terra, a network of settlements that make up
               a minority within the MST, that farm the land communally,
               nurture a spirit of solidarity, challenge sexism and capitalist
               mindsets internally, and create working examples of anarchy. It
               is notable that the people in the Comunas da Terra enjoy a
               higher standard of life than those who live in the individualized
               settlements.
               There are contemporary examples of non-hierarchical
               organizing in North America as well. Throughout the United
               States today, there exist dozens of anarchist projects that are
               run on a consensus basis. Consensus decision-making may be
               used on an ad hoc basis to plan an event or campaign, or more
               permanently to run an infoshop: an anarchist social center that
70 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               can serve as a radical bookshop, library, café, meeting space,
               concert hall, or free store. A typical meeting might begin with
               volunteers filling the positions of facilitator and note-taker.
               Many groups also use a “vibes-watcher,” someone who
               volunteers to pay special attention to emotions and
               interactions within the group, recognizing that the personal is
               political and that the tradition of suppressing emotions in
               political spaces derives from the separation of public and
               private, a separation on which patriarchy and the state are
               based.
               Next, the participants create an agenda in which they list all
               the topics they want to talk about. For each topic, they start by
               sharing information. If a decision needs to be made, they talk it
               over until they find a point where everyone’s needs and desires
               converge. Someone states a proposal that synthesizes
               everyone’s input, and they vote on it: approve, abstain, or
               block. If one person is opposed, the group looks for another
               solution.The decisions may not always be everyone’s first
               choice, but everyone must feel comfortable with every
               decision the group adopts. Throughout this process, the
               facilitator encourages full participation from everyone and
               makes sure no one is silenced.
               Sometimes, the group is unable to solve a particular problem,
               but the option of not coming to any decision demonstrates that
               within consensus, the health of the group is more important
               than efficiency. Such groups form on the principle of voluntary
               association — anyone is free to leave if she wishes, in contrast
               to authoritarian structures that may deny people the right to
               leave or exempt themselves from an arrangement they do not
71 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               agree to. According to this principle, it is better to respect the
               differing views of the members of a group than to enforce a
               decision that leaves some people excluded or silenced. This
               might seem impractical to those who have not participated in
               such a process, but consensus has served many infoshops and
               similar projects in the US for years. Using consensus, these
               groups have made the decisions necessary to organize spaces
               and events, reach out to the surrounding communities, bring in
               new participants, raise money, and resist attempts by local
               government and business leaders to shut them down. What’s
               more, it seems like the number of projects using consensus in
               the US is only growing. Granted, consensus works best for
               people who know one another and have a common interest in
               working together, whether they are volunteers who want to
               run an infoshop, neighbors who want to resist gentrification, or
               members of an affinity group planning attacks against the
               system — but it does work.
               A common complaint is that consensus meetings take longer,
               but are they really less efficient? Authoritarian models of
               decision-making, including majority voting in which the
               minority is forced to conform to the decision of the majority,
               hide or externalize their true costs. Communities that use
               authoritarian means to make their decisions cannot exist
               without police or some other structure to enforce these
               decisions. Consensus precludes the need for enforcement and
               punishment by making sure that everyone is satisfied
               beforehand. When we take into account all the work hours a
               community loses maintaining a police force, which is a huge
               drain on resources, the hours spent in consensus meetings
72 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               seem like a good usage of time after all.
               The rebellion in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca offer
               another example of popular decision-making. In 2006, people
               took over Oaxaca City and much of the state. The population of
               Oaxaca is over half indigenous, and the struggles there against
               colonialism and capitalism go back five hundred years. In June
               2006, 70,000 striking teachers gathered in Oaxaca de Juarez,
               the capital, to press their demands for a living wage and better
               facilities for the students. On June 14, the police attacked the
               teacher’s encampment, but the teachers fought back, forcing
               the police out of the center of the city, taking over government
               buildings and evicting politicians, and setting up barricades to
               keep them out. Oaxaca City was self-organized and
               autonomous for five months, until federal troops were sent in.
               After they forced the police out of the capital city, the striking
               teachers were joined by students and other workers, and
               together they formed the Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de
               Oaxaca (Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca). The
               APPO became a coordinating body for the social movements of
               Oaxaca, effectively organizing social life and popular
               resistance for several months in the vacuum created by the
               collapse of state control. It brought together delegates from
               unions, non-governmental organizations, social organizations,
               and cooperatives across the state, seeking to make decisions
               in the spirit of indigenous practices of consensus — although
               most assemblies made decisions with a majority vote. APPO
               founders rejected electoral politics and called for people
               throughout the state to organize their own assemblies at every
               level.[24] Recognizing the role of political parties in co-opting
73 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               popular movements, the APPO banned them from
               participating.
               According to one activist who helped to found the APPO:
               So the APPO was formed to address the abuses and create an
               alternative. It was to be a space for discussion, reflection,
               analysis, and action. We recognized that it shouldn’t be just
               one organization, but rather a blanket coordinating body for
               many different groups. That is, not one ideology would prevail;
               we would focus on finding the common ground among diverse
               social actors. Students, teachers, anarchists, Marxists,
               churchgoers — everyone was invited.
               The APPO was born without a formal structure, but soon
               developed impressive organizational capacity. Decisions in the
               APPO are made by consensus within the general assembly,
               which was privileged as a decision-making body. In the first few
               weeks of our existence we created the APPO State Council. The
               council was originally composed of 260 people —
               approximately ten representatives from each of Oaxaca’s
               seven regions and representatives from Oaxaca’s urban
               neighborhoods and municipalities.
               The Provisional Coordination was created to facilitate the
               operation of the APPO through different commissions. A
               variety of commissions were established: judicial, finance,
               communications, human rights, gender equity, defense of
               natural resources, and many more. Proposals are generated in
               smaller assemblies of each sector of the APPO and then
               brought to the general assembly where they are debated
               further or ratified.[25]
74 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Time and again, spontaneous popular assemblies such as the
               one created in Oaxaca have proved capable of making sound
               decisions and coordinating the activities of an entire
               population. Naturally, they also attract people who want to
               take over social movements and people who consider
               themselves natural leaders. In many revolutions, what begins
               as a horizontal, libertarian rebellion becomes authoritarian as
               political parties or self-appointed leaders co-opt and shut down
               popular decision-making structures. Highly visible participants
               in popular assemblies can also be pushed towards
               conservatism by government repression, since they are the
               most visible targets.
               This is one way to interpret dynamics that developed in the
               APPO after the federal invasion of Oaxaca in late October,
               2006. As the repression intensified, some of the more vocal
               participants in the assembly began calling for moderation, to
               the dismay of the segments of the movement that were still in
               the streets. Many APPO members and movement participants
               complain that the group was taken over by Stalinists and other
               parasites who use popular movements as tools for their
               political ambitions. And though the APPO had always taken a
               stand against political parties, the self-appointed leadership
               took advantage of the difficult situation to call for participation
               in the upcoming elections as the only pragmatic course of
               action.
               Many people felt betrayed. Support for collaboration was far
               from universal within APPO; it was controversial even within
               the APPO Council, the provisional decision-making group that
               was emerging as a leadership body. Some people within the
75 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               APPO created other formations to disseminate anarchist,
               indigenist, or other anti-authoritarian perspectives, and many
               just went on with their work and ignored the calls to flock to the
               voting booths. In the end, the anti-authoritarian ethic that
               constituted the backbone of the movement and the basis of its
               formal structures proved stronger. The vast majority of
               Oaxacans boycotted the elections, and the PRI, the
               conservative party that already held power, dominated among
               the few people who came out to cast ballots. The attempt to
               transform the powerful, liberatory social movements of
               Oaxaca into a bid for political power was an absolute failure.
               A smaller Oaxacan city, Zaachila (pop. 25,000), can provide a
               closer look at horizontal decision-making. For years, groups
               had been working together against local forms of exploitation;
               among other efforts, they had managed to defeat the plan to
               construct a Coca Cola plant which would have consumed much
               of the available drinking water. When the rebellion erupted in
               Oaxaca City, a majority of the residents decided to take action.
               They convoked Zaachila’s first popular assembly with the
               ringing of the bells, calling everyone together, to share the
               news of the police attack in Oaxaca City and to decide what to
               do in their own town. More meetings and actions followed:
               Men, women, children, and city council members joined
               together to take over the municipal building. A lot of the
               building was locked and we only used the hallways and the
               offices that were open. We stayed in the municipal building
               night and day, taking care of everything. And that’s how the
               neighborhood assemblies were born. We’d say, “It’s the
               neighborhood of La Soledad’s turn and tomorrow it’s up to San
76 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Jacinto.” That’s how the neighborhood assemblies were first
               used, and then later they turned into decision-making bodies,
               which is where we are now.
               The seizing of the municipal building was totally spontaneous.
               The activists from before played a role and initially directed
               things, but the popular assembly structure was developed little
               by little...
               Neighborhood assemblies, comprised of a rotating body of five
               people, were also formed in each section of town and together
               they would form the permanent popular assembly, the
               People’s Council of Zaachila. The people from neighborhood
               assemblies may not be activists at all, but little by little, as they
               follow their obligation to bring information back and forth from
               the Council, they develop their capacity for leadership. All the
               agreements made in the Council are studied by these five
               people and then brought back to the neighborhoods for review.
               These assemblies are completely open; anyone can attend
               and have their voice heard. Decisions always go to a general
               vote, and all the adults present can vote. For example, if some
               people think a bridge needs to be built, and others think we
               need to focus on improving electricity, we vote on what the
               priority should be. The simple majority wins, fifty-percent plus
               one.[26]
               The townsfolk kicked out the mayor while maintaining public
               services, and also established a community radio station. The
               city served as a model for dozens of other municipalities
               throughout the state that soon proclaimed their autonomy.
               Years before these events in Zaachila, another group was
77 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               organizing autonomous villages in the state of Oaxaca. As
               many as twenty-six rural communities affiliated with the CIPO-
               RFM (Council of Indigenous Peoples of Oaxaca — Ricardo Flores
               Magon), an organization that identifies with southern Mexico’s
               tradition of indigenous and anarchist resistance; the name
               references an indigenous anarchist influential in the Mexican
               Revolution. Insofar as they can, living under an oppressive
               regime, the CIPO communities assert their autonomy and help
               one another to meet their needs, ending private property and
               working the land communally. Typically, when a village
               expressed interest in joining the group, someone from the CIPO
               would come and explain how they worked, and let the villagers
               decide whether or not they wanted to join. The government
               frequently denied resources to CIPO villages, hoping to starve
               them out, but it is no surprise that many people thought they
               could live more richly as masters of their own lives, even if it
               meant greater material poverty.
               How will decisions be enforced?
               The state has so thoroughly obscured the fact that people are
               capable of implementing their own decisions that those raised
               in this society are hard-pressed to imagine how this could be
               done without giving a small minority the authority to coerce
               people into following orders. On the contrary, the power to
               enforce decisions should be every bit as universal and
               decentralized as the power to make those decisions. There
               have been stateless societies on every continent that used
               diffuse sanctions rather than specialized enforcers. Only
               through a long and violent process do states steal this ability
78 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               from people and monopolize it as their own.
               This is how diffuse sanctions work: in an ongoing process, a
               society decides how it wants to organize and what behaviors it
               considers unacceptable. This may occur over time or in formal,
               immediate settings. The participation of everybody in making
               these decisions is complemented by the participation of
               everybody in upholding them. If somebody breaks these
               common standards, everyone is accustomed to reacting. They
               don’t call the police, file a grievance, or wait for someone else
               to do something; they approach the person they think is in the
               wrong and tell him, or take another appropriate action.
               For example, the people in a neighborhood may decide that
               each different household will take turns cleaning the street. If
               one household fails to uphold this decision, everybody else on
               the block has the ability to ask them to fulfill their responsibility.
               Depending on how serious the transgression is, other people in
               the neighborhood might react with criticism, ridicule, or
               ostracism. If the household has a good excuse for being slack,
               perhaps someone living there is very sick and the others are
               busy taking care of her, the neighbors can choose to have
               sympathy and forgive the lapse. This flexibility and sensitivity
               are typically lacking in a law-based system. On the other hand,
               if the negligent household has no excuse, and not only do they
               never clean the streets, they throw their trash in it, their
               neighbors might hold a general meeting demanding a change
               in their behavior, or they might take some action like piling all
               the trash in front of their door. Meanwhile, in their day-to-day
               interactions individual neighbors might share their criticisms
               with members of the offending household, or ridicule them, not
79 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               invite them to joint activities, or glare at them in the streets. If
               someone is incorrigibly antisocial, always blocking or
               contradicting the desires of the rest of the group and refusing
               to respond to people’s concerns, the ultimate response is to
               kick that person out of the group.
               This method is much more flexible, and more liberating, than
               legalitarian, coercive approaches. Rather than being bound to
               the blind letter of the law, which cannot take into account
               specific circumstances or people’s needs, and depending on a
               powerful minority for enforcement, the method of diffuse
               sanctions allows everyone to weigh for herself how serious the
               transgression is. It also allows transgressors the opportunity to
               convince others that their actions were justified, thus providing
               constant challenges to the dominant morality. By contrast, in a
               statist system, the authorities don’t have to show that
               something is right or wrong before condemning someone’s
               home or confiscating a drug deemed illegal. All they have to do
               is cite a statute in a law book that their victims had no hand in
               writing.
               In a horizontal society, people enforce decisions according to
               how enthusiastic they are about those decisions. If almost
               everybody strongly supports a decision, it will be upheld
               vigorously, whereas if a decision leaves most people feeling
               neutral or unenthusiastic, it will only be partially enforced,
               leaving open more room for creative transgression and
               exploring other solutions. On the other hand a lack of
               enthusiasm in implementing decisions might mean that in
               practice organization falls on the shoulders of informal
               powerholders — people who are delegated an unofficial

               position of leadership by the rest of the group, whether they
               want it or not. This means that members of horizontal groups,
               from collective houses to entire societies, must confront the
               problem of self-discipline. They must hold themselves
               accountable to the standards they have agreed upon and the
               criticism of their peers, and risk being unpopular or confronting
               conflict by criticizing those who do not uphold common
               standards — calling out the housemate who does not do dishes
               or the community that does not contribute to road
               maintenance. It’s a difficult process, often lacking in many
               current anarchist projects, but without it group decision-
               making is a façade and responsibility is vague and unequally
               shared. Going through this process, people become more
               empowered and more connected with those around them.
               Groups always contain the possibility for conformity and
               conflict. Authoritarian groups typically avoid conflict by
               enforcing greater levels of conformity. Pressures to conform
               also exist in anarchist groups, but without restrictions on
               human movement, it is easier for people to leave and join
               other groups or to act or live on their own. Thus, people can
               choose the levels of conformity and conflict they want to
               tolerate, and in the process of finding and leaving groups,
               people change and challenge social norms.
               In the newly created state of Israel, Jews who had participated
               in socialist movements in Europe took the opportunity to
               create hundreds of kibbutzim, utopian communal farms. In
               these farms, the members created a strong example of
               communal living and decision-making. At a typical kibbutz,
               most decisions were made at a general town meeting, held
81 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               twice weekly. The frequency and length of meetings stemmed
               from the fact that so many aspects of social life were open to
               debate, and the common belief that proper decisions “can only
               be made after intensive group discussion.”[27] There were
               about a dozen elected positions in the kibbutz, related to
               managing the commune’s financial affairs and coordinating
               production and trade, but the general policy had to be decided
               in general meetings. Official positions were limited to terms of
               a few years, and the members encouraged a culture of “office-
               hating,” a reluctance to take office and a disdain for those who
               appeared to be power hungry.
               No one in the kibbutz had coercive authority. Neither were
               there police in the kibbutz, though it was common for everyone
               to leave their doors unlocked. Public opinion was the most
               important factor ensuring social cohesion. If there was a
               problem with a member of the commune, it was discussed at
               the general meeting, but most of the time even the threat of it
               being brought up at the general meeting motivated people to
               work out their differences. In the worst case scenario, if a
               member refused to accept group decisions, the rest of the
               collective could vote to kick her out. But this ultimate sanction
               differs from the coercive tactics used by the state in a key
               respect: voluntary groups only exist because everyone
               involved wants to work with everyone else. A person who is
               excluded is not deprived of the ability to survive or maintain
               relationships, as there are many other groups she can join.
               More importantly, she is not forced to abide by collective
               decisions. In a society based on this principle, people would
               enjoy a social mobility that is denied to people in statist
82 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               contexts, in which laws are enforced upon an individual
               whether she approves of them or not. In any case, expulsion
               was not common in the kibbutzim, because public opinion and
               group discussion were sufficient to solve most conflicts.
               But the kibbutzim had other problems, which can teach us
               important lessons about creating collectives. After about a
               decade, the kibbutzim began to succumb to the pressures of
               the capitalist world that surrounded them. Although internally
               the kibbutzim were strikingly communal, they were never
               properly anti-capitalist; from the beginning, they attempted to
               exist as competitive producers within a capitalist economy. The
               need to compete in the economy, and thus to industrialize,
               encouraged a greater reliance on experts, while influence from
               the rest of society fostered consumerism.
               At the same time, there was a negative reaction to the lack of
               privacy intentionally structured into the kibbutz — common
               showers, for example. The purpose of this lack of privacy was
               to engineer a more communal spirit. But because the
               designers of the kibbutz did not realize that privacy is as
               important to people’s well-being as social connectedness,
               kibbutz members began to feel stifled over time, and withdrew
               from the public life of the kibbutz, including their participation
               in decision-making.
               Another vital lesson of the kibbutzim is that building utopian
               collectives must involve tireless struggle against contemporary
               authoritarian structures, or they will become part of those
               structures. The kibbutzim were founded on land seized by the
               Israeli state from Palestinians, against whom genocidal policies
               are still continuing today. The racism of the European founders
83 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               allowed them to ignore the abuse inflicted on the previous
               inhabitants of what they saw as a promised land, much the
               same way religious pilgrims in North America plundered the
               indigenous to construct their new society. The Israeli state
               gained incredibly from the fact that nearly all their potential
               dissidents — including socialists and veterans of armed
               struggle against Nazism and colonialism — voluntarily
               sequestered themselves in escapist communes that
               contributed to the capitalist economy. If these utopians had
               used the kibbutz as a base to struggle against capitalism and
               colonialism in solidarity with the Palestinians while constructing
               the foundations of a communal society, history in the Middle
               East might have turned out differently.
               Who will settle disputes?
               Anarchist methods of settling disputes open up a much
               healthier range of options than are available within a capitalist
               and statist system. Stateless societies throughout history have
               come up with numerous methods for settling disputes that
               seek compromise, allow for reconciliation, and keep power in
               the hands of the disputants and their community.
               The Nubians are a society of sedentary farmers in Egypt. They
               were traditionally stateless, and even according to recent
               accounts they consider it highly immoral to bring in the
               government to solve disputes. In contrast to the individualistic
               and legalistic ways of viewing disputes in authoritarian
               societies, the norm in Nubian culture is to consider one
               person’s problem everyone’s problem; when there is a dispute,
               strangers, friends, relatives, or other third parties intercede to
84 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               help the disputants find a mutually satisfying resolution.
               According to anthropologist Robert Fernea, Nubian culture
               regards quarrels between members of a kinship group as
               dangerous, in that they threaten the supportive social net on
               which all depend.
               This culture of cooperation and mutual responsibility is backed
               up by economic and social structures as well. Among the
               Nubians, property such as waterwheels, cattle, and palm trees
               have traditionally been communally owned, so in the daily
               work of feeding themselves people are immersed in
               cooperative social bonds that teach solidarity and the
               importance of getting along. Additionally, the kinship groups
               which comprise Nubian society, called “nogs,” are interwoven,
               not atomized like the isolated nuclear families of Western
               society: “This means that a person’s nogs are overlapping and
               involve diverse, dispersed membership. This feature is very
               important, for the Nubian community does not easily split into
               opposing factions.”[28] Most disputes are resolved quickly by a
               third relative. Larger disputes that embroil more people are
               solved in a family council with all the members of the nog,
               including women and children. The council is presided over by
               an elder kinsman, but the goal is to reach consensus and get
               the disputants to reconcile.
               The Hopi of southwestern North America used to be more
               warlike than in recent times. Factions still exist within Hopi
               villages, but they overcome conflict through cooperation in
               rituals, and they use shame and leveling mechanisms with
               people who are boastful or domineering. When disputes get
               out of hand, they use ritual clown skits at kachina dances to
85 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               mock the people involved. The Hopi offer an example of a
               society that gave up feuding and developed rituals to cultivate
               a more peaceful disposition.[29] The image of clowns and
               dances being used to solve disputes gives a tantalizing glimpse
               of humor and art as means for responding to common
               problems. There is a world of possibilities more interesting than
               general assemblies or mediation processes! Artistic conflict
               resolution encourages new ways of looking at problems, and
               subverts the possibility of permanent mediators or meeting
               facilitators gaining power by monopolizing the role of arbiter.
               Meeting in the streets
               Politicians and technocrats are clearly not capable of making
               responsible decisions for millions of people. They have learned
               enough from their many past mistakes that governments
               usually do not collapse under the weight of their own
               incompetence, but they have hardly created the best of all
               possible worlds. If they can manage to keep their absurd
               bureaucracies functioning, it’s not a wild jump of logic to think
               that we could organize our communities at least as well
               ourselves. The hypothesis of authoritarian society, that a large,
               diverse population needs specialized institutions to control
               decision-making, can be disproven many times over. The MST
               of Brazil shows that in a huge group of people, most decision-
               making power can reside at the grassroots level, with
               individual communities that take care of their own needs. The
               people of Oaxaca showed that an entire modern society can
               organize itself and coordinate resistance against constant
               assault by police and paramilitaries, with open assemblies.

               Anarchist infoshops and Israeli kibbutzim show that groups
               running complex operations that have to pay rent or meet
               production schedules while accomplishing social and cultural
               objectives capitalist enterprises never even attempt, can make
               decisions in a timely fashion and uphold these decisions
               without a class of enforcers. The Nuer show that horizontal
               decision-making can thrive for generations, even after
               colonization, and that with a shared culture of restorative
               conflict resolution there is no need for a specialized institution
               to solve disputes.
               For most of human history, our societies have been egalitarian
               and self-organizing, and we have not lost the capability to
               make and uphold the decisions that affect our lives, or to
               imagine new and better forms of organizing. Whenever people
               overcome alienation and come together with their neighbors,
               they develop exciting new ways of coordinating and making
               decisions. Once they liberated themselves from landlords,
               priests, and mayors, the uneducated and downtrodden
               peasants of Aragon proved themselves equal to the task of
               making not just a whole new world, but hundreds of them.
               New decision-making methods are usually influenced by pre-
               existing institutions and cultural values. When people
               recapture decision-making authority over some aspect of their
               lives, they should ask themselves what reference points and
               precedents already exist in their culture, and what ingrained
               disadvantages they will have to overcome. For example, there
               might be a tradition of town meetings that can be expanded
               from symbolic window dressing to real self-organization; on the
               other hand, people might be starting from a macho culture, in
87 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               which case they will have to learn how to listen, compromise,
               and ask questions. Alternately, if a group develops a decision-
               making method that is totally original and alien to their society,
               they may face challenges including newcomers and explaining
               their method to outsiders — this is sometimes a weakness of
               infoshops in the US, which employ a well thought-out, idealized
               form of decision-making complex enough to seem foreign even
               to many participants.
               An anti-authoritarian group may use some form of consensus,
               or of majoritarian voting. Large groups may find voting quicker
               and more efficient, but it can also silence a minority. Perhaps
               the most important part of the process is the discussion that
               happens before the decision; voting does not diminish the
               importance of methods that allow everyone to communicate
               and arrive at good compromises. Many autonomous villages in
               Oaxaca ultimately used voting to make decisions, and they
               provided an inspiring example of self-organization to radicals
               who otherwise abhor voting. Though a group’s structure
               doubtlessly influences its culture and outcomes, the formality
               of voting may be an acceptable expedient if all the discussion
               that takes place before it is steeped in a spirit of solidarity and
               cooperation.
               In a self-organizing society, not everyone will participate
               equally in meetings or other formal spaces. A decision-making
               body can eventually become dominated by certain people, and
               the assembly itself can become a bureaucratic institution with
               coercive powers. For this reason, it may be necessary to
               develop decentralized and overlapping forms of organization
               and decision-making, and to preserve space for spontaneous
88 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               organization to occur outside of all pre-existing structures. If
               there is only one structure in which all decisions are made, an
               internal culture can develop that is not inclusive to everyone in
               the society; then experienced insiders can rise to positions of
               leadership, and human activity external to the structure can be
               delegitimized. Soon enough, you have a government. The
               kibbutzim and APPO both evidence the creeping development
               of bureaucracy and specialization.
               But if there are multiple decision-making structures for
               different spheres of life, and if they can arise or fade out
               according to need, none of them can monopolize authority. In
               this regard, power needs to stay in the streets, in the homes, in
               the hands of the people who exercise it, in the meeting of
               people who come together to solve problems.

               3. Economy

               Anarchism is opposed to capitalism and to private ownership of
               the tools, infrastructure, and resources everyone requires for
               sustenance. Anarchist economic models range from hunter-
               gatherer communities and agricultural communes to industrial
               complexes in which planning is carried out by syndicates and
               distribution is arranged through quotas or a limited form of
               currency. All these models are based on the principles of
               working together to fulfill common needs and rejecting
               hierarchy of all kinds — including bosses, management, and
               the division of society into classes such as wealthy and poor or
               owners and laborers.
               Without wages, what is the incentive to work?
               Some worry that if we abolish capitalism and wage-labor, no
               one will work anymore. It is true that work as it exists now for
               most people would cease to exist; but work that is socially
               useful offers a number of incentives besides the paycheck. If
               anything, getting paid to do something makes it less enjoyable.
               The alienation of labor that is a part of capitalism destroys
               natural incentives to work such as the pleasure of acting freely
               and the satisfaction of a job well done. When work puts us in a
               position of inferiority — to the boss who oversees us and the
               wealthy people who own our workplace — and we do not have
               decision-making power in our job but must mindlessly follow

               orders, it can become excruciatingly odious and mind-
               numbing. We also lose our natural incentive to work when we
               are not doing something that is useful for our communities. Of
               the few workers today who are lucky enough to actually
               produce something they can see, they are nearly all making
               something that is profitable to their employers but completely
               meaningless to them personally. The Fordist or assembly line
               structuring of labor turns people into machines. Instead of
               cultivating skills workers can be proud of, it proves more cost-
               effective to give each person a single repetitive task and put
               him or her on an assembly line. No wonder so many workers
               sabotage or steal from their workplaces, or show up with an
               automatic weapon and “go postal.”
               The idea that without wages people would stop working is
               baseless. In the broad timeline of human history, wages are a
               fairly recent invention yet societies that have existed without
               currency or wages did not starve to death just because no one
               paid the workers. With the abolition of wage labor, only the
               kind of work that no one can justify to himself as useful would
               disappear; all the time and resources put into making all the
               useless crap that our society is drowning in would be saved.
               Think of how much of our resources and labor go into
               advertising, mass mailings, throwaway packaging, cheap toys,
               disposable goods — things no one takes pride in making,
               designed to fall apart in a short time so you have to buy the
               next version.
               Indigenous societies with less division of labor had no problem
               doing without wages, because the primary economic activities
               — producing food, housing, clothing, tools — are all easily

               connected to common needs. In such circumstances, work is a
               necessary social activity and an apparent obligation from
               every member of the community who is able. And because it
               takes place in a flexible, personal setting, work can be adapted
               to every individual’s capabilities, and there is nothing to keep
               people from transforming work into play. Fixing up your house,
               hunting, wandering in the woods identifying plants and
               animals, knitting, cooking a feast — aren’t these the things
               that bored middle-class people do in their leisure hours to
               forget their loathsome jobs for a moment?
               Anti-capitalist societies with greater economic specialization
               have developed a variety of methods for providing incentives
               and distributing the products of workers’ labor. The
               aforementioned Israeli kibbutzim offer one example of
               incentives to work in the absence of wages. One book
               documenting life and work in a kibbutz identifies four major
               motivations to work within the cooperative labor teams, which
               lacked individual competition and profit motive: group
               productivity affects the whole community’s standard of living,
               so there is group pressure to work hard; members work where
               they choose, and gain satisfaction from their work; people
               develop a competitive pride if their branch of work does better
               than other branches; people gain prestige from work because
               labor is a cultural value.[30] As described above, the ultimate
               decline of the kibbutz experiment stemmed largely from the
               fact that the kibbutzim were socialist enterprises competing
               within a capitalist economy, and thus subsumed to the logic of
               competition rather than the logic of mutual aid. A similarly
               organized commune in a world without capitalism would not

               face these same problems. In any case, unwillingness to work
               due to lack of wages was not one of the problems the
               kibbutzim faced.
               Many anarchists suggest that the germs of capitalism are
               contained in the mentality of production itself. Whether a given
               type of economy can survive, much less grow, within
               capitalism is a poor measure of its liberatory potential. But
               anarchists propose and debate many different forms of
               economy, some of which can only be practiced to a limited
               extent because they are wholly illegal within today’s world. In
               the European squatter’s movement, some cities have had or
               continue to have so many squatted social centers and houses
               that they constitute a shadow society. In Barcelona, for
               example, as recently as 2008 there were over forty occupied
               social centers and at least two hundred squatted houses. The
               collectives of people who inhabit these squats generally use
               consensus and group assemblies, and most are explicitly
               anarchist or intentionally anti-authoritarian. To a large extent,
               work and exchange have been abolished from these people’s
               lives, whose networks run into the thousands. Many do not
               have waged jobs, or they work only seasonally or sporadically,
               as they do not need to pay rent. For example the author of this
               book, who has lived within this network for two years, has
               survived for much of that time on less than one euro a day.
               Moreover, the great amount of activity they carry out within
               the autonomous movement is completely unwaged. But they
               do not need wages: they work for themselves. They occupy
               abandoned buildings left to rot by speculators, as a protest
               against gentrification and as anti-capitalist direct action to
93 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               provide themselves with housing. Teaching themselves the
               skills they need along the way, they fix up their new houses,
               cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers,
               light, kitchens, and anything else they need. They often pirate
               electricity, water, and internet, and much of their food comes
               from dumpster-diving, stealing, and squatted gardens.
               In the total absence of wages or managers, they carry on a
               great deal of work, but at their own pace and logic. The logic is
               one of mutual aid. Besides fixing up their own houses, they
               also direct their energies towards working for their
               neighborhoods and enriching their communities. They provide
               for many of their collective needs besides housing. Some social
               centers host bicycle repair workshops, enabling people to
               repair or build their own bicycles, using old parts. Others offer
               carpentry workshops, self-defense and yoga workshops,
               natural healing workshops, libraries, gardens, communal
               meals, art and theater groups, language classes, alternative
               media and counterinformation, music shows, movies,
               computer labs where people can use the internet and learn
               email security or host their own websites, and solidarity events
               to deal with the inevitable repression. Nearly all of these
               services are provided absolutely free. There is no exchange —
               one group organizes to provide a service to everyone, and the
               entire social network benefits.
               With an astounding amount of initiative in such a passive
               society, squatters regularly get the idea to organize a
               communal meal or a bicycle repair shop or a weekly movie
               showing, they talk with friends and friends of friends until they
               have enough people and resources to make their idea a reality,

               and then they spread the word or put up posters and hope as
               many people as possible will come and partake. To a capitalist
               mentality, they are avidly inviting people to rob them, but the
               squatters never stop to question activities that don’t put
               money in their pockets. It is evident that they have created a
               new form of wealth, and sharing what they make themselves
               clearly makes them richer.
               The surrounding neighborhoods also become richer, as the
               squatters take the initiative to create projects much quicker
               than the local government could. In the magazine of a
               neighborhood association in Barcelona, they praised a local
               squat for responding to a demand the government had been
               ignoring for years — building the neighborhood a library. A
               mainstream news magazine remarked: “the squatters do the
               work the District forgets about.”[31] In that same
               neighborhood, the squatters proved to be a powerful ally to a
               rent-paying neighbor who was being pressured out by the
               landlord. The squatters worked tirelessly with an association of
               old folks who were facing similar situations of chicanery and
               illegal eviction by landlords, and they stopped the eviction of
               their neighbor.
               In a trend that seems common to the total abolition of work,
               the social and the economic blend to become
               indistinguishable. Labor and services are not valorized or given
               a dollar value; they are social activities that are carried out
               individually or collectively as a part of daily life, without any
               need for accounting or management. The result is that in cities
               such as Barcelona, people can spend the majority of their time
               and meet the majority of their needs — from housing to
95 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               entertainment — within this squatters’ social network, without
               labor and almost without money. Of course not everything can
               be stolen (not yet), and the squatters are still compelled to sell
               their labor to pay for things like medical care and court costs.
               But for many people the exceptional nature of those things
               that cannot be self-produced, scavenged, or stolen, the
               outrage of having to sell valuable moments of one’s life to work
               for some corporation, can have the effect of increasing the
               level of conflict with capitalism.
               One potential pitfall of any movement powerful enough to
               create an alternative to capitalism is that its participants can
               easily become complacent living in their bubble of autonomy
               and lose the will to fight for the total abolition of capitalism.
               Squatting itself can easily become a ritual, and in Barcelona
               the movement as a whole has not applied the same creativity
               to resistance and attack as it has to many of the practical
               aspects of fixing up houses and finding subsistence with little
               or no money. The self-sustaining nature of the network of
               squatters, the immediate presence of freedom, initiative,
               pleasure, independence, and community in their lives have by
               no means destroyed capitalism, but they do reveal it to be a
               walking corpse, with nothing but the police, in the end,
               preventing it for going extinct and being replaced by far
               superior forms of living.
               Don’t people need bosses and experts?
               How can anarchists organize themselves in the workplace and
               coordinate production and distribution across an entire
               economy without bosses and managers? In fact, a great deal of
96 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               resources are lost through competition and middlemen.
               Ultimately it is the workers who carry out all the production and
               distribution, and they know how to coordinate their own work
               in the absence of bosses.
               In and around Turin, Italy, 500,000 workers participated in a
               factory takeover movement after World War I. Communists,
               anarchists, and other workers who were pissed off at their
               exploitation launched wildcat strikes, many of them eventually
               gaining control of their factories and setting up Factory
               Councils to coordinate their activities. They were able to run
               the factories themselves, without bosses. Eventually, the
               Councils were legalized and legislated out of existence — in
               part co-opted and absorbed into the labor unions, whose
               institutional existence was threatened by autonomous
               workers’ power no less than the owners were.
               In December 2001, a long-brewing economic crisis in Argentina
               matured into a run on the banks which precipitated a major
               popular rebellion. Argentina had been the poster child of
               neoliberal institutions such as the International Monetary Fund,
               but the policies that enriched foreign investors and gave
               middle class Argentinians a First World lifestyle created an
               acute poverty for much of the country. Anti-capitalist
               resistance was already widely developed among the
               unemployed, and after the middle class lost all its savings,
               millions of people took to the streets, rejecting all the false
               solutions and excuses offered by politicians, economists, and
               the media, declaring instead: “Que se vayan todos! ” They all
               must go! Dozens were killed by police, but people fought back,
               shaking off the terror left over from the military dictatorship
97 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               that ruled Argentina in the ’70s and ’80s.
               Hundreds of factories abandoned by their owners were
               occupied by workers, who resumed production so they could
               continue to feed their families. The more radical of these
               worker-occupied factories equalized wages and shared
               managerial duties among all workers. They made decisions in
               open meetings, and some workers taught themselves tasks
               such as accounting. To ensure that a new managerial class did
               not arise, some factories rotated managerial tasks, or required
               that people in managerial roles still work on the factory floor
               and perform the accounting, marketing, and other tasks after
               hours. As of this writing, several of these occupied workplaces
               have been able to expand their workforce and hire additional
               workers from Argentina’s huge unemployed population. In
               some cases, occupied factories trade needed supplies and
               products with one another, creating a shadow economy in a
               spirit of solidarity.
               One of the most famous, the Zanon ceramics factory located in
               southern Argentina, was shut down by the owner in 2001 and
               occupied by its workers the following January. They began
               running the factory with an open assembly and commissions
               made up of workers to manage Sales, Administration,
               Planning, Security, Hygiene and Sanitation, Purchasing,
               Production, Diffusion, and Press. Following the occupation, they
               rehired workers who had been fired before the closing. As of
               2004, they numbered 270 workers and produced at 50% of the
               production rate before the factory was closed. Bringing doctors
               and psychologists on site, they provided themselves with
               healthcare. The workers found that they could pay their
98 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               workforce with just two days of production, so they lowered
               prices 60% and organized a network of young vendors, many
               previously unemployed, to market the ceramic tiles throughout
               the city. In addition to producing tiles, the Zanon factory
               involves itself with social movements, donating money to
               hospitals and schools, selling tiles at cost to poor people,
               hosting films, performances, and art shows, and carrying out
               solidarity actions with other struggles. They also support the
               Mapuche struggle for autonomy; and when their clay supplier
               stopped doing business with them for political reasons, the
               Mapuche began supplying clay. As of April 2003, the factory
               had faced four attempted evictions by the police, with the
               support of the trade unions. All were forcefully resisted by the
               workers, assisted by neighbors, piqueteros, and others.
               In July 2001, the workers of the El Tigre supermarket in Rosario,
               Argentina, occupied their workplace. The owner had shut it
               down two months earlier and declared bankruptcy, still owing
               his employees months in wages. After fruitless protesting, the
               workers opened El Tigre and began running it themselves
               through an assembly that allowed all workers a part in
               decision-making. In a spirit of solidarity they lowered prices
               and began selling fruit and vegetables from a local farmers’
               cooperative and products made in other occupied factories.
               They also used part of their space to open a cultural center for
               the neighborhood, housing political talks, student groups,
               theater and yoga workshops, puppet shows, a café, and a
               library. In 2003, El Tigre’s cultural center held the national
               meeting of reclaimed businesses, attended by 1,500 people.
               Maria, one collective member, said of her experience: “Three

               years ago, if someone had told me we’d be able to run this
               place I’d never have believed them... I believed we needed
               bosses to tell us what to do, now I realize that together we can
               do it better than them.” [32]
               In Euskal Herria, the Basque country occupied by the states of
               Spain and France, a large complex of cooperative, worker-
               owned businesses has arisen, centered around the small city of
               Mondragón. Starting with 23 workers in one cooperative in
               1956, the Mondragón cooperatives included 19,500 workers in
               over 100 cooperatives by 1986, surviving despite the heavy
               recession in Spain at the time and with a survival rate many
               times better than the average for capitalist firms.
               Mondragón has had a rich experience over many years in
               manufacturing products as varied as furniture, kitchen
               equipment, machine tools, and electronic components and in
               printing, shipbuilding, and metal smelting. Mondragón has
               created hybrid cooperatives composed of both consumers and
               workers and of farmers and workers. The complex has
               developed its own social security cooperative and a
               cooperative bank that is growing more rapidly than any other
               bank in the Basque provinces. [33]
               The highest authority in the Mondragón cooperatives is the
               general assembly, with each worker-member getting one vote;
               the specific management of the cooperative is carried out by
               an elected governing council, which is advised by a
               management council and a social council.
               There are also many criticisms of the Mondragón complex. To
               anarchists it comes as no surprise that a democratic structure
100 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               can house an elite group, and according to Mondragón’s critics
               this is exactly what has happened as the cooperative complex
               seeks — and achieves — success within a capitalist economy.
               Although their accomplishment is impressive and gives lie to
               the assumption that large industries must be organized
               hierarchically, the compulsion to be profitable and competitive
               has pushed the cooperatives to manage their own exploitation.
               For example, after decades of sticking by their egalitarian
               founding principles regarding pay scales, eventually the
               Mondragón cooperatives decided to increase the salaries of
               the managerial and technical experts relative to the manual
               workers. Their reason was that they had a hard time retaining
               people who could receive much higher pay for their skills in a
               corporation. This problem indicates a need to mix manual and
               intellectual tasks to avoid the professionalization of expertise
               (i.e. creating expertise as a quality restricted to an elite few);
               and to build an economy in which people are producing not for
               profit but for other members of the network, so money loses its
               importance and people work out of a sense of community and
               solidarity.
               People in today’s high-tech societies are trained to believe that
               examples from the past or from the “under-developed” world
               have no value for our situation today. Many people who
               consider themselves educated sociologists and economists
               dismiss the Mondragón example by classifying Basque culture
               as exceptional. But there are other examples of the efficacy of
               egalitarian workplaces, even in the heart of capitalism.
               Gore Associates, based in Delaware, is the billion dollar high-
               tech firm that produces waterproof Gore-Tex fabric, special
101 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               insulation for computer cables, and parts for the medical,
               automobile, and semiconductor industries. Salaries are
               determined collectively, no one has titles, there is no formal
               management structure, and differentiation between
               employees is minimized. By all capitalist standards of
               performance — employee turnover, profitability, product
               reputation, lists of best companies to work for — Gore is a
               success.
               An important factor in their success is adherence to what some
               academics call the Rule of 150. Based on the observation that
               hunter-gatherer groups around the world — as well as
               successful communities and intentional communes — seem to
               keep their size between 100 and 150 people, the theory is that
               the human brain is best equipped to navigate webs of personal
               relationships of up to 150. Maintaining intimate relationships,
               remembering names and social status and established codes
               of conduct and communication — all this takes up mental
               space; just as other primates tend to live in groups up to a
               certain size, human beings are probably best suited to keep up
               with a certain number of companions. All Gore factories keep
               their size below 150 employees, so each plant can be entirely
               self-managing, not just on the factory floor but also including
               the people responsible for marketing, research, and other
               tasks.[34]
               Skeptics often dismiss the anarchistic example of small-scale
               “primitive” societies by arguing that it’s no longer possible to
               organize on such a small scale, given the huge population. But
               there is nothing to stop a large society for organizing itself in
               many smaller units. Small-scale organization is eminently
102 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               possible. Even within a high-tech industry, Gore factories can
               coordinate with one another and with suppliers and consumers
               while maintaining their small scale organizational structure.
               Just as each unit is capable of organizing its internal relations,
               each is capable of organizing its external relations.
               Of course, the example of a factory producing successfully
               within the capitalist system leaves much to be desired. Most
               anarchists would sooner see all factories burned to the ground
               than anti-authoritarian forms of organization used to sugarcoat
               capitalism. But this example should at least demonstrate that
               even within a large and complex society, self-organization
               works.
               The example of Gore is still problematic because the workers
               do not own the factory, and also because formal management
               could be reimposed at any time by the company owners.
               Anarchists theorize that the problems of capitalism do not exist
               only in the relationship between workers and owners, but also
               between workers and managers, and that as long as the
               manager-worker relationship persists, capitalism can
               reemerge. This theory is certainly born out by the Mondragón
               example, where over time managers gained more pay and
               power and renewed the unequal, profit-focused dynamics
               typical of capitalism. Taking this into account, several
               anarchists have designed an outline for a “participatory
               economy,” or parecon, though no one has yet had the
               opportunity to set up such an economy on any considerable
               scale. Among other things, parecon emphasizes the
               importance of empowering all workers by mixing tasks that are
               creative and rote, mental and manual, thus creating “balanced
103 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               job complexes” that will prevent the emergence of a
               managerial class.[35]
               During the rebellion in Oaxaca in 2006, people without prior
               experience organized themselves to run occupied radio and
               television stations. They were motivated by the social need for
               free means of communication. The March of Pots and Pans, the
               legendary women’s march on August 1, 2006, culminated with
               thousands of women spontaneously taking over the state-run
               television station. Inspired by the sudden sense of power they
               had won by rebelling against a traditionally patriarchal society,
               they took over Channel 9, which continuously slandered the
               social movements while claiming to be the channel of the
               people. At first, they made the engineers help them run the
               station, but soon they were learning how to do it themselves.
               One woman recounted:
               I went daily to the channel to stand guard and help out. The
               women were organized into different commissions: food,
               hygiene, production, and security. One thing I liked is that there
               were no individual leaders. For each task there was a group of
               several women in charge. We learned everything from the
               beginning. I remember somebody asking who could use a
               computer. Then many of the younger girls stepped forward,
               saying, “me, me, I can!” In Radio Universidad, they announced
               that we needed people with technical skills, and more people
               came to help. In the beginning, they were filming headless
               people, you know. But the experience at Channel 9 showed us
               that where there’s a will, there’s a way. Things got done, and
               they got done well.
               In the short time [three weeks] that Channel 9 was running,
104 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               until Governor Ulises commanded that the antennas be
               destroyed, we managed to spread a lot of information. Movies
               and documentaries were shown that you could never have
               imagined seeing on TV otherwise. About different social
               movements, about the student massacre in Tlatelolco in
               Mexico City in 1968, the massacres in Aguas Blancas in
               Guerrero and Acteal in Chiapas, about guerrilla movements in
               Cuba and El Salvador. At this time, Channel 9 wasn’t just the
               women’s channel anymore. It was the channel of all the
               people. The ones participating made their own programs as
               well. There was a youth program and a program where people
               from the indigenous communities participated. There was a
               program of denouncements, where anyone could come and
               denounce how the government had treated them. A lot of
               people from the different neighborhoods and communities
               wanted to participate, there was hardly enough airtime for all
               of them.[36]
               After the occupied television station was taken off the air, the
               movement responded by occupying all eleven commercial
               radio stations in Oaxaca. The homogeneity of commercial
               radio was replaced by myriad voices — a radio station for
               university students, one for the women’s groups, one radio
               station occupied by the anarchists from a punk squat — and
               there were more indigenous voices on the radio than ever
               before. Within a short time, people in the movement decided
               to return most of the radio stations to their self-styled owners,
               but kept control of two of them. Their goal was not to suppress
               the voices that opposed them, as artificial as commercial
               voices are, but to win themselves the means to communicate.
105 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               The remaining radio stations operated successfully for months,
               until government repression shut them down. One university
               student involved in taking over, running, and defending the
               radio stations said:
               After the takeover, I read an article that said that the
               intellectual and material authors of the takeovers of the radios
               weren’t Oaxacan, that they came from somewhere else, and
               that they received very specialized support. It said that it
               would have been impossible for anyone without previous
               training to operate the radios in such a short amount of time,
               because the equipment is too sophisticated for just anyone to
               use. They were wrong.[37]
               Who will take out the trash?
               If everyone is free to work as they choose, who will take out the
               trash or perform other undesirable jobs? Fortunately, in a
               localized, anti-capitalist economy, we could not externalize, or
               hide, the costs of our lifestyle by paying someone else to clean
               up after us. We would have to pay for the consequences of all
               our own actions — rather than paying China to take our toxic
               waste, for example. If a necessary service like garbage
               disposal were being neglected, the community would quickly
               notice and have to decide how to handle the problem. People
               could agree to reward such work with small perks — nothing
               that translates into power or authority, but something like
               getting to be first in line when exotic goods come into town,
               receiving a massage or a cake or simply the recognition and
               gratitude for being a stand-up member of the community.
               Ultimately, in a cooperative society, having a good reputation
106 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               and being seen by your peers as responsible are more
               compelling than any material incentives.
               Or the community could decide that everyone should involve
               themselves in these tasks on a rotating basis. An activity like
               garbage collection does not have to define anyone’s “career”
               in an anti-capitalist economy. Necessary tasks no one wants to
               perform should be shared by everyone. So instead of a few
               people having to sort through garbage their entire lives,
               everyone who was physically able would have to do it for just a
               couple hours each month.
               The Christiania “free state” is a quarter in Copenhagen,
               Denmark, that has been squatted since 1971. Its 850
               inhabitants are autonomous within their 85 acres. They have
               been taking out their own trash for over thirty years. The fact
               that they receive about one million visitors a year makes their
               achievement all the more impressive. The streets, buildings,
               restaurants, public toilets, and public showers are all
               reasonably clean — especially for hippies! The body of water
               that runs through Christiania is not the cleanest, but
               considering that Christiania is tree-covered and automobile
               free one suspects most of the pollution comes from the
               surrounding city that shares the waterway.
               Residents have built dozens of the houses now standing in
               Christiania using innovative eco-designs. They also use:
               solar power, wind power, composting and a whole host of
               other eco-friendly innovations. A method of filtering sewage
               through reed beds, which means water coming out of
               Christiania is as clean as that coming out from the rest of

               Copenhagen’s treatment plants, has helped the commune be
               shortlisted for a pan-Scandinavian award for ecological living.
               [38]
               Different people interviewed had different conceptions of how
               Christiania was kept clean, suggesting a sort of dual system. A
               newcomer said that you cleaned up after yourself, and when
               you felt like doing some extra picking up, you did. An old-time
               resident who was more involved in decision-making explained
               there was a garbage committee, answerable to the “Common
               Meeting,” responsible for the bottom-line of keeping
               Christiania clean, though clearly voluntary assistance and
               cleanliness by all the residents was the first line of defense.
               Who will take care of the elderly and disabled?
               Only in a society with what is euphemistically termed a “highly
               competitive market” are elderly people and disabled people so
               marginalized. In order to increase profit margins, employers
               avoid hiring people with disabilities and force older workers
               into early retirement. When workers are compelled to move
               frequently in search of jobs, in a culture in which the rite of
               passage to adulthood is moving into your own house, parents
               are left alone as they age. Most eventually move into whatever
               kind of retirement facility they can afford; many die neglected,
               alone, and indignant, perhaps with bed sores and diapers that
               have not been changed in two days. In an anarchist, anti-
               capitalist world, the social fabric would not be so coarse.
               In the plethora of experiments that arose in Argentina in
               response to the crisis of 2001, the economics of solidarity and
108 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               care for all members of society flourished. The economic
               collapse in Argentina did not lead to the dog-eat-dog scenario
               that capitalists fear. Rather, the result was an explosion of
               solidarity, and the elderly and disabled have not been left out
               of this web of mutual aid. In participating in the neighborhood
               assemblies, elderly and disabled people in Argentina got a
               chance to secure their own needs and represent themselves in
               the decisions that would affect their lives. At some assemblies,
               participants suggested that those who own their own houses
               withhold their property tax and instead give that money to the
               local hospital or other care facilities. In parts of Argentina with
               severe unemployment, movements of unemployed workers
               have effectively taken over and are building new economies. In
               General Mosconi, an oil town in the north, unemployment is
               above 40%, and the area is largely autonomous. The
               movement has organized over 300 projects to see to people’s
               needs, including those of the elderly and disabled.
               Even in the absence of stored wealth or fixed infrastructure,
               stateless hunter-gatherer societies generally take care of all
               the members of their community regardless of whether they
               are economically productive. In fact, grandparents —
               genetically useless from a Darwinist point of view since they
               are past the age of reproduction[39] — are a defining
               characteristic of humankind going back millions of years, and
               the fossil record from the beginning of our species shows that
               the elderly were cared for. Modern hunter-gatherers
               demonstrate not only material care for the elderly, but also
               something that is invisible in the fossil record: respect. The
               Mbuti, for example, recognize five age groups — infants,

               children, youth, adults, and elders — and of these, only the
               adults carry out significant economic production in the form of
               gathering and hunting or collecting raw materials like wood;
               yet social wealth is shared by all regardless of their
               productivity. It would be unthinkable to let the elderly or
               disabled starve simply because they do not work. Likewise, the
               Mbuti include all members of their society in making decisions
               and participating in political and social life, and the elderly play
               a special role in conflict resolution and peacemaking.
               How will people get healthcare?
               Capitalists and bureaucrats see healthcare as an industry — a
               way to extort money from people in need — and also as a way
               to appease the population and prevent rebellion. It’s no
               surprise that the quality of the healthcare often suffers. In the
               richest country in the world, millions have no access to
               healthcare, including this author, and every year hundreds of
               thousands of people die from preventable or treatable causes.
               Since poisonous working and living conditions and lack of
               healthcare have always been major grievances within
               capitalism, providing healthcare is generally a chief goal of
               anti-capitalist revolutionaries. For example, unemployed
               piqueteros and neighborhood assemblies in Argentina
               commonly set up clinics or take over and fund existing
               hospitals left defunct by the state.
               During the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona’s Medical Syndicate,
               organized largely by anarchists, managed 18 hospitals (6 of
               which it had created), 17 sanatoria, 22 clinics, 6 psychiatric

               establishments, 3 nurseries, and one maternity hospital.
               Outpatient departments were set up in all the principal
               localities in Catalunya. Upon receiving a request, the Syndicate
               sent doctors to places in need. The doctor would have to give
               good reason for refusing the post, “for it was considered that
               medicine was at the service of the community, and not the
               other way round.”[40] Funds for outpatient clinics came from
               contributions from local municipalities. The anarchist Health
               Workers’ Union included 8,000 health workers, 1,020 of them
               doctors, and also 3,206 nurses, 133 dentists, 330 midwives,
               and 153 herbalists. The Union operated 36 health centers
               distributed throughout Catalunya to provide healthcare to
               everyone in the entire region. There was a central syndicate in
               each of nine zones, and in Barcelona a Control Committee
               composed of one delegate from each section met once a week
               to deal with common problems and implement a common
               plan. Every department was autonomous in its own sphere, but
               not isolated, as they supported one another. Beyond
               Catalunya, healthcare was provided for free in agrarian
               collectives throughout Aragon and the Levant.
               Even in the nascent anarchist movement in the US today,
               anarchists are taking steps to learn about and provide
               healthcare. In some communities anarchists are learning
               alternative medicine and providing it for their communities.
               And at major protests, given the likelihood of police violence,
               anarchists organize networks of volunteer medics who set up
               first aid stations and organize roving medics to provide first aid
               for thousands of demonstrators. These medics, often self-
               trained, treat injuries from pepper spray, tear gas, clubs,
111 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               tasers, rubber bullets, police horses, and more, as well as
               shock and trauma. The Boston Area Liberation Medic Squad
               (BALM Squad) is an example of a medic group that organizes
               on a permanent basis. Formed in 2001, they travel to major
               protests in other cities as well, and hold trainings for
               emergency first aid. They run a website, share information,
               and link to other initiatives, such as the Common Ground clinic
               described below. They are non-hierarchical and use consensus
               decision-making, as does the Bay Area Radical Health
               Collective, a similar group on the West Coast.
               Between protests, a number of radical feminist groups
               throughout the US and Canada have formed Women’s Health
               Collectives, to address the needs of women. Some of these
               collectives teach female anatomy in empowering, positive
               ways, showing women how to give themselves gynecological
               exams, how to experience menstruation comfortably, and how
               to practice safe methods of birth control. The patriarchal
               Western medical establishment is generally ignorant of
               women’s health to the point of being degrading and harmful.
               An anti-establishment, do-it-yourself approach allows
               marginalized people to subvert a neglectful system by
               organizing to meet their own needs.
               After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, activist street
               medics joined a former Black Panther in setting up the
               Common Ground clinic in one of the neediest neighborhoods.
               They were soon assisted by hundreds of anarchists and other
               volunteers from across the country, mostly without
               experience. Funded by donations and run by volunteers, the
               Common Ground clinic provided treatment to tens of
112 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               thousands of people. The failure of the government’s
               “Emergency Management” experts during the crisis is widely
               recognized. But Common Ground was so well organized it also
               out-performed the Red Cross, despite the latter having a great
               deal more experience and resources.[41] In the process, they
               popularized the concept of mutual aid and made plain the
               failure of the government. At the time of this writing Common
               Ground has 40 full-time organizers and is pursuing health in a
               much broader sense, also making community gardens and
               fighting for housing rights so that those evicted by the storm
               will not be prevented from coming home by the gentrification
               plans of the government. They have helped gut and rebuild
               many houses in the poorest neighborhoods, which authorities
               wanted to bulldoze in order to win more living space for rich
               white people.
               What about education?
               Education has long been a priority of anarchist and other
               revolutionary movements around the world. But even if people
               completely neglected the organization of education after the
               revolution, that would still be an improvement over the
               patriotic, degrading, manipulative, and mind-numbing forms of
               education sponsored by the nation-state. Like everyone else,
               children are capable of educating themselves, and are
               motivated to do so in the proper setting. But public schools
               rarely offer that setting, nor do they educate the students on
               topics of immediate usefulness, like surviving childhood,
               expressing emotions healthily, developing their unique
               creative potentials, taking charge of their own health or caring
113 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               for sick people, dealing with gender violence, domestic abuse,
               or alcoholism, standing up to bullies, communicating with
               parents, exploring their sexuality in a respectful way, finding a
               job and apartment or making do without money, or other skills
               young people need to live. In the few classes that teach useful
               hands-on skills — nearly always electives — students are
               “tracked.” Girls learn how to cook and sew in Home Ec, boys
               likely to go on to blue collar jobs learn wood-working in Shop. It
               is safe to say that most boys finish high school ignorant of how
               to cook or patch up their clothes, and most girls and future
               white collar workers graduate not knowing how to fix a toilet,
               mount an electrical installation, repair a bicycle or a car engine,
               plaster a wall, or work with wood. And in the computer and
               technology classes, the fact that the students often know more
               than the teachers is a clear indication that something is wrong
               with this form of education. Schools do not even teach kids the
               skills they need for the crappy jobs they will end up working.
               Most of this, people teach themselves, or learn among friends
               and peers — that is to say, the school of life is already
               anarchistic.
               The most important lessons consistently taught by schools
               under the state are to obey arbitrary authority, to accept the
               imposition of other people’s priorities on our lives, and to stop
               daydreaming. When children start school, they are self-guided,
               curious about the world they live in, and believe everything is
               possible. When they finish, they are cynical, self-absorbed, and
               used to dedicating forty hours of their week to an activity they
               never chose. They are also likely to be miseducated about a
               number of things, perhaps unaware that a majority of human
114 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               societies throughout history have been egalitarian and
               stateless, that the police have only recently become an
               important and supposedly necessary institution, that their
               government has a track record of torture, genocide, and
               repression, that their lifestyles are destroying the environment,
               that their food and water are poisoned, or that there is a history
               of resistance waiting to be uncovered in their very own town.
               This systematic miseducation is hardly surprising, given the
               history of public schools. Though public schools developed
               gradually from an array of precedents, the regime of Otto von
               Bismarck is widely credited with first establishing a national
               public school system. The purpose was to prepare youth for
               careers in the bureaucracy or military, discipline them, instill
               them with patriotism, and indoctrinate them in the culture and
               history of a German nation that had not previously existed. The
               school system was one of the modernizations that allowed a
               collection of bickering provinces, some of them practically
               feudal, to form a state that could threaten the rest of the
               continent — and large parts of Africa — within a generation.
               In response, a number of anarchist theorists set out to design
               non-hierarchical schools in which teachers would serve as
               aides helping the students learn and explore their chosen
               subjects. Some of these anarchist experiments in education in
               the US were called Modern Schools, on the model of Spanish
               anarchist Francisco Ferrer’s Escuela Moderna. These schools
               helped educate thousands of students, and played important
               roles in the anarchist and labor movements. In 1911, shortly
               after Ferrer’s execution in Spain, the first Modern School in the
               US was founded in New York City by Emma Goldman,
115 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Alexander Berkman, Voltairine de Cleyre, and other anarchists.
               A number of famous artists and writers helped teach there, and
               pupils included the artist Man Ray. It lasted for several
               decades, eventually moving out of New York City during a
               period of intense political repression, and became the center of
               a rural commune.
               More recently, anarchists and other activists in the US have
               organized “free schools.” Some of these are temporary, ad hoc
               classes, while some are fully organized schools. One, the
               Albany Free School, has existed for over 32 years in inner-city
               Albany. This anti-authoritarian school is committed to social
               justice as well as education — it offers sliding scale tuition and
               turns no one away for financial reasons. Most experimental
               schools are only accessible to the elite, but the student body of
               the Albany Free School is diverse, including many inner-city
               kids from poor families. The school has no curriculum or
               compulsory classes, operating according to the philosophy
               “‘Trust children and they will learn.’ Because when you entrust
               kids with their own so-called “education” — which is not a thing
               after all, but rather an ever-present action — they will learn
               continually, each in their own way and rhythm.” The Free
               School teaches children up to 8th grade, and has recently
               opened a high school, the Harriet Tubman Free School. The
               school organizes a small organic farm in the city which
               provides another important learning opportunity for students.
               Students also work with community service projects such as
               soup kitchens and daycare centers. Despite financial and other
               limitations, they have succeeded admirably.
               Our reputation with students that are struggling academically
116 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               and/or behaviorally, and whose needs the system has failed to
               meet, is such that an increasing number of kids are coming to
               us having previously been tagged with labels like ADHD and
               placed on Ritalin and other biopsychiatric medications. Their
               parents seek us out because they’re concerned about the side
               effects of the drugs and because they’ve heard that we work
               effectively with these children without drugs of any kind. Our
               active, flexible, individually structured environment renders
               the drugs entirely unnecessary.[42]
               The MST, the Landless Workers’ Movement in Brazil, has
               focused ardently on education in the settlements they have
               created on occupied land. Between 2002 and 2005, the MST
               claims to have taught over 50,000 landless workers how to
               read; 150,000 children are enrolled in 1,200 different schools
               they have built on their settlements, and they have also
               trained over one thousand educators. The MST schools are free
               from state control, so communities have the power to decide
               what their children are taught and can develop alternative
               methods of education as well as curricula free of the racist,
               patriotic, and capitalist values that are part and parcel of public
               education. The Brazilian government complains that children
               in the settlements are taught that genetically modified crops
               pose a risk to human health and the environment, which
               suggests that they get a much more relevant and accurate
               education than their peers in the state run schools. MST
               schools in the settlements focus on literacy and use the
               methods of Paulo Freire, who developed the “pedagogy of the
               oppressed.” In São Paulo the MST has built itself an
               autonomous university which trains farmers nominated by the
117 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               individual settlements. Rather than teaching, for example,
               agribusiness, as a capitalist university would, they teach family
               agriculture with a critique of the exploitative and
               environmentally destructive techniques prevalent in
               contemporary agriculture. For other technical courses the MST
               also helps people get educations in public universities, though
               they often win the collaboration of leftwing professors to offer
               more critical lessons of a higher caliber, even enabling them to
               design their own courses. They emphasize in all these forms of
               education that it is the responsibility of the students to use
               what they learn for their community and not for individual
               profit.
               The Movimiento Campesino de Santiago de Estero, MOCASE, is
               a group of farmers, many of them Quechua, with similarities
               and connections to the MST. Beginning as a group of farmers
               fighting for land in the face of expansion by forestry companies
               from the Global North, they now number 8,000 families in 58
               communities active in a broad range of struggles. Working
               together with the Universidad Transhumante, they set up a
               Farmers School that helps farmers learn the skills necessary for
               self-management. The students also learn to teach, so they
               can help train other farmers. The Universidad Transhumante is
               interesting in its own right. It is a popular education university,
               also inspired by Freire, that organized a year-long caravan to
               80 cities around Argentina, to present popular education
               workshops and learn about the problems people face.[43]
               Outside of the control of the state, education need not be a
               static, fixed thing. It can be a tool of empowerment, as people
               are taught how to teach, so they can pass on the lessons they
118 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               learn rather than being permanently dependent on a class of
               professional educators. It can be a tool of liberation, as people
               learn about authority and resistance, and study how to take
               control over their own lives. It can be a caravan, a circus, as
               people travel across a country and instead of bringing caged
               spectacles they bring new ideas and techniques. And it can be
               a tool for survival, as oppressed peoples learn about their
               histories and prepare for their futures.
               In 1969, Native American activists, organizing under the name
               “Indians of All Nations,” occupied the abandoned Alcatraz
               island, citing an ignored US law guaranteeing that indigenous
               people had a right to occupy any land the settler nation
               abandoned. For six months, the occupation numbered in the
               hundreds, and though most left because of a government
               blockade, the occupation ultimately lasted for 19 months,
               revitalizing indigenous culture and rejecting colonial control.
               During the early period, the Indian occupiers organized a
               school that taught indigenous history and culture from their
               own perspective, without the racist propaganda that filled the
               textbooks of the government’s schools. For the duration of
               their occupation, they used education as a means of cultural
               renewal, whereas it had previously been used against them to
               destroy their identity and conscript the survivors of the
               genocide into the civilization that had colonized them.
               What about technology?
               Many people worry that the complexity of modern day
               technology and the high level integration of infrastructure and
               production in present day society makes anarchy a dream of

               the past. In fact, this worry is not at all unfounded. It is not so
               much the complexity of the technology, however, that is odds
               with the creation of an anarchist society, so much as the fact
               that technology is not a neutral thing. As Uri Gordon expertly
               summed it up, the development of technology reflects the
               interests and needs of ruling members of society, and
               technology reshapes the physical world in a way that
               reinforces authority and discourages rebellion.[44] It is no
               coincidence that the nuclear arms and energy infrastructure
               creates a need for a centrally organized, high security military
               organization and disaster management agencies with
               emergency powers and the ability to suspend constitutional
               rights; that interstate highways allow the rapid domestic
               deployment of the military, encourage the transcontinental
               shipping of goods and private transportation via personal
               automobiles; that new factories demand unskilled, replaceable
               laborers who couldn’t possibly hold the job until retirement,
               assuming the boss even wanted to give retirement benefits,
               because within a few years occupational injuries from
               repetitive tasks or the unsafe pace of the production line will
               render them unable to continue.
               The subsidies and infrastructure provided by government tend
               to go towards inventions that increase state power, often to
               everyone else’s misfortune: jet fighters, surveillance systems,
               pyramid-building. Even the most benevolent forms of
               government support for invention, such as government
               subsidies to medical research, at best go to inventing
               treatments that are patented by corporations with no scruples
               about letting people die if they cannot afford them — just as

               they have no scruples over torturing and killing thousands of
               animals in the testing phase.
               The demands of freedom confront us with a much heavier
               choice than simply changing our decision-making structures.
               We will have to physically disassemble much of the world we
               live in and build it anew. Freedom, as well as the ecological
               balance of the planet and thus our very survival, is
               incompatible with nuclear energy, reliance on fossil fuels such
               as oil and coal, and a car culture which estranges public space
               and fosters a system of exchange where most goods are not
               produced locally.
               This transformation will require a great deal of inventiveness;
               thus the relevant question becomes, will an anarchist social
               movement and society be inventive enough to carry out this
               transformation? I think the answer is yes. After all, the most
               useful tools in human history were invented before
               government and capitalism came about.
               Capitalism’s so-called free market is said to motivate
               innovation, and market competition does contribute to the
               proliferation of profitable inventions, which are not necessarily
               helpful inventions. Capitalist competition dictates that every
               few years all the old gadgets become obsolete as new ones are
               invented, so people have to throw the old ones away and buy
               new ones — at great detriment to the environment. Because of
               this “planned obsolescence,” few inventions tend to be well
               made or fully thought-out in the first place, since they’re
               destined for the trash from the beginning.
               The doctrine of intellectual property prevents the spread of
121 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               useful technologies, allowing them to be controlled or withheld
               according to what is most profitable. Apologists for capitalism
               typically argue that intellectual property encourages the
               development of technology because it gives people the
               assurance, as incentive, that they can profit from their
               invention. What kind of cretin would invent something socially
               useful if he wouldn’t get exclusive credit for it and profit from
               it? But the technological mainstays of our world were
               developed by groups of people who let their inventions spread
               freely and didn’t take credit for them — everything from the
               hammer to stringed musical instruments to domesticated
               grains.
               In practice, the capitalist economy itself disproves the
               assumptions about intellectual property fomenting innovation.
               Just like any other kind of property, intellectual property usually
               does not belong to those who produce it: many inventions are
               made by wage slaves in laboratories who get no credit and no
               profit because their contracts stipulate that the corporation
               they work for receives ownership of the patents.
               The best people to develop useful innovations are the ones
               who need them, and they do not need government or
               capitalism to help them do this. Anarchists themselves have a
               rich history of inventing solutions to the problems they face.
               The anarchist bank robbers known as the Bonnot gang
               invented the getaway car. Makhno, the Ukrainian anarchist,
               was the first to deploy highly mobile machine guns — he
               mounted them on tatchankis, the horse-drawn carts used by
               the peasantry, with devastating effect against superior foes
               bogged down in traditional tactics. In revolutionary Spain, after
122 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               they had expropriated the big landlords, collectivized the land,
               and freed themselves from the need to produce a single export
               crop, farmers improved the health of the soil and increased
               their self-sufficiency by intercropping — specifically, growing
               shade-tolerant crops beneath the orange trees. The Peasant
               Federation of the Levant, in Spain, set up an agricultural
               university, and other agricultural collectives founded a center
               for the study of plant diseases and tree culture.
               In the highlands of New Guinea, millions of farmers live at high
               population densities in steep mountain valleys; their
               communities are stateless, consensus-based, and, until
               relatively recently, completely uncontacted by the West.
               Though they appeared as Stone Age primitives to racist
               Europeans, they have developed one of the most complex
               agricultural systems in the world. Their techniques are so
               precise and numerous that they take years to learn. Self-
               important Western scientists still do not know the reasons for
               many of these techniques, which they might dismiss as
               superstition were they not proven to work. For the past 7,000
               years, the highlanders have practiced a dynamic form of
               sustainable agriculture in response to impacts on their
               environment that might have caused less innovative societies
               to collapse. Their methods include complex forms of irrigation,
               soil retention, intercropping, and more. The highlanders have
               no chiefs, and make their decisions in long, community
               discussions. They have developed all their techniques without
               government or capitalism, via individual and group innovations
               communicated freely through a large, decentralized society.

               Many Westerners might scoff at the thought that people who
               do not use metal tools could provide a model of technological
               sophistication. These cynics, however, are simply benighted by
               Euro/American mythology and superstitions. Technology is not
               blinking lights and whirring gadgets. Technology is adaptation.
               By adapting a complex set of techniques that have allowed
               them to meet all their needs without destroying their
               environment over 7,000 years, the New Guinea farmers have
               accomplished something Western civilization has never even
               approached.
               Still, there are plenty of anarchistic examples for the
               impressed-by-blinking-lights crowd. Consider the recent
               proliferation of “Open Source” technology. Decentralized
               networks involving thousands of people working openly,
               voluntarily, and cooperatively have created some of the better
               forms of the complicated software on which the Information
               Age economy depends. The usual approach of major
               corporations is to keep the source, or code, for their software
               secret and patented, but Open Source software code is shared,
               so anyone can review it and improve it. As a result it is often
               much better, and generally easier to fix. Traditional patented
               software is more vulnerable to crashing and to viruses,
               because a smaller pool of brains are able to check for
               weaknesses, and very few specialists are available to fix
               problems. Those technical support people you call on the
               phone when your computer operating system crashes don’t
               get to see the code either, and beyond a little troubleshooting
               all they can do is direct you to a cumbersome “patch,” or
               advise you to erase your hard drive and reinstall the operating

               system. Users of Microsoft products, for example, are no doubt
               familiar with their frequent glitches, and privacy advocates
               also warn of spyware and the cooperation between technology
               corporations and the government. Says one anti-authoritarian
               geek involved in the creation of Open Source software: “The
               best advertisement for Linux is Microsoft.”
               Traditionally, much Open Source software has not been
               especially user-friendly, though generally this has to do with
               the fact that Open Source resides within, with all due respect, a
               geek subculture, and its typical users are highly computer
               literate. However, Open Source and participatory technology
               are steadily becoming accessible to an extent unprecedented
               by proprietary software. Wikipedia exemplifies this. Started
               recently, in 2001, on Open Source Linux software, Wikipedia is
               already the largest and most accessed encyclopedia in the
               world, with over 10 million articles in more than 250
               languages. Rather than being the exclusive domain of paid
               experts from a particular academic subculture, Wikipedia is
               written by everyone. Anyone can author an article or edit an
               existing article, and by allowing this openness and trust it
               provides a forum for instantaneous, multiple-peer review. The
               interests of the broader Wikipedia community of millions
               provide a self-regulating function, so vandalism — false editing
               and bogus articles — are quickly cleaned up, and facts lacking
               citations are challenged. Wikipedia articles avail themselves of
               a vastly greater body of knowledge than the small and
               generally elitist circle represented by academia. In a blind,
               peer-reviewed study it was judged to be as accurate as
               Encyclopedia Britannica.[46]
125 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Wikipedia is “self-organizing” and edited by an open body of
               peer-elected administrators.[47] There have been a few
               publicized cases of intentional sabotage, such as when the
               televised news comedy show The Colbert Report rewrote
               history in one Wikipedia article as a gag for their show; but the
               prank was quickly fixed, as most false information on the site
               tends to be. A more lingering problem is posed by corporations
               who use Wikipedia for public relations purposes, tasking paid
               personnel to maintain a clean image in the articles about
               them. However, contradicting interpretations of the facts can
               be registered in the same article, and Wikipedia contains much
               more information on corporate misdeeds than any traditional
               encyclopedia.
               How will exchange work?
               There are many different ways exchange could work in a
               stateless, anti-capitalist society, depending on the size,
               complexity, and preferences of the society. Many of these are
               far more effective than capitalism at ensuring a fair distribution
               of goods and keeping people from taking more than their fair
               share. Capitalism has created a greater inequality in access to
               resources than any other economic system in human history.
               But the principles of capitalism that economists have
               indoctrinated the public to accept as laws are not universal.
               Many societies have traditionally used gift economies, which
               can take many different forms. In societies with a modest
               amount of social stratification, the wealthier families maintain
               their status by giving gifts, holding lavish feasts, and spreading
               their wealth; in some cases, they risk the wrath of the others if
126 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               they are not generous enough. Other gift economies are barely
               or not at all stratified; the participants simply disown the
               concept of property and give and take social wealth freely. In
               his diary, Columbus remarked with amazement that the first
               indigenous people he encountered in the Caribbean had no
               sense of property, and gave willingly of all they had; indeed,
               they came bearing gifts to greet their strange visitors. In such a
               society, no one could be poor. Now, after hundreds of years of
               genocide and capitalist development, many parts of the
               Americas have some of the starkest wealth gaps in the world.
               In Argentina, poor people initiated a massive barter network
               that grew enormously after the economic collapse in 2001
               rendered capitalist forms of exchange unworkable. The barter
               system evolved from simple swap meets into a huge network
               involving an estimated three million members trading goods
               and services — everything from homemade crafts, food, and
               clothing to language lessons. Even doctors, manufacturers,
               and some railways participated. An estimated ten million
               people were supported by the barter network at its peak.
               The barter club facilitated exchange by developing a credit/
               currency system. As the network grew, and the capitalist crisis
               deepened, the network was beset by a number of problems,
               including people — often from outside the network — stealing
               or forging the currency. Several years later, after the economy
               stabilized under President Kirchner, the barter club shrank, but
               still retained a huge membership considering it was an
               alternative economy in the country that was once a model for
               neoliberal capitalism. Rather than giving up, remaining
               members developed a number of solutions to the problems
127 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               they had encountered, such as limiting membership to
               producers so the network is only used by those who contribute
               to it.
               Contemporary anarchists in the US and Europe are
               experimenting with other forms of distribution that transcend
               exchange. One popular anarchist project is the “free store” or
               “give-away shop.” Free stores serve as a collection point for
               donated or scavenged items that people no longer need,
               including clothes, food, furniture, books, music, even the
               occasional refrigerator, television, or car. Patrons are free to
               browse through the store and take whatever they need. Many
               accustomed to a capitalist economy who come into a free store
               are perplexed by how it could possibly work. Having been
               raised with a scarcity mentality, they assume that since people
               profit by taking stuff and do not profit by donating, a free store
               would quickly empty out. However this is rarely the case.
               Countless free stores operate sustainably, and most are
               overflowing with goods. From Harrisonburg, Virginia, to
               Barcelona, Catalunya, hundreds of free stores defy capitalist
               logic on a daily basis. The Weggeefwinkel, Giveaway Shop, in
               Groningen, Netherlands, has operated out of squatted
               buildings for over three years, opening twice a week to give
               away free clothes, books, furniture, and other items. Other free
               stores hold fundraisers if they have to pay rent, which would
               not be an issue in a completely anarchist society. Free stores
               are an important resource for impoverished people, who either
               are denied a job by the whims of the free market or who work a
               job, or two or three, and still can’t afford clothes for their kids.
               A more high-tech example of free exchange is the relatively

               mainstream and wildly successful Freecycle Network.
               Freecycle is a global network originally formed by an
               environmental nonprofit group to promote giving away items
               that might otherwise end up in the trash. As of this writing they
               have over 4 million members grouped into 4200 local
               chapters, spread through 50 countries. Using a website to post
               items wanted or items available to give away, people have
               circulated prodigious quantities of clothing, furniture, toys,
               artwork, tools, bicycles, cars, and countless other goods. One
               of the rules of Freecycle is that everything has to be free,
               neither bartered nor sold. Freecycle is not a centrally controlled
               organization; local chapters set themselves up based on the
               common model, and use the website on which the model is
               based.
               However, as it does come from a liberal nonprofit group
               without revolutionary aspirations nor any critique of capitalism
               and the state, we can expect Freecycle to have some
               problems. In fact, the organization accepts corporate
               sponsorship from a major recycling company and advertises
               on its website, and the chairperson has arguably slowed the
               spread of the Freecycle idea by attacking various member
               groups or copycat websites with lawsuits, or threats thereof,
               for trademark infringement; also by collaborating with the
               notoriously authoritarian Yahoo! Groups to shut down local
               chapters for not adhering to organizational rules concerning
               logo and language. Naturally, in an anarchist society there
               would be no lawsuits for trademark infringement and one
               chairperson would not be able to tyrannize a network that was
               maintained by millions of people. In the meantime, Freecycle

               demonstrates that gift economies can function even within
               jaded, individualistic Western societies, and can take new
               forms with the help of the internet.
               What about people who don’t want to give up a
               consumerist lifestyle?
               Though an anti-capitalist revolution would create new social
               relationships and values, as well as free people’s desires from
               the control of advertising, some people would probably still
               want to maintain a consumerist lifestyle — demanding the
               electronic entertainment, exotic imported foods, and other
               luxuries that (neo)colonialism currently affords them. By
               routinizing the act of going to a shop, taking out your wallet,
               and buying a mahogany dresser or a bar of chocolate,
               capitalism creates the illusion that human beings naturally
               possess the ability to procure luxury goods that in actuality are
               produced by slaves on another continent. It takes a massive
               infrastructure and multiple institutions of government and
               colonialism to afford this privilege to a select few. After an
               anarchist revolution, the slave labor camps that currently
               produce much of the world’s chocolate and tropical hardwoods
               would no longer exist.
               If a person or a group of like-minded people wanted to
               surround themselves with the consumer goods they still
               craved, they would be perfectly free to do so; however, without
               a police force to make others bear the ecological and labor
               costs of their lifestyle, they would be the ones who would have
               to procure the resources, produce the goods, and remediate
               any pollution. Of course, they could make the process more
130 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               efficient by specializing in one consumer good: for example, a
               union of chocoholics could produce eco-friendly chocolate —
               thus not damaging the ecological commons on which the rest
               of their society depends — and barter off some of that
               chocolate for, say, video-entertainment equipment produced
               by a union of TV addicts. Why not? Ultimately, however, all that
               work and personal responsibility might not mesh with the
               consumerist mentality; the end result would be a union of
               producers. When people have to take responsibility for all the
               costs of their own actions, it removes the pathological
               insulation from consequences which lies at the root of
               bourgeois whims. The result is carefully weighed, mature
               desires.
               In anarchist revolutions and stateless, non-capitalist societies
               throughout history, people used what they could make
               themselves or trade for from neighboring societies. In the
               Argentina factory takeovers, various occupied factories began
               trading their products with one another, allowing the workers
               access to a variety of manufactured goods. In many of the
               collectives of the 1936 Spanish revolution, communities
               decided together how much and what kinds of consumption
               they could collectively afford, by replacing wages with coupons
               redeemable for goods at the communal depot. Everyone had a
               voice in determining how many coupons of various types a
               person could get, and naturally they were free to trade their
               coupons with others, so someone who preferred more of one
               thing, say, cloth, could get more by trading the coupons for
               something they didn’t mind missing, like eggs. Thus there is no
               imposition of spartan uniformity, as in some communist states;
131 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               people are free to pursue the lifestyle they want, but only if
               they can personally bear the costs of it. They are not able to
               exploit other people, rob their resources, or poison their land to
               get it.
               What about building and organizing large, spread-out
               infrastructure?
               Many Western history books assert that centralized
               government arose out of the need to build and maintain large
               infrastructure projects, especially irrigation. However, this
               assertion is based on the assumption that societies need to
               grow, and that they cannot choose to limit their scale to avoid
               centralization — an assumption that has been discredited
               many times over. And while large-scale irrigation projects do
               require some amount of coordination, centralization is only one
               form of coordination.
               In India and East Africa, local societies built massive irrigation
               networks that were managed without government or
               centralization. In the Taita Hills region of what is now Kenya,
               people created complex irrigation systems that lasted
               hundreds of years, often until colonial agricultural practices
               ended them. Households shared day-to-day maintenance,
               each responsible for the closest section of the irrigation
               infrastructure, which was common property. Another custom
               brought people together periodically for major repairs: known
               as “harambee labor,” it was a form of collective, socially
               motivated work, similar to traditions in many other
               decentralized societies. The people of the Taita Hills ensured
               fair use through a number of social arrangements passed on by
132 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               tradition, which determined how much water each household
               could take; those who violated these practices faced sanctions
               from the rest of the community.
               When the British colonized the region, they assumed they
               knew better than the locals and set up a new irrigation system
               — geared, of course, to cash crop production — based on their
               engineering expertise and mechanical power. During the
               drought of the 1960s, the British system failed spectacularly
               and many locals returned to the indigenous irrigation system
               to feed themselves. According to one ethnologist, “East African
               irrigation works seem to have been more extensive and better
               managed during the precolonial era.”[48]
               During the Spanish Civil War, workers in occupied factories
               coordinated an entire wartime economy. Anarchist
               organizations that had been instrumental in bringing about the
               revolution, namely the CNT labor union, often provided the
               foundations for the new society. Especially in the industrial city
               of Barcelona, the CNT lent the structure for running a worker-
               controlled economy — a task for which it had been preparing
               years in advance. Each factory organized itself with its own
               chosen technical and administrative workers; factories in the
               same industry in every locality organized into the Local
               Federation of their particular industry; all the Local Federations
               of a locality organized themselves into a Local Economic
               Council “in which all the centers of production and services
               were represented”; and the local Federations and Councils
               organized into parallel National Federations of Industry and
               National Economic Federations.[49]
               The Barcelona congress of all Catalan collectives, on August
133 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               28, 1937, provides an example of their coordinating activities
               and decisions. The collectivized shoe factories needed 2 million
               pesetas credit. Because of a shortage of leather, they had to
               cut down on hours, though they still paid all their workers full
               time salaries. The Economic Council studied the situation, and
               reported that there was no surplus of shoes. The congress
               agreed to grant credit to purchase leather and to modernize
               the factories in order to lower the prices of the shoes. Later, the
               Economic Council outlined plans to build an aluminum factory,
               which was necessary for the war effort. They had located
               available materials, secured the cooperation of chemists,
               engineers, and technicians, and decided to raise the money
               through the collectives. The congress also decided to mitigate
               urban unemployment by working out a plan with agricultural
               workers to bring new areas into cultivation with the help of
               unemployed workers from the cities.
               In Valencia, the CNT organized the orange industry, with 270
               committees in different towns and villages for growing,
               purchasing, packing, and exporting; in the process, they got rid
               of several thousand middlemen. In Laredo, the fishing industry
               was collectivized — workers expropriated the ships, cut out the
               middlemen who took all the profit, and used those profits to
               improve the ships and other equipment or to pay themselves.
               Catalunya’s textile industry employed 250,000 workers in
               scores of factories. During collectivization, they got rid of high-
               paid directors, increased their wages by 15%, reduced their
               hours from 60 to 40 hours per week, bought new machinery,
               and elected management committees.
               In Catalunya, libertarian workers showed impressive results in
134 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               maintaining the complex infrastructure of the industrial society
               they had taken over. The workers who had always been
               responsible for these jobs proved themselves capable of
               carrying on and even improving their work in the absence of
               bosses. “Without waiting for orders from anyone, the workers
               restored normal telephone service within three days [after
               heavy street fighting ended]... Once this crucial emergency
               work was finished a general membership meeting of telephone
               workers decided to collectivize the telephone system.”[50] The
               workers voted to raise the salaries of the lowest paid members.
               The gas, water, and electricity services were also collectivized.
               The collective managing water lowered rates by 50% and was
               still able to contribute large amounts of money to the anti-
               fascist militia committee. The railway workers collectivized the
               railroads, and where technicians in the railroads had fled,
               experienced workers were chosen as replacements. The
               replacements proved adequate despite their lack of formal
               schooling, because they had learned through the experience of
               working together with the technicians to maintain the lines.
               Municipal transportation workers in Barcelona — 6,500 out of
               7,000 of whom were members of the CNT — saved
               considerable money by kicking out the overpaid directors and
               other unnecessary managers. They then reduced their hours
               to 40 per week, raised their wages between 60% (for the
               lowest income bracket) and 10% (for the highest income
               bracket), and helped out the entire population by lowering
               fares and giving free rides to schoolchildren and wounded
               militia members. They repaired damaged equipment and
               streets, cleared barricades, got the transportation system
135 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               running again just five days after fighting ceased in Barcelona,
               and deployed a fleet of 700 trolleys — up from the 600 on the
               streets before the revolution — repainted red and black. As for
               their organization:
               the various trades coordinated and organized their work into
               one industrial union of all the transport workers. Each section
               was administered by an engineer designated by the union and
               a worker delegated by the general membership. The
               delegations of the various sections coordinated operations in a
               given area. While the sections met separately to conduct their
               own specific operations, decisions affecting the workers in
               general were made at general membership meetings.
               The engineers and technicians, rather than comprising an elite
               group, were integrated with the manual workers. “The
               engineer, for example, could not undertake an important
               project without consulting the other workers, not only because
               responsibilities were to be shared but also because in practical
               problems the manual workers acquired practical experience
               which technicians often lacked.” Public transportation in
               Barcelona achieved greater self-sufficiency too: before the
               revolution, 2% of maintenance supplies were made by the
               private company, and the rest had to be purchased or
               imported. Within a year after socialization, 98% of repair
               supplies were made in socialized shops. “The union also
               provided free medical services, including clinics and home
               nursing care, for the workers and their families.”[51]
               For better or worse, the Spanish revolutionaries also
               experimented with Peasant Banks, Labor Banks, and Councils
               of Credit and Exchange. The Levant Federation of Peasant
136 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Collectives started a bank organized by the Bank Workers
               Union to help farmers draw from a broad pool of social
               resources needed for certain infrastructure- or resource-
               intensive types of farming. The Central Labor Bank of
               Barcelona moved credit from more prosperous collectives to
               socially useful collectives in need. Cash transactions were kept
               to a minimum, and credit was transferred as credit. The Labor
               Bank also arranged foreign exchange, and importation and
               purchase of raw materials. Where possible, payment was
               made in commodities, not in cash. The bank was not a for-profit
               enterprise; it charged only 1% interest to defray expenses.
               Diego Abad de Santillan, the anarchist economist, said in 1936:
               “Credit will be a social function and not a private speculation or
               usury... Credit will be based on the economic possibilities of
               society and not on interests or profit... The Council of Credit
               and Exchange will be like a thermometer of the products and
               needs of the country.”[52] In this experiment, money
               functioned as a symbol of social support and not as a symbol of
               ownership — it signified resources being transferred between
               unions of producers rather than investments by speculators.
               Within a complex industrial economy such banks make
               exchange and production more efficient, though they also
               present the risk of centralization or the reemergence of capital
               as a social force. Furthermore, efficient production and
               exchange as a value should be viewed with suspicion, at the
               least, by people interested in liberation.
               There are a number of methods that could prevent institutions
               such as labor banks from facilitating the return of capitalism,
               though unfortunately the onslaught of totalitarianism from
137 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               both the fascists and Communists deprived Spanish anarchists
               of the chance to develop them. These might include rotating
               and mixing tasks to prevent the emergence of a new
               managing class, developing fragmented structures that cannot
               be controlled at a central or national level, promoting as much
               decentralization and simplicity as possible, and maintaining a
               firm tradition that common resources and instruments of social
               wealth are never for sale.
               But as long as money is a central fact of human existence,
               myriad human activities are reduced to quantitative values
               and value can be massed as power, and thus alienated from
               the activity that created it: in other words, it can become
               capital. Naturally anarchists do not agree on how to strike a
               balance between practicality and perfection, or how deep to
               cut in order to root out capitalism, but studying all the
               possibilities, including those that might be doomed to failure or
               worse, can only help.
               How will cities work?
               Many people believe that an anarchist society might work in
               theory, but the modern world contains too many obstacles that
               prevent such a total liberation. Large cities are chief among
               these putative stumbling blocks. Industrial capitalist cities are
               a tangled mess of bureaucracies supposedly only kept running
               by the authorities. But the maintenance of a large city is not as
               mystifying as we are led to believe. Some of the biggest cities
               in the world are largely composed of self-organizing slums
               stretching for miles. Their quality of life leaves much to be
               desired, but they do show that cities do not simply collapse in

               Anarchists have some experience maintaining large cities; the
               solution seems to lie in maintenance workers taking over the
               organization of the infrastructure for which they are
               responsible, and neighborhoods forming assemblies so that
               nearly all other decisions can be made at a local level, where
               everyone can participate. It is probable that an anarchist
               revolution will be accompanied by a process of deurbanization
               as cities shrink to more manageable sizes. Many people will
               probably return to the land as industrial agriculture decreases
               or ceases, to be replaced by sustainable agriculture — or
               “permaculture” — which can support a higher population
               density in rural areas.
               In such a period, it might be necessary to make new social
               arrangements in a hurry, but it won’t be the first time
               anarchists have made a town or city from scratch. In May 2003,
               as envoys of the eight leading world governments prepared for
               the “G8” summit in Evian, France, the anti-capitalist
               movement set up a series of connected villages to serve as a
               foundation for protest and an example of collective, anti-
               capitalist living; these took the name VAAAG (Village Alternatif,
               Anticapitalist et AntiGuerres). For the duration of the
               mobilization, thousands of people lived in these villages,
               organizing food, housing, childcare, debate forums, media, and
               legal services, and making decisions communally. The project
               was widely regarded as a success. The VAAAG also exhibited
               the dual form of organization suggested above. Specific
               “neighborhoods,” each with fewer than 200 people, organized
               around a community kitchen, while village-wide services —
139 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               “inter-neighborhood collective spaces” such as the legal and
               medical space — were organized by those involved in
               providing those services. This experience was replicated
               during the 2005 mobilizations against the G8 in Scotland, and
               the 2007 mobilizations in northern Germany, when nearly six
               thousand people lived together in Camp Reddelich.
               These protest villages had precedents in the German anti-
               nuclear movement of the previous generation. When the state
               wanted to build a massive nuclear waste storage complex at
               Gorleben in 1977, local farmers began to protest. In May 1980,
               five thousand people set up an encampment on the site,
               building a small city from trees cut for construction and naming
               their new home The Free Republic of Wendland. They issued
               their own passports, set up illegal radio shows and printed
               newspapers, and held common debates to decide how to run
               the camp and respond to police aggression. People shared food
               and did away with money in their daily lives. One month later,
               eight thousand police assaulted the protestors, who had
               decided to resist nonviolently. They were brutally beaten and
               cleared out. Subsequent manifestations of the antinuclear
               movement were less inclined to pacifism.[53]
               In England, a yearly festival of travellers and hippies that
               converged at Stonehenge to mark the summer solstice
               became a major counter-cultural autonomous zone and an
               experiment in “collective anarchy.” Beginning in 1972, the
               Stonehenge Free Festival was a gathering that lasted for the
               month of June until the solstice. More than a music festival, it
               was a non-hierarchical space for the creation of music, art, and
               new relationships, as well as spiritual and psychedelic

               exploration. It became an essential ritual and social event in
               England’s growing traveller culture. By 1984, it drew 30,000
               participants who created a self-organized village for the month.
               In the words of one participant, it was “Anarchy. And it
               worked.”[54] The Thatcher regime saw it as a threat; in 1985
               they banned the 14th annual Stonehenge Free Festival, brutally
               attacking the several hundred people who came to set it up in
               an assault known as the Battle of the Beanfield.
               These examples of impromptu camps are not as marginal as
               they might seem at first. Hundreds of millions of people
               throughout the world live in informally organized cities,
               sometimes called shantytowns or favelas, which are self-
               organizing, self-created, and self-sustaining. The social issues
               posed by these shantytowns are very complex. Millions of
               farmers are forced off their land yearly and have to move to
               the cities, where the peripheral shantytowns are the only place
               they can afford to settle; but a great many people also move to
               the city voluntarily to escape the more culturally rigid rural
               areas and build a new life. Many shantytowns are plagued by
               health problems caused by poor access to clean water,
               healthcare, and nutrition. However, many of these problems
               are peculiar to capitalism rather than the structure of the
               shantytowns, as the inhabitants are often ingenious in
               providing for themselves in spite of artificially limited
               resources.
               Privatized electricity and water are generally too expensive,
               and even where these utilities are public the authorities often
               refuse to provide access to informal settlements. Shanty
               dwellers get around this problem by constructing their own
141 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               wells and pirating electricity. Medical care is highly
               professionalized in capitalist societies and distributed in
               exchange for money rather than on the basis of need;
               consequently, there are rarely fully trained doctors in the
               shantytowns. But the folk medicine and healers that are
               present are often available on a basis of mutual aid. Access to
               food is also artificially limited, because small-scale horticulture
               for local consumption has been replaced by large-scale
               production of cash crops, depriving people throughout the
               Global South of diverse and affordable sources of local food.
               This problem is exacerbated in famine areas, because food aid
               from the US, in line with military and economic strategies,
               consists of imports rather than subsidies for local production.
               But within the settlements, available food is frequently shared
               rather than traded. An anthropologist estimated that in one
               informal settlement in Ghana people gave away almost one
               third of all their resources. This makes perfect sense. Police
               rarely have control of shantytowns, and some armed force is
               required to uphold an unequal distribution of resources. In
               other words, those who hoard resources are likely to be
               robbed. With few resources, little security, and no guarantees
               of property rights, people can live better by giving away a large
               portion of whatever resources they come across. Gift-giving
               increases their social wealth: friendships and other
               relationships that create a safety network which cannot be
               stolen.
               In addition to mutual aid, the anarchist objectives of
               decentralization, voluntary association, hands-on production
               rather than professionalization of skills and services, and direct

               democracy are guiding principles in many shantytowns. It is
               also important to note that, in an era of growing environmental
               devastation, shantytown dwellers subside on just a fraction of
               a percent of the resources consumed by suburbanites and
               formal city dwellers. Some may even have a negative
               ecological footprint, in that they recycle more waste than they
               generate.[55] In a world without capitalism, informal
               settlements would have the potential to be much healthier
               places. Even today, they disprove the capitalist myths that
               cities can only be held together by experts and central
               organization, and that people can only live at today’s
               population levels by continuing to surrender our lives to the
               control of authorities.
               One inspiring example of an informal city is El Alto, Bolivia. El
               Alto sits on the Altiplano, the plateau overlooking La Paz, the
               capital. A few decades ago El Alto was just a small town, but as
               global economic changes caused the shutting down of mines
               and small farms, huge numbers of people came here. Unable
               to reside in La Paz, they built settlements up on the plateau,
               changing the town into a major urban area with 850,000
               residents. Seventy percent of the people who have jobs here
               make their living through family businesses in an informal
               economy. Land use is unregulated, and the state provides little
               or no infrastructure: most neighborhoods do not have paved
               roads, garbage removal services, or indoor plumbing, 75% of
               the population lacks basic health care, and 40% are illiterate.
               [56] Faced with this situation, the residents of the informal city
               took their self-organization to the next step, by creating
               neighborhood councils, or juntas. The first juntas in El Alto go
143 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               back to the ‘50s. In 1979 these juntas started to coordinate
               through a new organization, the Federation of Neighborhood
               Councils, FEJUVE. Now there are nearly 600 juntas in El Alto.
               The juntas allow neighbors to pool resources to create and
               maintain necessary infrastructure, like schools, parks, and
               basic utilities. They also mediate disputes and levy sanctions in
               cases of conflict and social harm. The federation, FEJUVE, pools
               the resources of the juntas to coordinate protests and
               blockades and constitute the slum dwellers as a social force. In
               just the first five years of the new millennium, FEJUVE took a
               lead role in establishing a public university in El Alto, blocking
               new municipal taxes, and deprivatizing the water services.
               FEJUVE also was instrumental in the popular movement that
               forced the government to nationalize the natural gas
               resources.
               Each junta typically contains at least 200 people and meets
               every month, making general decisions through public
               discussion and consensus. They also elect a committee which
               meets more frequently and has an administrative role. Political
               party leaders, merchants, real estate speculators, and those
               who collaborated with the dictatorship are not allowed to be
               committee delegates. More men than women sit on these
               committees; however a greater percentage of women take on
               leadership roles in FEJUVE than in other Bolivian popular
               organizations.
               Parallel to the organization in neighborhood councils is the
               organization of infrastructure and economic activity in unions
               or syndicates. The street vendors and transportation workers,
               for example, self-organize in their own base unions.
144 of 338 3/17/25, 5:09 PM Anarchy Works | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               Both the neighborhood councils and their counterparts in the
               informal economy are patterned after the traditional
               communitarian organization of rural indigenous communities
               (ayllu) in terms of territoriality, structure and organizational
               principles. They also reflect the traditions of radical miners’
               unions, which for decades led Bolivia’s militant labor
               movement. Fusing these experiences, El Alto’s migrants have
               reproduced, transplanted and adapted their communities of
               origin to facilitate survival in a hostile urban environment.
               [...]Through the neighborhood juntas, El Alto has developed as
               a self-constructed city run by a network of micro-governments
               [57] independent of the state. In Raúl Zibechi’s view, the
               autonomous organization of labor in the informal sector, based
               on productivity and family ties instead of the hierarchical boss-
               worker relationship, reinforces this sense of empowerment:
               Citizens can self-manage and control their own environment
               [58]
               Horizontal networks “without traditional leadership” also play a
               major role complementary to these formal structures in both
               the organization of daily life and the coordination of protest,
               blockades, and struggle against the state.
               Now that Bolivia has an indigenous president and progressive
               government led by MAS, the Movement Towards Socialism,
               FEJUVE faces the danger of incorporation and recuperation that
               typically neutralizes horizontal movements without explicitly
               anti-state goals and means. However, while supporting Evo
               Morales’ reversals of neoliberal policy, as of this writing FEJUVE
               remains critical of MAS and the government, and it remains to
               be seen to what extent they will be recuperated.
