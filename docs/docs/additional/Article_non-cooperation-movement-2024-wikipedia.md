          democratic disinvestment movement and a mass Part of the July Revolution
          uprising against the Awami League-led

          Hasina and her cabinet.[19][20] It was the ﬁnal stage
          of the wider movement known as the July
          Revolution. Although the movement was initially
          limited to the goal of reforming quotas in
          government jobs, it snowballed into a mass antigovernment uprising after the mass killings against People cheering in front of the Prime Minister's
          civilians. The movement was also fueled by Oﬃce after Sheikh Hasina's resignation
          ongoing socio-economic and political issues,
                                                                  Date 4–5 August 2024 (1 day)[1]

          Abu Shadik Kayem, one of the organizer of the movement and and former president of the Dhaka University
          branch and current central publication secretary of Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir was one of the ﬁrst to
          refer to the event as Fath-e-Ganabhaban, which he stated,
              "The legacy of Fath-e-Makkah, Fath-e-Bangala, and Fath-e-Kustuntiniyya has led us to achieve
              Fath-e-Ganabhaban."[31][32]
          Background
          During the quota reform movement in 2024, participants—
          particularly students—faced resistance, mass arrests, and
          massacre and severe injuries at the hands of police and other
          security forces. Six coordinators of the Anti-discrimination
          Students Movement, who were leading the initial quota reform
          movement, were also detained and were forcefully made to
          announce the conclusion of the protests by the Detective Branch
          (DB) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP). These events and
          authoritarianism fuelled people's anger against the government.
## People gathering at the Central

          it would be similar to that of "March '71".[33] In the afternoon,
          Prime Minister Hasina proposed talks with the protesters, saying
          that "The doors of Ganabhaban (her oﬃcial residence) are open".[34]

          with 13 deaths occurring at the Enayetpur police station in Sirajganj.
          Another oﬃcer was killed in Eliotganj, Comilla.[43] Twenty-seven
          police facilities were attacked and vandalized, and a hundred
          policemen were injured in these incidents, according to an oﬃcial
          statement by the Bangladesh Police.[17]
          In Dhaka, unidentiﬁed individuals set ﬁre to and damaged various
          vehicles, including cars, ambulances, motorcycles, and buses, at the
          Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University during the protests.

          by the police in Dhaka Farmgate area, whose photo of being taken to
          the hospital on rickshaw went viral on internet, creating high outrage
          by netizens.[45] By 12:00 p.m., users across the country reported
          internet inaccessibility.[46] The government ordered the closure of
          Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and all other Metaowned services, directing internet service providers to comply after

          The government declared a three-day general holiday starting
          from 5 August, during which banks will also remain closed.[52]
          The Anti-Discrimination Students Movement conﬁrmed their
          intention to march towards Dhaka on 6 August to demand the
          Prime Minister's resignation.[53] The Bangladesh University
          Teachers' Network proposed a framework for an interim
          government, suggesting it be composed of teachers, judges,
          lawyers, and representatives from civil society, reﬂecting the
          views of various civil and political groups for a democratic
          transition.[54]

          Long March to Dhaka
          Asif Mahmud, a coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement, announced that their march to
          Dhaka had been rescheduled to 5 August, instead of 6 August. He called on protesters and civilians
          nationwide to march toward the capital and participate in civil disobedience.[55] Several former Bangladesh
          Army oﬃcers, including former chief of staﬀ Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan, held a press brieﬁng urging soldiers to
          return to camps and refrain from getting involved in the political crisis or being used against civilians.[56][57]
          Retired Brig. Gen. M. Sakhawat Hossain stated that there was signiﬁcant unease among the troops, which
          likely pressured the chief of army staﬀ as soldiers were deployed and witnessing the events. Retired oﬃcers,

          including Brig. Gen. Mohammad Shahedul Anam Khan, deﬁed the curfew on Monday and took to the streets,
          with Khan noting that the army did not intervene. In response to calls for a march to Dhaka, DMP
          Commissioner Habibur Rahman warned of zero tolerance, stating that legal action would be taken against
          curfew violators.[58]
          The Anti-discrimination Students Movement rejected the curfew and encouraged everyone to march towards
          the Ganabhaban and Prime minister's oﬃce.[59]
          Reports indicated Sheikh Hasina had been moved to a secure location.[60] On the same day, up to 135 people,
          including 24 police oﬃcers, were killed during protests.[61]
          Same day, at around 3:00 p.m. (UTC+6), Sheikh Hasina resigned and ﬂed to India.[27] Widespread
          celebrations and violence occurred following her removal, while the military and President Mohammed
          Shahabuddin announced the formation of an interim government led by economist and Nobel laureate
          Muhammad Yunus.[26]
          Outcome
          Resignation of Sheikh Hasina
          On 5 August 2024, at around 3:00 p.m., Prime Minister Hasina
          resigned and ﬂed the country on a helicopter with her sister,
          Sheikh Rehana, to India,[2][26][62][3] arriving in Delhi via
          Agartala. Although she intended to record a speech, she did not
          have the opportunity to do so.[63] Reports indicated that in a
          meeting with security oﬃcials on 4 August, Hasina insisted on
          staying in power by using force against what she called
          "terrorists". However, military leaders warned her that the People surrounded Jatiya Sangsad
          country would be approaching a civil war if they ﬁred on the Bhaban after Sheikh Hasina's
          protesters. As she was determined to stay, the military leaders resignation
          met her again on the next morning and concluded that her safety
          could no longer be guaranteed as protesters were soon to reach the Ganabhaban. Senior police oﬃcers had
          also warned her that their forces were running out of ammunition. She ﬁnally agreed to resign after talking to
          her close relatives. Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, later said that his mother had begun considering resignation
          as early as 3 August but was only convinced to do so by close relatives who had been approached by senior
          military and police oﬃcials, according to media reports.[64][65]
          Storming of Ganabhaban
          Shortly after Sheikh Hasina's departure, at around 3:00 p.m., protesters reached the gates of the Ganabhaban
          and entered the Prime Minister's residence looting, vandalizing, and destroying numerous items, including
          furniture.[66] They rummaged oﬃce ﬁles[67] and sat on her bed as well as her chair to take selﬁes.[68] Some
          protesters ate food and stole live animals,[69][70] while others looted Hasina's luxury Dior suitcase and her
          sarees.[71]

          Sheikh Hasina's departure
          Reports indicated that Hasina, along with her sister Sheikh Rehana, ﬂed Ganabhaban aboard a military
          helicopter before transferring to a C-130 Hercules aircraft of the Bangladesh Air Force. An internet blackout
          was enforced to hinder the tracking of her movements.[64][72] Initial reports suggested Hasina's ﬂight,
          carrying the callsign AJAX1431, would land in Agartala, in the Indian state of Tripura. AJAX1431 switched
          oﬀ its transponder at around 17:00 local time over Lucknow, rendering the aircraft untraceable. Shortly, she
          was reported to have landed at the Hindan Air Force Station in Ghaziabad, on the outskirts of the Indian
          capital New Delhi, and was reportedly received by the Indian National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval at the
          base.[73][74] Her arrival in Delhi was subsequently conﬁrmed by Indian Minister of External Aﬀairs S.
          Jaishankar.[75] Sheikh Hasina is living in a secret location within India under tight security.[73]
          Flightradar24 reported that her ﬂight was, at one point, the most tracked ﬂight worldwide, with other civilian
          aircraft traveling into and out of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka also being highly tracked.
          [76] She is expected to proceed to London for her safe passage[77] and seek political asylum in the United
          Kingdom, where Rehana's eldest daughter, Labour Party MP Tulip Siddiq was Economic Secretary to the
          Treasury under the incumbent Prime Minister Keir Starmer, while her youngest daughter Azmina Siddiq
          works for Control Risks as a global risk analysis editor.[78] However, such plans are believed to be on hold
          due to indications from the UK government that she would not receive legal protection from investigations
          into the violence in Bangladesh.[73]
          Arrest of Awami League leaders
          In addition to Sheikh Hasina, several ﬁgures associated with her administration and the Awami League ﬂed
          or attempted to ﬂee Bangladesh. This group included Hasan Mahmud, the former Minister of Foreign Aﬀairs,
          Zunaid Ahmed Palak, the former Minister of state for Posts, Telecommunications and Information
          Technology, and Ziaul Ahsan, the former Director General of the National Telecommunication Monitoring
          Centre. All were detained at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on 6 August.[79][80][81] On 7 August, two
          more Awami League leaders were arrested near the Darshana border checkpoint while trying to ﬂee abroad.
          [82] On 13 August, Salman F Rahman, former Adviser for Private Industry and Investment to the Prime
          Minister, and Anisul Huq, former Minister for Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Aﬀairs, were arrested while
          attempting to ﬂee by boat at Sadarghat.[83] On 28 August, former Minister of Commerce Tipu Munshi was
          arrested after a murder case was ﬁled against him over the death of a protester in Rangpur.[84] On September
          10, Tawﬁq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, the former Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Adviser to Hasina, was
          arrested by the DB in the Gulshan area.[85]
          On 14 August, the general secretary of Barguna district Awami League was arrested on charges of conspiring
          to foment unrest. This followed the emergence of a phone call recording on social media in which he
          appeared to be communicating with Sheikh Hasina, who was by then in India.[86] On 16 August, Ramesh
          Chandra Sen, former Minister of Water Resources, was arrested in his residence in Thakurgaon Sadar
          Upazila.[87] On 19 August, former Minister of Social Welfare and Awami League joint secretary Dipu Moni
          was arrested in Baridhara.[88] On 24 August, Ishaque Ali Khan Panna, the former General Secretary of the
          Bangladesh Chhatra League, died from a heart attack while climbing a mountain in the Indian state of
          Meghalaya as part of his eﬀorts to ﬂee Bangladesh.[89]
          On 21 August, the interim government ordered the revocation of diplomatic passports issued to Sheikh
6 of 39 8/20/25, 8:49 PM Non-cooperation movement (2024) - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperation_moveme...
          Hasina as well as her ministers and MPs.[90] On August 29, the interim government issued an ordinance
          revoking a 2009 law that granted special privileges to the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, including
          Sheikh Hasina.[91]
          Numerous local oﬃcials nationwide also deserted their posts following Sheikh Hasina's overthrow.[92] This
          included the mayor of Khulna City Corporation, Talukder Abdul Khaleque, who along with most of the city's
          41 councillors, went into hiding, leading to a paralysis of the city government's functions.[93] At least 323
          municipal mayors, 495 Upazila Parishad chairs, 53 District Council chairs, and 12 city corporation mayors
          were subsequently removed from oﬃce by the interim government.[94]
          Casualties and damages
          Reprisal attacks against Awami League supporters and police
          On the day of Sheikh Hasina's resignation, protesters vandalized
          statues of her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the former
          president of Bangladesh, in Dhaka.[95] They also set the Awami
          League's headquarters in Dhaka ablaze. The vandalizing of
          Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's statues has been compared with that of
          Saddam Hussain's statue in Baghdad on 2003. Houses or
          businesses of several Awami League leaders and activists were
          attacked.[c] The Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre, operated by the
          Indian Council for Cultural Relations, and Sheikh Mujibur
          Rahman's residence in Dhanmondi, where he and his family were The Awami League central oﬃce on

          Sangsad Bhaban, which houses the Parliament of Bangladesh,
          was also stormed by protesters,[121] who took 40 weapons from
          the building's security. These were later returned by students.[122]
          The house of the Chief Justice of Bangladesh was vandalized by
          rioters who climbed the walls.[98] Sheikh Rehana's residence in
          Gulshan, Dhaka, was also looted.[27] The Mujibnagar Memorial
          Complex in Meherpur was also vandalized, resulting in damage
          to 600 sculptures. Incidents of vandalism were also recorded at
          the Bangladesh Shishu Academy, 22 branches of the Shilpakala
          Academy, and the Shasi Lodge and the Zainul Park in
          Mymensingh.[123] The 19th-century Bir Chandra Public Library The Wari Police Station after being

          At least 232 people were reported to have been killed in the three days that followed Hasina's resignation.[125]
          This included at least 29 oﬃcials of the Awami League and associated groups as well as their relatives.[126]
          An Awami League oﬃce in Chittagong was also set ablaze by miscreants.[98] Two vehicles of the BGB were
          set ablaze by the rioters and ﬁve were killed in clashes between BGB and demonstrators.[127] Jails in Satkhira
          and Sherpur districts were attacked, leading to prisoner escapes.[128][129] In Satkhira alone, 596 prisoners
          escaped, although more than 400 of them voluntarily returned within days.[130] An Awami League leader in
          Satkhira was hacked to death along with four associates after fatally shooting three members of a crowd that
          attacked his residence.[131] An installation of Bangladesh Ansar and Village Defence Force was also

          In Jessore, at least 24 people, including an Indonesian national, were killed after a hotel belonging to a
          district leader of the Awami League was set on ﬁre.[139] Two union council chairs were beaten to death by
          mobs in separate incidents in Khulna and Chandpur.[140][141] Clashes between BGB and demonstrators led to
          the deaths of six people, including a BGB soldier in Gazipur,[142] where a protest outside a jail also resulted
          in the escape of 209 inmates.[143] In Kishoreganj, a clash between Awami League leaders and activists led to
          the death of ﬁve individuals and left hundreds injured, including journalists.[144]
          Operations at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka were suspended for eight hours.[145] The
          Higher Secondary Certiﬁcate examinations, which were originally scheduled for 11 August, had to be
          postponed. This decision was made after the question papers suﬀered damage during the attacks on police
          stations.[146]
          On 10 August, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) dismissed the head of its Bauphal upazila branch
          following complaints about his alleged involvement in the violence and looting.[147]
          Violence against minorities
          Hours after Hasina's departure, reports surfaced about attacks against Hindus in Bangladesh as due to the
          collapse of governmental law enforcement agencies.[148] Haradhan Roy, a Hindu councilor from the Awami
          League in Rangpur, and Mrinal Kanti Chatterjee, a Hindu school teacher in Dhaka were killed.[148][149][150]
          According to the Investigation conducted by Prothom Alo correspondents across 64 districts and 67 upazilas
          between 5–20 August 2024, 1,068 attacks on the minority community occurred in 49 districts. Two members
          of the Hindu community were killed in the violence, and a total of 912 attacks were documented. Of these, in
          at least 506 cases, the victims were aﬃliated with Awami League.[151] The Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity
          Council reported that from August 4 to August 20, a total of 2,010 incidents (including 69 temples) of attacks

          According to most observers, the attacks were largely politically motivated where victims were primarily
          Awami League leaders, activists, and police. However, many Hindus with no political aﬃliation were also
          aﬀected.[148][28] The coordinators of the student movement denounced these attacks and urged the public not
          to participate in such violence.[154]
          Thousands of Bangladeshi Hindus attempted to ﬂee to India after being attacked, however, they were turned
          back by the border guards from both countries.[155][156] Indian Border Security Force (BSF) arrested nearly a
          dozen Bangladeshis who were trying to cross the border to escape the violence and political unrest.[157] In
          Lalmonirhat, an Awami League leader was seen spreading rumors, urging local Hindus to gather at the
          border with India and engage with Indian leaders who were expected to arrive there. Reportedly, he
          successfully assembled thousands of Hindus at the border before they were dispersed by the BGB and local
          police.[158][159][160]
          Meanwhile, students and members of the Muslim community, including madrasa students, were seen
          standing guard at temples and churches to protect them.[161][156] Chief adviser to the interim government,
          Muhammad Yunus, also denounced the violence, stating that there was no room for discrimination in
          Bangladesh.[162] The interim government also assured that it would "immediately sit with the representative
          bodies and other concerned groups to ﬁnd ways to resolve such heinous attacks".[163]
          Similar reports of Islamist mobs perpetrating violence against other minorities like Christians[164] &
          Ahmadiyyas[165] alongside vandalising tombs of Suﬁ saints[166][167][168] emerged in various parts of the
          country in midst of collapse of law and order. Reports of houses belonging to ethnic minorities like the
          Kurukh[169] and Chakma[170] being torched by mobs have also emerged.
          Aftermath
          Restoration of services
          As per reports, broadband internet services were reinstated approximately at 1:00 p.m. on 5 August,[171]
          followed by the restoration of cellular internet access after 2:00 p.m.[172] However, access to social media
          platforms continued to be restricted.[173][174] The curfew was rescinded on 6 August, and oﬃces, businesses,
          and schools were permitted to resume operations on the same day.[175]
          Interim government formation
          On 5 August, the Chief of Army Staﬀ, Waker-uz-Zaman, convened a meeting with representatives from BNP,
          Jatiya Party (Ershad), and Jamaat-e-Islami[176] and called for the creation of an interim government within 48
          hours, excluding the Awami League.[177] Several subsequent reports indicated that Nobel Laureate
          Muhammad Yunus had been approached to be the head of the interim government by the student protesters.
          Other possible names for the head of government included Salahuddin Ahmed, a former governor of
          Bangladesh Bank, retired General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, and lawyer Sara Hossain.[178] The nomination
          of Yunus, who accepted the advisory role in the interim government, has also been supported by prominent
          ﬁgures within the student movement.[179] In addition, Waker-uz-Zaman pledged an investigation by the
9 of 39 8/20/25, 8:49 PM Non-cooperation movement (2024) - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperation_moveme...
           military into the preceding incidents of violence and issued an order prohibiting security forces from opening
           ﬁre on crowds.[119]
           President Mohammed Shahabuddin issued an order for the release of all students who had been detained
           during the protests, as well as Khaleda Zia, the former prime minister and chairperson of the BNP.[57] Zia
           has been a long-standing political adversary of Sheikh Hasina. This decision was made unanimously at a
           meeting attended by major opposition parties and the heads of the armed services.[180] On 6 August, in
           response to an ultimatum from the student movement that warned of further demonstrations, Shahabuddin
           dissolved the Jatiya Sangsad.[181] Additionally, a reorganization was carried out within the Bangladesh
           Armed Forces,[145] while Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun was removed as Inspector General of the
           Bangladesh Police.[182] Following a meeting with student leaders on 6 August, Shahabuddin formally
           appointed Yunus on 7 August as head of the interim government,[183] Yunus, who was in Paris, returned to
           Dhaka on 8 August[184] and was inaugurated later that day along with the rest of his cabinet at the
           Bangabhaban.[185][186] Among those who joined the interim government as advisers were two leaders of the
           student movement, Nahid Islam and Asif Mahmud.[187]
           Security crisis
           Following the resignation of Sheikh Hasina, police were absent from their duties, leading to a surge in
           burglaries and thefts in residential areas of Dhaka. These incidents caused widespread panic among residents,
           who were compelled to guard their neighborhoods at night.[188] Reports indicted the presence of robbers on 6
           and 7 August. During this time, banks and ATM booths were nearly out of cash due to the security crisis.[189]
           In response, anti-robbery committees were established throughout the city.[190] Additionally, residents used
           social media platforms to prevent further burglaries.[191] Numerous weapons were also looted from police
           stations and security installations nationwide. By 3 September, authorities had recovered at least 3,880
           ﬁrearms, 286,353 rounds of ammunition, 22,201 tear gas shells, and 2,139 sound grenades.[192] More than
           500 prisoners set free by mobs during the violence also several banned terror outﬁt chiefs including ABT
           Chief Jashimuddin Rahmani released on Bail.[193][194]

           Prosecutions
           On 13 August, former Awami League MP Nizam Uddin Hazari was named as a primary accused in a murder
           case related to the killing of an auto-rickshaw driver in Feni during the protests on 4 August. Approximately
           400 other Awami League members and oﬃcials were also charged in this case, including Feni Sadar Upazila
           Chair Shusen Chandra Shil, the Awami League President in the upazila, and Feni Municipality Mayor Nazrul
           Islam Swapan Miazi.[195] On 16 August, murder complaints were ﬁled against former MPs Shahadara
           Mannan Shilpi, Talukdar Mohammad Towhid Jung Murad, and Mohammad Saiful Islam in connection with
           the deaths of students during protests on 5 August.[196][197]
           On 14 August, the father of a student killed during the protests ﬁled a petition at the International Crimes
           Tribunal. The petition called for an investigation into charges of genocide and crimes against humanity
           against Sheikh Hasina and nine other individuals, including the General Secretary of Bangladesh Awami

           League and former Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader, and former Minister of Home
           Aﬀairs Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal over their role in the crackdown on the protests. The Awami League and
           its associated organizations were also named as accused in the petition. A formal investigation was initiated
           by the court later that day,[198] and on 8 September, legal proceedings began to extradite Sheikh Hasina.[199]
           On 15 August, two additional murder charges were ﬁled against Sheikh Hasina and several of her associates
           in connection with the deaths of two individuals during the protests.[200][201] On 19 August, Sheikh Hasina
           and 66 others were charged over the killing of a BNP ward leader in Dhaka North City Corporation during
           the protests on 4 August.[202]
           On 21 August, journalists Shakil Ahmed and his wife, Farzana Rupa, from the pro-Hasina channel Ekattor
           TV, were arrested at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport while ﬂying to board a ﬂight to Paris. They were
           suspected of instigating the killing of a garment worker during a demonstration in Uttara, Dhaka, on 5
           August. Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders expressed concern over their arrest.[203][204]
           On 22 August, a United Nations (UN) team arrived in Bangladesh to discuss and understand the interim
           government's priorities for promoting human rights. A separate fact-ﬁnding team, to be dispatched later, will
           investigate human rights violations during the protests and unrest.[205]
           On 23 August, charges were ﬁled against former State Minister for Water Resources Zahid Farooq Shamim
           and at least 377 others for their role in an attack on the BNP oﬃce in Barisal on 5 August.[206]
           Reactions
           Domestic
           Muhammad Yunus, who was in Paris undergoing a medical procedure
           at the time of Hasina's departure, hailed her resignation as
           Bangladesh's "second Independence Day".[207] He also committed to
           returning to Bangladesh "without delay", responding aﬃrmatively to a
           request from the student movement to guide the interim government.
           [179]
           In her ﬁrst public address following her release, Khaleda Zia
           commended "the brave people who were in a do-or-die struggle to Massive victory procession after
## the resignation of Hasina
           make possible the impossible". She emphasized the need for restraint
           and advocated for "love and peace" as essential in the process of
           rebuilding Bangladesh.[185] Tarique Rahman, who is currently serving as the acting chair of the BNP and is
           based in London, declared that "Hasina's resignation is a testament to the power of the people"[208] and urged
           for "restraint".[145] On 7 August, during a rally in Dhaka, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Secretary General of
           BNP, called for the holding of fair elections within the next three months.[209] On 13 August, the BNP

           In a phone call with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on 14 August, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said
           that such an investigation would come "very soon".[211]

           Sajeeb Wazed, the son and adviser of Sheikh Hasina, initially
           announced on 5 August that his mother intended to retire from
           politics. On 7 August, he amended this statement clarifying that
           both Hasina and the Awami League would continue to be active
           in the political landscape of Bangladesh.[184] He further
           mentioned that she would return to the country once elections
           were declared.[212] On 10 August, he claimed to Reuters that

           country, Sheikh Hasina conﬁrmed that she resigned and conceded defeat to avoid further bloodshed. She
           attributed her decision to resign to pressure from the United States and urged Awami League supporters to
           keep their morale high.[215] Shortly thereafter, Wazed refuted the statement as "completely false and
           fabricated," emphasizing that Hasina "did not make any statement before or after leaving Dhaka".[216] On 12
           August, the Rumor Scanner Bangladesh investigated the matter and declared the reports about Sheikh
           Hasina's statement as fake and rumour.[217] On 13 August, Hasina released her ﬁrst conﬁrmed statements
           since her overthrow, published by Wazed, calling for an investigation into the killings during the protests. She

           were killed. Of these, nearly 400 deaths were reported from 16 July to 4 August,
           while around 250 people were reportedly killed following the new wave of protests
           between 5 and 6 August. [...] The reported death toll is likely an underestimate, as
           information collection has been hindered by restrictions on movement due to the
           curfew and the internet shutdown. Furthermore, hospitals were reportedly
           prevented by State authorities from providing details of those killed and injured.
           The majority of deaths and injuries have been attributed to the security forces and
           the student wing aﬃliated with the Awami League."
