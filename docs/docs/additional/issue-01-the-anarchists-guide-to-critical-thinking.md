What is criticalthinking...
Some writers andphilosophers have approach defining it broad strokes: Robert Ennis,who spent six decades writing about the topic, claimed that criticalthinking is simply “reasonable reflective thinking that is focusedon deciding what to believe or do.” (1991, p. 8). Similarly, SharonBailin and her colleagues identified only three characteristics thatmake thinking critical: (1) it is done to determine what to believeabout something, (2) the thinker is trying to meet some standards ofadequacy in their thinking; and (3) the thinker does meet thosestandards to an appropriate degree (1999).
Others have focusedmore specifically on critical thinking as applied to argumentation.Mark Battersby, for example, defines it as “the ability andinclination to assess claims and arguments” (2016, p. 7), andstresses the importance of evaluating evidence to expose falseclaims. Regardless of whether the definition is generic or specific,though, most writers agree that critical thinking is a habit thatrequires practice to master.
..and why shouldyou
give a fuck?
Far from a bourgeoisideology, critical thinking is a necessary tool for anarchists.Anarchism demands that individuals be able to think accurately andeffectively. From being able to spot exploitative power structures tounderstanding the minutiae of alternative economic theories,anarchism is far more than just tossing pipe bombs at cop cars. Eventhe most aware anarchist is in danger of falling for misinformation,conspiracy theories, and cults of personality— and before you thinkyou're immune, remember that you have identical brain structures tothe people who fall for it all the time. To avoid those traps,anarchists need to be able to think for themselves. When done right,critical thinking is a necessary step in the path to liberated,individual thinking.

## Here’s the plan

There’s alongstanding debate about whether critical thinking skills aregeneralizable (in that there is a single skillset that applies to allareas of inquiry) or if it’s domain-specific (in that eachdiscipline—math, science, history, philosophy, etc.—has its ownset of critical thinking skills). I’m choosing to split thedifference. InPart One, we'll address two generalizableskills: first, we'll discuss evidence gathering and assessment, andsecond, we’ll talk about heuristics, biases, and fallacies. InPartTwo, I'll present a guide to critical thinking specificallydesigned for anarchists, based on Daniel Willingham’s 2019 paper“How to Teach Critical Thinking.” Willingham outlines four stepsthat should be taken when teaching critical thinking about any topic:first, identify what “critical thinking” means in that domain;second, identify the knowledge that is necessary for eachunderstanding of critical thinking, third, create a sequence in whichthat knowledge should be learned; and fourth, revisit and relearn.With that, let’s get started.
When assessing any proposition, argument, or problem, a good thingto ask is:how good is the evidence?Every argument requiresevidence: if someone were to claim that leprechauns are real, weshouldn’t take their claims at face value. Rather, we should askfor the proof. After that, we should assess if the evidence theyprovide is adequate.
In his bookIs That a Fact?Mark Battersby dividesthe assessment process into two steps. First, ask if the evidencesupports the determination. He uses the example of a letter to theeditor
published in 7ime, in which the author claims that her“85-year-old mother powerwalks two miles each day, drives her car(safely), climbs stairs, does crosswords, reads the daily paper andcould probably beat [your columnist] at almost anything.” Thus, sothe writer believes, people in this era must be “living to ahealthy and ripe old age” (2016, p. 14). As Battersby points out,however, just because the writer’s grandmother does these thingsdoes not mean that all elderly people can do these things—thepremise does nothing to support the conclusion. Whether or not theevidence is true, you should be skeptical of an argument if theevidence doesn’t provide any basis for the conclusion. Second, youshould ask if the evidence is credible. If the above mentioned writerhad cited a study instead of using her own grandmother as an example,you should ask if the sample size was adequate and if the study wasfunded by organizations that may have an interest in promoting itsconclusion. Or if she had cited a poll conducted among seniorcitizens, you should pay attention toquestion bias(when thephrasing of the poll questions influences the responses) andcontextbias(when the context of the poll, such as a preliminaryintroduction by the researchers or the environment of the responder,influences the responses) (Battersby, 2016, pp. 29 & 52). Aboveall, you should seek to verify that the information being given toyou is correct—if the premise is false it could point to an invalidor unfounded conclusion.
Philosophical razors are rules of thumb that can be used tometaphorically “shave off” unlikely premises and conclusions. Theprinciple ofparsimony, for example, holds that explanationsshould be as simple as possible. The most famous formulation of it,Occam’s Razor, states that we should only accept the morecomplicated theory if the simpler one cannot explain the event(Battersby 2016, p. 23). If you hear a crash, walk upstairs, and seea baseball, broken glass, and a group of kids with bats and mittsrunning away, the most likely explanation is that they were playingbaseball and hit a ball through your window. The theory that aliensbroke your window and planted the baseball there to frame theinnocent kids should likely be rejected unless the first explanationdoesn’t account for some aspect of the situation.
Similarly, theSagan Standard, attributed to Carl Sagan inhis bookBroca’s Brain, holds that extraordinaryclaims require extraordinary evidence (1979, p. 73). The claim that anew treatment will cure any type of cancer in less than twentyminutes requires much more proof than the claim that diet andexercise help you lose weight. There are many other philosophicalrazors in existence, but a word of caution: while razors provide goodbases for ruling out bad arguments, they are not foolproof. Though itis overwhelmingly unlikely, perhaps aliens did plant that baseball,and that new treatment does cure cancer. So, while they may provide aquick-and-easy method of detecting bullshit, they are not infallible.

## Heuristics

Human beings (yourself included) are prone to biases, fallacies,and unclear thinking. The work of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman(1974) showed that we tend to rely on quick rules of thumb, calledheuristics, when making probability judgments. While usefulwhen making quick decisions, heuristics are prone to error, as whenone estimates the probability of a heart attack occurring among acertain age group based on how many people they know have had heartattacks. Who you know that has had a heart attack has no bearing onthe actual percentage of people that do, similar to how Battersby’swriter assumed that all elderly people are fit and healthy becauseher grandmother is.
Cass Sunstein (2005) extended Tversky and Kahneman’s work toinclude moral judgments, identifying a list of heuristics that tendto guide us when making ethical decisions. He includes, for example,the Betrayal Heuristic (in which an offense that includes a betrayalof trust is often judged as more immoral than one that does notinclude treachery, such as a close friend stabbing someone in theback rather than a known rival) and the Outrage Heuristic (in whichmost people’s judgment of how harsh a punishment should be isrelated to how outraged they are by the offense). Like Tversky andKahneman, he argues that these rules of thumb are prone to givinginconsistent or incorrect guidance. One thing to watch out for whenassessing claims (especially your own claims!) is the underlyingheuristics that the claimant is using.

## Biases

A number of other cognitive biases exist, too.Confirmationbiasis the tendency for individuals to unconsciously rejectinformation that doesn’t align with their existing beliefs. AsMargit Oswald and Stefan Grosjean put it, confirmation bias meansthat “information is searched for, interpreted, and remembered insuch a way that it systematically impedes the possibility that thehypothesis can be rejected” (2004, p. 79).
Framing effectsoccur when individuals draw differentconclusions from the same information depending on how thatinformation is presented. People are more likely to buy yogurt thatis advertised as “92% fat free” than they are yogurt that isadvertised as “8% full fat” even though they are the sameproduct. This is because the advertiser is “framing” the firstwith positive language and the second with negative. Problematically,this means that “people will choose inconsistently in the sense ofmaking different and opposed choices in decision problems that
areessentially identical” (Kamm, 2007, p. 424)—in other words, how aproblem is framed will affect what people decide to do about it, eventhough the framing doesn’t actually have anything to do with theproblem.
Finally, theillusory truth effectoccurs when continuedrepetition of a claim causes it to seem truer than alternatives, evenif it is false. First identified in a 1977 paper by Lynn Hasher,David Goldstein, and Thomas Toppino, they found that their testsubjects rated a statement as more likely to be true if it wasrepeated to them rather than if they read it once. Importantly, thisis a prominent reason why propaganda techniques such as theBigLie(like Trump’s claim that he won the 2020 election) and thefirehose of falsehood(like Trump’s constant and endlesslying) work.

## Fallacies

Unlike heuristics and biases, which affect how people processclaims, fallacies are mistakes made in the reasoning behind claims.There are hundreds, but below are some of the more common ones:
Sweeping generalization— The arguer expands aspecific case into a general principle that does not always apply.For example, claiming “People from that city are always rude”takes what may be true of some residents (rudeness) and generalizesit to all residents.
Begging the question-The arguer leaves out animportant premise to their argument, usually because they assumethat it is settled and does not need to be addressed. The claim“Killing an innocent person is murder. Murder should be illegal.Therefore, abortion should be illegal” leaves out thecontroversial premise “abortion is murder.”
Ad hominem– The arguer attacks the character oftheir opponent rather than discussing the issue at hand. Forexample, claiming, “You don’t know anything about climatechange, you’re too young and inexperienced” avoids engaging withthe hypothetical young person’s argument by dismissing it based ontheir youth.
Straw man– The arguer takes another’s argument,extends it to an extreme, and then easily dismisses it. This makesit seem as if the arguer succeeded in defeating the originalargument,
but they have only torn down the extended version of it.For example, the claim “My opponent wants to reduce carbonemissions. Clearly, what he really wants is to ban all cars and shutdown factories” takes a reasonable argument (reduce carbonemissions) and blows it up into an extreme not found in the originalargument (banning all cars and shutting down factories).

## PARTTWO

## DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SKILLS

Now that we’ve covered some general critical thinking skills,let us turn to Willingham’s plan to teach domain-specific skills.The first step is to identifywhat critical thinking means foranarchists. So, what should anarchists be able to do with theirthinking? While this list is by no means exhaustive, below are someideas.

## Power & Hierarchy

Key to an anarchist evaluation of the existing social norms is theidentification of existing hierarchies. After all, one of the coreaxioms of anarchism is that people have no obligation to follow thosein power (Crowder, 2005). This set of skills may include spottingclassism/racism/sexism/ableism, identifying structural violence, andrecognizing cults of personality. Bonus points for assessing the roleof police, politicians, and judges in perpetuating injustice.

## Economics

Economic theory is one of the cornerstones of anarchist thought.It is not only important to learn and understand anarchist models(anarcho-syndicalism, anarcho-communism, etc.) but also to study thecaptalist model that anarchism is working to overthrow. Skills inthis area include the ability to discover and analyze laborexploitation and the basic knowledge required to understand thefoundations of neoliberalism, communism, and socialism.

## Media

Media can be both a tool of the state and a source of the truth.On the one hand is the corporate media that, as Peter Gelderloos haspointed out, exists only to “fatten the wallets of their executivesand shareholders” and maintain social control (2004). On the otheris, well, this zine! Skills in this area include identifyingpropaganda, discovering the sources behind specific information andnarratives, and uncovering media bias in all of its forms (cf.Chomsky & Herman, 2002).

## Organization

What’s the point of being an anarchist if you aren’t willingto act? Critical thinking skills in this area include identifyingmethods to engage with activists in other spheres, organizingprotests, and advocating for alternative systems. Also included inthis area are skills related to the history and praxis of anarchism,especially learning from past and present successes and failures.
Now that the goals of anarchist thinking have been identified, thesecond step in the process is togather the knowledge necessary toreach those goals.Every problem requires the requisitebackground information in order to solve it. The example Willinghamuses is a historical letter: to analyze a letter written by asergeant before a battle, one needs to know the context in which theletter was written, the role of sergeants in the military, andknowledge of the war in general (2019).
There is quite a bit of knowledge that is necessary for anarchiststo think critically. Existing anarchist theory provides a solidfoundation: a working knowledge of Bakunin, Kropotkin, Goldman,Zerzan, Marx, and others is _ indispensable. With this theory inhand, anarchists can learn to identify exploitation, material andsocial inequalities, and the class-based structures inherent tocapitalism. An understanding of the ideological details of fascismand other ideologies opposed to anarchism can help with spottingpropaganda as well, especially if that propaganda is particularlysubtle (it doesn’t have to be the Two Minutes Hate to bepropaganda).
Familiarity with politics, news, and world events is alsoessential. The world has seen a resurgence of right-wing populismrecently that is threatening to undermine our collective rights. Anygood anti-fascist should be able to discuss why it has arisen and howto address it.
Knowledge about the struggles of our trans, gay,disabled, BIPOC, and marginalized brethren is likewise necessary todismantle the barriers preventing us from full equality.
This list is not complete and is only meant to point criticalthinkers in the right direction. Remember, knowledge is power, andpower begins with knowledge.
Willingham’s third step is toidentify the order in whichskills should be learned. In most subjects, complex knowledge isbuilt on a foundation of more basic information: musicians learnscales before they learn to improvise, artists learn to draw basicshapes before they draw hands, and math students learn algebra beforethey learn calculus. While this sequence can be flexible (as itshould be— everyone learns information differently and at differentrates), here is the sketch of a plan.
Phase I: Foundations
This includes learning about the core concepts of anarchism, suchas anti-authoritarianism, liberty, solidarity, and direct action. Oneshould practice spotting power structures in daily life, such aspolice presences and workplace managerial hierarchies. This stageshould also include practice identifying common statist andcapitalist arguments.
Phase II: Critique
This phase begins applying anarchist ideas from Phase I toreal-life situations. It includes critiquing capitalism, the state,and the media, analyzing the successes and failures of historicalexamples of anarchism, and getting involved in collectives, unions,and other groups in the anarchist milieu.
Phase III: Praxis
This phase is advanced practice. It includes tackling complexdebates within anarchism (such as violence vs. pacifism andindividualism vs. collectivism), critically assessing both anarchistand non-anarchist movements, evaluating (and originating) tactics fororganizing, and creating alternative and anarchist media such aszines, papers, and teachins.
Critical thinking is not something that one learns once and cansimply use forever. Rather, it takes continual practice to cultivate.Willingham stresses that the fourth step is torevisit eachcritical thinking skillover time in order to master it. Oftentimes the application of these skills will change, as new questionsand problems arise in which they are put into use. It helps, however,to be deliberate about putting these skills into practice.
Engaging with fellow anarchists and others can help to keepcritical thinking sharp. Start a reading group to discuss anarchistliterature or regularly get together with non-anarchists to debatethe merits of decentralized systems. Join a mutual aid organizationin order to help others or plan a protest with other activists. Theopportunities to interact with others are endless.
Critical thinking skills can be honed individually as well.Regularly challenge your own assumptions and thought processses whenconsidering important questions or problems. Consider alternatescenarios to every solution you find and actively test your ideas inthe real world. Resist accepting easy answers, and work to applyanarchist frameworks to daily life (like usingprefigurativepoliticsto imagine the world as it could be).
Anarchists often rally a round the slogan “No gods, no masters.”While a great phrase, it shouldn’t mean “no thought” as well.In fact,anarchism demands more thinking in order to work.Willingham may show how critical thinking can be taught, butanarchists must take those skills to go forth and build a worldwithout domination. In order for this guide to be useful, it shouldbe used—so please, go forward and practice these skills (for all ofour sakes).
