It’s not just consensus rather avoiding up to now—is why anthropologists process: the idea of mass non-violent direct action first haven’t, so far? I have already described why I think developed in South Africa and India; the current academics, in general, have rarely felt much affinity network model was first proposed by rebels in with anarchism. I’ve talked a little about the radical Chiapas; even the notion of the affinity group came inclinations in much early twentieth-century anthro- out of Spain and Latin America. The fruits of ethnog- pology, which often showed a very strong affinity with raphy—and the techniques of ethnography—could be anarchism, but that seemed to largely evaporate over enormously helpful here if anthropologists can get time. It’s all a little odd. Anthropologists are after all past their—however understandable—hesitancy, owing the only group of scholars who know anything about to their own often squalid colonial history, and come actually-existing stateless societies; many have actually to see what they are sitting on not as some guilty lived in corners of the world where states have ceased secret (which is nonetheless their guilty secret, and no to function or at least temporarily pulled up stakes and one else’s) but as the common property of humankind. left, and people are managing their own affairs
