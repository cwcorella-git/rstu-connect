Use the form email from KEEP YOUR RENT - TORONTO or write your own. Emphasize that keeping our rent is something everyone can and should do. How can you reach tenants at your building? Stay safe. Don’t knock on doors or pass flyers hand to hand. We need to be very careful not to spread COVID-19. Instead, put up posters on the streets in your area. Prioritize busier areas like major intersections, around grocery stores and convenience stores. To reach tenants in your building, post flyers in your building’s lobby. At a safe distance, have brief conversations with neighbours you see. Collect tenants’ phone numbers and email addresses on your own phone. How will you communicate with your neighbours? Once you have collected contact information from a few tenants, set up an email list, WhatsApp group, and/or a phone list. Experiment and find out what platform works best for people.

How can you expect your landlord to respond? Your building committee should be prepared to respond if your landlord tries to retaliate against tenants. KEEP YOUR RENT - TORONTO is here to take action alongside tenants against landlord retaliation. Keep in touch! Your landlord may try and undermine your organizing by offering rent deferral plans to individual tenants. Your building committee should respond by clearing stating that tenants should not have to pay rent April 1 and that no tenant should have to repay it in the future. Your landlord may threaten legal action against tenants (see FAQ). KEEP YOUR RENT - TORONTO has members who are lawyers and paralegals who can provide tenants with information and advice. ``` --'
