How to defend yourself during a police interrogation Date: Unknown Source: https://libcom.org/article/how-defend-yourself-during-police-interrogation Tags: Projet-Evasions.org, police An interrogation is not a harmonious exchange between two individuals. It’s a conflict.And in this conflict, our ignorance is our strength. Ignorance of the meaning of police work, ignorance of the manipulative techniques used, ignorance of the legal framework and, last but not least, ignorance of our means of defence.In response to this observation, this book is intended as a tool for self-defense against police interrogation practices of interrogation. You can find thePDF-versionhere. [Libcom note - and below.] In summer 2022, 2000 copies of this book were printed inFrenchFrench and 2000 inGerman. The french version is now sold out, and the Publisher «Éditions du Commun» had now reissued the book. The book was written with the intention of serving as a tool of self-defense against the manipulative interrogation strategies employed by the police. As stated in the introduction, “It addresses readers in various countries in which legislation may differ“. And indeed, we soon received feedback that the content conveyed by the book is equally applicable to countries such as Turkey, Morocco, Serbia, Italy, Denmark, and many more. And soon a number of supportive people were offering to translate the book into other languages. This is what happened with the English version, and we’d like to take this opportunity to warmly thank our translator and proofreader for their fine work. As a consequence of imperialism and colonization, English is spoken today in contexts as diverse as Kenya, Australia and, of course UK and the USA. So many different places from which you may be reading these words, and where the contexts of repression are very different. Most of what is conveyed in the book applies to all these contexts, but, in case of doubts, it makes sense to keep an eye out for certain elements that differ and check them with your local legal team. Our network lacks relays in the English-speaking world, so let us take this opportunity to pass on the message that we are looking for a publishing house or a collective that would be interested in printing and distributing the book in its geographical regions. With these words, we wish you a pleasant reading. Project-evasions – network of anarchist friendships
