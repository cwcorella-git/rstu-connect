## Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism
## in Interwar Japan
                Author: John Crump

## 433–551 minutes

## This book is dedicated to Derek and Marjorie Crump, who
                taught me that no things are more important than mutual love,
## social justice, and decency in human relations.

## Acknowledgements

                Writing this book has involved a great deal of painstaking work
                and most of my ‘spare time’ during the past five years. What
                has made it worthwhile, in addition to the fascination of the
## subject, are the many fine people who have helped and
                encouraged me during those years. The main fieldwork for the
                book was carried out during 1990, when a fellowship from the
## Japan Foundation enabled me to spend three months at Keiō
                University in Tōkyō. I chose to be based at Keiō because the
                foremost authority on Japanese anarchism, Komatsu Ryūji, is a
                professor there. His encouragement, interest and unparalleled
## knowledge of the subject enriched my time in Japan
## enormously. I also incurred considerable debts to Ōshima
## Eizaburō and Mihara Yōko. Ōshima-san has spent a small
## fortune in financing Kokushoku Sensensha’s (the Black

## Battlefront Company) republication of numerous, otherwise
## unobtainable, anarchist texts. As one of the few surviving
                anarchists of the interwar era, he also provides an inspiring link
                with the past. I gratefully acknowledge the fact that much of
                the research material I obtained from him was priceless in both
## senses of the word. Discussions with Mihara-san always
## enlivened my visits to Kyōto and study of her informative
## writings on anarchism in interwar Japan provided me with
                much food for thought. I am particularly grateful to her for
                efficiently answering several requests for factual clarification
                after I returned to England. Another person whose kindness I
## wish to acknowledge is Mochizuki Akiyoshi, who permitted me
## to include in this book a sketch of Hatta Shūzō which was
                drawn by his father, the famous anarchist artist Mochizuki Kei.

## In Europe my thanks are mainly due to friends and comrades
                whose interest in my research encouraged me to believe, even
                when the going was tough, that the project was worthwhile. I
                cannot mention them all by name, but it would be churlish to
## omit the following four. Adam Buick in London and Peter
## Nicholson in York were kind enough to comment on early
                chapters of my manuscript. I am grateful for their useful and
## informed criticisms. Alain Pengam in Paris read the entire
                manuscript and thus I benefited from his detailed knowledge of
## anarchist communism. Mark Shipway in Leeds also read the
## entire manuscript and his many helpful comments were
                unfailingly meticulous in their attention to detail and their
## communist content. I am pleased to be able to use this
                opportunity to pay tribute to Mark as an exemplary friend and
                comrade. Last, but not least, come the three women in my life.

## With good humour. Emily Midorikawa Crump and Erica
## Midorikawa Crump put up with their father’s strange
                enthusiasms for visiting obscure bookshops, for paying respect
                at the graves of fallen revolutionaries, and for interminable
## discussions on the minutiae of anarchist communism. Their
                only resistance as they traipsed behind me across the length
                and breadth of a very different Japan from that which features
## in the glossy brochures was to rename Hatta Shūzō ‘Hatta
## Shoesore’. Midorikawa Taeko helped me in more ways than she
## knows or I can record. Her just being there was no less
                important than her obvious role of checking my translations of
## the pure anarchists’ Japanese on the many occasions when
## they expressed themselves in language which was even more
## convoluted, polemical or jargon-ridden than usual. The best
                compliment I can pay to these women in my life is that, if ever
## we do achieve a society which is both anarchist and
## communist, it will be inhabited by people like them.

                Introduction: the Importance of Pure Anarchism

## ‘Pure anarchism’ was the dominant current within Japanese
## anarchism during the interwar years. Its adherents were

## anarchist communists who wished to rid anarchism of the
                ‘impurity’ of syndicalism. It might well be asked: why write a
                book on these pure anarchists? After all, did they not ultimately
## fail in their attempt to establish an anarchist communist
                society and are they not largely forgotten today even within
                Japan? Besides, was it not Spain where anarchism’s life-anddeath struggle was fought in the 1930s? Why, then, should we
## in Europe pay much attention to what happened during
                roughly the same period in an East Asian country, far removed
## from the drama in Spain?

## In reply, I can give at least three reasons why a study of
                Japanese pure anarchism is worthwhile. First, the image of the
## Japanese (including Japanese working men and women) which
                has prevailed in the West during recent decades has been of an
## overwhelmingly conformist and docile people. The oft-
## repeated epithet ‘economic animals’ has been used to
## describe the apparent character of the Japanese during much
## of the postwar period and has conveyed their seeming
                indifference to political principles or ethical questions. At an
                early stage of my research into pure anarchism I read a paper
## on ‘The Communist Idea in Japan’ at a seminar in Oxford,
                where I was criticised because I had supposedly overlooked the
                ‘fact’ that the Japanese are the most unrevolutionary, order-
## loving and conformist people in the world. Of course, this
                widely held image derives from attributing to all Japanese in all
                eras certain characteristics which, even if present today (and it
                is arguable that they are nowhere near as universal as is often
                claimed), are of very short historical duration. Not only does
                this image conflict with the perception of the Japanese as a

## revolutionary people, which was widespread throughout East
                Asia in the years following the upheaval of 1868, but it also
                clashes with the supposedly unJapanese concern for political
                principles and ideological clarity which was demonstrated by
                the pure anarchists of the interwar years. Hence one reason for
## writing a book on the pure anarchists is that I think it is
                instructive to draw the attention of Western readers to those
                ‘other Japanese’, those whose very existence (irrespective of
## their concrete achievement) modifies the negative image
## projected by their depressingly conformist countrymen and
## countrywomen.

                A second reason for my interest in the pure anarchists is that
## they represent an authentically Japanese expression of the
## universal principles of communism. By communism I mean, of
## course, not the system of bureaucratic power, party
## domination, and state manipulation of the economy found in
                countries such as (until recently) Russia and China, but the
                project to reorganise society so as to achieve a community of
## social equals who would control the means of production
                communally, cooperatively organise production for the direct
                satisfaction of needs, and consume by taking freely from the
## commonly held wealth of society. Such a vision of social
                reorganisation got its first fully worked-out presentation in
## Japanese when Petr Kropotkin’s (1842–1921) The Conquest of
                Bread was translated in 1909. Although The Conquest of Bread
## struck a responsive chord among many radical Japanese of
                that era, it remained very much a Japanese translation of an
## essentially European work. The very title The Conquest of
                Bread (as opposed to The Conquest of Rice) indicates the (for

## many Japanese) exotically European flavour of Kropotkin’s
## passionate arguments for communism. Kropotkin remained
## the dominant influence on the pure anarchists during the
## interwar years and this was reinforced when his Collected
                Works were published in Japanese from 1928. Nevertheless, by
## that period communism had been fully assimilated by its
                Japanese exponents, so that by then the pure anarchists were
                able to relate it thoroughly to Japanese society and present it to
                a Japanese audience in an authentically Japanese form. Thus,
                when the pure anarchists wrote texts of their own to popularise
## communism, the commune which they, like anarchist
## communists everywhere, advocated as the unit of communist
## society had ceased to be a European transplant from
                Kropotkin’s texts and was clearly a Japanese farming village,
                transformed by an anarchist revolution no doubt, but none the
                less Japanese for that. Likewise, those who were expected to
                bring about this social transformation were not cosmopolitan
## revolutionaries expressing European concepts in
## katakanaesque Japanese, but flesh and blood products of
## Japanese society, such as the tenant farmers.

## Several years ago Maximilien Rubel and I edited a volume of
                essays under the title Non-Market Socialism in the Nineteenth
                and Twentieth Centuries.[1] ‘Non-market socialism’ was a
## synonym for what I have referred to here as ‘communism’.
## Although in that earlier book we chose not to use the word
## ‘communism’ because of our concern that it might be
## misinterpreted as having a connection with the political
## systems formerly or actually found in Russia, China and
                elsewhere, there is no alternative to employing the term here,

                since ‘anarchist communism’ was the declared aim of the pure
## anarchists. Our theme in Non-Market Socialism in the
## Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries was that, although a
## communist society has so far never been achieved anywhere,
## communism has nevertheless had a constant, if unsteady,
                existence during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as a
                challenge to the ideology of capitalism. For as long as there has
## been industrial capitalism, groups of working men and women
## have reacted to its existence, and to the indignities and
                irrationalities which inevitably accompany it, by formulating a
## communist alternative. The book argued that neither social
## democracy nor bolshevism represented communist challenges
## to capitalism, since both were variations on the capitalist
## theme, in that they left intact the principal constituent
## elements of capitalism (the wages system, commodity
## production, state power and so on). The real challenge to
## capitalism has come from quarters other than social
## democracy or bolshevism, and the currents we examined as
                different versions of this communist challenge in the various
                chapters of our book were the following:

            1. Anarchist communism, represented from approximately 1880
                onwards by a string of thinkers and activists, such as Kropotkin
## and Alexander Berkman (1870–1936).

            2. The impossibilism of currents such as the Socialist Party of
                Great Britain, which was founded in 1904 in the course of the
                split between ‘possibilists’ and ‘impossibilists’ in the ranks of
## the Social Democratic Federation in Britain.

            3. The council communism associated with the German
                Revolution of 1918 and its aftermath, which was articulated by
7 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## theoreticians such as Anton Pannekoek (1873–1960), Otto
## Ruhle (1874–1943) and Paul Mattick (1904–81).

            4. Bordigism, which takes its name from Amadeo Bordiga (1889–
                1970), the first leader of the Communist Party of Italy, before
## the leadership of that party passed in 1924 to others more
## acceptable to the Comintern, such as Antonio Gramsci (1891–
## 1937).

            5. The situationism of the Situationist International, whose
## activity spanned the period 1957 to 1972 and was one of the
## streams feeding the upheaval in Paris in May 1968.

                Considered in isolation, it is tempting to dismiss any one of
## these five currents as too weak to be of much significance.
                Taken together, however, they represent a sustained critique of
                capitalism and a consistently posed, communist alternative to
## it. Naturally, there have been differences between these
## currents, which have kept them divided and over which they
## have argued (particularly with regard to the question of
                means), but each in its own way has effectively kept alive the
                goal of a communist society and has thus prevented capitalism
                from enjoying unchallenged ideological supremacy. What gives
                these currents added significance as a collective phenomenon
## is that they have emerged largely independently of one
## another at different historical junctures and in different
## geographical locations. Bordigism is as recognisably the
## product of Italian influences and circumstances as
## impossibilism owes much to its Anglo-Saxon origins. The
## repeated emergence of these organisationally separate and
                culturally distinct formulations of what still remains essentially
                the same communist alternative to capitalism suggests that it

                is in the nature of capitalism, wherever it exists, to evoke a
## communist response which does not vary in its fundamentals.
                From the standpoint of the late twentieth century, it may look
## as though capitalism rules the world untroubled and has
## successfully countered all attempts to replace it by
## communism. Yet, as the existence of these communist
## currents demonstrates, despite its apparatus of ideological
## domination, capitalism has proved unable to eradicate an
## alternative communist vision of how society could be
                organised. As long as varieties of this communist alternative
                remain to haunt capitalism, its supremacy is less than total and
                the possibility of achieving communism cannot be discounted.
                It is with these considerations in mind that I have approached
                the study of the Japanese pure anarchists. Since capitalism is a
## world phenomenon, it would be strange indeed if communist
                ideological challenges to capitalism were all of European origin,
## like the five currents mentioned above. Obviously, of the
## European communist currents which I have identified,
## Japanese pure anarchism had most in common with European
                anarchist communism. Nevertheless, as I indicated earlier, the
                pure anarchists did not simply repeat parrot-fashion lessons
## learnt by rote from the European anarchist communists. The
                ability of the pure anarchists to take account of the way in
## which capitalism had developed in Japan, and to respond
                creatively to its special features by offering an alternative
## which was no less communist for being rooted in Japanese
## conditions, is further confirmation of the argument that
## capitalism invariably evokes a communist response from
## within the ranks of those whom it oppresses and exploits.

## Hence, despite Japanese pure anarchism’s lack of concrete
                success, its very existence can be regarded as significant when
## it is set within the international context outlined above.
## Particularly if one’s knowledge and experience of communism
## hitherto have conspired to give it the appearance of a
                predominantly European ideological construct, it can be more
                than a little exciting to recognise the pure anarchists as the
                Japanese equivalent of the European currents to which I have
## alluded.

                A third reason for writing a book on the pure anarchists is the
## sophisticated theoretical level which the best among them
                were able to achieve. Writing from a European perspective in
## his chapter in Non-Market Socialism in the Nineteenth and
## Twentieth Centuries, Alain Pengam claimed that after
## Kropotkin’s death in 1921 the theory of anarchist communism
                survived for a while, ‘but was consigned to isolation by the
## unfolding counter-revolution from the 1920s onwards’.

                Unlike the Italian Left [Bordigists] and the German-Dutch
                council communists (the latter above all, with their criticism of
                the whole workers’ movement and their analysis of the general
                tendency for a unification of labour, capital and the state), the
                partisans of anarcho-communism did not really try to discover
                the causes of this counterrevolution; nor did they perceive its
                extent. As a result, their contributions amounted to little more
                than a formal defence of principles, without any critical depth.
                Moreover, these contributions ceased very rapidly. Sebastien
## Faure’s Mon Communisme appeared in 1921, Luigi Galleani’s
## The End of Anarchism? in 1925 and Alexander Berkman’s
## What Is Communist Anarchism? (better known in its abridged

                form as the ABC of Anarchism) in 1929.[2]

## Even with regard to Spanish anarchism, Pengam was sceptical
                whether the collectivisations in Spain from 1936 contained any
## anarchist communist potential, since he regarded Spanish
                ‘libertarian communism’ of the 1930s as an ‘empty phrase’.[3]

## The contrast between the withering of anarchist communist
                theory in Europe after the First World War and its flowering in
## Japan during the interwar years is striking. As will be
## demonstrated in Chapter 1, in Europe after 1918 anarchist
                communists were largely content to echo Kropotkin’s writings
                and even tolerated a dilution of theoretical clarity, with the
## result that eventually anarchist communism ceased to have a
## coherent identity of its own and was incorporated into the
## wishy-washy cocktail of nondescript ‘anarchism’. By way of
                contrast, in interwar Japan the confrontation between anarchist
## syndicalists and their pure anarchist opponents forced the
                latter to define ever more clearly the theoretical bases of their
                activity. As a result, the interwar years were a period of intense
## theoretical innovation in Japan and, in contrast to what
## happened in Europe, anarchist communist theory did not
                stagnate at the points at which Kropotkin had left it or, worse
## still, even regress. There is a tendency among Japanese
## commentators to regret the confrontation that occurred
## between anarchist syndicalists and pure anarchists, and to
                regard it as the suicide of a movement already beleaguered by
## the twin enemies of capitalism and bolshevism. Yet, without
                such intense polemics between anarchist syndicalists and pure
## anarchists, anarchist communism would probably have
## withered on the bough in Japan as in Europe, so that there

## would be no particular reason today for studying a movement
## which displayed the same fading qualities as its
## contemporaries in Europe.

## Among the theoreticians of pure anarchism none was more
                innovative or determined to rid anarchist theory of extraneous
## elements, derived from syndicalism or elsewhere, than Hatta
                Shūzō (1886–1934). Even in Japan, Hatta is largely forgotten
                these days outside of anarchist circles. I spent several months
                in Japan in 1990, engaged in research for this book, and I was
## struck by the fact that mention of my research theme
## prompted most scholars with whom J came in contact to dive
                for the biographical dictionary on their shelves to discover who
## on earth was Hatta Shūzō. Needless to say, in the West the
                situation is bleaker still and Hatta is totally unknown. This is
## incongruous, since in the West at least something is known
## about Japanese anarchism and, for example, both Kōtoku
## Shūsui (1871–1911) and Ōsugi Sakae (1885–1923) have had
                (albeit unsympathetic) biographies written on them by
                American scholars.[4] In Chapter 2 I explain Kōtoku’s and
                Ōsugi’s contributions to anarchism in Japan and it is certainly
                far from my purpose in this book to belittle either of them. Both
## are towering personalities in the history of Japanese
## anarchism. Yet it is also fair to say that neither can be
                considered to have made a significant, original contribution to
                anarchist theory. On the international level they are secondary
                figures, since the roles they fulfilled were mainly to introduce
                and popularise Western theories of anarchism in Japan. By way
                of contrast, fate has not been kind to a gifted and original
## thinker like Hatta. Language has acted as a barrier to an

                appreciation in the West of his stature as a theoretician, while
## in Japan the prevalence of bolshevism within the relevant
                scholarly circles has caused him to be ignored. Hopefully, the
                publication of this book, which is the first full-length study of
## Hatta Shūzō and pure anarchism to appear in any language,
                will belatedly bring to Hatta and his comrades a little of the
## recognition they richly deserve.

                At any rate, to return to my first two reasons for writing this
                book, the reader can be assured that the chapters which follow

## the same sources were to be believed, is supposed to be a

## introduced to Japan early in the twentieth century. In this
                chapter I shall give an account of anarchist communism as it
                developed within the political and intellectual milieu of Europe
                in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Yet,
                although my focus in this chapter will be primarily European,
                bearing in mind the theme of this book, I shall pay particular
## attention to those aspects of anarchist communism which
                were to become controversial in the different setting of Japan
## in the 1920s and 1930s.

## Anarchist communism is a revolutionary theory and practice
## which seeks to establish, by means which from the outset
## transcend the state, a society where individual freedom is
## reinforced by communal solidarity and mutual aid. It is
## probably most convenient to see anarchist communism as a
## tendency which crystallised within the wider European
                anarchist movement during the 1870s. This is not to say that
## prior to then there was nobody who combined commitment to
## anarchism (abolition of the state) with advocacy of
## communism (common ownership of the means of production
## and the social product). Théodore Dézamy (1808–50) and
                Joseph Déjacque (1822–64) were two such thinkers,[5] and
## Maximilien Rubel has pointed out that, contrary to popular
                opinion, Karl Marx (1818–83) was, in the senses given above,
                just as much of an anarchist as he was a communist.[6]
## However, self-proclaimed anarchist communism emerged
                within the anti-Marxist wing of the International Working Men’s
                Association (the First International) during the period 1876–80.
## François Dumartheray (1842–1931) was the first to use the
## term ‘anarchist communism’ when he wrote a pamphlet To the

## Manual Workers, Partisans of Political Action, which was
## published in Geneva in February 1876, and Elisée Reclus
                (1830–1905) is said to have delivered a speech from an
## anarchist communist standpoint in Lausanne in March of the
## same year. Similar ideas were spreading among the Italian
## anarchists, who adopted a communist resolution at their
## congress held near Florence in October 1876. Anarchist
## communism gained a further important victory when the Jura
                Federation, which was an influential anarchist grouping that
## had been active in the French-speaking area of Switzerland
                throughout the 1870s, proclaimed itself for communism at its
## congress held at La Chaux-de-Fonds in October 1880. Carlo
## Cafiero’s (1846–92) speech on ‘Anarchy and Communism’ at
                this congress was published in the Geneva journal Le Révolté in
                November 1880 and was one of the earliest written statements
                of anarchist communism.[7]
                Cafiero explained that a communist society would function in
                line with the principle ‘from each according to his faculties to
                each according to his needs’ or, as he alternatively put it, ‘from
                each and to each according to his will’.[8] This was a break with
                the principle of collectivism which had previously prevailed in
                anarchist circles and which advocated that everyone’s share of
## the collective product should be proportional to their
## contribution to production. Cafiero recognised that
## communism was dependent on abundance, but he did not
## regard this as an obstacle ‘because in the future society
                production will be so abundant that there will be no need to
## limit consumption or to demand from men more work than
                they would be able or willing to give’.[9] He was confident that
15 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## communism would create the conditions for such an
## abundance for several reasons, the chief of which were that
## cooperation would replace competition, there would be an
## immense extension of the use of machinery, and economies
## would result from the elimination of dangerous or useless
## sectors of production. Of course, there might be certain
## temporary shortages during the initial stages of communism
## but, if so, these would be handled by adopting a system of
                rationing which accorded with people’s needs, rather than with
## the hours of work they contributed to society. Two other
## features of Cafiero’s exposition of anarchist communism to
                which attention ought to be drawn are, first, that those who
## were to bring about the new society were the people
                themselves and not some inspired minority acting for them or
                leading them: ‘the taking of possession and the enjoyment of
                all the existing wealth must be, according to us, the deed of the
                people itself’.[10] Second, while Cafiero made it clear that he
## thought in terms of a worldwide society of communism, he
                nevertheless seemed to regard ‘countries’ as the natural units
                of organisation:

## Since the common wealth is spread over the whole earth, and
                since all of it belongs by right to the whole of humanity, those
                who find this wealth within their reach and are in a position to
                use it will use it in common. The people of some country will
                use the land, the machines, the workshops, the houses, & c., of
## the country, and they will make use of it in common. Since
                they are part of humanity, they will exercise here, by deed and
                directly, their right to a share of the human wealth. But if an
                inhabitant of Peking came into this country, he would have the

                same rights as the others: he would enjoy, in common with the
                others, all the wealth of the country, in the same way that he
                had done in Peking.[11]

## Although Petr Kropotkin crossed the dividing line between
## collectivism and communism rather more tardily than some of
## his comrades, by 1883 he had become the most able exponent
                of anarchist communism.[12] In a series of articles which
## appeared between 1886 and 1891 in the Paris-based journals
## Le Révolté and La Révolte, Kropotkin thought through the
                implications of anarchist communism in a far more systematic
## manner than earlier attempts, such as Cafiero’s, had done.
## When these articles were collected in book form to become
                The Conquest of Bread (first published in Paris in 1892), they
## became what was to be for many years the best known and
## most persuasive elucidation of anarchist communist theory
                and strategy. As a trained geographer, Kropotkin was anxious
## to bring to the investigation of social phenomena the same
## scientific method that underpinned his geographical studies
## and not to indulge in metaphysical speculation of the kind
                which he associated with Marxism.[13] Hence he was at pains
## to demonstrate that anarchist communism was not a utopian
                presentation of an ideal society but a theoretical reflection of
## practical initiatives and tendencies that were at work
                throughout society. Ultimately, however, his ethical preference
## for liberty and decentralisation proved stronger than his
                scientific objectivity, causing him to misread the evident trend
                of the times: ‘everywhere the State is abdicating and
## abandoning its holy functions to private individuals.
                Everywhere free organization trespasses on its domain.’[14]

                Despite this flaw in the scientific foundation, which Kropotkin
## attempted to give to anarchist communism, in other respects
## the theory which he constructed had a coherent logic to it.
## Kropotkin’s understanding of radical social change derived
## from the experiences which dominated European revolutionary
## thought throughout most of the nineteenth century – the
                French Revolution of 1789 and the various attempts to restage
## it (albeit with an outcome other than bourgeois power) at
## junctures such as 1848 and 1871. The revolutions which
## constituted Kropotkin’s main points of reference were
                essentially local uprisings of an insurrectionary people, often
                confined to a single centre such as Paris. In Kropotkin’s view,
                the reason why initially successful revolutions had repeatedly
                led to the consolidation of authoritarian regimes of one hue or
                another was their failure to guarantee in the shortest possible
                time well-being for the people. Unless a future revolution could
## swiftly eliminate the privations (such as hunger) which had
                caused the popular uprising in the first place, the people would
                rapidly become disillusioned and fall prey to a new leadership
                eager to install itself in power by means of plausible promises
## to establish a caring government. To avoid this outcome of
## revolutionary hopes being dashed against the rocks of
## reconstituted governmental power, the means of production
## within the revolutionary area would have to be expropriated
                immediately and set to work so as to produce an ample supply
                of the goods people needed. Food, clothing and shelter would
                be distributed by the people without regard to buying capacity,
## whether measured in terms of conventional money or some
                substitute for it, such as labour vouchers. Thus everyone would
## be secure in the knowledge that they had a right to receive

## from the common wealth free supplies of consumer goods. In
                the light of the demoralising hunger that past revolutions had
## brought with them, which had caused people to lose faith in
                their ability to run society efficiently in their own interest, the
## most pressing need was for the bakeries to be communalised
                and operated to produce bread in such plentiful amounts that it
                would be freely available to all. Such a state of affairs would
                constitute the ‘conquest of bread’, which was the image that
## the title of Kropotkin’s book was designed to conjure up in
## people’s minds, and which was intended as a symbol of a
## society of plenty achieved by communal solidarity.

                Naturally, Kropotkin was not so unrealistic as to imagine that a
                revolution could immediately usher in a condition of universal
## abundance of all the numerous goods that people might
## choose to consume. Hence the principle which was to govern
## distribution was ‘no stint or limit to what the community
## possesses in abundance, but equal sharing and dividing of
                those things which are scarce or apt to run short’.[15] But in
                the case of essentials, such as food, Kropotkin considered that
## abundance could be attained rapidly and his expectation was
                that, over time, the proportion of goods needing to be rationed
## would dwindle to zero. The anarchist communist project thus
## had nothing in common with the plans of some perhaps wellmeaning but nevertheless authoritarian revolutionaries to take
                over the existing process of production and use revolutionary
## power so as to divide up the social product more equitably.
## Kropotkin believed that what made anarchist communism
## distinctive was that its approach would be not to take
                production as a given and then decide how the cake should be

                divided, but to start with the people entirely rethinking their
## consumption needs and then reorganising production so as to
## achieve the required output of goods. In other words, in
                contradistinction to conventional economics, which he saw as
## proceeding from production to consumption, anarchist
## communism would reverse the sequence, so that consumption
                determined production. When Kropotkin returned to this theme
                several years later in Modern Science and Anarchism (1903) he
                expressed himself as follows:

## Anarchism understands therefore that in political economy
## attention must be directed first of all to so-called
## ‘consumption,’ and that the first concern of the revolution
                must be to reorganize that so as to provide food, clothing and
                shelter for all. ‘Production,’ on the other hand, must be so
## adapted as to satisfy this primary, fundamental need of
                society.[16]
                When political economy was conceived in this fashion, it would
## become a science whose essence was captured by the term
## the ‘physiology of society’, since its attention would be
                directed towards ‘the study of the needs of mankind, and the
## means of satisfying them with the least possible waste of
                human energy’.[17]
                Clearly, the degree of social restructuring which would be a
                consequence of setting production on a scientific footing would
                be immense. But, given the conditions that were likely to apply
## in the event of revolution, there was an even more pressing
## need for social reorganisation than the somewhat abstract
                requirement to introduce scientific rationality into the realms of
## consumption and production. Since Kropotkin expected future

                revolutions, as in the past, to occur in limited geographical
## areas, production within a revolutionary commune would need
                to be reorganised swiftly so as to make the territory it held
                largely self-sufficient and not fatally reliant on surrounding
## areas, which might still be in the hands of the counterrevolution. To restate this in more concrete terms, if revolution
                were to break out in an urban, manufacturing centre, such as
## Paris, the city could not afford to remain dependent on the
## surrounding countryside for its food supplies. Kropotkin
                expected revolutions to occur unevenly in different localities
                and different countries, and this was a telling, practical reason
                why production would need to be diversified. with agriculture
                spreading into the towns, and industrial workshops being set
## up in those rural locations which opted for revolution. Max
## Nettlau was thus quite right when he described The Conquest
                of Bread as ‘the utopia of a large city in revolt, proclaiming its
## autonomy, besieged by enemies and working out its own
## complete social life by its own resources. It was—the
                Commune of Paris, as Kropotkin wished that it should act when
                it would happen the next time.’[18]

## In addition to the exigencies of revolution leading to the
## emergence of decentralised communes practising diversified
## production, there was a further reason why Kropotkin spoke
                out against specialisation in production and the division of
                labour within society. Not only did such arrangements create
## social imbalances, but they also resulted in lopsided
## individuals, rather than the well-rounded men, women and
## children whom Kropotkin expected to inhabit an anarchist
## communist society. No less important than achieving a

                combination of agriculture and industry in each locality was the
## desirability of bringing about a merging of ‘the husbandman
                and the mechanic in the same individual’.[19] Participation in,
                and taking an intelligent interest in, varied forms of production
## would be the guarantee that society would be made up of
## people healthy in body as well as mind. Work was to be
                restructured not only in such a way as to achieve the required
                levels of consumption but also so as to make it interesting and
## enjoyable. If such changes were made, then even urbanised
                ‘men, women and children will gladly turn to the labour of the
                fields, when it is no longer a slavish drudgery, but has become
                a pleasure, a festival, a renewal of health and joy’.[20]
                Despite the crucial need for a ‘city in revolt’ to be able to feed
## itself, it would be wrong to think that Kropotkin envisaged
## anarchist communist society as a collection of autarkic
## communes. Revolution was expected to be an ongoing process
                so that, whereas initially a revolutionary commune might have
                to exist entirely by its own efforts, surrounding areas would
                sooner or later be influenced by the revolutionary example in
## their midst. While an urban commune should endeavour to
## plough up ‘the parks and pleasure grounds of the landed
                gentry’ that fell within its area of control, and hence become
                self-sufficient in food production, it should also make practical
## efforts to win over to the revolution the peasantry in the
                surrounding countryside.[21] It is worth quoting Kropotkin at
                some length on how this should be done, because the following
## passage exposes his lack of clarity on economic relations
                between different areas:

## We must offer the peasant in exchange for his toil not

## worthless paper-money, but the manufactured articles of
## which he stands in immediate need ...

                Let the town apply itself, without loss of time, to manufacturing
                all that the peasant needs, instead of fashioning geegaws for
                the wives of rich citizens ... Let the factories and foundries turn
## out agricultural implements, spades, rakes and such-like …

                ... let them [the towns] send friendly embassies to the country
                folk and bid them in brotherly fashion: ‘Bring us your produce,
## and take from our stores and shops all the manufactured
                articles you please.’ Then provisions would pour in on every
                side. The peasant would only withhold what he needed for his
                own use, and would send the rest into the cities, feeling for the
                first time in the course of history that these toiling townsfolk
## were his comrades—his brethren, and not his exploiters …

## This, then, is our view of the whole question. Cheat the
                peasant no longer with scraps of paper—be the sums inscribed
## upon them ever so large; but offer him in exchange for his
                produce the very things of which he, the tiller of the soil, stands
                in need. Then the fruits of the land will be poured into the
                towns. If this is not done there will be famine in our cities, and
                reaction and despair will follow in its train.[22]

## The precise nature of the relationship between town and
                countryside which is described here is open to interpretation.
## On the one hand. the repeated use of the expression ‘in
## exchange’ suggests that it is a quid pro quo exchange
## relationship (even if not mediated by money) that Kropotkin
## envisages. On the other hand, the invitation from the
## townspeople to the peasants to ‘bring us your produce, and

23 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                take from our stores and shops all the manufactured articles
                you please’ implies that the relationship is to be based on free
## distribution, without regard for equivalent exchange.
                Kropotkin’s later writings did little to resolve this ambiguity and
                hence, on this important question, it was an ambivalent legacy
## which he left to later generations of anarchists.

                Other areas of ambivalence in Kropotkin’s theory of anarchist
                communism are the roles to be played by anarchist groups and
## by the labour movement. As we have seen, Kropotkin’s image
## of revolution essentially consisted of the people rising in
                insurrection. Yet, if the people as a whole were to carry out the
                revolution, what room did this leave for either anarchist groups
                or labour organisations to engage in struggles of their own? As
## far as anarchist groups were concerned, Caroline Cahm’s
## careful study of Kropotkin’s thought in the context of the
## revolutionary anarchist movement between 1872 and 1886
                led her to conclude that ‘Kropotkin stressed the role of heroic
                minorities in the preparation for revolution.’[23] The key words
                here are in the preparation for revolution. By their courage and
## daring in opposing capitalism and the state, anarchist
## minorities could teach by example and thereby draw
## increasing numbers into the struggle. But Kropotkin was not
## advocating substitutionism; the idea that a minority might
                carry out the revolution in place of the people was as alien to
                him as the notion that a minority would exercise rule after the
                revolution. In fact, Kropotkin recognised that the former would
## be a prescription for the latter.

## As for the labour movement, Kropotkin paid virtually no
## attention to workers’ organisations in the articles which

                constituted The Conquest of Bread. With the passage of time,
                however, he not only took note of the spread of labour unions
## but was loath to surrender these organisations, and the
## opportunities they provided, to social democrats and other
## opponents of anarchism. There was thus an increasing
                tendency for Kropotkin to see labour unions as organisations in
## which workers could become aware of the shortcomings of
## capitalism and, through struggle, could become conscious of
                their collective ability to run the economy without recourse to
                either the capitalists or the state. Positive evaluation of labour
## unions appeared both in the 1903 work Modern Science and
                Anarchism, where Kropotkin wrote:
                As to anarchist communism, it is certain that this solution wins
## more and more ground nowadays among those working-men
## who try to get a clear conception as to the forthcoming
## revolutionary action. The syndicalist and trade union
## movements, which permit the workingmen to realize their
                solidarity and to feel the community of their interests much
## better than any elections, prepare the way for these
                conceptions.[24]
                and in a letter to L. Bertoni (dated 2 March 1914) where he put
                it as follows:
                The syndicat is absolutely necessary .. It is the sole force of the
## workers which continues the direct struggle against capital
                without turning to parliamentarism.[25]

## Nevertheless, Kropotkin was also aware that by no means all
                unions fulfilled this function. In a letter to Max Nettlau (dated 5
                April 1895) he also argued:

                There are trade unions which egotistically struggle for higher
                wages or shorter hours [to achieve] emancipation. These
## unions are wrong, and often as monopoly-striving as
                capitalists. But labour unions, with the view of fighting against
                capitalism directly are different things.[26]

## Hence once can say that, even when Kropotkin’s earlier
## indifference towards the labour movement was replaced by
## recognition of the growing importance of workers’
## organisations, his enthusiasm was qualified by acute
## awareness of the shortcomings of many unions.

## It was the rise of the labour movement which brought about
                changes not merely in Kropotkin’s ideas, but in the character of
                the anarchist movement in countries such as France. In France
                national union federations developed in the 1880s and 1890s,
                and not a few anarchists found that the labour unions provided
                a congenial environment for their activity. From the unions’
                point of view, sections of their membership felt the need for a
                political philosophy which would give further meaning to the
                day-to-day struggles in which they were engaged and, indeed,
                would sustain them through the hardships which such conflicts
                often involved. The result was the hybrid doctrine of anarchist
## syndicalism.

                From anarchism, anarchist syndicalism derived its distrust of
                political parties and parliamentary politics, its preference for
## federal organisation rather than centralisation, and its
                anticipation of an approaching social revolution. Despite these
## anarchist elements, the importance which anarchist
## syndicalism accorded to the union form of organisation
                ensured that it was distinct from other varieties of anarchism.

## Anarchist syndicalists believed that unions (syndicats in
## French) had a potential which extended far beyond their
## primary function of defending workers’ interests within
                capitalism. Struggles by unions for limited objectives within the
## framework of capitalism were held to have a vital educative
                role, teaching workers the importance of solidarity and raising
## their sights beyond partial work stoppages to the ultimate
                objective of revolution in the form of the social general strike.
                On this reading of their significance, unions became the means
                of social revolution. In fact, even this formulation understates
## the importance attributed by anarchist syndicalists to the
## labour unions, since they believed that not only were the
                unions destined to carry out the revolution, but they would also
                provide the framework for administering the new society of the
                future. It was this set of linked propositions which lay behind
                the oft-repeated assertion made by anarchist syndicalists that,
                in organising labour unions, they were constructing the core of
                a new society within the shell of the society they sought to
## replace.

## Anarchist syndicalist influence increased within the French
## union movement throughout the 1890s and early 1900s, as
## was demonstrated by the Charter of Amiens, which the
## Confédération Générale de Travail (General Confederation of
                Labour or CGT) adopted in 1906. This charter was a declaration
## of the union movement’s independence from all political
                parties and it became a very influential statement of anarchist
                syndicalist principle. As we shall see, when the Zenkoku Rōdō
## Kumiai Jiyū Rengōkai (AlI-Japan Libertarian Federation of
                Labour Unions or Zenkoku Jiren) was formed in Japan in 1926,

## the influence of the Charter of Amiens on the platform it
## adopted at its founding conference was striking. However,
                initially the CGT’s influence was evident closer to home, as
## shown by the formation of the Confederación Nacional del
                Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour or CNT) in Spain in
## 1910.

                Organisational successes, such as the stamping of an anarchist
                syndicalist character on the CGT and the founding of the CNT,
## were matched by corresponding developments in the realm of
                theory. Yet here there were many anarchists who resisted the
                anarchist syndicalists’ tendency to see the unions as the be-all
## and end-all of the struggle for a new society. One famous
                debate was that which occurred at the International Anarchist
## Congress in Amsterdam in 1907 between the Italian anarchist
## communist Errico Malatesta (1853–1932) and Pierre Monatte
                (1881–1960) of the CGT. Monatte’s uncritical enthusiasm for
## union activity was such that it leaned towards a ‘pure
                syndicalism’ from which anarchism had been drained entirely,
## whereas Malatesta, while not opposed to anarchists being
                active in labour unions, was not prepared to allow the anarchist
## communist vision of a new society to be eclipsed by the
## immediate tactical concerns of unions engaged in the class
## struggle. This was a theme to which Malatesta was to return
                repeatedly in later years, as when he wrote:
                There are those who call themselves ‘anarcho-syndicalists’; or
                when they link up with others who are really not anarchists,
## they take the name of ‘revolutionary syndicalists’. It is
## necessary to explain what is meant by ‘syndicalism’.

                If it is a question of the sought-after future, if, that is, by

## syndicalism is meant the form of social organisation which
                should replace the capitalistic and statal organisation, then
                either it is the same as anarchy, and is therefore a term which
                only serves to confuse matters, or it is different from anarchy
## and cannot therefore be accepted by anarchists. Indeed,
                among the ideas and plans for the future put forward by this or
                that syndicalist, there are some which are genuinely anarchist,
                but there are others which present, under different names, and
                in different guises, the authoritarian structure which is the
                cause of the evils which today we complain of, and therefore
                can have nothing in common with anarchy.[27]

## As the cases of both Kropotkin and Malatesta demonstrate,
## anarchist communism was not completely overwhelmed by
                anarchist syndicalism, but it was put on the defensive, since it
## could not match the organisational achievements of the mass
## union federations, such as the CGT. The typical form of
## anarchist communist organisation was the ‘group’ of like-
## minded individuals, which would be infused with a
                recognisable ideological orientation but would lack a defined
                membership, officials, procedural rules and so forth. The only
## other elements which gave any semblance of structure to the
## anarchist communist movement were the journals they
## published. Apart from their obvious propaganda function,
                these journals provided the movement with its public ‘face’,
## and acted both as channels of communication and foci for
## coordinated activity by the otherwise dispersed anarchist
## communist groups. While most journals led a precarious
                existence, both due to lack of funds and the oppression of the
## authorities, they replaced one another in more or less

## continuous succession and hence were a constant presence in
                the collective sense, no matter how short-lived the majority of
## such publications might be.

                The reason for the tension which developed between anarchist
## communism and anarchist syndicalism during the 1890s and
## 1900s is clear enough. The anarchist communists lacked the
                mass following of the syndicats, but they could point out that
                there was a price to pay for attracting a membership that was
## primarily interested in the day-to-day struggle. Again,
                Malatesta’s writings of the 1920s provide us with one of the
## most quotable examples of the kind of arguments that were
                already circulating twenty years earlier:
                it would be a great and fatal illusion to believe, as many do,
## that the workers’ movement can and must on its own, by its
                very nature, lead to such a revolution. On the contrary, all
## movements founded on material and immediate interests (and
## a mass working class movement cannot be founded on
                anything else), if the ferment, the drive and the unremitting
                efforts of men of ideas struggling and making sacrifices for an
## ideal future are lacking, lend to adapt themselves to
                circumstances, foster a conservative spirit, and the fear of
## change in those who manage to improve their conditions, and
                often end up by creating new privileged classes and serving to
## support and consolidate the system which one would want to
                destroy.[28]

## Nevertheless, other factors were also at work which had the
## opposite effect of muting anarchist communist criticism of
## anarchist syndicalism and fostering a sense of common
                identity among anarchists of all persuasions. Faced with the

                frequently vicious repression mounted by the capitalist state,
## disputes between anarchists over the relative merits of
## communism and syndicalism often seemed like a luxury which
                neither side could afford, particularly when the authorities
                made no distinction in their attempts to suppress all shades of
                anarchist opinion. In addition, the capitalist state was not the
## only enemy with which the anarchists had to contend. It was
## galling to observe social democratic parties and reformist
## unions acquiring mass followings and thereby, to the
                anarchists’ way of thinking, raising new obstacles to social
## revolution. Confronted by the evident success of social
## democracy and reformist unionism, many anarchist
## communists, whatever their reservations about anarchist
                syndicalism, took comfort from the fact that at least some who
                called themselves anarchists were able, in certain contexts, to
## build a mass movement and outperform those who were using
## the labour movement as a means to advance their careers or
## gain political power.

                The trend towards diluting anarchist communism’s theoretical
## clarity, to which we have alluded here and which we noted
                earlier in Kropotkin’s writings, was already under way before
## the First World War, but the outcome of the 1917 Russian
## Revolution gave fresh momentum in that direction. The
## Russian Revolution raised enormous hopes among anarchist
                communists, to the extent that some, like Alexander Berkman,
## who was deported from the USA to Russia in 1919, initially
                cooperated with the bolsheviks. In a Letter to the Workers of
## Western Europe, which Kropotkin wrote two years after his
## return to Russia in 1917, he expressed enthusiasm for the

                soviets or councils of workers and peasants: ‘the idea of
                soviets, that is to say, of councils of workers and peasants ...
                controlling the economic and political life of the country is a
                great idea. All the more so, since it necessarily follows that
                these councils should be composed of all who take a real part
                in the production of national wealth by their own efforts.’[29]
## As Berkman and Kropotkin were well aware, however, the
## bolsheviks were relentlessly tightening their grip on state
                power, misappropriating the title soviet and persecuting the
## anarchists. The year 1921 saw Kropotkin’s death, the brutal
                suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion, and Berkman’s decision
## to leave Russia.

                Now the situation for anarchists everywhere was considerably
                worse than it had been prior to the First World War. Nothing had
                changed as far as the oppression enforced by capitalist states
## and the opportunistic manoeuvring of labour leaders were
                concerned. But the difficulties confronting anarchists were now
## compounded by the existence of a bolshevik regime which not
                merely outstripped the other states in the thoroughness with
## which it imprisoned and crushed the anarchists, but whose
## consolidation of state power and systematisation of
## exploitation was made easier by the aura of ‘socialism’ and
                ‘communism’ which it employed its vast resources to cultivate.
## Fighting for the lives of their movements, and beset by
                enemies on all sides, the anarchists’ pursuit of theoretical
                clarity now took second place to their struggle to survive. The
                result was that, in Europe at any rate, the distinctive theory of
## anarchist communism was subsumed into an increasingly illdefined catch-all of ‘anarchism’. Even in Spain, which after the

32 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                First World War had the largest anarchist movement in Europe,
                the slide towards theoretical imprecision took place, resulting
## in 1936 in the ultimate absurdity of ‘anarchist’ ministers
## accepting portfolios in the Republican Government.

                The tendency for anarchist communists to give ground in their
## theory can be illustrated by the case of Alexander Berkman.
                Berkman remained an anarchist communist until his suicide in
## 1936, and in 1929 he wrote What Is Communist Anarchism?
                (which, symbolically, is better known in its abridged version as
## the ABC of Anarchism). While What Is Communist Anarchism?
## remained a recognisably anarchist communist text, Berkman
## incorporated into his account of communist society and the
## means to achieve it, elements which were drawn from
## anarchist syndicalism and elsewhere. According to Berkman,
## ‘the social revolution can take place only by means of the
## General Strike’ and he considered factory committees and
## labour unions to be important training grounds for the
## revolution, since they provide the setting within which
                ‘preparation for a new economic system, for a new social life’
                can take place.[30] Not surprisingly, this led him to a positive
                evaluation of the anarchist syndicalists:

## Large numbers of progressive working-men are coming to this
                understanding: the Industrial Workers of the World and the
## revolutionary anarchist-syndicalists in every country are
                devoting themselves to this end.[31]

## The familiar elements of communism, as it had been
## envisaged by Cafiero, Kropotkin and others, were present in
                Berkman’s sketch of the new society. These included abolition
## of the state, decentralisation, voluntary labour, free

33 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                distribution of products and so forth. Yet although there were
## passages in What Is Communist Anarchism? that could be
## interpreted as references to the type of self-supporting
## communes which Kropotkin had described in The Conquest of
                Bread, the process of revolution which Berkman envisaged was
                clearly different from that which Kropotkin had anticipated.
## Whereas Kropotkin had extrapolated from previous
                revolutionary experience and had therefore thought in terms of
                localised insurrections, Berkman expected revolution to take
                place on the terrain since established by capitalist industry. The
                reason why Berkman identified the general strike as the key to
                revolution was that, for him, the crucial step in any revolution
## had become the workers taking over ‘their’ industries and
## operating them under their own control. Thus miners were to
## take over the mines, steelworkers the steel plants,
## railwayworkers the railways, and so on. When it came to
## running these industries, Berkman had the following
                suggestions to make:
                Every factory, mine, and mill should have its special workers’
## council, separate from and independent of the shop
                committee, for the purpose of familiarising the workers with
                the various phases of their particular industry, including the
## sources of raw material, the consecutive processes of
## manufacture, by-products, and manner of distribution. This
## industrial council should be permanent, but its membership
                must rotate in such a manner as to take in practically all the
## employees of a given factory or mill ... In this manner the
                whole factory or mill can consecutively acquire the necessary
## knowledge about the organisation and management of their

34 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## trade and keep step with its development. These councils
## would serve as industrial colleges where the workers would
                become familiar with the technique of their industry in all its
                phases.[32]
                Berkman anticipated that by such means industrial production
## would be democratised. It was not, however, merely the how
## but also the why of industrial production that was to be
                radically redefined. To take a concrete example:
                The coal miners, for instance, will deliver the coal they mined
                to the public yards for the use of the community. In their turn
## the miners will receive from the community’s warehouses the
## machinery, tools, and the other commodities they need. That
## means free exchange without the medium of money and
                without profit, on the basis of requirement, and the supply on
                hand.[33]

## While these suggestions represented a fundamental break
                with the methods and objective of industrial capitalism, the
                extent to which Berkman’s new society would bear the imprint
## of the society from which it sought to escape should not be
## underestimated. In contrast to Kropotkin’s hope that each
                individual in the society of the future would combine the skills
## of ‘the husbandman and the mechanic’, Berkman envisaged a
                society still populated by miners, steelworkers’, railwayworkers
## and so forth. Similarly, in contrast to Kropotkin’s idea of
                transcending the division of labour by dispersing industry into
                the villages and bringing agriculture into the cities, the physical
## and social structure of communist society as Berkman
                imagined it was still to consist of distinct foci of industry and of
                separate urban and rural locations. In this sense, it was no
35 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## mere rhetorical turn of phrase when Berkman admitted that
                ‘capitalism is the parent of the new society’.[34]

## The image of communism which Berkman’s text projected is
                one which replicates many of the structures of capitalism, even
## if strenuous efforts are made to democratise them. One can
                interpret this development in different fashions. Either the
## trend which Berkman exemplified was a case of anarchist
## communists coming to terms with industrialisation,
## recognising that some of the changes which capitalism had
                brought about were here to stay irrespective of the capitalist or
                communist nature of society, and adjusting their strategy in
                line with the increasing proletarianisation of the workforce. Or
## it was a case of anarchist communists watering down their
                theory, retreating from their earlier determination to achieve
## an entirely different society to that based on economic
                specialisation and industrial concentration, and hence diluting
## their opposition to capitalism’s division of labour.

## One final development within European anarchist communism
                that needs to be noted for later comparative purposes was the
                publication of the Organisational Platform of the General Union
## of Anarchists by the Group of Russian Anarchist Communists
## Abroad in Paris in 1926. This group consisted of anarchist
## communists who had been driven into exile by the bolsheviks
                and included Petr Arshinov (1887–1937), the principal author
## of the Organisational Platform, and Nestor Makhno (1889–
                1934), whose guerilla forces had fought against the bolsheviks
                and the Whites and had controlled large areas of the Ukraine
## between 1918 and 1921. Reflecting the defeat which the
                anarchists had suffered in Russia at the hands of the better
36 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## organised bolsheviks, the Organisational Platform sought to
## establish a General Union of Anarchists equipped with ‘a
                general and tactical and political line which would serve as a
                guide to the whole movement’.[35] What was distinctive about
                the Organisational Platform was that, while the ends to which
                the anarchist struggle was directed were defined as libertarian
## communism, whose ‘fundamental economic, social and
                juridical principle’ would be ‘from each according to his ability,
## to each according to his needs’, the means to be employed
## were totally at odds with those traditionally advocated by
                anarchist communists.[36] The strategy which the
                Organisational Platform recommended essentially consisted of
## adopting bolshevik means in order to compete more
## effectively with bolshevism and thereby achieve anarchist
                ends. The essence of this strategy is captured in the following
                passage:

## Every organisation adhering to the [General Union of
## Anarchists] represents a vital cell of the common organism.
                Every cell should have its secretariat, executing and guiding
## theoretically the political and technical work of the
## organisation.

                With a view to the coordination of the activity of all the Union’s
                adherent organisations, a special organ will be created: the
## executive committee of the Union. This committee will be in
                charge of the following functions: the execution of decisions
                taken by the Union with which it is entrusted; the theoretical
## and organisational orientation of the activity of isolated
                organisations consistent with the theoretical positions and the
                general tactical line of the Union; the monitoring of the general

## state of the movement; the maintenance of working and
                organisational links between all the organisations in the Union;
## and with other organisations.

                The rights, responsibilities and practical tasks of the executive
## committee are fixed by the congress of the Union ...

## Born out of the heart of the mass of the labour people, the
                General Union must take part in all the manifestations of their
## life, bringing to them on every occasion the spirit of
                organisation, perseverance, action and offensive. Only in this
                way can it fulfil its task, its theoretical and historical mission in
## the social revolution of labour, and become the organised
                vanguard of their emancipatory process.[37]
                Berkman’s rejoinder to this proposal was that it amounted to
                advocating an Anarchist Communist Party.[38] This was a
## perceptive comment, for in 1934 the Nihon Museifu Kyōsantō
                (Anarchist Communist Party of Japan) was formed on a similar
## platform and attempted, with disastrous consequences, to
## press bolshevik methods into the service of anarchism.

                What this chapter has sought to do is to give a brief account of
## anarchist communism’s emergence in Europe in the 1870s, its
## subsequent development into a political doctrine of
## considerable depth and sophistication in the writings of
## Kropotkin and others, and its accelerated decline after the
## Russian Revolution. As will become clear from the chapters
                which follow, the very period which in Europe saw the dilution
## of anarchist communist theory, and its absorption into the
## increasingly vague and amorphous hotchpotch of ‘anarchism’,
                was in Japan a time of intense organisational confrontation and

## theoretical controversy between ‘pure anarchists’ (as the
## anarchist communists were often known in Japan) and
                anarchist syndicalists. Instead of regressing, as in Europe, in
## Japan anarchist communist theory was developed further and
## pushed beyond the theoretical frontiers established by
## Kropotkin and his comrades. In so doing, the Japanese pure
## anarchists not merely built up a movement which bravely
## challenged the militaristic state and made important
                contributions to anarchist communist theory. In their criticisms
                of industry, science and urbanisation, they anticipated by half
                a century several concerns which have been at the heart of the
## modern Green movement, and which, indeed, have recently
                given a new lease of life to anarchist communism in the shape
                of ‘ecological anarchism’. All of these are good reasons why a
## Western-language study of Japanese pure anarchism is long
## overdue.

## 2. Japanese Anarchism to 1923

                It is an arbitrary decision where one locates the historical
                origins of anarchism in Japan. After the implantation of Western
                anarchism into Japan, Japanese anarchists identified a native
                anarchist tradition within their own culture. For example, the
## Nihon Heimin Shinbun (Japan Common People’s Newspaper) of
                20 January 1908 carried an article on the eighteenth century
## thinker Andō Shōeki, describing him as ‘an anarchist of 150
## years ago’, and in 1979 the Tōkyō-based Libertaire group
## referred to Andō as an advocate of ‘agricultural communist
                anarchism’.[39] For the purposes of this book, however, it is
                not necessary to go back further than 1906. In 1906 the most

                influential socialist of his generation, Kōtoku Shūsui, returned
                from six months spent in California and astounded his social-
## democratic comrades by questioning the usefulness of
                contesting parliamentary elections in a speech which he made
## at a public meeting held in Tōkyō on 28 June to welcome him
                back to Japan.[40]

## Kōtoku Shūsui and Anarchism

## Kōtoku had been a founder member of the Shakai Minshutō
                (Social Democratic Party) when it was formed in May 1901,
                although this venture had proved abortive since the party was
## immediately banned. He originated from Kōchi Prefecture
                which, under its pre-revolutionary name of Tosa, had been one
## of the cradles of the Japanese Revolution (the ‘Meiji
## Restoration’) of 1868. After moving to Tōkyō for higher
                education, Kōtoku had become a journalist in 1893. Ten years
                later, in October 1903, he resigned from his newspaper when it
## came out in support of the impending Russo-Japanese War
                (1904–5). The following month, Kōtoku and his comrades
## launched an anti-war journal, the weekly Heimin Shinbun
                (Common People’s Newspaper), as a result of which he was
                imprisoned for five months in February 1905 on charges arising
## from the Draconian press laws. It was Kōtoku’s direct
                experience of state repression, and his disgust with the way in
## which the figurehead of the Emperor was used to justify
                exploitation at home and militaristic aggression abroad, that
## led him from social democracy towards anarchism. For these
                reasons, his stay in the USA can be said to have brought to a
                head a development in his political ideas that was discernible
40 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                even before he left Japan.[41]

## Kōtoku’s speech on 28 June 1906 was followed by various
## articles written by him for the socialist press in which he
                expounded his new ideas. In one article he analysed the results
                of the general election held in Germany in January 1907:

## What the European working class needs is not to elect a
## majority of deputies but to gain the assurance of food and
                clothes and shelter. It does not need the eloquent phrases of
## Bebel or Jaures. What it does need is to achieve the social
                revolution. It is not laws which produce food and clothes, any
                more than it is votes which can be the means of revolution. We
                believe that if the European socialist parties persist in their
                adherence to nothing but a parliamentary policy, they will in
## the end be incapable of functioning as the revolutionary
                parties of the working class. They will end up as nothing more
                than alternative bourgeois parties. As a result, the workers
## themselves will all desert them and turn to anarchist
                communism.[42]
                A few days later, in the most famous of these articles, entitled
## ‘The Change in My Thought’, Kōtoku asserted

                A real social revolution cannot possibly be achieved by means
                of universal suffrage and a parliamentary policy. There is no
## way to reach our goal of socialism other than by the direct
                action of the workers, united as one.[43]

## Additional weight was added to Kōtoku’s pronouncements by a
                letter he received from Kropotkin, which was also published in
                the socialist press. During the six months Kōtoku had spent in
## the USA he had come under the influence of various

                anarchists, not the least influential of whom was his Russianborn landlady in San Francisco, a certain Mrs Fritz. Mrs Fritz had
                thoughtfully decorated the room that she let to Kōtoku with a
                picture of Mikhail Bakunin (1814–76) on one wall and a picture
## of Kropotkin on another, and it was she who forwarded to
                Kropotkin a letter that Kōtoku wrote in San Francisco, a letter in
                which he asked Kropotkin’s permission to translate some of his
                works into Japanese. By the time Kōtoku received a reply to his
                letter he had already returned to Japan, and it was published in
## the journal Hikari (Light) on 25 November 1906. Kropotkin’s
                letter was polite rather than stirring, but perhaps its most
                interesting feature, in view of the later anti-syndicalist direction
## taken by the pure anarchism which he inspired in Japan, was
## that his remarks reveal him at his most generous towards
                syndicalism. To the best of my knowledge, the original text of
## Kropotkin’s letter has been lost but. translating back into
                English from the Japanese, it read:

## Bromley, England
## 25 September 1906

## Dear Mr Kōtoku,

                Mrs. Fritz has forwarded your letter to me and also informed
## me that you stayed with them in San Francisco.

## I have shown your letter to several comrades and, when they
## saw that already in Japan too a start has been made on
                libertarian propaganda, I do not need to tell you how delighted
                and elated they were. A few years ago I heard that a number of
## young people in America had made a study of the
## development of the labour movement. Consequently, they

## became interested in the libertarian movement and were fond
                of reading various works of mine. I wonder if among them are
## any of your acquaintances? …

## I am sure that you will be pleased to hear that from 1
## November next we should start to publish a new English
                language journal called the Voice of Labour.[44] By calling with
                all its strength for the solidarity of the workers, this newspaper
                should be able to rid itself of any political taint. In other words,
                it will be an organ of what in France and Switzerland is called
                anti-political syndicalism. (In France, the newspaper Voix du
## peuple represents this tendency. In Lausanne too, the
                newspaper of the same name advocates this.) It is this which is
## the striking thing about the current movement—that a labour
## movement which has no connection with the parliamentary
## camp of social democracy is springing up everywhere. This
## movement is, in other words, anti-parliamentary unionism in
## the tradition of the old-time International Working Men’s
## Association. Even though this movement is more socialistic
                than the existing unions in Britain, it is not in the same camp as
## parliamentary social democracy. Our newspaper will aim to
## represent this movement and we have high hopes for its
                success. Meanwhile, the magazine Freedom will continue to be
## published as before.

## You have asked permission to translate my writings and it
                gives me great pleasure to assign that permission to you. If
## you require any of my works, I would be happy to send
## whichever of them you need.

## Yours fraternally,

            16. Kropotkin[45]

## Kōtoku’s new ideas created a sensation within the Japanese
## socialist movement and were soon taken up by many younger
                activists. A Nippon Shakaitō (Socialist Party of Japan) of some
## two hundred members had been organised on 24 February
## 1906 while Kōtoku was in the USA and, shortly after the
## appearance of ‘The Change in My Thought’ article, it held a
## conference in Tōkyō on 17 February 1907. This conference
                provided a forum for a vigorous debate between pro- and antiparliamentarians, and the state reacted to the radicalism of
## some of the views expressed by banning the Nippon Shakaitō
                on 22 February 1907.[46] Then, on 14 April 1907, a short-lived
                experiment to publish a socialist daily newspaper came to an
                end after a struggle to survive over the previous three months,
## and the daily Heimin Shinbun (Common People’s Newspaper)
                was replaced by two separate journals, representing the social
                democrats and the direct actionists respectively. The direct
## actionist paper was a bimonthly, known as the Ōsaka Heimin
## Shinbun (Ōsaka Common People’s Newspaper) after the city
                where it was published, and it appeared on 1 June 1907. Later
## renamed the Nihon Heimin Shinbun (Japan Common People’s
                Newspaper), it survived until 20 May 1908. Another bimonthly
                which also acted as a vehicle for spreading anarchist ideas was
## the Kumamoto Hyōron (Kumamoto Review), which was
## published in Kumamoto on the southern island of Kyūshū
## between 20 June 1907 and 20 September 1908. The short life
## of both journals was due to harassment by the authorities.
## Their editors were repeatedly fined and imprisoned, and
                various techniques were employed to hinder their distribution.

## Even the ostentatiously law-abiding social democrats were
                hounded by the authorities, so it was little wonder that public
                meetings organised by anarchists were regularly broken up. In
                the ‘red flag incident’ of 22 June 1908, demonstrators with red
## flags bearing the slogans ‘Anarchy’ and ‘Anarchist
## Communism’ were beaten up by the police and some, like
## Arahata Kanson (1887–1981), Ōsugi Sakae and Yamakawa
                Hitoshi (1880–1958) (who were all able. young activists in their
## twenties and under Kōtoku’s influence), were subsequently
## given prison sentences of several years.

                It was under such repressive conditions that the pioneers of the
## anarchist movement in Japan absorbed Western theories of
## anarchism and attempted to relate them to the realities of
## Japanese society. Two key texts which Kōtoku was determined
                to translate into Japanese after his return from the USA were
## The Social General Strike and The Conquest of Bread. The
## Social General Strike was a short pamphlet which Kōtoku had
                acquired in the USA, where it had been published in 1905. Its
## author was the German anarchist Siegfried Nacht (1878–
## 1956), who was better known by the pseudonym ‘Arnold
## Roller’, which was the name which appeared on the cover of
## The Social General Strike. Translated into Japanese, it was
## mimeographed in 1907 and distributed under the deliberately
                innocuous title Keizai Soshiki no Mirai (The Future of Economic
                Organisation). Circulated secretly from hand to hand between
## trusted comrades, it became an extremely influential text
## within the nascent anarchist movement in Japan. Work on a
## Japanese version of The Conquest of Bread got under way in
## 1907 and extracts appeared in the Nihon Heimin Shinbun and

## Kumamoto Hyōron as they were translated during 1907–8.
## Ōsugi and Yamakawa translated sections of The Conquest of
                Bread, but their imprisonment in 1908 prevented their further
## involvement in the project. Eventually Kōtoku completed the
                entire translation and 1,000 copies were printed in 1909. Police
                raided the publishing house but were able to seize only twenty
                copies since, in a similar fashion to The Social General Strike,
## the rest had already been distributed among students and
## workers throughout Japan.

                In contrast to Kropotkin’s account of anarchist communism in
## The Conquest of Bread, which was discussed in the previous
## chapter, Arnold Roller’s pamphlet was unambiguously
                anarchist syndicalist. It presented unions as the means both for
                effecting revolutionary change and for administering the new
## society. Capitalist production was to be paralysed by a
                coordinated strike which would spread to all industries, so that
                ‘the whole class of workers finally refuse to work for the whole
                class of capitalists’.[47] Revolution was thus envisaged as the
## culmination of the class struggle between workers and
                capitalists, the confident expectation being that neither the
                accumulated wealth of the capitalist class nor their control of
## state power would be an adequate match for the
                determination of the working class and its organised strength.

## There was considerable enthusiasm among Japanese militants
                for the anarchist syndicalist strategy outlined in The Social
## General Strike, despite the yawning gap between theory and
                practice. The ‘Public Peace Police Law’ of 1900 had outlawed
## union organisations, so that those inclined to anarchist
## syndicalism were restricted to theoretical discussion and

## prevented from any attempts to organise syndicats among the
                growing working class. Nevertheless, despite repression by the
## state, there was a feeling among some anarchists that
                syndicalism fitted the circumstances created by the increasing
                industrialisation of Japan. The forces of capital and the state
                were committed to transforming Japan into an industrial power
                and syndicalism was seen as a fitting response on the part of a
                working class which was as much the product of the drive for
## industrialisation as were factories and machinery. Even as
                syndicalist-inclined anarchists chafed under the restrictions
                imposed by the state, they could console themselves with the
                thought that, by encouraging industrialisation, the state was
                planting the seeds that would ultimately lead to its overthrow.
                Evidently, this was the train of thought of a contributor to the
## Kumamoto Hyōron in 1908, who referred to Roller’s pamphlet
                and wrote: ‘when the time is ripe and somewhere a strike
                breaks out, it is bound to spread elsewhere and provoke a so-
## called general strike and the workers will set about
                expropriation’.[48] Insurrectionary strikes, such as that which
                occurred at the Ashio Copper Mine in February 1907, were also
                taken as pointers to the future. As the daily Heimin Shinbun
                commented:

## In Japan we do not know whether or not in the future
                revolutionary labour unions will be organised. But when we see
## the strikes which recently have been occurring in various
                places, we have no doubt that the working class is gradually
                becoming conscious of its solidarity and the strength of its
                direct action.[49]

## Like The Social General Strike, The Conquest of Bread also

## evoked a ready response in Japan. The impact which
                Kropotkin’s book made was due to the fact that, in addition to
                offering a vision of the future, there were obvious similarities
## between the anarchist communism which it portrayed and
                various features of traditional peasant life in Japanese villages.
                Rice cultivation, and the maintenance of the water system on
## which it depended, required a high degree of communal
                solidarity. Similarly, although the market economy increasingly
                impinged on the villages, there still remained areas of peasant
                life into which monetary transactions rarely intruded. Hence it
## is not difficult to see how experience of life in a peasant
## community, remote from the centres of commercial and
## governmental power, could have the effect of making readers
## of The Conquest of Bread receptive to its arguments for a
## society of autonomous communes engaged in decentralised
## production. A good example of the influence exerted by
## Kropotkin is provided by The Peasant’s Gospel, which Akaba
                Hajime wrote in 1910. In this booklet Akaba sought to establish
                the connection between the ‘village community’ of a vanishing
## past and the local commune of the anarchist communist
                future. As Akaba put it:
                We must send the land robbers to the revolutionary guillotine
                and return to the ‘village community’ of long ago, which our
## remote ancestors enjoyed. We must construct the free
## paradise of ‘anarchist communism’, which will flesh out the
## bones of the village community with the most advanced
                scientific understanding and with the lofty morality of mutual
                aid.[50]
                It would not do to leave Akaba’s case without mentioning that

                he was forced to go underground after illegally distributing his
## booklet in 1910, was eventually apprehended, and died in
## custody in 1912.

                There were various reasons why, in this earliest phase of the
## anarchist movement in Japan, the differences of goal and
## method that existed between anarchist communism and
                anarchist syndicalism went largely unnoticed. First, as we have
                seen, Kropotkin’s letter had given an impression of unqualified
                support for ‘anti-political syndicalism’. Kropotkin was then at
## the height of his prestige among anarchists everywhere and
## had not yet tarnished his name by taking sides in the First
## World War. In addition, there were cultural reasons why, in
                Japan, even anarchists tended to defer to those whom age and
## reputation endowed with supposed ‘authority’. Many young
## anarchists looked up to Kōtoku, while Kōtoku in his tum
## habitually referred to Kropotkin as sensei (‘master’ or
                ‘teacher’). Hence casual remarks by Kropotkin could assume a
## significance far beyond what was intended or envisaged.

                Second, even as it attempted to establish itself, the anarchist
                movement in Japan was already fighting for its life against the
                state. The intensity of persecution by the state increased year
                by year, so that for many anarchists the battle for personal
                survival absorbed much of their energy, leaving little time for
## pondering over theoretical questions. Kōtoku accurately
                conveyed the situation that confronted many anarchists in the
                translator’s note which he appended to The Conquest of Bread
                in 1909: ‘Many of the comrades in Tokyo gradually lost their
                jobs and their houses. All were threatened by hunger.’[51]
                Clearly, a barely established movement experiencing this level

## of persecution did not provide the type of environment in
                which the clarification of theoretical issues could easily be
## pursued.

                Third, from the very outset the Japanese anarchists were also
                fighting on a second front against the social democrats. Those
## who turned to anarchism in 1906 and succeeding years had
## virtually all previously been social democrats. As they
## detached themselves from social democracy, they were
## criticised by those among their former comrades who
                continued to adhere to social democratic theory and practice.
                In the words of Katayama Sen (1859–1933), writing in less than
                perfect English:

## The Socialist movement of Japan is somewhat crippled and
## hindered on account of anarchistic views held by some who
                profess to be ... socialists and hold some influence among their
## Comrades. Those who have gone over to Anarchism oppose
                legislative and parliamentary tactics and political movement,
## and preached so-called direct action or a revolutionary or
                destructive general strike. We are sorry that some of our best
## Comrades have changed to the above views and no longer go
                with us, the international Socialists![52]

## Not surprisingly, such criticism from those whom they had
## previously regarded as their comrades stung the early
## Japanese anarchists and this explains why so much of their
                effort was directed towards justifying their new ideas. It was
                natural that the need they felt to explain why they had broken
                with social democracy took precedence over any inclination to
## probe for inconsistencies between different varieties of
## anarchism.

                Finally, and most importantly, it was the state’s prohibition of
                unions which defused any potential tension between anarchist
## communism and anarchist syndicalism. Only where unions
                existed, as in contemporary Europe, did the question arise of
                the extent to which the tactics which flowed from pursuing the
## day-to-day struggle over wages and working conditions were
                in harmony with the strategy required to achieve a stateless
## society. As long as unions were banned, notions such as the
                proletariat ‘taking possession through its labor unions of all the
                means of production’ (Roller) and ‘a free society ... seeking in
                free groups and free federations of groups, a new organization’
                (Kropotkin) remained highly abstract propositions and the
                possibility that they might be in conflict was obscured.[53]

## High Treason and its aftermath

                In 1910 Japanese anarchism met with disaster in the shape of
## the ‘high treason case’. Frustrated by the intolerable
## repression which the state enforced, a handful of militants
                started to make plans for a bombing campaign. The state took
                advantage of this and rounded up hundreds of radicals, most of
## whom had no direct connection with terrorism. Eventually 26
## were brought to trial in December 1910 and 12 of these were
## hanged in January 1911. Among those executed was Kōtoku,
## and also others who were certainly innocent of the charges
## brought against them. The remaining 14 defendants received
                long prison sentences (12 of them life terms). The round-up of
                1910 signalled the start of the ‘winter period’ for anarchism in
                Japan, which was to continue until the end of the First World
## War.

51 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                During the ‘winter period’ the state suppressed all anarchist
                and socialist organisations and kept a careful watch on those
## whom it regarded as infected with ‘dangerous thoughts’.
## Known militants had police tails assigned to them and were
                kept under observation twenty-four hours per day (a political
                police unit had been set up as early as 1904 at the time of the
                Russo-Japanese War). Under such conditions, overt activity, or
                even the publishing of recognisably anarchist literature, was
## impossible. Many former activists had no alternative but to
                withdraw from the cities and live quietly in the countryside,
                waiting for the opportunity to take up the struggle again, or
                even to go into exile. Yamakawa Hitoshi was one of the former.
## Having completed a two-year jail sentence arising from his
## involvement in the ‘red flag incident’, he retreated to the
                countryside in 1910 and did not reappear in Tōkyō until 1916.
                In Ishikawa Sanshirō’s (1876–1956) case, after two spells of
                imprisonment in 1907–8 and 1910, he left Japan for Europe in
## 1913 and did not return until 1920. However, others such as
## Arahata Kanson and Ōsugi Sakae, both of whom emerged from
## prison in 1910, were determined to keep alive the spark of
                anarchism during the ‘winter period’, whatever the obstacles
## that confronted them.

## With Kōtoku dead, a younger generation of anarchists now
                came to the fore and, in so doing, shifted the centre of gravity
## further towards anarchist syndicalism. As I have indicated,
## prominent among these anarchists were Arahata and Ōsugi,
                both of whom had been arrested in the ‘red flag incident’ and
                who, thanks to their imprisonment, had escaped the dragnet of
## the ‘high treason case’ and possible execution. Ōsugi Sakae

## was the most colourful personality among his generation of
## anarchists and, in conjunction with the sharpness of his
                intellect and his wide-ranging talents. this made him from now
                on the dominant figure in Japanese anarchism until his murder
                in 1923. He was the son of an army officer and had been sent
                to a military academy as a boy in anticipation that he would
                follow in his father’s footsteps. A rebel from his early days, he
## was expelled from the academy, and went on to study
## principally French at the Tōkyō Foreign Languages School.
                (Ōsugi was a considerable linguist and one of the founders of
## the Esperanto movement in Japan.) It was as a student in
## Tōkyō that he became involved in the socialist movement at
                the time of the Russo-Japanese War. Ōsugi was one of the first
                to be influenced by Kōtoku’s changed political position, so that
## by December 1906 Kōtoku was writing that ‘Comrade Ōsugi is
                a young Anarchist student and a best friend of mine.’[54] From
## then on Ōsugi’s knowledge of French made him the principal
## source of information in Japan about the CGT and European
## anarchist syndicalism generally.

                In October 1912, less than two years after Kōtoku’s execution,
## Arahata and Ōsugi started to issue a monthly journal called
## Kindai Shisō (Modern Thought). Ostensibly a literary-cumphilosophical magazine, it nevertheless acted as a vehicle for
## surreptitiously explaining and discussing the theories of
## anarchist syndicalism. As Ōsugi put it, Kindai Shisō
## ‘disseminated among young students revolutionary ideas
                under a scientific, literary and philosophical form’.[55]
## Encouraged by the relative success of Kindai Shisō, Arahata
                and Ōsugi then organised in Tōkyō a Sanjikarizumu Kenkyū Kai
53 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                (Society for the Study of Syndicalism) in July 1913. Meetings
                were held at least monthly and lectures were delivered on the
## CGT and on the syndicalist movement associated with Tom
## Mann in Britain, although the ensuing discussions could not
## avoid being somewhat abstract since most of those attending
## were young intellectuals who had never ventured inside a
## factory. As the journal Rōdō Undō (Labour Movement)
## commented when it posthumously summarised Ōsugi’s
                activity during the ‘winter period’, ‘the workers were still totally
                unconscious and those who attended were principally literary
                youths’.[56]

## Impressive though their achievements were in publishing
## Kindai Shisō and organising the Sanjikarizumu Kenkyū Kai,
## Arahata and Ōsugi were not likely to remain content with
                preaching to a largely intellectual audience. In October 1914
                they suspended Kindai Shisō and attempted to replace it with a
## more combative journal whose title, Heimin Shinbun (Common
                People’s Newspaper), recalled earlier struggles. Most issues of
                this journal were suppressed, leading to its discontinuation in
## March 1915, and although the attempt was then made from
                October 1915 to revert to Kindai Shisō, having blown its cover,
                this too was now repeatedly banned and ceased publication in
## January 1916. During the rest of the ‘winter period’, small
                groups of anarchists bravely attempted to launch publications
                with titles such as Rōdō Kumiai (Labour Union) [1916], Bunmei
                Hihyō (Critique of Civilisation) [1918], Aofuku (Overalls) [1918]
                and Rōdō Shinbun (Labour Newspaper) [1918]. All were
                suppressed and their editors were often imprisoned under the
## press laws.

## Whereas both anarchist communism and anarchist
## syndicalism remained discernible strands within Japanese
                anarchism during the ‘winter period’, various factors combined
## to induce the pendulum to swing further towards anarchist
                syndicalism. First, as the principal theoretician of anarchist
## communism, Kropotkin’s reputation in Japan as elsewhere was
                diminished within revolutionary circles by the support he gave
                to France and its allies during the First World War. In Japan
## anarchists of all persuasions remained firmly committed to
                anti-militarism and rightly regarded Kropotkin’s position on the
                war as a betrayal of anarchist principles.[57] Second,
                conscious of their exposed position as intellectuals who lacked
## any means of resisting persecution, there was a tendency
                among anarchists to look to the growing number of industrial
                workers as the social group which was best placed to turn the
## tide of state oppression. Industry was vital to the state’s
## military as well as economic ambitions and, to many
                anarchists’ way of thinking, this was potentially a trump card in
## the hands of the workers, once they became aware of their
## collective strength. It was argued that, although the state
## might seem to have enormous forces at its disposal, in the
                shape of the police, the army, the judiciary and so forth, all
## these could be neutralised once the workers organised
                themselves in syndicalist-style unions armed with the crippling
                weapon of the general strike. Third, since distance and lack of
                accurate information added to its reputation, the example of
                the CGT’s supposedly ever expanding organisation and activity
## in France excited many anarchists in Japan. Even though the
## CGT proved quite incapable of unleashing the general strike
                against the catastrophe for the working class of mass slaughter
55 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                in the First World War, it still dazzled many anarchists in Japan
## and was seen by them as a role model for their movement.

## Finally, due to his stature within the anarchist movement,
                Ōsugi’s personal enthusiasm for anarchist syndicalism exerted
## considerable influence over his comrades. Ōsugi combined a
## passionate commitment to personal liberation, expressed as
                much in his lifestyle (for example, in his relations with women)
## as in his writing, with support for the aims and methods of
                anarchist syndicalism. The title of one of his articles in Kindai
## Shisō, ‘The Labour Movement and Individualism’, neatly
                captures the essence of his political creed.[58] In another
                article, entitled ‘The Creation of Life’, he wrote:
                In brief, this minority [the anarchists and syndicalists] is in this
## way gradually destroying the foundations of the existing
                society and developing elements of the new society within the
## framework of the old. And when this process has gone far
                enough, they will demolish in a last great struggle this edifice
## which they have undermined and build the new society which
                they have been constructing within themselves.[59]
                In the morally and politically stifling climate of the ‘winter
## period’ it was hardly surprising that many young anarchists
                were attracted by Ōsugi’s fusing of individual rebelliousness
## with support for anarchist syndicalism.

                It was difficult for the anarchists during the ‘winter period’ to
## keep open lines of communication with other countries, but
## nevertheless they were aware that tension existed between
                anarchist communists and anarchist syndicalists in Europe. Yet
                although they could follow the dispute in intellectual terms, the
56 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## absence of unions deprived the issues of any immediate
## relevance in Japan. The detached manner in which the
## anarchists viewed this dispute from afar during the ‘winter
                period’ is conveyed by the following remarks by Ōsugi:

## A long way away as we are, we can look calmly at the
                relationship between both parties. And it seems to us that the
                inevitable tendency in both cases should be for anarchists to
## become unionists and for unionists to become anarchists, so
                that in the end there is perfect agreement between them. The
                vague, abstract theories of Kropotkin and others have become
                clear and concrete in the unions. And the unions, which for a
## long time have been weak and uncertain of themselves, have
## learned through experience and, thanks to anarchism, are at
                last marching straight ahead in a definite direction.[60]

## As the later course of events was to show, Ōsugi’s
## recommendation that anarchists become unionists and vice
                versa, ‘so that in the end there is perfect agreement between
## them’, proved easier said than done. For the time being,
                however, many anarchists in Japan shared Ōsugi’s belief that it
                was the combination of personal rebellion with the building of
                syndicalist unions that would bring about the realisation of an
## anarchist society.

## The End of the ‘Winter Period’

## The ‘winter period’ came to an end not because the state
                voluntarily suspended its repression, but because it was forced
## to give ground by a wave of struggles which engulfed Japan
## towards the end of the First World War. The years 1915–18

## were boom years for Japanese capital due to the commercial
## stimulus provided by a war in which Japan was only
## peripherally involved militarily. Fortunes were made by
## Japanese companies, banks and investors, but little of this
## prosperity trickled down to ordinary men and women. There
                was runaway inflation in 1917 and 1918, in the face of which
                the harshly disciplined workforce in the factories found its
## wage levels progressively eroded. The result was that, even
## though the law prohibited strikes, tens of thousands of
                increasingly desperate workers were forced into often violent
                confrontation with their employers and with the state, since
## the police regularly became involved in labour disputes.
                According to available figures, 57,309 workers were involved in
## 398 disputes in 1917 and 66,457 workers in 417 disputes in
                1918 (out of a total workforce in all factories of less than 1.5
## million).

                The rampant inflation particularly affected the price of the
                staple food, rice. This brought no benefits to most of the rice-
## growing farmers because much of the crop had to be handed
                over to landlords as rent in kind and the rest was often sold in
## advance in order to raise the money needed to pay taxes.
## When such farmers later came to buy back rice for
## consumption, they were confronted by the same relentlessly
                rising prices as afflicted working class families, the fishing
                communities and other non-farming sectors. It was against this
                background that rice riots swept across Japan in the summer of
## 1918. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children
                were involved in these incidents, which look in most of Japan
                except for a few of the northernmost areas. In major cities,

## such as Ōsaka and Kōbe, there were pitched battles with the
## police, troops were mobilised, and destruction was on a
## considerable scale.

                Persecution of the anarchists did not cease when the ‘winter
## period’ came to an end. Among other forms of continuing
                oppression, public meetings were still frequently ordered to
## close, issues of journals were often banned from sale and
## employers were invariably prompted to sack known activists.
                But the blanket suppression of all activity, which had previously
## been enforced, now became impossible to maintain. Nor were
## anarchists the only ones to find themselves with more room
                than previously in which to manoeuvre and one result of this
## changing environment was the emergence of a union
## movement. As early as 1912 a class-collaborationist body.
                appropriately known as the Yūaikai (Friendship Society), had
## been formed and had probably been tolerated by the police
## both because of its minuscule size (it started with 15
                members) and because of its conciliatory objectives. Although
                the Yūaikai was initially derided by the anarchists, they started
                to pay more attention when, in the closing years of the First
## World War, it grew rapidly into a sizeable federation and
                became more combative under pressure from its rank and file.
## By the end of the war the Yūaikai had a membership
## approaching 30,000 and by 1921 it had changed its name to
## Nihon Rōdō Sōdōmei (Japanese Confederation of Labour),
## which was generally abbreviated to plain Sōdōmei.

## When they were first formed, almost all unions were led by
                reformists of one type or another. Even though many of these
                reformists came to use the vocabulary of socialism when it was
59 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## expedient to do so, they were not seeking any fundamental
                change in capitalist social relations. At worst, such reformist
                leaders were out to make a career for themselves by using the
                labour movement as a stepping stone; at best, they sought to
                improve the conditions of the workers within capitalism while
                leaving the wages system intact. A typical example of one of
## the more high-minded leaders was Kagawa Toyohiko (1888–
## 1960) who played a prominent role in the Kansai labour
## movement during its early years. As a Christian social
## reformer, Kagawa hoped for a gradual improvement in the
                social order, leading eventually to a system of institutionalised
## collaboration between the government, the unions and organs
## representing consumer interests. Following the Russian
## Revolution and the fascination which bolshevism started to
                exert over some Japanese radicals, the reformists were joined
                by a new type of aspiring labour leader who sought to imitate
                the strategy recently employed by Lenin’s parry in achieving
                power. For Japanese bolsheviks the unions became targets for
                infiltration, with the aim of using the workers’ struggles to
                undermine the established order, win power for the party and
                establish a similar regime to that already achieved in Russia.

## Among the anarchists there was virtually unanimous
## enthusiasm for the emergence of a union movement. Even
## those anarchists who harboured doubts about the efficacy of

                positively, believing that they provided a useful field of activity
                for anarchists and a means of self-assertion for the workers.

                efforts. Many anarchists threw themselves into the struggle to
## rid the unions, both inside and outside the Yūaikai/Sōdōmei
                federation, of their manipulative leaders. In view of the degree
## to which this struggle for the heart and soul of the union
                movement absorbed the energies of anarchists, it is tempting
                to characterise the years immediately following the First World
## War as a period when anarchist syndicalism predominated
                almost entirely. To put it this way would be an overstatement,
## however. The battle between the union leaders, whether
                reformist or bolshevik, and the anarchists was essentially over
                the issue of whether there should be centralised control and
                direction of the movement or a decentralised, federal structure
                allowing for initiative and autonomous action by the rank and
                file. Anarchists of all persuasions were drawn to the latter
## alternative and did not need to be committed anarchist
                syndicalists in order to join the battle to resist the union
## leaders. Hence, despite the enthusiasm for anarchist
                syndicalism on the part of Ōsugi and others, anarchist activity
                in the unions was pitched more at the level of resistance to
## centralised authority than strict adherence to syndicalist
                principles. The struggle to defeat the reformists and bolsheviks
## within the unions actually worked to defer any attempt to
                implement a syndicalist strategy. Only later, when the union
## movement split irrevocably, with reformists, bolsheviks and
## anarchists each in control of their own section, would the
                setting be created in which anarchist syndicalism could be put
                to the test and each anarchist would have to take a stand for or
## against syndicalism.

                There were by this stage significant numbers of anarchists in

## many sections of the workforce, but the hardest core of the
## anarchist union movement was undoubtedly made up of
## printworkers. In 1916 a typically named Shinyūkai (Sincere
                Friends’ Society) printing union had been formed on a purely
## reformist footing. By 1919 it had 1,500 members and was
                abandoning its initial reformism for anarchism. The same year,
## a major dispute between the Tōkyō newspaper companies and
                another reformist union ended in defeat for the workers. In the
                wake of this dispute, an anarchist-inclined union, the Seishinkai
                (Righteous Progress Society), was organised among the
## newspaper workers with an initial membership of some 500.
                Together, the Shinyūkai and Seishinkai became for many years
## the stronghold of the anarchist union movement and their
                influence was further enhanced when, in 1923, they linked to
## form a general printworkers’ union federation, which had
## achieved a combined membership of 3,850 by 1924. It was a
                sign of the times that, when Ōsugi and his comrades launched
## a new journal, Rōdō Undō (Labour Movement) in October 1919,
                it was no longer merely a vehicle for popularising the ideology
                of anarchist syndicalism but carried detailed reports on labour
## disputes as they occurred throughout Japan. Rōdo Undō‘s
                publication was frequently interrupted, due to repression and
                shortage of funds, but it continued to appear, in one form or
## another and despite gaps of several months, until October
## 1927.

                Although virtually from their emergence the unions provided a
                forum for clashes between reformists and anarchists, with the
## bolsheviks also soon becoming involved, initially there was
## room for a limited amount of cooperation before positions

## hardened into irreconcilable battlelines. Prominent among
## those who turned to bolshevism, and who went on to
                participate in the founding of the Nihon Kyōsantō (Communist
                Party of Japan) in 1922, were a number of former anarchists,
                including Arahata Kanson and Yamakawa Hitoshi. Despite their
## new-found sympathy for bolshevism, Arahata and Yamakawa
                contributed articles to the early issues of Rōdō Undō and there
## was sufficient cooperation among unions of different
                ideological orientation for several thousand workers jointly to
                take pan in the first ever May Day demonstration in Tōkyō on
## Sunday 2 May 1920. Encouraged by the success of May Day, a
## Rōdō Kumiai Dōmeikai (Labour Union Alliance), encompassing
## unions as varied as Sōdōmei, Shinyūkai and Seishinkai, was
## formed on 16 May 1920. Another example of an initial
## willingness to cooperate was the invitation by a Comintern
## agent to Ōsugi to visit Shanghai in October 1920 for
                discussions. Ōsugi accepted this invitation and, although he
## refused to abandon anarchism for bolshevism, he did receive
## ¥2,000 from the Comintern in order to relaunch Rōdō Undō,
## which had temporarily ceased publication in June 1920. The
                second series of Rōdō Undō, which lasted from January to June
## 1921, marked probably the high point of cooperation between
## anarchists and bolsheviks in Japan, both standpoints being
                aired in the columns of that journal. Parallel to this, an attempt
## was made in 1920 to organise a broadly-based Nihon
## Shakaishugi Dōmei (Japanese Socialist League) which would
## encompass various shades of opinion, including anarchists,
                bolsheviks and reformists. Although its founding conference,
## held in Tōkyō on 9–10 December 1920, was disrupted by the
## police, with many arrests, it had achieved a membership of

## approximately 1,000 by that stage and was publishing the
                journal Shakaishugi (Socialism). Three thousand attended the
## second attempt to hold a conference in Tōkyō on 9 May 1921,
## but the police again ordered the meeting to close and soon
## after banned the organisation entirely.

## These attempts to find a basis for cooperation between
                anarchists, bolsheviks and reformists proved short-lived and,
                even without the repressive actions of the authorities, would
                have foundered on the differences in theoretical outlook and
## organisational practice which existed between the various
                camps. Even at the height of anarchist-bolshevik cooperation,
## there were anarchists who resisted the compromises which
                this involved and criticised Ōsugi’s acceptance of Comintern
## funds. Those anarchists grouped around the journal Rōdōsha
                (Worker), which was published from April 1921 until May 1922,
## made a sharp distinction between workers and intellectuals.
## They counted among the latter not merely the Japanese
## bolsheviks, with their aspirations to leadership, but also
## anarchists such as Ōsugi who, they argued, had ‘committed
## the biggest mistake of his life’ in compromising with
                bolshevism.[61] In fact, it did not take long for Ōsugi himself to
## reappraise his cooperation with the bolsheviks. Ōsugi was a
## careful reader of (and often translated into Japanese)
## Alexander Berkman’s and Emma Goldman’s (1869–1940)
## reports on the Russian government’s persecution of the
                anarchists, its treacherous attack on Nestor Makhno’s forces as
## soon as the common enemy in the shape of the White armies
                had been defeated, and its bloody suppression of the Kronstadt
## rebellion in 1921. Ōsugi shared Berkman’s and Goldman’s

## estimation of the Russian Revolution and concurred that its
## potential for human liberation had been wrecked by the
                bolsheviks’ consolidation of state power and their enforcement
                of a form of exploitation which was essentially capitalist. By
                September 1922 Ōsugi was asking ‘to what extent was the life
## of workers in the new Russia, where state capitalism and
                private capitalism exist side by side, basically different from
                the life of workers in those other so-called “capitalist countries”
                where there is private capitalism?’[62] By January 1923 he was
## answering his own question by asserting that ‘the New
## Economic Policy has cast the chains of wage slavery for the
## Russian proletariat and has dragged the workers down into a
                worse situation than the conditions of labour found in other
                capitalist countries’.[63]
                Within the unions, the triangular rivalry between reformists,
                anarchists and bolsheviks ultimately undermined all attempts
## at cooperation. While anarchist elements within Sōdōmei
## never ceased to denounce the reformism and parliamentarism
## of its leaders, the reformists reciprocated by attacking
## anarchism as destructive adventurism and urged Sōdōmei
## members to ‘dissociate themselves from frenzied, extremist
                groups which believe in socialism’.[64] Despite the relative
## success of the 1920 May Day demonstration, there was
## tension in 1921 between reformists and anarchists over the
                readiness of the latter to turn May Day into a confrontation with
                the authorities. Not only were there clashes with the police on
                this occasion, but reformist and anarchist unionists also came
                to blows. One of the issues at stake in the disputes between
## reformists and anarchists was the nonproletarian background

## of many of the reformist leaders. As a Seishinkai spokesman
                put it from the May Day platform: ‘We are opposed to people
## from the intellectual class assuming the leadership of the
                labour movement.’[65] As a result of this rivalry, and in the
## wake of the May Day brawls, the Sōdōmei leaders and the
## unions they controlled withdrew from the Rōdō Kumiai
## Dōmeikai on 4 June 1921.

                In September 1922 there was one final attempt to form an all-
## encompassing federation of unions. The founding conference
## of the Zenkoku Rōdō Kumiai Sōrengō (All-Japan General
## Federation of Labour Unions) was held in Ōsaka on 30
## September 1922 and attended by 106 delegates, representing
## 59 organisations with a combined membership of over 27,000.
## As usual, this conference ended prematurely when the police
                ordered the meeting to close but, even before this occurred,
                the discussions which did take place revealed the unbridgeable
## gap between the anarchists and their opponents. Once again
                the numerous differences, both theoretical as well as practical,
## which existed between the various camps found their most
## concentrated expression when the question of organisational
## structure was debated. The anarchists stood for a
                decentralised federation, while the reformists and bolsheviks
                opportunistically united on this issue and backed each other’s
## determination to establish a centralised leadership with
## powers of direction.

## The failure to establish the Zenkoku Rōdō Kumiai Sōrengō
## brought to a close the period of albeit limited cooperation
## between the anarchists and their reformist and bolshevik
## opponents. Anarchist elements were henceforth either driven

                out of Sōdōmei or forced to conform to policies decided by the
## leadership. The reformists and bolsheviks maintained an
                uneasy cohabitation within Sōdōmei until the organisation split
                in 1925. At that stage the reformist leadership retained control
## of 35 unions with around 20,000 members, enabling them to
                cling on to the title Sōdōmei, while the bolsheviks set up the
## Nihon Rōdō Kumiai Hyōgikai (Japanese Labour Union Council),
## comprised of 32 unions with 12,500 members. It was against
## this background that in 1926 the anarchists formed the
## Zenkoku Rōdō Kumiai Jiyū Rengōkai (All-Japan Libertarian
                Federation of Labour Unions), bringing together 25 unions with
## a combined membership of 8,372.

## However, during the period covered by this chapter, the
## anarchists remained in unaffiliated unions and dispersed
                groups, wim no umbrella organisation to link them. Following
## the abortive founding conference of the Zenkoku Rōdō Kumiai
                Sōrengō, 20 unions signed a joint declaration which appeared
## in Rōdō Undō in November 1922. This declaration, which was
## entitled ‘Announcement to the Workers Throughout the
                Country’, stated its support for ‘libertarian federation’ and
## expressed opposition to ‘combination based on centralised
                authority’. The list of signatories reveals that, besides their
## preponderance among the printworkers, the anarchists had
## considerable support at this time among the watchmakers,
## general labourers, tramworkers, shipbuilders, engineering
## workers, communication workers and other sections of the
                workforce.[66] Certain local unions, such as the Shibaura
## Labour Union, which had been formed in November 1921,
## were also strongly anarchist. As for the anarchist groups,

## adorned with often extravagant . names such as the
                Girochinsha (Guillotine Society) or Futeisha (Outlaws’ Society),
## they were mostly short-lived but replaced one another in
                uninterrupted succession. Their activity was as varied as their
                names, some being essentially groups whose raison d’être was
                the publishing of a journal, others inclining towards terrorism,
## some lending support to the workers’ struggles and others
## throwing themselves into the tenant farmers’ disputes.

## This was roughly the situation of anarchism in Japan when
                disaster on a similar scale to that inflicted by the ‘high treason
## case’ hit the movement once more in September 1923. At
## noon on 1 September 1923 a massive earthquake shook the
                Kantō region, including Tōkyō. The initial destruction and loss
## of life was severe, but it was nothing compared to that
## resulting from the fires which followed the earthquake. The
## strong winds associated with the typhoon season fanned the
## flames, which cut enormous swathes through Tōkyō as the
                fires burned out of control for days and nights on end. In the
## atmosphere of fear and panic which this situation induced,
## rumours that revolutionaries and arsonists were out on the
                streets spread as quickly as the flames. The authorities had all
## the excuse they required to round up dissidents and among
## those detained by the military police were Ōsugi (who had
## recently returned from four months spent in France), his
## partner Itō Noe (1895–1923) and Ōsugi’s nephew Tachibana
## Munekazu, who was still a child. Arrested on 16 September,
                their bodies were fished out of a well four days later. Ōsugi, Itō
## and Tachibana were only three among thousands who were
                lynched, but the blow to Japanese anarchism was severe. Once

## again, the most able anarchist of his generation had been

                3. Hatta Shūzō: Christian Pastor to Anarchist Militant

## After Ōsugi Sakae’s murder, it was Hatta Shūzō who became
## the most influential anarchist theoretician in Japan. Most
## accounts treat anarchism as though it was supplanted by
                bolshevism after 1923 but, in fact, this was far from the case.
                As the next chapter will show, in terms of being an active social
## movement. anarchism was still very much alive and kicking
                throughout the 1920s and early 1930s. Intellectually, it also
## entered its richest and most productive phase after Ōsugi’s
                murder, and the theoretical fertility of this period was primarily
## due to Hatta’s writings and the intense debates which these
## provoked. Ōta Ryū has been one of the few postwar
## commentators who has adequately appreciated Hatta’s
                significance as a thinker. As he once put it, in an essay on
                anarchist theory:

## Hatta Shūzō (born 1886; died 1934) was an important
## anarchist after the murder of Ōsugi Sakae (in 1923). Basing
                himself on Kropotkinism, he developed the theory of anarchist
## communism one step further. After Kropotkin’s death, world
                anarchism rapidly regressed from the level to which Kropotkin
                had brought it. It seems to me that, as far as I know, in the
                midst of these degenerate circumstances (the era of Marxism-
## Leninism’s complete domination) there was nobody other than
                Hatta (not only in Japan but in the entire world) who took a step
                forward in this way.[67]

## Hatta’s active involvement in the anarchist movement

## spanned the relatively short period 1924–32 and his most
                important writings all appeared during a concentrated spurt of
                theoretical innovation, lasting barely five years between 1927
## and 1931. Nevertheless, to understand Hatta’s theory of
## anarchist communism, and to locate it within the unfolding
                process of Japan’s social, political and economic development
                after the First World War, one needs not merely to examine his
                role as an anarchist during the period 1924–32, but to set his
                anarchist years within the context of his life as a whole. The
                half century of Hatta’s lifespan was a time of enormous change
                within Japan, involving the spread of capitalist social relations,
                the sacrifice of the peasant villages on the altar of industrial
## growth, and the militarisation which accompanied relentless
                imperialist expansion on the Asian mainland. As we shall see,
## the tensions and traumas which these related processes
## produced impinged on Hatta throughout his life and were
                responsible for the directions taken by his thought and activity.

## Origins and Education

                Hatta was born on 11 December 1886 in the port town of Tsu in
                Mie Prefecture.[68] He was the youngest of seven children and
                both his parents died while he was young. Clearly, this was a
## keenly felt loss because even at the end of his life, in an
                introspective article which he wrote in 1932, he was attributing
                certain aspects of his character to being deprived of parental
                love at such a young age.[69] Even without his parents’ early
                deaths, however, Hatta’s childhood could not have been other
## than beset by difficulties. The Hatta family was long
                established in Tsu and had a tradition of loyal service to the
70 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Tōdō han (fief) prior to the Meiji Restoration of 1868. In fact, the
## Hattas had for generations managed the finances of the Tōdō
## daimyō (lord). The family house was located in the Wakebe
                Machi (modern Higashi Maru no Uchi) district of Tsu and, since
                this was a chōnin (merchant) quarter, it is an indication of the
## family’s location within the strict hierarchy of samurai-
## peasants-artisans-merchants that pervaded Tokugawa society.
## After 1868 the han were abolished throughout Japan and
                replaced by a modern administrative structure of prefectures
## which were answerable to those who held power in Tōkyō.
## Along with the abolition of the han, the daimyō were also
## deprived of power, with catastrophic economic consequences
                for those who had previously catered for their needs. While this
## was the general pattern of events throughout Japan, the
## consequences of this redistribution of power must have been
## compounded in Tsu, since the Tōdō han had been on the
                ‘wrong’ side in the Meiji Restoration, having remained loyal to
                the doomed Tokugawa regime instead of throwing in its lot with
                the restorationist forces, whose leaders became the new rulers
                of Meiji Japan. The lingering impact which this social upheaval
                made on those like the Hatta’s even as late as the turn of the
                century is revealed by the difficulty young Shūzō experienced
                in acquiring an education appropriate to his family’s traditional
## merchant status. He enrolled in Kōbe Shōgyō Gakkō (Kobō
## Commercial School) but could not progress beyond the third
## year because the money sent from home dried up, depriving
## him of all means of support.

## Although then still in his teens, Hatta was drawn to Tōkyō
## since, to a provincial lad like him, the wealth, power and

                educational institutions to be found there all had a magnetic
                appeal. In Tōkyō he hoped to find the means to support himself
## and to pick up the threads of his education. However, this
## proved more difficult than he had imagined. Jobs such as
## delivering newspapers provided him with barely enough to
                survive, let alone to finance an education and as he drifted out
                of one menial occupation into another. Hatta thought he would
## try his luck as a deckhand. Evidently this was no more
                satisfactory than the other jobs he had tried, since he jumped
                ship at one of the first opportunities, but in taking him to
                Taiwan it did lead to an experience which was to be one of the
                two major turning points in his life. Taiwan was then a recently
                acquired colony, which China had been forced to cede to Japan
## under the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki after the
## Japanese victory in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–5, and it
                was therefore relatively easy for even a poorly educated young
## Japanese such as Hatta to find employment. He secured a
                position at Taipei Post Office and the fact that his elder sister
## had settled there with her husband must have made life in
## Taiwan easier for Hatta. He did not stay in Taiwan for long
                because a quarrel with the postmaster caused him to lose his
                job, but before that happened Hatta came under the influence
                of Christianity and by the time he returned to Japan he was a
## fervent believer in the protestant creed.

                Christianity’s standing in Japan at this time needs to be briefly
## explained. The social transformation that Japan was
## experiencing in the late nineteenth century and early
## twentieth century was, up to a point, a process of
## Westernisation. Western machines, Western guns, Western

                sciences and so on were all adopted with alacrity but, when it
## came to Western ideologies, the state was considerably less
## enthusiastic. The purpose behind the adoption of Western
                technology was to strengthen Japan as a nation-state, thereby
                enabling Japan better to resist Western, imperialist aggression.
                Yet, while it was clear to the Meiji leaders that a Japan equipped
## with Western-style arms would be better able to stand up to
## the Western powers, they were much more doubtful about the
                benefits which Western-style ideologies would confer. Rather it
## was the case that, parallel to their promotion of Western
                technology within Japan, they were no less busy synthesising
                an ideology of nationalism from components which were lifted
## eclectically from Japan’s own ideological tradition.

## Suspicious though the authorities were of Christianity and
                other Western ideologies, they were in no position to resist
## Western demands that Japan be opened up to Western
## missionaries. During the closing decades of the nineteenth
                century and into the twentieth century various Christian sects
## mounted a considerable missionary effort in Japan and,
## although the number of converts was small when measured
## against Japan’s population as a whole, Christianity enjoyed
## something of a vogue among young, and particularly
                disaffected, intellectuals. Within such circles, Christianity
                benefited from its ‘modern’ and ‘Western’ image and also from
                the tendency for at least the protestant missionaries to engage
## in social work, in contrast to the largely ‘other-worldly’
## attitudes which were characteristic of longer established
                religions in Japan, such as Buddhism in its various forms. An
                illustration of the somewhat radical tinge which Christianity

                had acquired in Japan at this time is provided by the case of the
## Shakai Minshutō. When the abortive attempt was made to
                launch this social democratic party in Tōkyō in 1901, all its
## founder members were Christians, with the notable exception
## of Kōtoku Shūsui. Furthermore, when Katayama Sen was
                prosecuted for publishing the party’s manifesto, the journal
## Rōdō Sekai (Labour World) responded with the explanation
                that ‘it will be the very first time in Japan that Socialism as well
                as Christianity will be tried before the law’.[70] As Kōtoku
                complained in 1903: ‘In Japan socialism is regarded merely as a
                special product of Christianity, or as its appendage. People
## even go to the extreme of believing that “socialist” is
                synonymous with “Christian”.’[71]
                Under these circumstances, it is not difficult to understand the
## attraction which Christianity would have had for an
                impoverished young man with frustrated intellectual ambitions
## such as Hatta. There might even have been the subsidiary
                consideration that the mission schools could provide a cheaper
## education than was available elsewhere. Be that as it may,
## after his return to Japan, Hatta entered the Presbyterian
## missionary college Meiji Gakuin in Tōkyō in 1905. Among a
## number of lifelong friends whom Hatta made at Meiji Gakuin
## was a fellow student called Kagawa Toyohiko. As was
## mentioned in Chapter 2, Kagawa went on to play a prominent
## role in the early Kansai labour movement and he also became
                a leading evangelist in Japan. Hatta spent five years at Meiji
## Gakuin, taking first the general course (1905–6), then the
                higher course (1906–8) and finally the theology course (1908–
## 10). The surviving college records show him to have been a

74 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                brilliant student who was superior to most of his peers and an
                accomplished all-rounder.[72] Apart from academic studies,
## contemporary issues of Shirogane Gakuhō, the college
## magazine, reveal that he was an involved and active student
## who was a member of such societies as the Seinenkai (Young
## Men’s Association) and the Literary Society and who spoke
## frequently at meetings.

                For reasons which are not entirely clear, Hatta left Meiji Gakuin
                in 1910 before graduating. After a spell of evangelical work, he
## then entered Kōbe Shin Gakkō (Kōbe Theological School). The
                reason for this switch from one college to another might have
## been that Kagawa Toyohiko had also transferred to Kōbe and
## Hatta followed his friend there. On the other hand, another
## explanation which has been given is that Hatta clashed with
                one of his teachers at Meiji Gakuin, leading to his premature
                departure.[73] Whatever the reason, Hatta completed his
## theological studies at Kōbe Shin Gakkō and graduated from
                there in 1912 at the age of 25. Kōbe Shin Gakkō was a training
                college for Presbyterian clerics which had been established as
## recently as 1907 by the American Southern Presbyterian
                Church Mission. Most of its graduates obtained posts within the
## Presbyterian Church on leaving and Hatta was no exception.
## For the next twelve years of his life (1912–24) he was
## employed as a clergyman in a succession of provincial
## churches.

## Provincial Clergyman

## Hatta’s career as a clergyman took him to a number of
                locations in the Chūbu (Central Honshū) and Chūgoku (Western
75 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Honshū) regions. Typically a protestant church in provincial
                Japan at this time would have been a small-scale enterprise.
## Active membership would have been no more than a few
                dozen and, although congregations were expected to strive for
## economic viability, many churches could not have survived
## without assistance, which ultimately derived from overseas
## sources. Although there would have been visiting preachers
                from time to time, a local pastor had to rely very much on his
## own resourcefulness to maintain the cohesion and
                commitment of his flock. For an intellectually alert person such
## as Hatta, life as a provincial clergyman must have been
                frustrating and lonely at times. On the other hand, with his
## congregation being no more than a drop in the ocean of the
## unconverted, there was unlimited scope for the kind of
                propaganda work and activity on which Hatta thrived. Without
## a doubt, during his years as a practising clergyman, Hatta
## developed many of the talents which he later employed with
                such telling effect in the anarchist movement. Intellectual selfreliance, the ability to win over and inspire an audience, and a
## passion for human interaction and committed social
## involvement were only some of the attributes which Hatta
                acquired during his years in the church and later took with him
## into the anarchist movement.

## Hatta’s earliest appointments were to churches in Gifu and
                Aichi Prefectures. It is difficult to put precise dates on his
## transfers from church to church (at least prior to his
                appointment as pastor of Yamaguchi Church in April 1919) but
## a letter from Hatta which was published in the Meiji Gakuin
## magazine in March 1915 does throw interesting light on his

76 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                work in Gifu Prefecture.[74] At the time of writing Hatta has
                been in what is evidently a rural location in Gifu Prefecture for
## ten months and he calculates that during this time he has
                made twelve converts to the church. He describes the district
## in which his church is located as renowned on two counts—
                firstly for its sword-making industry and secondly for its geisha.
## Evidently, the practice of consigning young girls to
                apprenticeship as geisha is so entrenched locally that, as he
## explains, even little girls of primary school age calmly
                announce that this is what the future holds for them. Hatta is
## struggling to change this outlook, but it must have been an
                uphill battle, given the crippling poverty affecting so many
## peasant families. Many peasant households of the time were
                regularly faced with heart-rending choices between losing their
                land for failing to pay taxes or selling their daughters into
## prostitution. Those households which lost their land were
## reduced to becoming tenant farmers, who were forced to
                surrender to the landlord a proportion of their output as rent in
                kind, which typically amounted to about half of the total crop.
## Consequently, household consumption among tenant farmers
                in this period was only about 55 per cent of even the miserable
## levels experienced by peasants who owned their own land.
## Hence the pressures to dispose of daughters as geisha were
                considerable.[75]

## Another observation which Hatta makes in the same letter is
                that he regards the countryside as offering the most fertile soil
                for the growth of Christianity in Japan. A single convert in the
## countryside soon leads 10 others, writes Hatta, presumably
                due to the closely-knit web of human relations which exist in
77 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                rural society. By implication, the individualism which is more
## characteristic of urban life means that converts have to be
                made one by one in the cities. This favourable evaluation of the
                countryside and its potential relative to the cities was another
## attitude which Hatta was later to take with him into the
## anarchist movement.

## At some stage during these years Hatta married a young
## woman who was a graduate of Yokohama Kyōritsu Joshi Shin
## Gakkō (Yokohama Public Women’s Theology School). Little is
                known about Mrs Hatta in this period beyond the fact that she
                impressed people as jōhin (‘refined’ or ‘ladylike’).[76] Since
                Yokohama Kyōritsu Joshi Shin Gakkō was, in effect, a training
                college for those intended to become the wives of protestant
## clergymen (Kagawa Toyohiko’s wife, for example, was another
                graduate of this college), there is every likelihood that Hatta’s
## was a conventional, arranged marriage, as were the
## overwhelming majority of marriages in those days. Mrs Hatta
                gave birth to two children in the years prior to 1924, a boy
## called Tetsurō and a girl who was given the Western-style
## name Yohana (Johanna). Beyond this, the only other
                observation that can be made about Hatta’s relations with his
                wife is that they cannot have been entirely happy even at this
                stage of their marriage. As Mrs Hatta revealed in later years,
## Shūzō had a number of affairs with other women even during
                the period when he was a practising clergyman.[77]
                Hatta was pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Yamaguchi from
## April 1919 until August 1920. This was evidently a crucial
                period in his life because it seems to have been at this time
                that his dissatisfaction with orthodox Christianity developed. It

## is reasonable to speculate that this was linked with the
                widespread discontent and mass struggles which occurred just
## before and during Hatta’s tenure of the Yamaguchi post and
                with what he is likely to have seen as the inadequate response
## from the Christian churches. However, firm evidence of the
                strain to which his faith must have been subjected is hard to
                come by. All that is available is a frustratingly vague report
## from the clergyman who succeeded Hatta as pastor of the
## Yamaguchi Church. Hatta’s successor was a man called
## Tamura Kensuke, who was pastor of the Yamaguchi Church
## from September 1920 until September 1922. In the Synod
## Report for 1921, Tamura writes that he does not know the
                details of what occurred prior to his arrival in Yamaguchi, but he
                nevertheless refers to ‘various distressful incidents’ that took
                place in 1920 during Hatta’s term of office.[78]

## After Yamaguchi, Hatta moved to Hiroshima and what proved
                to be his last post as a clergyman. The four years Hatta spent
                in Hiroshima were to climax in the second major turning point
                in his life and we are therefore fortunate that there is more
                information available on his pastorship there than on all his
                other postings put together. Hatta’s church in Hiroshima was
                then known as the Mokage Church.[79] It was a well
## established church, having been founded in 1892, and Hatta
                was its fifth pastor. Hiroshima City was an important port and
                prefectural capital and the prefecture to which it had given its
                name had one of the highest incidences of rice riots recorded
## in any prefecture during the hot summer of 1918. A labour
## movement started to emerge in the locality after the First
## World War, with various unions such as the Hiroshima

## Seishinkō Kumiai Hōyūkai (Hiroshima Needlemakers’ Union
## Friendly Society) , the Hiroshima-Shi Insatsukō Shinyūkai
                (Hiroshima City Printworkers’ Friendly Society) and the
## Hiroshima Rōdō Kōseikai (Hiroshima Labour Fairness
                Association) being formed from 1919 onwards.[80] The holding
## of local May Day rallies was another indication of the
                heightened consciousness of the workers. It was in this climate
                of increased working class assertiveness that Hatta arrived in
## Hiroshima on 23 August 1920.

## The Mokage Church was of much the same size as the other
                churches where Hatta had worked. Church records show that in
                1921, the year after Hatta’s arrival, the average attendance at
                services was about forty.[81] Hatta preached regularly at these
                services, and prayer meetings and Sunday school were part of
                the normal weekly routine. In addition to religious meetings,
                Hatta also gave lectures on cultural subjects. On one or two
## occasions he persuaded his old friend Kagawa Toyohiko to
## travel from Kōbe to preach at the Mokage Church. Initially,
                after Hatta took up the Hiroshima post, all went well and the
## congregation of Mokage Church was enthusiastic about the
## eloquence of their new pastor. His skill as a speaker was
## compared to that of Uchimura Kanzō (1861–1930) and the
## previously mentioned Kagawa, who were the leading
## evangelists of their generations.

                However, the recollections of a veteran member of the Mokage
## congregation show how Hatta’s very eloquence became a
                problem for his new church: ‘Pastor Hatta’s sermons were
                superb, so much so that I thought it a shame that more people
                were not there to hear them. It was like the Bible talking in the
80 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                spirit of pure socialism and one of my friends admired Pastor
## Hatta so much that he asked him to celebrate his
                marriage.’[82] The gospel as Hatta taught it proved popular
## with young people and a number of youths became regular
## attenders at Mokage Church services. But the older members
                of the congregation were disturbed, particularly when Hatta’s
## outspokenness antagonised those with power and wealth in
                the neighbourhood. To quote the same source as previously: ‘it
                was a period when everybody was taught that socialist thought
                was unpatriotic or the work of the devil. When the Church put
                up a noticeboard announcing a series of “labour lectures”, the
## Hiroshima newspapers all started to run headlines attacking
                Pastor Hatta.’[83]

## By giving a series of ‘labour lectures’, announcing the
                formation of the Hiroshima Jiyū Rōdō Kumiai (Hiroshima Casual
                Workers’ Union) and similar means, Hatta attempted to orient
## his church towards the ongoing struggles of workers and
## farmers against exploitation and oppression. Increasingly
## Hatta was thinking in terms of achieving paradise here on
                earth, rather than in the nebulous never-never land promised
                by conventional Christianity. He also came to realise that a
                project of social reconstruction as profound as this would entail
                abolition of both capitalism and the state. To put it another
## way, it became increasingly clear to Hatta that the
## achievement of a society which embodied the values which
                until now he had associated with Christianity was beyond the
                scope of conventional religion. Not only that, but such a society
## could not be achieved by reformist half-measures either.
## Gradually Hatta came to the view that there was only one

81 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                political philosophy that was equal to the task of achieving
                such a total transformation of society’s institutions and mores.
                This was anarchism. Step by step, Hatta was reaching the point
                of thinking of himself as an anarchist first and foremost, and
## only secondly as a Christian.

                As indicated above, newspapers then were little different from
## newspapers now and the local papers responded to Hatta’s
## undisguised sympathy for anarchism by attempted character
                assassination. It has to be said that Hatta’s behaviour, and
                particularly his relations with women, undoubtedly made this
## easy for the newspapers. Among other sneers, they claimed
                that ‘he is involved in a triangular relationship with a lady who
## was searching after the truth. He is a disgrace as someone
                purporting to show others the way.’[84] It is more than likely
                that the reports of this affair were accurate, although this does
                little to justify the moral posturing of the press. This was a
                period when a recognised symbol of worldly success was for a
## man to acquire a mistress and the newspapers were
                deafeningly silent about the ‘triangular relationships’ in which
## so many contemporary politicians and capitalists were
                involved. Nevertheless, the effect of such reports on Hatta’s
## church can be imagined. Older members of the congregation
## were distressed and dropped away, so that increasingly the
## active membership of the church consisted of youngsters
## under Hatta’s spell. By 1924 average attendance at services
## was down to thirty and there was a corresponding
## deterioration in the church’s financial situation.

                For the church establishment and the local dignitaries alike, the
## final straw was Hatta’s response to Ōsugi’s murder. With

82 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## considerable bravery, and disregarding intimidation by the
## police, Hatta organised a memorial meeting for Ōsugi at his
## church. As a result, Hatta was ordered by both the Town
                Council and the Mission authorities to leave Hiroshima. By this
## stage Hatta had virtually ceased holding religious meetings
## and was devoting all his time and energy to anarchist
                propaganda.[85] Mrs Hatta was heard to pray, ‘Please let him
                return to being a disciple of Christ’, but Shūzō’s response was:
                ‘For myself. I am going to end my life as a propagandist for
                anarchism. If you disapprove of that, there is nothing for it but
                to split up.’[86] When the Mokage congregation joined the
                chorus demanding his resignation, there was no alternative but
                to leave Hiroshima. Abandoning his church, his family and all
                means of a secure livelihood, Hatta left for Tōkyō in September
## 1924 and threw himself into the vortex of the anarchist
## movement.

## Anarchist Propagandist

                Life was not easy for a revolutionary anarchist in Japan in the
                1920s. Quite apart from the continual threat of imprisonment
                and police violence, there was the problem of making a living.
                Even skilled workers, such as the many anarchist printworkers,
## had to contend with victimisation when they became known as
                militants and with bouts of unemployment, but for someone in
                Hatta’s position life was even more insecure. Writing for the
## anarchist press and speaking at anarchist meetings made
## enormous demands on his time but provided no income. A

                better of his business sense. Kropotkin’s Ethics: Origin and
## Development, Modern Science and Anarchism and Anarchist
                Morality (all published in 1928), Bakunin’s God and the State
                (1930) and Charles Cide’s Les Colonies Communistes et
## Coopératives (1933) might all have had a place on any
## anarchist’s bookshelf, but they were unlikely to become
## bestsellers. Apart from the limited funds generated by
## translation work, there remained only sponging off
## acquaintances (Hatta’s friendship with Kagawa was strained
## by a string of unrepaid loans and broken promises) and the
                practice of ryaku. Ryaku (略) derived from the Japanese title of
                Kropotkin’s The Conquest of Bread (Pan no Ryakushu). It is a
                character which literally means to capture or seize or plunder.
## Among the anarchists in prewar Japan it was jargon for the
## practice of extorting funds from the wealthy. One or more
                anarchists would pay a visit to a suitable capitalist and suggest
                that, if he wanted to sleep soundly, a contribution might not be
                such a bad idea. Faced with this sort of vague threat to person
                and property, many a capitalist swallowed his indignation and
## paid up. Ryaku was an unreliable source of income, and it
                required steady nerves and considerable audacity to pull it off,
                but many anarchists were forced to resort to it for want of any
## other means of filling the rice bowl.

## When Hatta first moved to Tōkyō he stayed at the charitable
                ‘settlement’ run by Kagawa and, after several moves, he later
                took up residence in Setagaya-Ku, not far from Kagawa’s house
## and church in Matsuzawa. In 1939 Kagawa published an
                autobiographical novel, under the title Taking a Stone As My
## Pillow, which covered the period 1923–6. The character Yagi

                Shūzō who appears in this novel is plainly modelled on Hatta,
## even down to being a renegade clergyman from Hiroshima
                who has abandoned his wife and children. Apart from throwing
                light on Hatta’s perpetually complicated relations with women,
## the novel vividly describes his poverty and shabby
                appearance:
                At that time Yagi had put a cheap kimono over his yukata and
## was wearing an Ōshima haori which had once had a splashed
                pattern but was now faded and had holes here and there. With
                his face flushed by saké and a skin rash around his neck, he cut
                an incredibly sorry figure.[87]

## Clearly, even making allowances for a degree of literary
                licence, Yagi Shūzō still represents a considerable comedown
## from the promising young clergyman of ten years earlier.

## The few surviving photographs of Hatta, and his fellow
## anarchist Mochizuki Kei’s (1886–1975) sketch of him, show a
                short, stout man with a moustache and features which are far
## from handsome and make one wonder why so many women
                obviously found him attractive. Hatta’s relations with at least
## one of the women with whom he was involved also reveal a
                thoroughly reprehensible side to his character.[88] During his
                final years Hatta lived with Hirose Waka, who was the younger
                sister of the anarchist Hirose Kotarō, and by whom he had two
                further children. It is said that Hatta was often violent towards
                Waka, pulling her by her hair and attacking her even when she
                had their baby strapped to her back. Waka is described as not
                a pretty woman, but it seems that Hatta was morbidly jealous
                and suspected her of philandering. In his anarchist theorising
## Hatta often wrote that it was the ‘creative violence of a

## minority’ that would rouse the masses and precipitate the
                revolution. Whatever the merits of this strategy as a means of
## bringing about the revolution, it did not provide any
                justification for individual violence, particularly when this was
                directed at someone like Waka who was, by any standards, one
                of capitalism’s victims and not one of its perpetrators. Living
## with Hatta, Waka could not have been other than miserably
## poor; after his death, she worked as a cleaning lady at the
## Setagaya-Ku Council Offices (kuyakusho). Whichever way one
## looks at it, Hatta’s treatment of Waka was inexcusable and
## totally at variance with the very principles he expounded.

                How was it that this down-at-heel, lapsed clergyman, who was
## overfond of saké and prone to violence, could have become
## such a forceful influence in the prewar anarchist movement?
                The answer lay partly in the calibre of Hatta’s ideas, expressed
                in his theoretical writings, but also had much to do with his
## ability to convey passion and enthusiasm, both as a public
## speaker and in his everyday dealings with his comrades.
                Mochizuki Kei wrote that one would come across Hatta quietly
## dozing and smelling of saké but that, as soon as people
## gathered round him and a discussion started, he would
                become animated and full of passion.[89] Years after Hatta’s
## death, the journal Museifushugi Undō (Anarchist Movement)
                recalled: ‘He really loved to discuss and was a person fired with
## passion. You could say he had the atmosphere of a
                revolutionary about him, burning for the ideal of anarchism and
                always with young people gathered round him.’[90] In the
## same journal, Daidōji Saburō described how he once took
## Hatta on a propaganda trip to the poor farming village in

## Tōhoku (North-East Honshū) where he came from. Hatta’s
                unsurpassed ability to talk to an audience of farmers for hours
                on end without losing their interest, and his capacity to move
## them to tears, fill them with anger, and redouble their
## enthusiasm for anarchist communism, are vividly conveyed in
                Daidōji’s account, of which the following is an excerpt:
                We passed the 14 hours in the train talking about this and that,
## and the next day at about 11 a.m. we arrived at my village.

## It was mid-Autumn in that Tōhoku village and already there
## was a nip in the air. Two youths had come to meet us at the
                station. They told us that we would be put up in my parents’
## house and a comrade’s house. I was surprised to hear that—
## young and old, men and women—there would be more than
## 50 people from the hamlet as an audience. I was amazed too
## at how much they had come on—saying that they didn’t give a
## damn about the police and being full of fight.

                That night 60 people really did turn up. Young and old, male
## and female, they all turned out. Since the youngsters had
## organised a collection in the hamlet and made rice cakes
                (mochi) from the proceeds, it was decided that first we’d eat.

## Among the comrades, there was a young man called Kikuchi
## who was good at drawing. Big drawings of Kropotkin, Makhno
                and others had been fixed to the front-facing sliding doors.
                On the evening of our arrival and the next evening too, from
                about 6 p.m. until midnight, Hatta talked for 5 or 6 hours at a
## stretch. Whether words like ‘eloquently’ or ‘resonantly’
                adequately describe Hatta’s delivery on those nights, I don’t
                know, but let’s just say that they were masterly speeches, with
87 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## Hatta talking on and on. I don’t remember what he talked
## about, but not even one person dozed off. The women were
## shedding tears as they listened. The comrades were worked
## up (kinchō shi) and an atmosphere like the eve of the
## revolution filled the room.

                I was scared by what on earth might happen if the police came
## marching in but, since it was a hamlet far removed from the
## police in the towns, it ended without incident. It was a
                wonderful reception they gave us in the houses of that hamlet
## and, with a merry song of victory from the people who had
## gathered to see us off ringing in our ears, we returned to
                Tōkyō.[91]
                Hatta’s outstanding talent as a public speaker is clear from this
                passage, but so too is the unforced enthusiasm of the farmers
## for the revolutionary creed of anarchist communism. No
## amount of eloquence on Hatta’s part could have compensated
                if the anarchist communist critique of existing society and its
                vision of an alternative had not matched his audience’s sense
                of grievance and their hopes for the future. Hence one can say
                that, for all his undoubted talent, an anarchist propagandist
## such as Hatta was merely expressing, albeit in a more
## systematic and articulate fashion than most were capable of
## doing, a social and political philosophy which flowed from
## ordinary people’s experiences and aspirations.

## Theoretician of Pure Anarchism

                In addition to his reputation as a public speaker, Hatta came to
                be regarded by his comrades as ‘the greatest theoretician of
88 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                anarchist communism in Japan’.[92] A detailed examination of
                Hatta’s theoretical writings will be left until Chapters 5 and 6,
                but here it is appropriate to indicate the objectives which lay
                behind this side of his activity. In particular, it is important to
                demonstrate that his theoretical output was in response to the
## twin enemies which he saw confronting anarchism—namely,
## capitalism and bolshevism.

## Japan continued to develop as a capitalist and imperialist
## power throughout the interwar years. For many years, the
## textile industry led this development, with the number of
                cotton spindles in operation increasing from 2.4 million in 1914
                to 6.7 million in 1929.[93] Consequently Japanese textiles were
## penetrating the world’s markets and were posing a serious
                threat to Western manufacturers, such as the once unrivalled
                Lancashire cotton mills. Other industries as diverse as coal
## mining, iron and steel production, shipbuilding and machine
                construction were developing too, laying the basis for Japan’s
                increasing military strength as well as its economic power. It
                would be tedious to recite the economic statistics for all these
## industries but, typically, between 1913 and 1929 coal
                production increased from 21.3 to 34.3 million tonnes and the
                output of finished steel rose from 255,000 to 2.0 million tonnes.
                [94]

## Linked with Japan’s rise as the dominant economic power in
                East Asia, step-by-step it acquired an empire. In 1910 Korea
## was added to Taiwan as another colonial territory, and, by
                judiciously siding with the ‘right’ side in the First World War,
                Japan took over a string of formerly German-held islands in the
                North Pacific. Parallel to this acquisition of a formal empire,
89 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                there was a continual process under way of informal economic
                and military penetration of China, particularly of its NorthEastern region of Manchuria, which was rich in many of the raw
## materials needed by Japanese industry. Eventually Manchuria
## was to be detached from China by the creation of the puppet
## state of Manchukuo in 1932. Rivalry on the world’s markets
## and the ambition to secure dependable supplies of raw
                materials inevitably led to increasing tension between Japan
                and other imperialist powers in the years after the First World
                War. It is not only the benefit of hindsight that allows one to
                recognise the roots of the Second World War here. Already in
## 1927, when Japanese troops had been dispatched to China,
## Kokushoku Seinen (Black Youth) had argued that what was
## happening in the Far East was ‘preparation for the Second
                World War’.[95] Hatta was as aware as any of his comrades
## that war and economic crisis were inherent features of
## capitalism and he wrote in apocalyptic terms about the
                destruction and misery that would follow if existing society
                were allowed to proceed unchecked.[96] For Hatta, capitalism
## meant the division of labour, centralised power, national
## aggrandizement, and the expansion of production at the
## expense of the people’s consumption. These were the reasons
## why he fought against capitalism with such passionate
## intensity.

                Not a few of capitalism’s opponents in Japan during this period
                believed that opposition to capitalist society automatically
## entailed supporting bolshevik Russia. Hatta would have none
                of this. For him, capitalism and bolshevism were cut from the
                same cloth and displayed essentially the same characteristics.
90 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                As a consequence of bolshevik attempts to industrialise, the
## division of labour was proceeding apace in Russia and
                destroying patterns of communal living that had survived for
                centuries among the peasants. In order to enforce this, power
## was being concentrated more and more in the hands of a
## despotic state and a tyrannical party. The supposedly
## international creed of bolshevik-style ‘communism’ provided
                an ideological gloss for these processes but was, in fact, merely
                a vehicle for advancing Russia’s national interests. Similarly,
                once the succession of bolshevik economic policies and plans
## were stripped of the propaganda which accompanied them, it
                could be seen that they unfailingly gave precedence to raising
                production rather than improving the people’s livelihood. All
                these features of bolshevism meant that it was no more than a
                variation on the capitalist theme and in no way an alternative
                to capitalism.[97]

## Hatta and similarly minded anarchists were determined to
## pose a distinctively anarchist communist challenge to any
                system that incorporated state control and capital/wage labour
                relations, no matter whether it described itself as capitalist or
                bolshevik. However, as they saw it, the problem was not only
                for anarchism to confront external enemies, such as capitalism
                and bolshevism, but also to cleanse the anarchists’ own ranks
                of any taint of capitalist or bolshevik influence. It was this
## determination which lay behind their struggle for ‘pure
## anarchism’. Among the anarchists were some who wished to
## meet the bolsheviks’ claims to be exponents of ‘scientific
## socialism’ by setting anarchism on a more self-consciously
                scientific footing.[98] Similarly, faced with competition from
91 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## bolsheviks employing organisational methods based on so-
## called ‘democratic centralism’, there were anarchists who
                stressed the need to develop their own theory and practice of
## organisation. Many of these anarchists were anarchist
## syndicalists, who naturally favoured an organisational
                structure of industrial unions pursuing the class struggle.[99]
                Another current of anarchists consisted of those who reacted to
## the appalling poverty afflicting many farmers by concluding
                that the fundamental conflict within society lay between the
                cities and the countryside. According to these anarchists, all
                city dwellers benefited parasitically from the flow of wealth out
                of the villages, so that even the urban workers shared in the
                exploitation of the farmers.[100] These arguments were given
## added weight by the fact that peasants and tenant farmers
                constituted half of the entire workforce during this period, while
                under twenty per cent of the population lived in cities of more
                than 100,000 inhabitants.[101]
                Hatta met these challenges emanating from different anarchist
## currents head on. Science, he argued, was not a neutral
                technique which could be employed without cost to everyone’s
                (including anarchists’) advantage. For him, science was a form
                of knowledge which had grown up with capitalism and to use it
                meant to locate oneself on the capitalist terrain of authority,
## centrally imposed norms, the division of labour and
                technologically assisted exploitation.[102] On the question of
## organisation, Hatta insisted that anarchists had no need to
                devise an artificial organisational theory and practice, because
## the entirely natural process of free association by groups
## united in a common purpose, which was widely practised

## among animals and supposedly ‘primitive’ peoples, yielded
## better results than any form of ‘artificial organisation’,
                including ‘democratic centralism’.[103] As for anarchist
## syndicalism, Hatta saw a syndicalist-style labour movement,
## organised industry by industry, as a mirror image of the
                division of labour inherent within capitalism. This meant that it
                could not provide a genuine alternative to capitalism, but was
                doomed to reproduce the structures of hierarchical power and
## economic inequality which, according to Hatta, always
                accompany the division of labour.[104] With regard to the
## claim that the fundamental social division was between the
                urban centres and the countryside, Hatta agreed that the cities
                exploited the farming villages. However, he saw this as merely
                one facet of the overall situation which typifies capitalism,
                where everyone is an actual or potential exploiter of everyone
                else. Consequently, he argued that the solution to this situation
## of generalised antagonism lay not in the farmers pursuing a
                class struggle against the city folk, but in farmers and workers
                uniting to dissolve all structures of exploitation, including the
                cities, since these functioned as centres of industry, power and
                wealth.[105]

## In summary, what Hatta and the other pure anarchists sought
## to achieve was a decentralised society of largely self-
## supporting communes engaged in both agriculture and smallscale industry. Hatta believed that a society organised in this
## fashion could avoid the division of labour and the unequal
                distribution of power. Hence it would be free of any incipient
                structures that could eventually mature into a new apparatus
                of state control. Such a society’s rhythms of production would
93 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                flow from decisions on the levels of consumption they wished
## to enjoy taken by the people in their communes. Consumption
## would thus determine production, rather than being
                subordinated to the priority of expanding production, as occurs
## in any system based on capital accumulation and state
## aggrandizement. Since this anarchist communist society
## represented a fundamental break with all aspects of
                capitalism, Hatta and his comrades believed that it could not
                grow out of any of the internal processes of capitalism, such as
                workers engaging in the class struggle for improved wages and
## working conditions. Just as anarchist communism transcended
                the norms of capitalism, so the revolution to bring it about
                would have to transcend the norms of political activity within
## capitalism, including parliamentary elections and class
                struggle. What was required was a process of self-liberation
                carried out by the ‘propertyless masses’ (musan taishū). For
## Hatta, these ‘propertyless masses’ encompassed a far wider
## range of people than the wage-earning working class and at
## their core stood the tenant farmers.

## The foregoing paragraphs indicate the main areas over which
## Hatta’s theoretical investigations ranged. As was mentioned
                earlier, detailed examination of his theoretical writings will be
## left until Chapters 5 and 6. However, what has been
## demonstrated here is that the issues which concerned him
## were all linked to developments within Japanese and world
## capitalism, and to interpretations of those developments by
## other anarchists with whom he disagreed. Hence one can say
## that, during his anarchist years, Hatta was that rare
## combination of a man of action and a man of thought. As

                Komatsu Ryūji has described him:
                Hatta was no mere educator of the masses or activist. Still less
## was he a mere researcher or philosopher. His assertions and
## ideas all came about within the movement or in connection
## with the movement. Furthermore, he devoted all his energy
## not merely to shouting at those around him, but to taking
## responsibility for his own assertions and trying to embody
## them in his own life and activity. In that sense, Hatta was
                without doubt a thinker.[106]

## Decline and Death

                Hatta’s last contribution to the anarchist press was an article
                on ‘Questions of the Day’ which was published in January 1932.
                By this stage, repression of the anarchists was becoming ever
## more intense, their movement was in decline, and Hatta
## himself was at a low ebb. Poverty and alcoholism had taken
                their toll and his health was by now seriously undermined. He
                was eventually to die on 30 January 1934. An obituary notice
## which appeared in the Jiyū Rengō Shinbun (Libertarian
## Federation Newspaper) explained that he had been ill for a
## long time but had been unable to afford medical attention.

                It is tragic that in the last two years of his life Hatta’s acumen
## as a theoretician of anarchist communism was on the wane.
                The ideas expressed in the article ‘Questions of the Day’ are so
                at variance with his earlier writings that some commentators
                have even questioned whether it really was written by Hatta.
                [108] However, I see no reason to doubt its authenticity and I

## am more inclined to explain the contradictions which exist
## between it and Hatta’s earlier writings by reference to his
                political desperation. It was already clear by 1932 that the
## state’s vice was tightening on the anarchists and, in a
## desperate bid to ensure their survival, Hatta proposed that
## they integrate themselves into popular movements, including
                the labour movement. A key passage in his article asserted:
                Now is the era of capitalism. Even to get on a tram one needs
                money. Everything boils down to commercial transactions. The
## masses are all engaged in commercial transactions. Hence we
## too should undertake commercial transactions and enter into
                the midst of the people, enter into their midst via commercial
                transactions. As one particular commercial transaction, there
## is the labour movement. We should establish close contact
## with the people and enter into their midst via those
## commercial transactions which constitute the labour
                movement.[109]

## Hatta’s precise meaning here is open to interpretation, but
## certainly his readiness to countenance ‘commercial
## transactions’ was a far cry from his earlier unambiguous
                condemnation of the monetary economy and all that it implies.
## Whereas previously Hatta had denounced the daily struggle
## over wages and working conditions as utopian, in the sense
                that it involved pursuing aspirations for economic security and
## human dignity which the very workings of capitalism make
## unrealisable, he was now apparently urging the pure
## anarchists to enter the fray and make the labour movement’s
## concerns their own. Hatta now seemed to be encouraging
                anarchists to base their activity on conflicts occurring within

## capitalism rather than on the struggle against capitalism,
## which was perceptibly dwindling by 1932.

                In addition, there is evidence that Hatta reverted to Christianity
                at the very end of his life. One of the last articles he wrote for
## any outlet was a piece entitled ‘Confession’ which was
## published in July 1932 in the journal of the Iesu no Yūkai
                (Society of the Friends of Jesus). Although Hatta was still critical
                of conventional Christianity in that article, he nevertheless
                wrote that ‘society is waiting for the reality of love to emerge
                from the hands of Christians’.[110] Also, when I interviewed
## veteran members of the Matsuzawa Church in Tōkyō in 1990,
                they recalled that Hatta attended their church in the period
                immediately before his death. As 87-year-old Makino Teru put
                it: ‘In his last days, he quietened down. After the violence
                subsided, he naturally returned to the church.’[111]

## Such remarks may explain why few, if any, of Hatta’s former
                comrades attended his funeral in 1934.[112] His obituary
                notice in the Jiyū Rengō Shinbun, which was referred to earlier,
                was a mere five lines in length and perhaps it is significant that
                Hatta was described there as a ‘former anarchist polemicist’.
                [113] Hatta’s old friend, Kagawa Toyohiko, presided at his
## funeral in Matsuzawa Church and the former Mrs Hatta took
                the role of wife, since Hirose Waka was in confinement with her
                second child.[114] Where Hatta’s remains were interred is not
                known. If his ashes were taken back to his family grave in Tsu,
                all trace has disappeared, since Tsu was reduced to ruins by
## successive raids by American bombers in the closing months
                of the Second World War, a war which anarchists like Hatta had
                vainly struggled to prevent. People by the name of Hatta still

## live in Tsu, but all memories of Shūzō have long since
## evaporated. In 1990 one household dimly recalled thal their
                family originated from the Wakebe Machi district, but the fact
                that one of their relatives had been ‘the greatest theoretician
                of anarchist communism in Japan’ evoked little interest from a
## generation for whom anarchist communism is as much of a
                mystery as is the name Hatta Shūzō.[115]

                4. Organisational Confrontation: Pure Anarchists
## versus Syndicalists 1926–31

## Kokuren

## On 1 December 1925 an event took place which had no direct
                connection with anarchism but which provided the stimulus for
                the first ever national federation of anarchist groups. Several
## months earlier, in March 1925, the Diet had passed a law
## widening the electorate to all males aged 25 or over. In
## response to this, a broad range of leftists entered into
                negotiations in order to form a party which could attract the
                votes of the newly enfranchised farmers and workers. This was
                the Nōmin Rōdōtō (Farmer-Labour Party) but, when it held its
## founding conference in Tokyo on 1 December 1925, the
                anarchists turned out in force to confront what they saw as yet
                another bunch of political opportunists who were out to dupe
## the farmers and workers. Activists from many different
                anarchist groups gate-crashed the conference and disrupted it
                by distributing leaflets to the cry of ‘Down with the political
                movement!’[116] The Nōmin Rōdōtō was merely a transient
## organisation, since the state issued a banning order within

                thirty minutes of the announcement of its inauguration, but the
                anarchists were sufficiently encouraged by the effectiveness of
## their joint intervention on 1 December 1925 to initiate
## discussions aimed at forming a broadly based federation of
## their own. The federation which emerged from these
## discussions some two months later was the Kokushoku Seinen
## Renmei (Black Youth League, or Kokuren for short).

## Despite its name, Kokuren was not an exclusively youth
## organisation. It drew its support from numerous anarchist
                groups and also from such strongholds of the anarchist union
                movement as the Tōkyō Printworkers’ Union. It is interesting to
## note that among the two dozen constituent groups which
                initially comprised Kokuren was one, known as the Shakai Seiri
                Kenkyū Kai (Social Physiology Research Association) which had
                been formed by Hatta Shūzō and his comrades.[117] A public
## meeting to announce the formation of Kokuren was held in
## Tōkyō on 31 January 1926 and attracted an audience of more
                than seven hundred. The principal issues for discussion at this
                meeting were itemised in the following six slogans:

## The emancipation of the workers must be carried out by the
## workers themselves!
## We insist on libertarian federation (jiyū rengōshugi)!
## Destroy the political movement!
## Reject the proletarian party movement!
## Get rid of professional activists!
                Down with all oppressive laws and ordinances![118]
                In anticipation of interference from the police, a roster of more
## than forty speakers had been drawn up so that they could
## replace one another in continuous succession whenever the

99 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## police ordered a speaker to stop. Sure enough, the meeting
## proceeded in this fashion but, as it did, the anarchists’
## indignation gradually rose until it reached boiling point.
## Eventually the meeting broke up amid cries of ‘Out on the
                streets!’ Black flags were unfurled and the anarchists poured
## out of the meeting and headed for the Ginza, the most
## fashionable thoroughfare in Tokyo where many of the shops
                specialised in luxury goods for the rich. In the running street
## battles which ensued dozens of shop windows were smashed
                and many well-to-do passers-by took to their heels in terror.
## More than thirty anarchists were arrested and seven were
                subsequently imprisoned.[119]

## When Kokuren was first formed its main strength was in the
## Kantō (Eastern Honshū) region, but before long regional
## federations had been organised in most other areas of Japan
## and even in such Japanese colonies as Taiwan and Korea.
                Although it is difficult to estimate its size with any degree of
                confidence, it was a strong organisation by anarchist standards
## and extremely active. From April 1926 it started to publish
## Kokushoku Seinen (Black Youth) and this continued to appear
## until February 1931, despite the authorities repeatedly
                banning its sale. The early issues of Kokushoku Seinen reveal
## Kokuren as a grouping of class-struggle anarchists. For
## example, an article in the second issue reported a labour
## dispute involving several hundred workers which had broken
                out at a branch of the Keisei Tram Company in March 1926. The
                subtitle of this article referred to ‘Black Action Which Terrified
## the Watchdogs’ and this conveys an idea of the role which
                Kokuren militants regularly assumed in such disputes. Practical
100 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                support was given to the Keisei tramworkers, both in the form
## of leafleting and by physically confronting the police. The
## article explained that Kokuren had ‘resolved from a class
## standpoint to give all-out support’ to the workers. Kokuren
## members were described as having backed the dispute ‘with
                the utmost bravery for the benefit of the class’, leading to
                twenty of them being arrested.[120]
                The readiness of Kokuren militants to battle with the police also
                flowed from their perception of themselves as a revolutionary
## minority whose responsibility it was to precipitate the
## revolution. Another article in the same issue of Kokushoku
## Seinen throws light on this area of Kokuren’s political
                philosophy. This article was entitled ‘The Strength to Create a
                Historical Turning Point’ and its purpose was to refute what it
                perceived as the Marxist notion of historical inevitability. It
## asserted that ‘just as we cannot dream about our day coming
                tomorrow, so we cannot wait for the day when the majority of
                our brothers will consciously awake’. The article took the view
                that it was up to the anarchists to seize the initiative and create
                the conditions for social transformation, since ‘the actions that
                will realise this and create this opportunity are inevitably the
                mission of the revolutionary minority’.[121]
                Kokuren’s perception of its role as an activist minority initially
                reinforced its commitment to class struggle. Both views acted
## in the early stages of Kokuren’ s existence to induce its
## militants to involve themselves in labour disputes and to
                confront the police with scant regard for their own safety. Other
## notable disputes in which Kokuren members became actively
## involved were those by 600 workers at Hitachi’s Kameido

## Factory in September/October 1926 and at the Japan Musical
## Instruments Company in Hamamatsu from April until August
                1926. In the Hitachi strike, Kokuren militants issued leaflets
                threatening the capitalists and, in order to give substance to
## their words, they firebombed the mansion belonging to the
## company president, Kuhara Fusanosuke. Arising out of this
## incident, six members of Kokuren were imprisoned for arson
                and riot.[122] The Japan Musical Instruments Company strike
## was an epic confrontation by more than 1,200 workers, who
## showed enormous resilience throughout 105 days, an amazing
## period over which to sustain a strike in the conditions
                prevailing in prewar Japan. Although the bolshevik-led Hyōgikai
## union federation made a major commitment to this strike,
## Hyōgikai’s involvement should not be allowed to obscure the
## fact that Kokuren also gave active support to the Hamamatsu
                workers. Indeed, the point is worth making that in this period
## many rank-and-file Hyōgikai members were inclined to
## anarchism, despite their leaders’ alignment with the
                Communist Party.[123]

## Anarchist syndicalist ideas were evident among Kokuren
                members during the early days of its existence. As an article
                on ‘Black Action and Labour Unions’, which again appeared in
                the second issue of Kokushoku Seinen, put it: ‘we believe that
                the means of revolution in Japan have to be collective action
                centred on the labour unions’.[124] Such views did not go
## unchallenged, however, and a further strand in Kokuren’s
                political philosophy that was equally evident in the early issues
## of Kokushoku Seinen was hostility to urbanisation. For
## example, an article in issue number 4 declared that ‘the

102 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                farmers are the source of civilisation’[125] and another article,
                entitled ‘Revolt Against the City’, in the third issue of the
## journal, discussed in some detail the parts to be played by
                farmers and urban workers in the revolutionary process. As far
                as the writer of this unsigned article was concerned, the cities
## were simply centres of overwork for the workers and of
                superfluous production of unnecessary goods for the benefit of
                the capitalists. All necessary production of truly useful goods
## was rooted in the land. The cities were seen as having an
## exploitative relationship with the countryside, which meant
                that:
                all people who live in the cities are undoubtedly exploiting the
                villages. That’s even the case for the workers. However, the
                city workers certainly are not exploiting on their own initiative,
                nor are they satisfied with this state of affairs.[126]

## The same article recognised that most urban workers
## originated from the farming villages, economic necessity
## having driven them to work in the factories.

                Hence, most city workers are essentially people who have the
                ability ‘to produce in order to satisfy everyone’s needs’. If they
                converted their industrial skills from ‘making motor cars’ to
                ‘making spades’, they could sufficiently participate in true
                ‘production in order to satisfy everyone’s needs’.[127]

## However, it was maintained that such a fundamental
## reorientation of production could not take place within the
                framework of existing society. For this to occur, the cities would
## have to be destroyed and those within them who exercised
                authority over the rest of society would have to be stripped of
103 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                their power. In contrast to anarchist syndicalism’s aim of taking
                over the urban industries, this article asserted that it is only
                rulers and exploiters who need cities, not those who live by
                their own efforts. The alternative strategy which it therefore
                recommended was for the ‘city workers and village workers’ to
                join forces. The article made clear that, for this to take place,
## the urban workers would have to abandon the cities to the
                capitalists and other parasites and take their skills back to the
                countryside.[128]

## Clearly there were tensions between the various theoretical
## and strategical orientations which different members of
## Kokuren adopted. As time went by, anarchist syndicalism and
## the theory of the class struggle came in for increasingly
## forthright criticism from a majority of Kokuren members.
                Conversely, the penchant for violent struggle by an activist
## minority and ideological rejection of the cities became
                entrenched characteristics of those who remained in Kokuren’s
                ranks. Hatta Shūzō’s theories exerted a considerable influence
## among Kokuren members and played no small part in
## determining which of the various strands within Kokuren’s
                initial mélange of theories would prevail. In particular, his
                extended article ‘An Investigation into Syndicalism’, which was
## serialised in Kokushoku Seinen between September and
## November 1927, was a powerful attack on anarchist
                syndicalism and included a section entitled ‘A Criticism of the
                Theory of the Class Struggle’.[129] It was due to the influence
## exerted on Kokuren members by articles such as this that,
                within a short time of its formation, Kokuren became a bastion
## of pure anarchism within the wider anarchist movement.

## Later issues of Kokushoku Seinen contained many articles
                which strongly affirmed anarchist communism and stressed its
                distinctive character relative to other currents of anarchism.
                One particularly forceful statement to this effect appeared in
## the Esperanto column of issue number 22, where the
## distinction between anarchist syndicalism and anarchist
## communism was stressed for the benefit of overseas readers.
                In part, this article read:
                The anarchist movement is progressing a great deal in Japan at
## the present time. In other countries we find an anarchist
## movement which links up with the syndicalists. But in this
                country we do not approve of them, driving them away just as
## we do the bolsheviks. We are even against anarchist
                syndicalism and we adhere to anarchist communism.[130]

## Many Kokuren militants were active within the Zenkoku Rōdō
## Kumiai Jiyū Rengōkai (All-Japan Libertarian Federation of
                Labour Unions, generally abbreviated to Zenkoku Jiren) after
## that organisation was formed in May 1926. The relationship
## between Kokuren and Zenkoku Jiren has sometimes been
                likened to that between the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI)
## and the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) in Spain.
                [131] Yet, although the drawing of such parallels may help to
                convey to those outside Japan Kokuren’s role as an inner core
                of battle-hardened militants within the wider ranks of Zenkoku
                Jiren, it should not be allowed to obscure the major differences
                in theoretical orientation that distinguished Kokuren from the
## FAI. More will be said about Kokuren below but, in order to
                grasp the full extent of the shakeout between pure anarchists
                and anarchist syndicalists which occurred in Japan in the late

## Zenkoku Jiren

                The founding conference of Zenkoku Jiren took place on 24 May
                1926. The conference was held in the Asakusa district in Tōkyō
## and the meeting place was kept secret even from the
                delegates until the day before to prevent the authorities from
## banning the conference. Some 400 delegates attended,
## representing 25 unions with a combined membership of 8,372
                workers. It is worth listing the participating unions, since this
## conveys the geographical spread of the anarchist union
## movement and the range of industries involved, even if
## absolute numbers were small due to the limited size of the

                up the meetings of those it considered hostile to working class
                interests. Conscious that the majority of workers were still
## unorganised, Zenkoku Jiren announced its intention to
## campaign among such workers so as to convince them of the
## need to form libertarian union federations. The problem of
                unemployment was addressed by calling for the introduction of
                a number of reforms, such as the establishment of the eight-
## hour day and the adoption of measures for dealing with
## seasonal unemployment among casual labourers. Other
## decisions were concerned with establishing industry-by-
## industry organisation, persuading sympathetic but as yet

## unaffiliated unions to join Zenkoku Jiren, abolishing all
## oppressive laws and ordinances. and promoting a network of
                Far-Eastern libertarian labour unions.[133]
                The programme which the conference adopted read as follows:

## We take the class struggle as the basis for the movement to
## liberate the workers and tenant farmers.
## We reject all political movements and insist on economic
## action alone.
## We advocate libertarian federation organised industry by
## industry and we reject centralised authoritarianism.
## We oppose imperialist aggression and advocate the
                international solidarity of the working class.[134]

## The influence of the classic formulation of syndicalist
## principles, the CGT’s Charter of Amiens (1906), on Zenkoku
## Jiren’s programme is evident both in the latter’s stated
                commitment to class struggle and in its rejection of all political
## movements. Just as Zenkoku Jiren’s programme declared that
                ‘we take the class struggle as the basis for the movement to
## liberate the workers and tenant farmers’, so the Charter of
                Amiens had proclaimed:
                The Congress considers that this declaration is a recognition of
## the class struggle which, on the economic terrain, sets the
## workers in revolt against all forms of exploitation and
                oppression, both material and moral, which are instigated by
                the capitalist class against the working class.[135]
                Similarly, Zenkoku Jiren ‘s affirmation that ‘we reject all political
## movements and insist on economic action alone’ mirrored the
                Charter of Amiens’ declaration that ‘the CGT groups, outside of
108 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                all political schools, all those workers who are conscious of the
## struggle leading to the disappearance of wage-earning and
                employment’.[136]

## Zenkoku Jiren’s programme was supplemented by an agreed
                set of rules, the third clause of which was the most significant.
                This clause emphasised that, providing there was no conflict
                with the programme, unions which affiliated to Zenkoku Jiren
## were independent and autonomous as far as their actions and
                the management of their own affairs were concerned.[137]
                Such freedom of action was clearly attractive to many unions,
## since Zenkoku Jiren grew rapidly in the period immediately
                after its formation, with numerous unions affiliating to it.
                Notable among these affiliating organisations were the Hitachi
## Employees’ Union, the Korean Casual Workers’ Union and
                unions in regions where initially Zenkoku Jiren had not been
## implanted, such as Niigata and Asahikawa. Membership was
## expanded in the Tōkyō newspaper industry, the Tōkyō Gas
## Workers’ Union affiliated, and Zenkoku Jiren established a
                presence at various big factories and heavy industrial centres.
## There was also a rationalisation of union structure along
## industrial union lines, with the formation of a national
                printworkers’ federation, a national metalworkers’ federation
                and So on. The overall effect of these developments was that it
## was not long before Zenkoku Jiren claimed more than 15,000
                members.[138]

## Zenkoku Jiren started to issue a journal, called Jiyū Rengō
                (Libertarian Federation), from 5 June 1926. The same range of
                views on questions of theory and strategy that was evident in
                Kokushoku Seinen was also found in the columns of Jiyū Rengō.

## Syndicalism was well represented in the early issues of the
                journal. For example, in issue number 2 there was an article on
                the French syndicalist Fernand Pelloutier, which described him
                as ‘the father of the labour movement’ at the same time that it
                talked about ‘we young anarchist syndicalists of Japan’.[139]
                Similarly, in the joint issue of numbers 9 and 10, there was a
## report on the formation in France of the CGTSR (SR =
                Syndicaliste Révolutionnaire).[140]
                On the other hand, an article by a Tōkyō printworker in issue
## number 7, entitled ‘Let’s Abandon the Cities’, was against
                industrial concentration in urban centres. After claiming that
                the land and its produce are the basis of life, the article went on
                to look at the relationship between those who work in the cities
## and those who work on the land. It argued that, even though
                the city workers and ‘the village workers, in other words the
                tenant farmers’, are both proletarians, the life of the latter is far
                harder and more miserable than the former: ‘At present the
                city workers are exploited by their employers but, all the same,
                they benefit from some share in the exploitation of the villages
                by the cities.’ The article recognised that urban workers have
                to fight against the bosses who exploit them, but it insisted
## that they should also oppose the continued existence of the
                cities in any shape or form, because inevitably cities stand in
## an exploitative relationship with the villages. The urban
## workers were urged to adopt such an attitude not solely for
                altruistic reasons, but also because it was in their own interests
## to do so. The argument proceeded from the observation that
                the cities grew fat at the expense of the villages, allowing some
                crumbs from this exploitation to fall to the urban workers. Since
110 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                continuing exploitation of the rural areas was progressively
                impoverishing them, however, the urban workers’ share in the
## diminishing . surplus that could be extracted from an
## increasingly destitute countryside was bound to dwindle.
                Hence the logic of the present economic system was that both
## tenant farmers and urban workers faced increasing hardship,
## which gave them a common interest in revolutionary change.
                It is true that the conclusion which the article reached was that
## the tenant farmers and the urban workers should stand
                shoulder to shoulder. Nevertheless, it was striking that in a city-
## based union journal, such as Jiyū Rengō, the point was made
## that it is the former who occupy a crucial position in the
                struggle for human liberation. This view was taken because not
## only were the tenant farmers deemed to be forced into
                resisting their immediate exploiters, the landlords, but also
                their position within society led them to confront the cities.
                [141]
                During the first eighteen months of its existence, the unions
## federated to Zenkoku Jiren were involved in numerous
## disputes. The strike at Hitachi’s factory in Kameido in
## September/October 1926 has already been mentioned in
## connection with the firebombing of the company president’s
## mansion by Kokuren militants. The union at Kameido was the
## Hitachi Employees’ Union, which had been organised in June
                1926 and had promptly affiliated to Zenkoku Jiren. This dispute
                was prominently reported in the columns of Jiyū Rengō.[142]
## There were also many disputes involving printworkers. A
## detailed analysis of those printworkers’ disputes which had
## flared up in 1926 appeared in Jiyū Rengō in September 1927.

111 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                According to the figures given there, in 1926 there had been
## seventy disputes involving the All-Japan Printworkers’
                Federation.[143] This high level of disputes continued into
                1927. Articles in the July and October 1927 issues of Jiyū Rengō
                stated that the number of disputes that had occurred in Tokyo
                printing works in May and June 1927 was probably the highest
## in any two-month period since the formation of the Tokyo
                Printworkers’ Union and that there had been thirty-six disputes
                involving the All-Japan Printworkers’ Federation during the first
                half of 1927.[144] In addition, there were articles in various
                issues of Jiyū Rengō which discussed the correct tactics to be
## employed in labour disputes and which invariably argued
                strongly against centralised leadership and decision-making.
                [145]

## Zenkoku Jiren was also involved in a number of campaigns,
## often in association with Kokuren. It campaigned vigorously
## against the attempt by the printing companies to introduce
                ‘workers’ record books’ (shokkō techō) into the industry. Since
                these were designed to record information on a worker’s skills,
                productivity, wages, behaviour, length of service, reasons for
                leaving jobs, etc., they were intended to serve as a means of
                controlling and disciplining the workforce, which accounted for
                Zenkoku Jiren’s implacable opposition to their introduction.
                [146] On 23 August 1927 the anarchists Nicola Sacco and
## Bartolomeo Vanzetti were executed in the USA and prior to
## their deaths Zenkoku Jiren and Kokuren mounted a passionate
## campaign for their release, which included public meetings
## and demonstrations. Both federations also launched another
## joint campaign in the same year against Japan’s armed

                intervention in China. This was in response to Prime Minister
## Tanaka dispatching 2,000 troops to Shantung Province in May
                1927, in a move designed to block Chiang Kai Shek’s northern
## expedition, which was considered to be detrimental to the
## interests of Japanese imperialism.

                The line between Kokuren and Zenkoku Jiren was often blurred,
## since the same individual was often a member of both
                federations, but Kokuren’s role as a more theoretically rigorous
## ginger group, which was less inclined to compromise
                politically, was highlighted by the controversy surrounding the
## Pan-Pacific Labour Union Conference which was held in
## Hankow in May 1927. Zenkoku Jiren decided to participate in
                this conference after it received a letter inviting it to send
## delegates in March 1927. The positive initial response from
## Zenkoku Jiren was perhaps understandable, since topics for
## discussion at the conference were to include ‘Preventing a
                Pacific War’ and ‘Pacific Coast Labour Union Cooperation’.[147]
## However, when Zenkoku Jiren’s delegates reached Canton, the
                local anarchists told them that it was the Russian-dominated
## Profintern which was behind the conference. Zenkoku Jiren
## should also have been alerted by the fact that the unions
## dominated by the Communist Party of Japan sent a sizeable
                delegation to Hankow. Despite this, Zenkoku Jiren’s delegates
## pressed on from Canton to Hankow and took part in the
                proceedings, only to find themselves on the receiving end of its
                bolshevik organisers’ machinations. After returning to Japan, a
## report on the treatment accorded to them was issued, which
                read as follows:

## During the conference the Communists obliged our two

## comrades to have only one vote and referred their items on
                ‘Sacco and Vanzetti’ and the ‘Freeing of political prisoners in all
                countries’ to ... representatives who were not fully informed on
## the subjects.
## And after the conference the Communists pressed our
## comrades to sign agreements that Zenkoku Jiren would in
## future not oppose the Communists in Japan. What arrogance!
## Understandably, our comrades refused and reported on their
## return that the conference was manipulated by Communist
                charlatans.[148]
                Despite such explanations, Kokuren remained highly critical of
## Zenkoku Jiren’s participation in this Profintern-organised
## conference. In September 1927, Zenkoku Jiren published an
                explanation of its participation in the Hankow conference.[149]
                Kokuren printed this explanation in its own paper and added a
                note of its own which criticised what it saw as the opportunist
## elements within Zenkoku Jiren who had supported the
                conference.[150] By opportunist elements it meant the
## anarchist syndicalists. Hence the controversy over the Pan-
## Pacific Labour Union Conference became an issue in the
## debate between supporters and opponents of syndicalism, a
## debate which became increasingly bitter as 1927 progressed
                and as the date of Zenkoku Jiren’s second national conference
## approached.

                The anarchist syndicalists within Kokuren’s ranks started to
## issue a journal of their own from June 1927. Known as Han
## Seitō Undō (Anti-Political Party Movement), it opposed all
## political parties, no matter whether they were avowedly
                bourgeois or supposedly proletarian. One of those behind this
114 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## journal was Utagawa Noboru (1895–1944) who had been one
                of Zenkoku Jiren’s delegates to the Pan-Pacific Labour Union
                Conference. The anarchist syndicalists within Kokuren felt the
## need for their own paper because Kokushoku Seinen was
## becoming increasingly open in its attacks on syndicalism,
## reflecting the pure anarchist leanings of the majority of
## Kokuren members. For example, in the issue of Kokushoku
## Seinen which was published two weeks before the second
## conference of Zenkoku Jiren; the lead article was headlined
## ‘Bury the Dictatorial Unionists’ and was outspokenly antisyndicalist in tone and content.[151] The appearance of Han
## Seitō Undō raised the temperature of the polemics between
## anarchist syndicalists and pure anarchists, leading to the
## former’s withdrawal from Kokuren, with the result that pure
## anarchists came to comprise the overwhelming majority of
## those who remained in its ranks.

## As 1927 progressed, tension between anarchist syndicalists
                and pure anarchists was similarly building up within Zenkoku
                Jiren and was reflected in the columns of Jiyū Rengō. In July
                1927 the pure anarchist Iwasa Sakutarō’s (1879–1967) booklet
                Anarchists Answer Like This was published.[152] There was a
                critical review of lwasa’s booklet and of his pure anarchist
                rejection of the theory of the class struggle by someone who
## signed himself Katamachi in the issue of Jiyū Rengō which
                appeared on 5 August 1927.[153] This review provoked, in its
## tum, a pure anarchist retort by Mizunuma Tatsuo (1892–1965)
## in the next issue on 5 September 1927. In this polemic,
## Mizunuma explained that he was not against prosecuting the
## class struggle, but that he was opposed to a theory which

115 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                sought to reduce all social phenomena to a simplistic scenario
## that allowed only for antagonism between capital and wage
                labour. To reduce all social conflicts to this simple formula
## meant that the mass of tenant farmers could have no
## significant role to play. Mizunuma claimed that those who
                adhere to the theory of the class struggle habitually argue that
## everything depends on the actions of the proletariat, even
## though ‘the number of wage labourers among the people has
                not even reached 10 per cent’.[154]
                Katamachi had claimed in his article that the class struggle was
                a conscious struggle over control of the means of production
                between owners of capital and sellers of labour power. In other
                words, he had criticised Iwasa’s view that the class struggle is
## simply a struggle over the share of the social product that
                should accrue to the capitalist or the worker.[155] Mizunuma
                rebutted Katamachi’s interpretation of the everyday struggle
## over wages and working conditions. According to him,
## experience showed that countless struggles between
## capitalists and workers are confined to the issue of how to
                share out the social product, and are not informed by the type
## of consciousness needed for attaining a new society.
                Mizunuma argued that if pure anarchists did think in terms of
                the class struggle, it was a class struggle which was entirely
                different from that on which the anarchist syndicalists pinned
                their hopes:
                The class struggle on which libertarian federation lays stress is
## not merely aiming to transfer the ownership of the means of
## production from the capitalists to the workers, as Brother
                Katamachi advocates. It has to be the initial means of going
116 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                beyond that and realising a truly free and equal society without
                classes and where all social exploitation will be abolished.[156]

## It was against this background of tension between anarchist
                syndicalists and pure anarchists that the second conference of
## Zenkoku Jiren was held on 19 and 20 November 1927.

## Zenkoku Jiren’s Second Conference

                The second conference of Zenkoku Jiren was again held in the
                Asakusa district of Tōkyō, on this occasion in an annexe to the
                Honganji Temple. As often happens with theoretical disputes,
## the controversy between pure anarchists and anarchist
## syndicalists at this conference assumed the form of a
                protracted wrangle over how to interpret Zenkoku Jiren’s rules.
## The issue over which the two sides squared up was the
## representation of the Ōsaka Amalgamated Workers’ Union.
                This syndicalist-inclined union had joined the Kansai Federation
## of Zenkoku Jiren in May 1927, but had subsequently been
                expelled by the same federation on the grounds that it was in
## conflict with Zenkoku Jiren’s programme. However, the Ōsaka
## Amalgamated Workers’ Union persisted in sending delegates
                to the Zenkoku Jiren conference in Tōkyō, claiming that it was
## still a member of the national organisation, despite its
                expulsion from the regional federation.[157] Some of those
## attending the conference denounced the Ōsaka Amalgamated
                Workers’ Union as a bolshevik group and, such was the passion
## which this union’s status engendered, that the dispute over
## whether its representatives should be allowed to take their
                seats occupied a full day and a half of conference time.[158]
                Although the national conference eventually upheld the Kansai
117 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## Federation’s expulsion of the Ōsaka Amalgamated Workers’
                Union, and thus refused seating rights to the union’s delegates,
                by the time this decision had finally been taken the conference
## was reduced to utter confusion. Antagonism between pure
                anarchists and anarchist syndicalists was running high and the
                conference was adjourned until a later date.[159]

## One person who had become alarmed by the intensity of the
                arguments between pure anarchists and anarchist syndicalists
                was Augustin Souchy (1892–1984), secretary of the syndicalist
                International Workers’ Association (IWA). Writing on 4 October
## 1927 from the IWA’s head office in Berlin, Souchy sent
## greetings to Zenkoku Jiren and expressed hopes for the
                success of the conference ‘in the name of the syndicalists of
                the entire world’. He then added:

## Comrades! We have heard something about a current
## theoretical dispute between the pure anarchists and pure
                syndicalists within the Japanese libertarian labour movement.
                If we might express our opinion, now is not really the time for a
## dispute over such an issue. It has taken on an entirely
                theoretical character. On this occasion, we would like to draw
## your attention to Argentina and to the South American
                countries in general. In these countries the labour movement
                acts in the spirit of Mikhail Bakunin and also, at the same time,
## is under the spiritual guidance of our indomitable pioneer
                Errico Malatesta. In these countries, all anarchists heroically
                take part in the syndicalist movement, while, at the same time,
## all syndicalists are fighting to abolish the oppressive
                machinery of the state and to resist capitalist exploitation. In
                Spain too, anarchists and syndicalists apportion between them
118 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                concern for economic questions and for the spiritual side of
                things in such a way that theoretical disputes do not arise.
                [160]

## Yet, although Souchy’s letter was published as a front-page
                article in Jiyū Rengō on 10 January 1928, and despite the cases
## it cited of countries where anarchists and syndicalists
## cooperated readily, it did little to cool tempers. Kokuren
                published a rejoinder to the IWA the following month, in which
                it declared that since 1927 it had been engaged in a struggle
                against ‘the betrayers, opportunists and union imperialists’ in
                Zenkoku Jiren’s ranks.[161] This was a foretaste of the mood
## which was to prevail when the second conference of Zenkoku
## Jiren reconvened in March 1928.

## Prior to the reconvening of Zenkoku Jiren’s conference, the
                Tōkyō Printworkers’ Union held its conference on 19 February
## 1928. The programme of the Tōkyō Printworkers’ Union had
## hitherto been modelled on the famous Charter of Amiens, but
## at their February conference the printworkers broke with
                anarchist syndicalism and revised their union’s statement of
                principles accordingly.[162] Having taken this step, it was the
                printworkers who pressed hardest for changing Zenkoku Jiren’s
## programme when the delegates to its second conference
                reassembled in the Hongō district of Tōkyō on 17 March 1928.
                They called for Zenkoku Jiren’s original, four-point programme
                to be replaced by a simple affirmation that ‘We take libertarian
## federation as the basis for the movement to liberate the
                workers and farmers.’[163] This was opposed by the Tōkyō
## Casual Workers’ Union, whose delegates countered by
## proposing a revised programme which differed less

                fundamentally from the original:

## We take the class struggle as the basis for the liberation
## movement of the workers and farmers.
                We shall resist all authority, not by means of political parties
                and cliques, but by relying on the strength of the workers and
## farmers themselves.
## We emphasise the need for organisation based on libertarian
## federation and reject organisation based on centralised
## authority.
## We oppose imperialism and promote the international
                solidarity of the working class.[164]

## The debate over the programme commenced on 17 March and
## continued into the next day’s session, with tempers getting
## frayed on both sides and the atmosphere in the hall
## deteriorating. Kokuren members barracked the anarchist
## syndicalists, jeering and catcalling at them, and the
## proceedings degenerated to the level where it was almost
## impossible to hear the speeches. Eventually, the anarchist
                syndicalists decided that they had had enough. Unfurling their
                black flags, they walked out of the hall to a chorus of taunts,
                such as ‘blind believers in central authority!’, ‘bolsheviks!’ and
                ‘betrayers!’[165] Following this, the printworkers’ amendment
## of the programme was approved, and the unions and branches
## which had withdrawn were formally expelled from Zenkoku
                Jiren. It was significant that Hatta was among those who spoke
                in the final session and that his speech was one of those which
                evoked enthusiastic applause.[166]

## The unions that withdrew from the conference included the
## Tōkyō Casual Workers’ Union, the Kōtō and Nankatsu branches

## of the Tōkyō General Workers’ Union, and the Tōkyō Food
                Workers’ Union. There is evidence that, at least in some cases,
                the pure anarchists were justified in accusing their opponents
## of sympathising with bolshevism. After their expulsion from
## Zenkoku Jiren, both the Tōkyō Casual Workers’ Union and the
## Nankatsu branch of the Tōkyō General Workers’ Union
## subsequently affiliated to the Zenkoku Kyōgikai (National
## Council, generally abbreviated to Zenkyō) union federation.
                [167] Formed in December 1928, Zenkyō openly supported the
## Communist Party, so much so that its journal, Rōdō Shinbun
                (Labour Newspaper), declared in January 1929: ‘In order to
## liberate the working class from the pits of oppression, to
## destroy capitalism, and to achieve communism, our council
## must be under the political leadership of the Japanese
                Communist Party, which is the organizational unit of the most
                advanced element of the Japanese proletariat.’[168] On the
## other hand, the Kōtō branch of the Tōkyō General Workers’
## Union and the Tōkyō Food Workers’ Union maintained their
                commitment to anarchist syndicalism and jointly formed one of
                the foci around which the anarchist syndicalist union federation
## Nihon Rōdō Kumiai Jiyū Rengō Kyōgikai (Libertarian Federal
## Council of Labour Unions of Japan, generally abbreviated to
                Jikyō) was to form.[169] A section of the Ōsaka Amalgamated
                Workers’ Union, whose delegates had been at the centre of the
                controversy in November 1927, also subsequently affiliated to
## the Communist Party’s Zenkyō union federation and most of
                the activists connected with the anarchist syndicalist journal
                Han Seitō Undō eventually turned to bolshevism.[170] As
## Shirai Shinpei (1907–88) put it in later years, of those
                associated with Han Seitō Undō, ‘only three people stayed with

## the black flag’—Enishi Ichizō (1901–84), Takahashi Kōkichi
                (1903–84) and Shirai himself.[171] It would be unfair to pay
                disproportionate attention to those anarchist syndicalists who
## switched their allegiance to bolshevism, but it cannot be
## denied either that such defections from the anarchist
                syndicalist camp lent weight to Hatta’s claim that syndicalism
## was an inherently unstable amalgam of ‘anarchist’ and
## ‘Marxist’ elements which, on breaking down, was likely to
## metamorphose into reformism. The theory which underpinned
## this claim will be examined in the next chapter.

## Kokuren and Zenkoku Jiren after the split

                After the split in Zenkoku Jiren, organisational separation of
## pure anarchists and anarchist syndicalists occurred in many
## unions and also in other fields of anarchist activity. For
## example, the more than 5,000 members of the Tōkyō
                Printworkers’ Union divided in April 1929, with the anarchist
## syndicalists in its ranks breaking away to form the Tōkyō
## Printworkers’ Federation, which no longer had any
                organisational connection with Zenkoku Jiren. In oilier areas of
                Japan too, anarchist syndicalists withdrew from Zenkoku Jiren
                in order to set up organisationally distinct unions of their own.
## The Kyōto General Workers’ Union, the Kyōto Printworkers’
                Union, the Izumi Fishworkers’ Union and the Kishiwada branch
                of the Black General Workers’ Union all emerged from Zenkoku
                Jiren in this fashion midway through 1929.[172] Similarly, at
## the end of 1929, the confrontation between pure anarchists
                and anarchist syndicalists led to the demise of the anarchist
## literary and theoretical magazine, Kokushoku Sensen (Black

                Battlefront), which had been launched in February of that year.
## Differences between those associated with this journal had
## been exacerbated by arguments over Hatta’s pamphlet The
## Fallacy of the Theory of the Class Struggle, which was
                published by Zenkoku Jiren in August 1929. From October 1929
                a number of meetings were held to discuss the attitude which
## anarchists should adopt towards the class struggle. These
                failed to resolve the differences and the controversy finally
## came to a head at an editorial meeting over a lead article
                which declared itself for ‘true libertarian federation’ (shin no
                jiyū rengōshugi) at the same time that it bracketed syndicalism
                and Marxism together. Following the final issue of Kokushoku
                Sensen, which carried this article, in December 1929, the pure
## anarchists and the anarchist syndicalists each sought to
## replace it with a magazine oriented towards their own
                theoretical position. The pure anarchists’ Kurohata (Black Flag)
## appeared from January 1930 and the anarchist syndicalists’
                Kokusen (Black Battle) from February of the same year.[173]

## Kokuren was in the thick of the process whereby the
                differences between pure anarchists and anarchist syndicalists
## were pushed to the point of organisational splits and
## confrontation. As far as it was concerned, the anarchist
## syndicalists had betrayed true anarchism and were no better
## than crypto-bolsheviks. In Kokuren’s eyes, the anarchist
                syndicalists (whom it preferred to call plain ‘syndicalists’,
## thereby denying them any association with anarchism) had
## shown their real colours in splitting away from the pure
                anarchists and were therefore as legitimate targets of violent
                direct action as were the capitalists or the bolsheviks. Violent

## confrontations between Kokuren’s militants and anarchist
## syndicalists became commonplace and Kokushoku Seinen kept
## up a withering criticism of syndicalism’s methods and
## objectives. As well as articles by Hatta, such as the
                characteristically titled ‘The Daily Struggle Is Utopian’, there
## were many articles by other writers dealing with the union
                movement and discussing revolutionary strategy.[174]

## It would be wrong to think that, because Kokuren’s members
## had come to reject syndicalism, they were automatically
                hostile to unions. On the contrary, as an article published in
## April 1928 on ‘Anarchists and the Union Movement’ made
## clear, they considered that under capitalism workers were
## bound to form unions in order to pursue economic objectives
                and resist the bosses. However, they did not believe that there
## was anything inherently, or even potentially, revolutionary
## about workers engaging in such activity. Workers would only
## become revolutionaries to the extent that they made a
## conscious choice to direct their struggle away from seeking
## improvements within capitalism towards overthrowing
## capitalism and reorganising life on the basis of anarchist
## communism. This was where genuine anarchists had a role to
## play, since their function ‘must be, via the daily economic
## struggle, to make the workers themselves aware of the fact
## that, without unionists embracing anarchist communism, they
                can never bring about the true liberation of the workers’. If
## anarchist communists were to neglect this role, day-to-day
## economic demands would be uppermost in the workers’ minds
## and unions would be nothing more than ‘mere organs of daily
                economic struggle’.[175]

## Various commentators have argued that, after the anarchist
## syndicalists broke away from Zenkoku Jiren, it came to have
## more the character of an ideological movement than of a
## federation of labour unions. This is an exaggeration.
                Organisationally Zenkoku Jiren remained a federation of labour
## unions. The list of constituent organisations published in
## Zenkoku Jiren’s organ Jiyū Rengō in August 1928 gave the
## names and addresses of seventeen unions in all. Eleven of
## these unions were grouped into regional federations in the
## Kantō, Chūgoku and Hiroshima areas, while the other unions
## were located in urban centres such as Kyōto, Kōbe, Niigata,
                Sapporo and Hakodate.[176] It is true that, while it survived,
## Kokuren exerted a strong ideological influence on Zenkoku
                Jiren and acted to reinforce the latter’s commitment to pure
                anarchism, but there is ample evidence that the Zenkoku Jiren
                unions welcomed their relationship with Kokuren. A resolution
## jointly moved by the Okayama General Workers’ Union and the
## Okayama Textile Workers’ Union at Zenkoku Jiren’s second
                conference stated that ‘as long as Zenkoku Jiren’s objective
                and that adhered to by Kokuren are identical, Zenkoku Jiren will
                have a close, organic relationship with Kokuren.’[177]
                Where the ‘ideological’ outlook of Zenkoku Jiren could be said
## to have shown itself was in the attitude it adopted towards
## labour disputes. Even when Zenkoku Jiren became involved in
                clashes with the bosses, it continually directed the attention of
                the workers beyond the immediate conflict to the battle for a
## new society. For example, in late 1930 a struggle against
## redundancies and wage cuts broke out at the Shibaura Works
## which was jointly owned by Mitsui and the American General

## Electric (G.E.) Company. By the standards of the time, the
## Shibaura Works was a large factory, employing 1,300 workers
                in the production of electrical machinery’. Zenkoku Jiren was
                heavily involved in this dispute, running articles on it in Jiyū
                Rengō Shinbun (Libertarian Federation Newspaper),[178]
## organising meetings, distributing leaflets and supporting
## demonstrations. At a packed meeting held in Shibaura on 1
## December 1930, Zenkoku Jiren’s speakers were one after
                another ordered by the police to stop speaking and more than
                ten were arrested. After the strike ended in defeat in February
                1931, Jiyū Rengō Shinbun wrote:
                Even though the strike was crushed, we did not give in to the
                capitalists’ tyranny. We are well aware of the fact that our
                situation and the present state of society mean that struggles
## against those bastards (yatsura) must end in defeat. So our
## struggle towards victory certainly cannot be fought only
                against the capitalists of the Shibaura Works. Our true victory
                lies in directing our attack against the very world order which
                forces us to struggle only to see those struggles end in defeat.
                [179]
                In other words, Zenkoku Jiren ‘s message on this and similar
## occasions was that nothing short of the destruction of
## capitalism and its replacement by anarchist communism could
## solve the workers’ hardships. Short of this fundamental
                solution to their problems, workers would remain permanently
                disadvantaged in a society whose very make-up stacked all the
                cards against them. This was certainly a radically different
## outlook from that which has characterised most unions,
                whether in Japan or elsewhere. Surely the most striking feature

## of Zenkoku Jiren after the departure of the anarchist
                syndicalists from its ranks, however, was not its ‘ideological’
                distance from conventional unionism, but rather the extent to
## which its supposedly ideological, pure anarchism enthused
                significant numbers of rank and file unionists, despite the fact
                that it promised no immediate improvements to their situation
## within capitalism.

                Another way in which the ‘ideological’ commitment of Zenkoku
                Jiren to pure anarchism was manifested was in the attention it
## paid to the farming communities, despite its own members’
                location in an industrial and urban environment. In this regard
## too, Kokuren’s influence on Zenkoku Jiren was important.
                While, as was noted earlier, Kokuren recognised the unions as
                a target for organised anarchist intervention, it attached no
## particular significance to the labour movement. Kokuren
## regarded the unions as merely one field among many which
                offered anarchists opportunities for promoting revolution.[180]
                It considered the rural villages and urban neighbourhoods to
                be just as important as the factories, and hence, unlike the
## anarchist syndicalists, Kokuren’s members saw no reason to
                concentrate their efforts on industry. Rather it was the case
## that Kokuren looked especially to the tenant farmers as the
## most potent source of revolution in Japan. As an article in
                Kokushoku Seinen put it in February 1931:
                Revolution—in particular anarchist revolution—will occur when
## the farmers rebel simultaneously throughout the country to
## escape from their agony.
## Today a dangerous atmosphere envelops the whole of Japan.
## Disturbances on account of poor economic conditions are

                occurring here and there. We anarchists are conscious that our
                responsibility is very great. A feeling of urgency abounds in our
                camp.[181]

## Such sentiments were transmitted from Kokuren to Zenkoku
                Jiren. Numerous articles in Zenkoku Jiren’s journals dwelt on the
                poverty afflicting the tenant farmers, whose lives were even
                more miserable and insecure than those of the urban workers,
                and on the ways in which the existing farming villages could be
## transformed into the communes which, it was believed, would
                be the basic units of an anarchist communist society. An issue
                of Jiyū Rengō Shinbun in April 1929 focused on the countryside
## and took up many of the themes which were of central
## importance to pure anarchism. Mutual aid was presented as
                the foundation stone of rural life and the land as the key to
                universal well-being. Precisely because the farming villages
## were said to be doubly exploited by both the cities and the
                landlords, successful revolution depended on the cooperation
                of the farmers and urban workers.[182] In other issues of Jiyū
                Rengō Shinbun the tenant farmers were urged to refuse to pay
## taxes and rent, to abandon the commercial production of
## crops, to refuse to become embroiled in politics, and to
                organise their villages as libertarian federations.[183] Zenkoku
## Jiren also published in September 1928 Hatta’s booklet
                Lectures on Social Problems in the Farming Villages, which was
                further evidence of its ‘ideological’ orientation towards the
## countryside.

                Despite the secession of the anarchist syndicalists, Zenkoku
## Jiren grew in the period following its second conference.
## Although the statistics on union membership in the prewar

                period are not wholly reliable, the available figures show that
## Zenkoku Jiren reached a peak of 16,300 members in 1931.
                [184] In September 1931 the so-called ‘Manchurian Incident’
## occurred and the army’s aggressive action in Manchuria gave
                rise to increasing militarisation and repression within Japan. An
                account of the various strategies which different currents of
## pure anarchists employed after 1931 in their attempts to
## rescue the movement from state repression will be left to
                Chapter 7, but the decline of Kokuren predates the Manchurian
## Incident and therefore needs to be mentioned here.

                In February 1931 Kokuren’s journal, Kokushoku Seinen, wrote:

## The Japanese anarchists do not locate anarchist communism
## in the cultural movement or in the movement to improve the
## lot of the exploited. They define it as a movement of all
## humankind to abolish capitalism—in other words, to abandon
## private property—and to destroy power. They have already
## driven the power-mongers, who call themselves anarchist
## syndicalists, out of their camp and now our comrades have
## actively launched their own anarchist movement throughout
                the entire country.[185]

## Brave words though these were, such remarks proved to be
## the swansong of Kokuren. Its members were acutely aware of
## the ‘terrible economic distress’ experienced by Japanese
## farmers as a result of the world depression and sensed the
                impending political crisis which hung over Japan.[186] But, for
                all their heroics, they were unable to muster sufficient forces to
                detonate the revolution on which they pinned their hopes. On
                the contrary, Kokuren’s recklessly violent activism, coupled
## with the unremitting persecution which it experienced even

                prior to the Manchurian Incident, had the effect of driving all
                but the most committed elements out of its ranks. In 1929 and
## 1930 sections of Kokuren’s membership in Western Honshū
## broke away, so that Kokuren was gradually reduced from the
                nationwide federation it had once been to a narrower grouping
## of uncompromising pure anarchists, whose best known feature
                was their readiness to use violence.[187]

## As indicated above, Kokuren was perpetually harried by the
                state. In fact, every issue of Kokushoku Seinen was prohibited
                from sale and had to be distributed covertly. From September
## 1928 Kokushoku Seinen was reduced from its previous eight
## pages to four pages and its supposedly monthly publication
## became increasingly irregular. Indeed, a full year elapsed
## between the appearance of the last two issues in February
## 1930 and February 1931 respectively. In this situation many
                Kokuren militants found it easier to act under Zenkoku Jiren’s
                colours than to maintain a separate identity as Kokuren. This is
## not to imply that Zenkoku Jiren was untroubled by state
                interference during the period prior to the Manchurian Incident.
## We have already seen how its speakers at public meetings
## were habitually harassed by the police and an article which
                appeared in the Jiyū Rengō Shinbun in July 1929 recorded that
## five out of the previous six issues of thal paper had been
                banned from sale.[188] Nevertheless, Zenkoku Jiren ‘s
                implantation into a working class milieu made it relatively less
## vulnerable to the state’s attempts to suppress it than was
## Kokuren. Even though Jiyū Rengō Shinbun was frequently

## circulated from hand to hand among sympathetic workers.
## Without this advantage, Kokuren was swamped by the
                formidable difficulties which were bound to beset any activist
                group trying to keep alight the flame of anarchist communism
                in a hostile environment. To Kokuren’s credit, even as it was
                overwhelmed, it refused to relinquish its commitment to pure
                anarchism. In what proved to be the final issue of Kokushoku
## Seinen, Kokuren was still talking about a new start for the
## anarchist movement and was still determined to draw a line
## between ‘anarchist communists equipped with genuine
## consciousness’ and the hotchpotch of ‘pan-anarchism’ (which
                it saw as encompassing everything from Stirner’s philosophical
                anarchism to anarchist syndicalism).[189]
                After the collapse of Kokuren, Zenkoku Jiren battled on and met
## the crisis precipitated by the Manchurian Incident with an
                analysis of the capitalist roots of war in the modern world. In an
## attempt to establish international solidarity against armed
                aggression in China, it published an article written in Esperanto
## in the issue of Jiyū Rengō Shinbun which appeared on 10
                November 1931. This article first exposed the lying pretexts
                used by the Japanese army to justify its expansionist moves in
                Manchuria and then explained:
                The true cause of the mobilisation to China is none other than
                the ambition of the Japanese capitalist class and military to
## conquer Manchuria. Japan has its own Monroe doctrine.
                Japanese capitalism cannot develop, or even survive, without
## Manchuria. That is why its government has made up its mind
                to risk anything so as not to lose its many privileges in China ...
## American capital has flowed into China in larger and larger

## amounts. This represents an enormous menace to the
                Japanese capitalist class. In other words, now Japan is forced to
                oppose American capital in China. This is, in fact, the direct
                cause of the mobilisation.[190]
                As with labour disputes, Zenkoku Jiren argued that there was
                no fundamental solution to war other than the achievement of
## anarchist communism. The masses in all countries were urged
                to reject war, cease military production, refuse military service
                and disobey the officers. In an appeal to like-minded anarchists
                abroad, the article concluded:
                Complete international unity of the anarchists would signal our
## victory, not only economically but in the war against war.
## ANARCHIST GROUPS OF ALL COUNTRIES. UNITE! ABOLISH
                IMPERIALIST WAR![191]

## Unrealistic though Zenkoku Jiren might have been in its
## assessment of the strength of the anarchist communist
                movement internationally, it could not be faulted for the clarity
                of its perception that war would remain a scourge as long as
## there were rival nation-states locked into a struggle for
## economic advantage.

## The Anarchist Syndicalists

## Much of Hatta Shūzō’s theoretical output was written within
                the context of the developments which have been described in
                this chapter. Many of his most important texts were published
                either as articles or booklets by Kokuren or Zenkoku Jiren. Since
## several of these works were specifically directed against
## syndicalism, it is appropriate briefly to examine here the

                anarchist syndicalist current which he engaged in theoretical
                debate. Hence, before moving on to a detailed consideration of
                pure anarchist theories in the next two chapters, this chapter
## will conclude with a short account of what became of the
                anarchist syndicalists after they withdrew from Zenkoku Jiren.
                In July 1928 those syndicalist-inclined unions in the Tōkyō area
## which had not moved towards bolshevism in the aftermath of
                the split in Zenkoku Jiren’s ranks formed the Kantō Chihō Rōdō
                Kumiai Jiyū Rengōkai (Kanto District Libertarian Federation of
                Labour Unions, generally known as Chihō Jiren). Chihō Jiren has
## been described as ‘the focus of the movement as a battling
                stronghold of the syndicalists’.[192] In April 1929 a preparatory
## conference to launch a nationwide grouping of anarchist
                syndicalists, the Zenkoku Rōdō Kumiai Jiyū Rengō Kyōgikai (AlIJapan Libertarian Federal Council of Labour Unions, generally
                abbreviated to Zenkoku Jikyō), was held and this was followed
                by a national delegate conference in Tōkyō in June of the same
## year. This brought together twelve unions from the Kantō
                (Eastern Honshū), Kansai (Ōsaka-Kyōto-Kōbe), Chūbu (Central
## Honshū) and Western Kyūshū regions, representing workers in
                the printing, metal, chemical and other industries.[193] These
## anarchist syndicalist unions had a combined membership of
                about 2,000.[194] Even if one includes other loosely related
## and sympathetic groups of anarchist syndicalists, Zenkoku
## Jikyō was a considerably smaller federation than the pure
                anarchist Zenkoku Jiren. As one account puts it, ‘it cannot be
## denied that the syndicalists who had broken away were
                organisationally far weaker than Zenkoku Jiren and numerically
                inferior’.[195] For a time during 1930 and 1931 Zenkoku Jikyō
133 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                adopted the title Jiyū Rengō Dantai Zenkoku Kaigi (All-Japan
                Conference of Libertarian Federation Groups) but by the end of
                1931 it had settled on the name Nihon Rōdō Kumiai Jiyū Rengō
                Kyōgikai (Libertarian Federal Council of Labour Unions of Japan,
                generally abbreviated to Nihon Jikyō). Given this complicated
                story of realignment and changing names, it is probably least
## confusing to refer to the anarchist syndicalists’ union
                federation throughout this period as ‘Jikyō’ and this is the
## convention which will be adopted henceforth. By 1931 Jikyō
## had almost 3,000 members (compared to Zenkoku Jiren’s
                16,300 members in the same year) and, as with Zenkoku Jiren,
                this proved to be the peak membership it attained in any year.
                [196]

## Jikyō came into existence at a time of intensifying class
                struggle. The number of labour disputes was on the increase as
## workers sought to defend themselves against wage cuts, layoffs, factory closures and other measures taken by companies
                to promote ‘rationalisation’. Considering its limited resources,
                Jikyō was involved in an impressive number of these disputes,
                its members repeatedly throwing themselves into the fray and
## enthusiastically lending support to the workers’ struggles.
## Many of the labour disputes of this period were marked by
                violence, since the police habitually intervened on the side of
## the capitalists and many companies routinely employed
                gangsters to intimidate the workforce. It was against such odds
## that Jikyō’s militants regularly took up the cudgels and,
## disregarding the likelihood of beatings and imprisonment,
## committed themselves to struggles which were often doomed
                to failure from the start. Two of the best-known disputes in

## which Jikyō activists were involved were the strikes at the
## Nihon Senjū Company and the Tōkyō Gas Company in April
## and July 1931 respectively. These strikes will be briefly
                described as they are representative of Jikyō’s role in such
## disputes.

## Nihon Senjū was a medium-sized dyeing works in the Asakusa
## district of Tōkyō. It employed about 300 workers and was a
                stronghold of the Jikyō-affiliated Kantō General Workers’ Union.
## When the company moved to rescind the existing labour
## agreement and sack part of the workforce, the union
                responded with a strike and also occupied the factory so as to
## prevent the company from resuming operations using scab
                labour. The company tried to starve the occupying strikers into
## submission by cutting off supplies and the workers met this
## threat by initiating their own hunger strike. The factory
## occupation lasted for twenty-four days and women played key
                roles in the struggle by nursing the hunger strikers, taking care
                of supplies, sticking up posters, organising demonstrations and
## harassing the company directors in their houses. Out of the
## women’s experience, a consumers’ union developed which
                outlasted the dispute itself. The most famous incident in the
                Nihon Senjū dispute came on 1 May when Chiba Hiroshi, a Jikyō
## militant who was a member of the Tōkyō Printworkers’
## Federation, climbed the forty metres-high factory chimney,
                unfurled a black flag, and remained precariously perched aloft
                for the next fourteen days. The tactics used by the Nihon Senjū
                strikers evoked wide sympathy and the dispute was eventually
                resolved by the arbitration of the police.[197]

## The Tōkyō Gas Company dispute was complicated by the

135 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                divide and rule policy which the company adopted for handling
## its workers. In addition to ‘regular’ workers, there was a
                category of ‘external’ workers who were not directly employed
## by the company but by a labour contractor. In July 1931 a
## dispute erupted among these ‘external’ workers, which was
## hampered by the divisions among the workforce. Jikyō became
                involved in this dispute and a group of its militants occupied
## the company’s gas tank. Without food and water, under the
                blazing summer sun, they were driven to the desperate length
                of drinking their own urine in an attempt to slake their thirst.
                Finally, on 2 August, they could hold out no longer and were
## forced down from the gas tank. The strike ended once again
                under the formal guise of police arbitration, but this time it was
                unmistakably a defeat for the workers.[198]
                As a militant union federation, Jikyō could claim a number of
## achievements. For example, its pioneering use of the hunger
                strike in the Nihon Senjū occupation led to the recognition of
## this tactic as an emotive weapon which could be employed in
                labour disputes, sometimes with telling effect, depending on
## the circumstances. However, in their enthusiasm for
                prosecuting the class struggle, Jikyō’s members tended to pay
## less attention than their Zenkoku Jiren counterparts to
## mounting a theoretical challenge to capitalism and to
                propagandising the anarchist alternative. In fact, the class
                struggle became one of the principal bones of contention in the
## bitter polemics between pure anarchists and anarchist
                syndicalists which were the hallmark of this period. It is to
                these polemics, and particularly to the part played in them by
## Hatta Shūzō as he strove to purify anarchism of what he

                considered to be alien influences, such as syndicalism, that we
## now turn.

## 5. Critique of the Old World

## Syndicalism

## For Hatta Shūzō syndicalism was one of the fetters which
                chained the workers to the old world of political power, social
                divisions and exchange relations, rather than offering hope for
## a new world free from state domination and commodity
                production. Why was it that pure anarchists such as Hatta were
                so hostile to a syndicalist strategy which, at first glance.
## seemed to have much in common with anarchism and which,
## indeed, had been enthusiastically embraced by many
## anarchists?

## Hatta regarded syndicalism as an economic movement which
## was a reaction against the negative experience of political
## activity within the labour movement. He argued that
                historically the labour movement had first emerged in Britain
## due to that country’s role as the pioneer of industrial
## capitalism. According to Hatta’s account of the historical
## development of the labour movement, when it had first
## appeared in Britain in the early years of the nineteenth
## century, its adherents had supported the campaign for
                electoral reform which culminated in the Reform Act of 1832.
                Quite apart from the limited extension of the franchise which
                was actually achieved under the Act of 1832, Hatta maintained
## that ‘even if, for argument’s sake, the workers had secured
                “universal suffrage”, it was still bound to have been a failure’
137 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                as far as they were concerned.[199] Hatta believed that
## disillusionment with electoral politics had led to workers
## stressing the need for ‘economic action’ alone and that
                syndicalism was a manifestation of this enduring trend within
                the labour movement. Yet Hatta pointed out that the historical
## record also showed that the workers ‘cannot win by economic
                action alone’.[200] In that sense, syndicalism too derived from
## an additional legacy of failure that was embedded in the
                history of the labour movement: ‘syndicalism is a movement
## which belongs to the second variety of failed labour
                movements’.[201]
                Since the pure anarchists did not regard anarchism as confined
                to the terrain of the labour movement, the distinct historical
## origins of anarchism and syndicalism constituted one reason
                for sharply differentiating between them. However, in Hatta’s
## eyes, a further, and more important, reason for contrasting
                anarchism and syndicalism lay in the ideology which the latter
                employed. As Hatta put it:

## syndicalism is not a theory or an ideology, but is merely a
## tendency within the labour movement. Nevertheless, to the
## extent that the labour movement is a movement of human
                self-awakening, it certainly cannot be devoid of ideas. In other
                words, syndicalism’s weak point and bankruptcy lie in the fact
                that, while it does not possess a systematic set of ideas, it
                cannot entirely dispense with ideas either. To put it another
                way, since syndicalism is not itself a specific ideology, it
                underpins itself with some other ideology. And in answer to the
                question what is it that ideologically underpins syndicalism, I
## can only conclude that it is a combination of Marxism and

138 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                anarchism. In other words, syndicalism can be said to be, in
                this sense, a hybrid creature.[202]
                Specifically, Hatta maintained that syndicalism borrowed from
                Marxism the theory of the class struggle and the ambition to
## take over the capitalist means of production (including the
                division of labour, which Hatta saw as inseparable from largescale industry) in order to construct a society centred on the
## producers. To these elements, which Hatta insisted were
                derived from Marxism, syndicalism added ‘the anarchist theory
                of creative violence by a minority’.[203] As was mentioned in
                Chapter 4, Hatta’s contention was that what made syndicalism
## inherently unstable was precisely the fact that it drew its
## ideology eclectically from what he regarded as two opposing
## philosophical systems—Marxism and anarchism. Hatta did not
                deny that there were able and enthusiastic activists within the
## ranks of the anarchist syndicalists, but he argued that,
                irrespective of the quality of its militants, syndicalism would
## always tend to degenerate into reformism because of its
                unstable theoretical base.[204]
                With the benefit of hindsight, one could well argue that Hatta
                was wrong to attribute to Marx the ambition to take over intact
                capitalism’s division of labour. Marx’s early philosophical texts
## provide ample evidence that his vision of communism was
## informed by the determination to transcend the division of
                labour.[205] However, such texts were not available to Hatta,
                who habitually looked at Marxism through the distorting prism
                of what he took to be its realised form in Russia. In any case,
                what concerns us at this point is not the inadequacy, in this
                regard, of Hatta’s understanding of Marxism, but his critique of
139 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                syndicalism’s incorporation of the capitalist division of labour
                into its union-based organisation and strategy. Here Hatta was
## on much firmer ground. Anarchist syndicalists believed that
## the strength of the working class derived from the crucial
                position it occupied within the capitalist production process.
                When capitalism developed large-scale industries, it also gave
                rise to sizeable bodies of workers whose cohesion, solidarity,
                and organisation were functions of the system of factory-based
## production. Hence, anarchist syndicalists saw the workers’
## unions as organic outgrowths of capitalist industrial
                organisation itself. Yet, since the unions were seen not only as
## the means of revolutionary struggle but also as the
## administrative structure of the coming society, what was
## implied was a considerable degree of structural continuity
## between industrial capitalism and the society which was
## expected to replace it. Hatta did not doubt the well-meant
## intentions of anarchist syndicalists to democratise the new
                society, eliminate state power and abolish class divisions, but
## he nevertheless predicted that their efforts would be
                undermined by the structures that were unavoidably built into
## large-scale industry and the procedures it was bound to
                practise, irrespective of its ideological trimmings. For Hatta, the
                most important of these inevitable characteristics of large-
## scale industry was the division of labour.

## The Division of Labor

                In his writings, Hatta analysed the division of labour inherent
## within large-scale industry and identified the principal
## consequences which flowed from it. First, he argued that,

140 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## where the division of labour exists, labour becomes
## mechanised and, as a result, degenerates into mechanical
## activity. The producer becomes a cog in an inflexible
                production process which dehumanises work, stifles creativity
                and devalues labour to the point where it is no more than ‘an
                assistant of the machine’.[206] Economists often claim that it
                is the division of labour which socialises production. In the era
## of industrial production, no individual can claim to have
## produced independently any item of social wealth, since all
                products are the result of multiform labour which links together
## innumerable, anonymous producers’ in an extended network
                of productive activity. However, Hatta believed that this is a
                superficial way of looking at the effects of the division of
                labour:
                The division of labour is mechanised, but in the true sense of
                the word is not socialised. Nay, rather it is the division of labour
                that destroys genuine social solidarity.[207]
                This leads us to what Hatta regarded as a second consequence
                of the division of labour, namely that those involved in one
                branch of production generally have ‘neither responsibility for,
                understanding of, nor interest in’ other branches of production.
                [208] This is clearly so in the case of capitalism, since
## enterprises occupying different niches in the production
                process are indifferent to each other’s well-being and relate to
## one another solely via antagonistic, buying and selling
                relations, with each unit of capital pursuing its own narrow goal
                of attempting to maximise profit. Yet, even if the capitalists
                were expropriated so that all industries came to be controlled
                by those who worked in them, there would still be a situation
141 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                where, for example, the coal mines would be in the hands of a
## body of men who saw themselves as miners and looked out on
                the rest of society from the confines of their industry. No other
## section of society could fully appreciate the problems and
                hardship involved in the extraction of coal, nor the satisfaction
## derived from using the particular skills of the miner to
                accomplish safely potentially hazardous operations. One could
## no more envisage those who were not miners being fully
                conversant with the ins and outs of coal production, or with the
## ethos of the mining communities, than one could reasonably
                expect miners to appreciate entirely the joys and frustrations
                of growing crops or the seasonal rhythm of agricultural work.
## Even if syndicalism successfully lopped off the head of
## capitalism by eliminating the capitalist class, the body of
## society would still be riddled with the tensions and
## misunderstandings which arise when people are tied into

                industries and sectional interests. In Hatta’s estimation, this
## would be no less the case for syndicalism than it is for
## capitalism.

## According to Hatta, the third principal consequence of the
                division of labour is that ‘a superior coordinating machinery’
## becomes necessary in order to coordinate the various
                branches of production.[209] In capitalism it is the market
                which fulfils this role, but since syndicalism’s declared intention

                was to transcend the capitalist market, it would have to find
## some other means to achieve this goal. The means which
                anarchist syndicalists have generally favoured is a network of
## delegate conferences, where the mandated delegates of one
                industry would negotiate agreements with the representatives
## of related industries so as to ensure the smooth flow of
## materials into, and products out of, the factories. Hatta
## maintained that one thing which such arrangements
## overlooked was the unequal standing of different industries
                within the production process. Hatta’s point was that, where
                the division of labour existed, it was a reasonable expectation
                that industries supplying vital goods and services would have
## leverage over others engaged in less crucial lines of
                production. His suspicion was that, faced with a hierarchy of
                industries arising from their different degrees of importance in
                the production process, ideological commitment to the goal of
                a classless society would prove to be an inadequate safeguard:
                In a society which is based on the division of labour, those
## engaged in vital production (since it forms the basis of
## production) would have more power over the machinery of
                coordination than those engaged in other lines of production.
## There would therefore be a real danger of the appearance of
                classes.[210]

## Hatta described syndicalism’s ‘superior coordinating
                machinery’ as ‘in other words, a supreme economic council or,
                in other words, a government’.[211] Why was he so convinced
                that, for all their ideological hostility to state power, the
                anarchist syndicalists’ strategy of social transformation would
                degenerate into the familiar social division between rulers and

## ruled? In a situation where those engaged in one branch of
                production have ‘neither responsibility for, understanding of,
## nor interest in’ other branches of production, effective
## coordination would depend on the emergence of a stratum
                which could rise above sectional interests and take an overall
                view of the production process. Even the emergence of such a
                stratum would not be straightforward, since people engaged in
                different branches of production would compete to elect their
                representatives to the ‘superior coordinating machinery’ and
## those elected would strive to look after their industrial
                constituencies, but to the extent that this stratum did appear,
                it was likely to become a specialist agency composed of people
## who did not themselves engage in production. Not only would
                the need for administrative expertise set up pressures leading
## the members of the ‘superior coordinating machinery’ to
                detach themselves from production, but in order to administer
## effectively they would need to be able to enforce their
                decisions. To put it bluntly, the resulting ‘supreme economic
## council’ would need to be equipped with centralised power
                simply in order to fulfil its role efficiently.[212] Yet all
## experience shows that, once a stratum furnished with such
                power emerges within society, it tends to use its authority to
                benefit itself by exploiting others. Hence, ‘one cannot separate
                the division of labour from rule and exploitation,’ argued Hatta.
                [213]
                In Hatta’s opinion, a further reason why the division of labour in
                its syndicalist form would inevitably lead to power relations and
## the emergence of government was that most anarchist
## syndicalists accepted the need for exchange between

                economic units and for calculation in labour time. Hatta traced
## back to Pierre Joseph Proudhon (1809–65) the readiness of
## many anarchist syndicalists to resort to such economic
## measures, since Proudhon was not only the first to declare
                himself an anarchist but was also an advocate of an economic
                system based on precisely these elements:
                Even Proudhon, since he was an adherent of the labour theory
                of value, took labour exchanges to be the organs of distribution
                in the new society. Yet, by setting up labour exchanges, one is
                forced to adopt quantitative labour as the standard of value.
                But, as Kropotkin affirmed, this immediately gives rise to a
## wages system which takes as its principle recompense
                according to labour time.[214]
                Why did Hatta regard exchange and calculation in labour time
                not as neutral techniques for facilitating economic affairs, but
## as measures which were pregnant with dire consequences for
## the new society? The reason was that he grasped the
## antagonism inherent in exchange relations, where each party
                involved tries to get the best deal for itself, giving rise to the
                need for an arbiter who is sufficiently detached to ensure that
                equity is achieved and yet who is equipped with the necessary
                power to enforce the rules of the game. In capitalism it is the
                state which fulfils these roles and syndicalism was held to be
## no different, in that it too would create an environment in
## which these same functions would need to be undertaken by
## an equivalent body, no matter what it was called. A similar
## parallel was drawn between capitalist money and syndicalist
                labour vouchers. Since both were to function as the symbols of
                value in their respective systems, calculation could only be
145 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                reliably conducted in either of them if their production and
                circulation were controlled and monitored and policed by some
## supervisory body. Once again, it was only the state, in one
                guise or another, that could adequately carry out these tasks
## and hence guarantee sound currency, either in the form of
## conventional money or a substitute such as labour vouchers.
                Hatta summarised this area of his thought as follows:

## Where the division of labour occurs, exchange takes place.
## Where exchange takes place, a medium of exchange—in other
## words, money (or labour vouchers)—comes into existence.
## And money stands in need of a basis of centralised power
                (government). The development of money naturally leads to
                the development of government.[215]

## Hatta regularly described anarchist communism as a society
## which would take consumption as its basis. What he meant by
                this was that, since the people in their communes would be in
                control of the means of production, they would be in a position
                first to decide what level of consumption they wished to enjoy
## and subsequently to organise production in whatever manner
## was most congenial for meeting their requirements. This
## formed a complete contrast to capitalism, which he
                characterised as a society that took production as its basis.
                This feature of capitalism again derived from the division of
                labour, which led competing enterprises to battle against one
                another for economic survival by producing more cheaply than
                their rivals. If anarchist communism and capitalism were polar
## opposites in this regard, where did syndicalism stand in
                relation to the crucial question of the primacy of consumption
## or production? Hatta’s answer was that, by accepting the

146 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                division of labour, syndicalism located itself on essentially the
## same terrain as capitalism and, for that matter, bolshevism
                too:
                syndicalism will take over, just as it is, the capitalist mode of
## production and perpetuate the system of big factories, the
                division of labour system and the economic organisation which
## takes production as its basis. As far as these points are
## concerned, it will not be the slightest bit different from
                communism [sic].[216]

## In other words, syndicalism planned to inherit capitalist
## industries which had habitually given priority to economic
## growth. While the desire for expansion ultimately proceeded
                from the capitalist’s thirst for profit, the assumption that there
## was a link between increased growth and economic progress
                tended to rub off onto the workforce too. To the extent that
                workers in capitalist industries believed that ‘the union makes
## us strong’, there would be an expectation that economic
                activity on a wider scale would lead to a bigger workforce and
## hence to a still stronger union. Furthermore, even if the
## capitalist entrepreneur were eliminated and syndicalism
                realised, the producers organised in a syndicalist union would
                still have an interest in expanding the scale of their enterprise’s
## operations and in capturing the economic high ground. This
                would be so because the weight of their voice in the decision-
## making councils of syndicalist society, would depend on the
                scale of their operations and the importance of their products
## for society as a whole.

                It is worth noting that Hatta extended his criticisms of union-
## based syndicalism to the alternative revolutionary strategy

                which sought to use soviets (workers’ councils) as the means
                to overthrow the existing order and establish a new society in
## its place. Advocates of this strategy have often pointed to
                various advantages which soviets have over syndicalist-style
                unions, such as the fact that the former were seen as emerging
                spontaneously in the heat of revolution whereas the latter were
## intended to be built up incrementally in advance of the
## revolution, making them susceptible to bureaucratisation in
                the process. Yet, whatever the claimed advantages of soviets
                over unions, for Hatta they were still fatally flawed by being
## rooted in the capitalist workplaces and therefore embodying
                the division of labour:

## The soviets are a machinery of administration which arises
                from the fact that the working class, as the producers, control
                society. Those who seek to establish soviets insist that it is the
## system of production based on the division of labour which
## becomes the basis of society and also think that during the
## transitional period [the need for which Hatta rejected—see
## Chapter 6] it should be the working class that necessarily
                controls society.[217]

## Here we can see that not only were soviets rejected because
                they would consolidate rather than transcend the division of
## labour, but also because they represented class power. We
                shall analyse the distinction which the pure anarchists made
                between class struggle and revolution in the next section, so
                here it is sufficient to make the point that, given their root and
                branch criticism of soviets, Hatta and his comrades were not
## impressed by those who sought to distinguish between
## genuine soviets and their bolshevik-dominated namesakes in

148 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## Russia. Hatta maintained that, irrespective of whether they
                were manipulated by party bosses or were the freely organised
## expression of workers’ interests, soviets were not the way
                forward to human liberation.[218] This was why he criticised
                those anarchists in the Russian Revolution who had advocated
                ‘free soviets’ as an alternative to the ‘party soviets’ under
                bolshevik control:

## What deluded the Russian anarchists at the time of the
                revolution was this word soviet. Those like Berkman, using the
                expression ‘free soviet’, even tried to introduce the soviet
                principle (sobietoshugi) into anarchism.[219]

## To those who objected that even Kropotkin had evaluated the
                soviets highly, Hatta retorted (not altogether convincingly)
                that, just because Kropotkin happened to have said one or two
## positive things about the soviets, this did not make him a
                sovietist.[220] Hatta believed that in Russia it was the
## anarchist syndicalists who had been the most enthusiastic
                campaigners for ‘free soviets’, because they had realised that
## the soviet form of organisation was just as serviceable for
## syndicalist purposes as unions. This was why he referred
## approvingly on more than one occasion to the conference of
## the Nahat Confederation of anarchist communists, which had
## been held in Kharkov in 1920 and where the anarchist
                syndicalists had been roundly denounced.[221]

## The Class Struggle

## Although Hatta made a major contribution to pure anarchist
## theorising on the class struggle, it was Iwasa Sakutarō who

## most pithily captured the pure anarchists’ distrust of the
## conventional labour movement with his ‘mountain bandit’
## theory. In an essay on ‘The Labour Movement and the Mass
                Workers’ Movement’, Iwasa wrote:

## I divide the workers’ movement into two. One of these is a
                movement that arises from the majority of the workers in the
## farming villages and the towns. It is a movement which
## demands a fundamental change of social organisation,
## immediately and decisively, due to the economic
                circumstances of those who comprise it. In other words, it is a
## revolutionary movement. The other is the so-called labour
## movement, the members of which form labour unions from the
## standpoint of the particular position they occupy under the
                modern capitalist system. They compromise with the capitalist
                class and cooperate with it so as to shorten the hours of labour,
                raise wages and improve their conditions. They seek to raise
                their own standard of living and achieve prosperity. It is a
## movement of a minority working class found mainly in the
                towns—a movement of the so-called new working class.[222]
                Iwasa criticised the latter on the grounds that ‘they turn their
## back on the movement of the general mass of workers, those
## who cannot achieve liberation without a fundamental
                transformation of the modern capitalist system’.[223] It was
                true that this aristocracy of labour organised themselves so as
                to improve their position within capitalism, yet ‘their so-called
                class struggle is not a rebellion against capitalism but has
                become an approval of capitalism, an assenting to capitalism,
## and amounts to appealing and imploring to the capitalists’.
                [224]

## The nub of Iwasa’s criticism of the conventional labour
                movement was that it had allowed itself to be incorporated into
                existing society in such a way that its members were just as
                imbued with capitalist values as were the capitalists. It was to
                illustrate the relationship between the capitalist class and the
## conventional labour movement that Iwasa used the analogy of
## a gang of mountain bandits. Within such a gang, there may
                well be tension between the leader and his henchmen, with the
## latter harbouring an ambition to step into the shoes of the
## former. But, however fiercely the battle between leader and
## henchmen might be joined, no-one expects a gang of
                mountain bandits to be socially transformed by the outcome of
                such a struggle. A gang of bandits remains a gang of bandits,
## no matter who their leader is. Likewise, capitalism would
## remain capitalism, no matter whether it was led by the
                established capitalists or by a new leadership drawn from the
## labour movement and seeking support by the use of
                expressions such as ‘the dictatorship of the proletariat’:

## It may be going a bit too far, but their relationship even
## resembles the boss-henchmen relationship between mountain
                bandits holed up in their mountain den. The henchmen, having
                formed a union, could launch the class war against their boss
                and thus raise their own position and improve their livelihood.
                Not only that; going further, they could even overthrow their
                boss and replace him. Yet it would still remain the case that
## they were mountain bandits, just as they were before.

## Hence their movement—that is, the class struggle—does not
                fundamentally break with the plunder and exploitation of the
                capitalist system. It is essentially a conservative, reformist
151 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## movement which is in harmony with capitalism, compromises
                with it, or even inherits its pillage and exploitation. It is not a
## movement by means of which the liberation of the whole of
                society can be achieved.[225]
                Iwasa depicted class struggle, even in its most radical form, as
## the process whereby one class replaced another as the
## dominant group in society. However far-reaching the changes
                which this transfer of power might bring about, it did not signify
## the end of social domination or class rule. He specifically
                rejected Karl Marx’s and Friedrich Engels’ (1820–95) contention
                in The Communist Manifesto that ‘the history of all hitherto
                existing society is the history of class struggles’.[226] Clearly,
                the class struggle is part of social experience, retorted Iwasa,
## but it is far from being the sole theme which runs through
                human history.[227] There is also a striving for revolution
## which, Iwasa believed, transcended the class struggle and
## whose modern expression he saw as anarchist communism.
## Such a revolutionary movement ‘aims to destroy utterly the
                destructive system of capitalist exploitation (in other words,
                the state system) and to give free rein to the essentially social
                nature of human beings’.[228] It is not simply hardship and
                misery which bring about social revolution, nor will it be ‘an
                inevitable achievement of the working class as the so-called
                scientific socialists argue’.[229] Rather, social revolution would
                occur when sufficient people were inspired by the vision of a
## new society. In a phrase which harked back to the Meiji
                Restoration of 1868, and beyond that to the Confucian classics,
## Iwasa described those who would provide the spark to kindle
                this vision as ‘many anonymous activists and people of virtue
152 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                and righteousness’ (ikuta mumei no shishi jin jin gishi). ‘Due to
                their activity and their effort, the notion of a just future is
                clearly implanted in the heads of the people and, in this way,
                for the first time, the people are awakened.’[230]
                Hatta shared this pure anarchist critique of the class struggle,
                but he sought to provide it with a more rigorous theoretical
## expression than Iwasa achieved in his writings. From a
## sociological standpoint, Hatta pointed to the difficulty of
                arranging people into water-tight classes, particularly within a
                society such as Japan. He rightly emphasised the artificiality of
                attempts to force interwar Japan into the mould of a schematic
## class structure which assigned everybody to either the
                capitalist class or the proletarian class by reference to their
## relationship to the means of production. Throughout the
                1920s, for example, roughly half the workforce was engaged in
                agriculture or forestry, compared to less than one-fifth who
                were employed in manufacturing.[231] Of the more than 14
                millions who worked on the land, only a few hundred thousand
                (400,000 in 1920 and their number declined thereafter) were
                agricultural labourers and thus proletarians.[232] The vast
## majority worked the land in family units (men, women and
## even children engaging in production) and most families
                rented part or all of their land from landlords to whom they paid
                rent in kind. Two out of every three farms were less than 2.5
                acres (1 hectare) in size.[233] With entire families trying to eke
                out a living on such tiny smallholdings (and at the same time
## surrendering to the landlord half of the crop produced on
## whatever percentage of their land was rented) the poverty

                Hatta’s point was that there was no direct connection between
                poverty and proletarianisation. Nor was there any perceptible
## trend towards the tenant farmers becoming wage labourers,
## since the form of exploitation to which they were subjected
## was stable and served the purposes of their often absentee
                landlords.[234]
                Hatta had two principal objections to the way in which most of
## the self-proclaimed Marxists in Japan conceived of the
                supposedly revolutionary class as a narrow stratum of factory
## workers. First, as shown above, he argued that there was no
## evidence that as capitalism developed in Japan society was
## being reduced to a simple, bipolar structure of two rival
                classes. Besides the tenant farmers, there were other sizeable
                strata, such as small traders and petty officials, who were poor
                and oppressed but who did not fit into the revolutionary class if
                it was conceived narrowly as consisting only of factory workers.
## Hatta asserted that it was quite wrong to overlook the
                revolutionary potential of these other strata. In fact, one should
                recognise that often the people in these strata ‘long for and
## also struggle for social change more than the working class
                does’.[235] Second, Hatta pointed to the course of revolution
## in the world. From the vantage point provided by the late
## 1920s and early 1930s, the most fertile regions for the
## outbreak of revolution seemed to be those countries where
## capitalism was not so highly developed and where the class
                struggle had not been focused to the point where it pitted two
## all-encompassing classes against one another. Far from the
                developed capitalist countries being ripest for revolution, one
## found that the living conditions of workers were improving

                there and that they were not the ones to manifest any spark of
## rebellion. Workers in the advanced countries seemed to be
## largely preoccupied with maintaining and improving their
                conditions within capitalism, so that in such circumstances it
                was often left to the intellectuals to assume the role of rebels.
                [236]
                Given the failure of the available methods of class analysis to
## capture the subtleties of Japan’s social structure, Hatta
## developed the notion of the ‘propertyless masses’ (musan
                taishū) as an alternative to the concept of the proletariat. The
## ‘propertyless masses’ was a wide-ranging term which
                encompassed the tenant farmers, small traders, petty officials,
## artisans and even wage labourers when they were prepared to
## forsake their preoccupation with narrowly defending the
## advantages that accompanied their urban lifestyle and were
                ready to throw in their lot with other oppressed strata. Since
                the various constituent elements of the ‘propertyless masses’
                stood in different relations to the means of production, they did
                not collectively constitute a class and therefore class struggle
## was not an appropriate mode of action for them. What could
                potentially unite the ‘propertyless masses’ was not a shared
## objective position within society relative to the means of
## production, but a common, subjective realisation that
                capitalism oppressed them and that their liberation depended
                on its revolutionary overthrow. Thus, just as Hatta developed
                the notion of the ‘propertyless masses’ as a challenge to the
## rival concept of the ‘proletariat’, so he put forward
## ‘revolutionary action’ as an alternative strategy to ‘class
                struggle’.[237] By drawing a sharp contrast between class
155 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                struggle and revolution, Hatta found another opportunity for
                attacking syndicalism:

## Syndicalism says that it will bring about the revolution by
                means of the class struggle, but that is a major mistake. The
## class struggle and the revolution are two opposing
                movements; one does not give birth to the other.[238]
                What did Hatta understand by ‘revolution’ and what contrasts
                did he make between it and the ‘class struggle’? In the first
                place, Hatta understood revolution to entail a rejection of class
## divisions. By way of contrast, he believed that, by basing
                themselves on a struggle to further sectional interests, those
## who advocated class struggle were perpetuating social
                divisions. Second, Hatta saw class struggle as a kind of trench
## warfare. Classes experience continual advances and retreats
## and, as a result, start to observe in the conduct of their
## struggles what Hatta termed ‘a general law of competitive
                power’.[239] The endless repetition of class struggle leads to it
                being conducted according to mutually observed rules so that
                it settles down into a self-perpetuating routine. For Hatta,
                revolution was entirely different to this. It was a once and for
## all, life-and-death explosion which was not governed by any
## laws and could not be channelled into routine. Although
## revolution could be prepared for, in the sense of the
                revolutionary forces building up their strength prior to its
                occurrence, its outbreak could not be predicted nor its course
## tailored to order.

                Hatta argued that a third characteristic of the class struggle
## was that, even as classes pitted themselves against each
                other, there was a tendency for them to develop similar tactics.
156 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## In this sense, class war was much like any other form of
## warfare. In military confrontations, if one side acquires a
                particular weapon, the other side must do the same if it is to
## defend itself effectively. Hatta maintained that the class
                struggle was no exception to this general rule. If (as inevitably
                they will) the capitalists resort to political measures, the
                proletariat has to involve itself in politics too. Similarly, if (as
                inevitably they will) the capitalists wield state power, the
                proletariat will be tempted to strive for a supposed workers’
## and peasants’ state. Once again, Hatta saw revolution as
                offering an entirely different approach to that represented by
                the class struggle. If class struggle was characterised by the
                fact that both sides did battle on the same terrain by using
## analogous tactics, revolution broke with all accepted
                procedures and therefore was likely to disorient the capitalists
## and disarm them in the process. What Hatta was suggesting
                here was that, in the case of the class struggle, the capitalists
## can employ carefully prepared, defensive measures because
## the rules of the game are well known and the struggle
                proceeds via set-piece confrontations. On the other hand, since
                there are no rules to regulate an explosion of revolutionary
                violence, the capitalists will find their well-rehearsed tactics
## inadequate for containing a situation which takes them by
                surprise.[240]
                The final distinction which Hatta made between class struggle
## and revolution lay in their very different outcomes. Hatta
                argued that even if the class struggle were fought successfully
                to the point of ‘final victory’ for the oppressed class, the
                outcome ‘will be nothing more than a reversal of positions’.
157 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                [241] He predicted that. even if the former oppressors were
                subjugated, a new ruling class would emerge from the formerly
## oppressed and ironically the class struggle would persist.
                Conversely, ‘final victory’ in revolutionary terms would entail
                ‘the destruction of the opposing camp’ and of class society in
                any shape or form.[242]
                It should be clear from what has been said that Hatta and the
                other pure anarchists did not deny that class struggle existed.
                On the contrary, they recognised that it was inevitable that
                workers would engage in the class struggle in order to defend
                themselves for as long as capitalism lasted. This was so since
                wage earners are in exactly the same position as anyone else
                within capitalism: ‘in order to live, workers must undertake
                commercial transactions, in other words buying and selling ...
                they sell their labour and buy the means of life’.[243]
                Consequently, since individual workers are in this position, it is
                only to be expected that they will band together in order to get
                a better price for their labour power. What the pure anarchists
                insisted, however, was that a struggle between classes could
                not be transformed into a struggle to abolish classes. For the
                pure anarchists, these struggles were qualitatively different
                and were pitched at different levels. Hence Hatta spoke for all
                pure anarchists when he asserted:
                If ... we understand that the proletariat (musan kaikyū) and the
                propertyless masses (musan taishū) are different things, and
                that the class struggle and the revolution are different things,
                then we are forced to say that it is a major mistake to declare,
                as the syndicalists do, that the revolution will be brought about
                by the class struggle. Even if a change in society came about

## by means of the class struggle, it would not mean that a
                genuine revolution had occurred.[244]

## Physiocracy (Jūnōshugi)

## Physiocracy was a powerful ideology in interwar Japan. With
## half the workforce engaged in agriculture, and millions of
## peasants and tenant farmers living lives of hardship and
                insecurity, it was little wonder that urban capitalism was widely
                regarded as a parasitic leech on the otherwise healthy body of
## the countryside. Jūnōshugi (physiocracy) and its related
                ideology of nōhonshugi (literally ‘agriculture-as-the-root-ism’)
## were even utilised by the militarists as a means of winning
## support from the peasants and tenant farmers for the army’s
## political ambitions. Hence, when Hatta took up the cudgels
## against physiocracy, he was not engaging in a debate over
                abstract, philosophical principles but was addressing issues
## that were of burning importance to millions of hard-pressed
## peasants and tenant farmers.

                Just as Hatta rejected demands by anarchist syndicalists for
## anarchism to base itself on the struggle between the
## bourgeoisie and the proletariat, so he was equally scathing
## about suggestions that anarchism should develop a strategy
                based on alternative methods of dividing society into classes.
                He was sarcastic about the efforts of those associated with the
## journal Fujin Sensen (Women’s Battlefront) to present the
## relationship between men and women as the principal
## antagonism within society and he expended much energy on
## opposing those who sought to orient anarchism towards a
                struggle which would pit the agricultural villages against the
159 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                cities.[245] In articles with titles such as ‘Against Physiocracy’,
                Hatta criticised anarchists of this latter persuasion not because
                of their hostility towards the cities, nor even because they look
                the view that ‘the workers too exploit the farmers’, but rather
                because of their physiocratic ambition to favour agricultural
## interests at the expense of the urban population. He
                maintained that, even if it were true that all city dwellers
                (including the urban workers) currently benefited from the
                exploitation of the agricultural population, the solution did not
                lie in inverting this relationship and reversing the flow of wealth
                so that it was henceforth transferred from the cities into the
                villages. As Hatta put it:
                The city exploits the farming village. That’s a fact. However,
                the cause lies in the division of labour, in the fact that, due to
                the total system of the division of labour, industries exploit one
                another. One side of the matter is that the city exploits the
                farming village, but this must not cause us to overlook the fact
                that the cities exploit one another. To abolish exploitation, and
                particularly the city’s exploitation of the farming village,
## cannot be achieved by prosecuting a class struggle whereby
                the city and the village are set against one another. It cannot
                be achieved without abolishing the division of labour system
                (in other words, the capitalist system) which sets the city and
                the village against one another.[246]

## The alternative strategy which Hatta and his comrades put
## forward was not to subjugate the cities or to declare the
                villages independent of the urban centres, as the physiocrats
                intended to do. Instead, the pure anarchists sought to bring
## about a revolution which would be jointly executed by the

## farmers in the villages and the wage-earning workers in the
                clues. The aim of such a revolution would be to dissolve the
## cities and convert the villages into the communes which the
## pure anarchists anticipated would form the constituent
## elements of an anarchist communist society. However, to win
## the peasants and tenant farmers over to this strategy of
## cooperating with the urban workers, it was necessary to
                convince them that they were not, as the physiocrats asserted,
                the sole objects of exploitation. To this end, Hatta devoted
                much effort towards examining the nature of exploitation and
                identifying the roots of the antagonism which existed between
                the cities and the villages. Hatta did not deny that the capitalist
                stood at the apex of the system of exploitation that constituted
                capitalism, nor that the tenant farmer was at the base of the
## same system. Even though, in Hatta’s estimation, the
                capitalists were not the sole exploiters, he readily conceded
## that they were the social group engaged in the most
                systematic appropriation of the wealth created by others.[247]
## Conversely, Hatta considered that the tenant farmers were
                doubly exploited, first by the landlords, due to the exorbitant
## rents they were forced to pay in kind, and secondly by the
                cities. Hatta conceived of the latter form of exploitation as a
                case of unequal exchange. In his view, the tenant farmers were
## forced through poverty and ignorance to sell their produce
                cheaply as raw materials or food to the cities. When these raw
## materials came back to the villages as manufactured
## commodities, the same factors of poverty and ignorance
## enabled the urban entrepreneurs to sell them expensively.
                [248]
161 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Hatta was well aware that urban wage earners are exploited by
                their capitalist employers. Nevertheless, he was still of the
## opinion that the workers in the cities benefited from the
## exploitation of the countryside. He maintained that if, for
                example, urban workers organised themselves skilfully so as to
                raise wage levels and/or shorten working hours, the capitalists
                could recoup their losses by increasing the prices of the goods
                they sold to the villages. Hence, it seemed to him that, even
## when the class struggle was prosecuted successfully by
                workers in the cities, the result was simply a shift in the burden
## of exploitation from the wage earners to the peasants and
                tenant farmers.[249] Arguments along these lines were part of
                Hatta’s case against the so-called ‘proletarian parties’, such as
## the Nōmin Rōdōtō (Farmer-Labour Party) and the Rōdō
## Nōmintō (Labour-Farmer Party). He argued that such parties
## habitually called for a united front of workers and farmers
                despite the fact that, within the parameters of capitalism, there
                was a conflict between their class interests.[250]
                It might be objected that Hatta’s account of the mechanics of
## exploitation displayed a certain degree of economic or
                sociological naivety. After all, if capitalists could automatically
                transfer to the agricultural population the losses incurred by
## conceding wage rises, why should they bother to resist
## workers’ demands as strenuously as they evidently did?
                Setting such objections aside, however, Hatta’s account of the
                various exploitative relationships outlined so far could be taken
                as lending weight to, rather than countering, the physiocrats’
## contention that city folk prospered at the expense of the
                villagers. Yet where Hatta parted company with the physiocrats
162 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                was in his claim that ‘in today’s society, everybody exploits
## everybody else and robs each other. Everybody engages in a
                struggle for existence with everybody else.’[251] Actually or
                potentially, even the poorest peasants or tenant farmers were
                exploiters, insisted Hatta, and this was why exploitation could
## not be eradicated from society by taking their side against
## those who exploited them.

                By giving a further twist to the notion of unequal exchange,
## Hatta suggested that peasants and tenant farmers exploit
## when, for example, they exchange rice for fish, or exchange
## their produce for manufactured articles which contain a
                fraction of the labour expended in coal mines. Even if formally
                an exchange of equal quantities of labour time were involved in
## such commercial transactions, there would be no economic
                compensation to the coal miners or fishermen for the dangers
## which their occupations involved. Compared to farming, both
## coal mining and sea fishing are hazardous operations, which
                for Hatta signified that peasants and tenant farmers benefited
## from an exploitative relationship when they consumed the
                products of these industries.[252] He argued that physiocracy,
                with its holier than thou attitude towards the city dwellers,
                failed to recognise that exploitation was a universal condition
## within capitalism. Thus the physiocrats were wrong to blame
                the plight of the villages on the cities when the inhabitants of
                both had a common enemy in the shape of capitalism.[253]
## For Hatta, the crucial difference between anarchism and
                physiocracy was that ‘anarchism is opposed to the antagonism
                between city and village (physiocracy is opposed only to the
                city)’.[254]

## Although the physiocrats were opposed to inequality between
                the cities and the villages, they were far from being against
## hierarchy in principle and tended to eulogise patterns of
## authority in the countryside, including the supposedly
                paternalistic relationship between landlords and tenants. Hatta
                and the other pure anarchists interpreted life in the agricultural
                villages quite differently from the physiocrats in this regard. For
                the pure anarchists, one reason why the rural villages were so
                important was that they were seen as repositories of healthy
## ‘natural anarchism’ even in a society which was becoming
## more and more diseased, due to the spread of pathological
## capitalism. As the pure anarchists saw it, agricultural
## production was so dependent on cooperation by the farming
## community that even capitalism could not smother this
                inherent feature of village life. In one of his Lectures on Social
                Problems in the Farming Villages, Hatta wrote:
                In the present era of capitalism, selfish egoism has penetrated
                even into the villages, but all the same the farming village
## cannot exist unless, as a village, it practises cooperative
## irrigation and cooperative endeavour. When the farmers
## organise a village by means of cooperative and communal
## endeavour, they possess a power which does not depend on
                the law or on orders, but which is the power of human beings
                to organise a natural society and to strive for a cooperative
## existence and common prosperity—a natural power which
## human beings have been endowed with from ancient times.
                [255]
                In passages such as this, Hatta tried to persuade the peasants
                and tenant farmers to see their villages in a different light from
164 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## that shed by physiocracy. Poor and exploited though the
                villages might be, and though they might fall far short of the
## communes of the society to come, they possessed, in the
## shape of communal solidarity, one of the indispensable
## cornerstones on which anarchist communism would be built.

## A second reason why Hatta attributed such importance to the
                rural villages was the sheer size of the agricultural population:

## The farmers account for a majority of the population and
                occupy a vast area of land. If this great mass does not awaken
## and does not move, the reform of society cannot possibly be
## achieved. For example, whatever the scale of the movement
## which the urban workers organise, as long as the farming
                masses do not move, it will fizzle out. Even if we supposed that
## it succeeded, it could only take the form of centralised
## authority and not of an organisation based on locally
## autonomous libertarian federation. The foundation stones on
                which to build the new society that we long for are none other
                than the awakening of the tenant farmers and the launching of
## their determined movement. Whether our creative movement
                is destroyed or lives depends solely on the awakening of the
                farmers.[256]

## Hatta was angered by the superiority complex displayed by
## some city-based workers towards the peasants and tenant
## farmers, an attitude which he claimed was particularly
                prevalent among the members of the Communist Party.[257]
                He argued that it was a major mistake to imagine that society’s
## problems could be solved by the urban workers taking action
                on their own in the cities. Echoing Kropotkin’s warnings in The
## Conquest of Bread, Hatta asked what would be the outcome of

## an uprising which was confined to the city alone. Dwindling
                food stocks would soon precipitate a crisis and any attempt to
## solve this by adopting authoritarian measures towards the
                countryside would be self-defeating for the project of liberation
                in which the workers were engaged.[258] Hatta insisted that it
                was therefore vital for the urban workers to rid themselves of
                any arrogance or trace of superiority in their dealings with the
## peasants and tenant farmers. Likewise, the peasants and
## tenant farmers should shake off any sense that they were
                inferior to the city dwellers and should instead be aware of
                their heavy responsibility, since the outcome of any revolution
## would hinge on their readiness to cooperate with the urban
## workers. It was this realisation which constituted the most
## important difference between the physiocrats and the pure
                anarchists. While both talked in terms of instituting radical
                change, the former believed that the way to bring this about
                was to accentuate the rural population’s feelings of hostility
                towards those who lived in the cities. By way of contrast, pure
                anarchists like Hatta repeated tirelessly that ‘our movement
                cannot succeed without [the urban workers and the farmers]
                advancing together in a spirit of heartfelt mutual cooperation
                and mutual aid’.[259]

## Science

                In addition to the attacks on various features of existing society
                which we have considered so far, Hatta also launched a frontal
                assault on science. In a series of articles on ‘Natural Science
## and Anarchism’ which appeared in Rōdō Undō (Labour
## Movement) in 1927 he announced his intention ‘to prove that

## natural science is the enemy of the people and to give a
## detailed explanation of the fact that a new system of
                knowledge must be created’.[260] Hatta pointed out that when
## people talked about the ‘wonders of science’, such as the
                radio, or the motor car or the electric tram (all of which were
                still novelties in Japan in the 1920s), they overlooked the fact
                that much of the misery of modern life was equally attributable
## to science. To Hatta’s way of thinking, the regimenting of
                workers in the factories and the phenomenon of people toiling
                endlessly in poverty were just as much the result of science’s
## role in society as were spectacular inventions and handy
                gadgets.[261] He recognised that some would argue that it
                was not science itself which was at fault but the use to which it
                was put by existing society. Hatta was little impressed by such
## arguments, however, since his contention was that science
                and capitalism were inextricably linked together so that there
                was nothing fortuitous about the fact that the former served
## the interests of the latter.

                In order to support this contention, Hatta developed a critique
                of science which was embedded in an historical account of the
                changing forms of human knowledge. Starting with the earliest
## forms, he sought to identify the characteristics which
                knowledge had exhibited among so-called ‘primitive’ peoples.
## He suggested that, within their range of knowledge, it was
## whatever was most important for maintaining life (knowledge
                of crops, knowledge of fire, and so forth) that was most highly
                valued. Indeed, in early societies whatever contributed most to
## communal well-being was usually endowed with a spiritual
## aura. The other vital aspect of supposedly ‘primitive’

167 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                knowledge to which Hatta drew attention was that it was held
## in common by the community as a whole, it was not the
                property of specialists, nor was it used to bolster the power of a
                privileged minority.[262]

## Hatta argued that, although the forms taken by human
## knowledge change as society evolves, the common feature of
                all systems of knowledge found within class societies is that
                care is taken by the ruling class to monopolise vital areas of
## knowledge so that they can be used as instruments of social
                control. The principle of common knowledge is thus lost, as is
## the belief that whatever contributes most to communal wellbeing has the highest spiritual value. It is not necessary to go
                into the details of Hatta’s description of varieties of class
## knowledge, but his general approach can be conveyed by
## citing one of his examples—Europe in the Middle Ages. In
## medieval Europe, he explained, knowledge took the form of
## religious dogma and was employed by the ruling class to
                mystify the people, discourage dissent and justify the elite’s
                power and privileges.[263]
                By extending this line of reasoning, Hatta developed the case
## that science was not knowledge as such but was merely one
                variety of class knowledge. He maintained that it was not an
                historical accident that the rise of science coincided with the
## consolidation and expansion of capitalism. On the contrary,
                being a class society, capitalism needed a form of knowledge
## which was monopolised by specialists (‘scientists’), was
                therefore inaccessible to the mass of the people, and could be
                used as an allegedly neutral and value-free arbiter whenever
                people’s interests were sacrificed in the name of ‘progress’.

## Hatta insisted that there was thus a parallel between
                capitalism and earlier types of class society. In the ancient
                world, rule by the elders went hand in hand with the politics of
                plunder and an ideology rooted in magic. In the Middle Ages,
                the feudal rulers relied on despotic politics and an ideology of
                religious dogma to maintain their grip on power. Hatta’s claim
                was that the modern age was no different, in that a capitalist
                ruling class employed parliamentary politics and the ideology
                of science for similar purposes. In other words, each social
## system has its own style of politics and its own form of
                knowledge which, in each case, is tailored to meet its particular
                needs.[264]

## Hatta did not dispute that in some ways science represented
                an advance over previous forms of knowledge. For example, he
## did not deny that there had been an advance in human
                understanding when it was grasped that the planet turns on its
                axis, rather than the sun rising in the East and setting in the
                West. What he was at pains to point out, however, was that the
## price which had been exacted for this advance in
## understanding was the emergence of ‘the belief in an allpowerful reason’ (risei bannōshugi).[265] Ordinary men and
                women were henceforth perceived as insignificant in the face
## of a natural universe which works according to its own
                inexorable laws: ‘Giant nature becomes an enormous machine
## which operates without concern for human happiness or
## misery and, irrespective of whether they are laughing or
## crying, in the face of this machine of giant nature, human
                beings become creatures devoid of any authority.’[266] For
                Hatta the danger inherent in this attitude was that scientists
169 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## come to erect ‘natural laws’ which, because they are
                considered to be expressions of incontrovertible reason, take
                on the role of sources of authority to which the people have no
                option but to submit. Hatta was suspicious of external authority
                in any shape, no matter whether it took the form of rulers and
                their self-serving laws or science and its ‘natural laws’. His
                contention was that ‘natural laws’ are not natural phenomena
                existing independently of humans. ‘What are natural laws?’, he
                asked, and replied: ‘They are nothing more than things which
## reduce observed reality to an extremely simple form for the
                sake of economic convenience in human thought.’[267] Even
## ‘nature’ is a product of human thought—a concept and an
                abstraction: ‘Both what is called nature and natural laws were
## created by humans for the sake of humans. Humans were not
                created for the sake of nature and natural laws.’[268] Hence,
## part of Hatta’s case against science was that, being the
                products of human minds, so-called ‘natural laws’ are fallible
                and should be treated with scepticism, rather than as forces to
## which people have no option but to conform.

## The conclusion which Hatta draw from his investigation into
                science was that ‘we must build a new social system, create a
                new system of knowledge, and get rid of science’.[269] He
## believed that one of the ways in which science reflects
                capitalism’s priorities is that it operates on the principle of
                universality (fuhensei). Just as the bottom line for capitalism is
                inevitably the mathematical calculation of profit and loss, so
                science too is based on mathematics, in the sense that it relies
## on methods such as quantitative assessment and establishing
                numerically derived norms which are to be enforced with scant
170 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                regard for local conditions and exceptional circumstances. In
## place of science, Hatta looked to the emergence of a new
## system of anarchist communist knowledge which would adopt
## specificity (tokushusei) rather than universality as its
## fundamental principle. For that reason, he thought that the
## geographical rather than the mathematical metaphor came
## closest to capturing the essence of anarchist communist
## knowledge. This was because the form of knowledge which he
                favoured was one which would be, above all, sensitive to local
                circumstances and conditions: ‘Like the people of ancient
## times, we should take as our starting point the knowledge
                which relates to the land on which we live in each district.’[270]
## In anarchist communism as Hatta envisaged it, the people of
## each locality would live a life of self-support and self-
## sufficiency, and they would absorb that knowledge and
                engage in that study which enabled them to satisfy their needs
                with the minimum of labour. Universality was not to be rejected
## out of hand just because it was such a prominent feature of
## science. It could be assimilated into the new system of
## knowledge, but only to the extent that it contributed to
                specificity, locality, practical application and happiness. Hence
                the contrast with the currently prevailing species of knowledge
                was that universality would not be allowed to dictate people’s
                fate blindly, as it was wont to do under the rule of science at
                the service of capitalism.[271]
                In view of Hatta’s hostility to science, it was ironic that in 1928
## he should have translated into Japanese Kropotkin’s Modern
                Science and Anarchism. In his preface to the translation Hatta
                had to admit that Kropotkin’s purpose in writing this booklet
171 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## had been to give anarchism a scientific foundation and he
## conceded that Kropotkin ‘grasped the points of agreement
                between science and anarchism’.[272] Obviously, this
                presented Hatta with a dilemma, since he was as fervent in his
## admiration of Kropotkin as he was in his hostility towards
## science. Hatta attempted to circumvent this difficulty by
## claiming that Kropotkin had used the term ‘science’ in a
                particular way which made it acceptable to anarchists. Thus he
                wrote: ‘I am opposed to Marx’s “science”, but I agree
                unconditionally with Kropotkin’s “science”.’[273] As with his
                comment on Kropotkin and the soviets, such a remark can only
## be explained in terms of Hatta’s loyalty to the principal
## theoretician of anarchist communism blunting his normal
                acerbity. The fact is that Kropotkin’s understanding of science
## seems to have been largely at one with the prevailing
                nineteenth century use of the term. This was revealed in the
## passage in Modern Science and Anarchism where he
## committed anarchism both to the methodology of the natural
## sciences and to an aim which was clearly premised on the
                scientific principle of universality:

## Anarchism is a world-concept based upon a mechanical
## explanation of all phenomena, embracing the whole of nature
                —that is, including in it the life of human societies and their
## economic, political and moral problems. Its method of
                investigation is that of the exact natural sciences, and, if it
                pretends to be scientific, every conclusion it comes to must be
## verified by the method by which every scientific conclusion
                must be verified. Its aim is to construct a synthetic philosophy
## comprehending in one generalization all the phenomena of

172 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                nature—and therefore also the life of societies.[274]

## Hence it was ironic that Hatta should have attributed to
                Kropotkin a distinctive interpretation of science, since this was
## a claim which could have been directed with far greater
                justification at Hatta himself. It was Hatta’s understanding of
                science as the ideology of capitalism which informed all his
## writings on the subject and which induced him to attack
## science with such uninhibited gusto.

## Marxism

                As with syndicalism, Marxism for Hatta was part of the world
                which had to be conquered rather than a conveyor of hope for
## a new world. His writings on Marxism ranged from critical
## examinations of Marx’s theories, such as the materialist
## conception of history, to denunciations of what (as was
                mentioned earlier) he took to be the concrete application of
                those theories in the shape of the regime in Russia and its local
## apologist—the Nihon Kyōsantō (Communist Party of Japan).
## Although Hatta did not distinguish between the Marxism of
                Marx himself and the ‘Marxism’ of his bolshevik epigones, the
                following account will concentrate on the former in the interest
                of clarity. Failure to do so would raise major questions, such as
## the extent to which Marx can be held responsible for the
## actions of later generations who invoked his name. Such
                questions fell outside of Hatta’s fields of interest and therefore
## do not concern us here.

## We have already seen that Hatta wrote extensively on the
## theory of the class struggle, which was one of the main

173 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## weapons in Marx’s theoretical armoury. Yet, although Hatta
## referred to Marx when discussing the problems involved in
                aggregating people into social classes, it was the anarchist
## syndicalists who served as his main example of a movement
## led away from communism by basing its strategy on the class
                struggle.[275] Even so, one should not lose sight of the fact
                that, in directly targeting syndicalism, Hatta was indirectly
                attacking Marx too. This was particularly the case with regard
                to the class struggle since, as we have seen, Hatta held that
                this area of syndicalist theory was largely derived from Marx.
## Hatta did not dispute that syndicalism differed from most
                varieties of self-proclaimed ‘Marxism’ (he cited revisionism and
                bolshevism as examples) due to its declared hostility towards
                political parties and the state.[276] Paradoxically, however,
## this merely confirmed syndicalism as an exceptionally pure
                form of Marxism in Hatta’s eyes. His argument here rested on
                Marx’s distinction between economic infrastructure and social
## superstructure. By rejecting superstructural politics and
                focusing on economic action at the level of the all-important
                infrastructure, anarchist syndicalists revealed their true nature,
                argued Hatta. ‘If this is not Marxism, what is it?’, he asked
                rhetorically.[277] Hence, bearing in mind this identification of
                syndicalism with Marxism, it is fair to say that in all Hatta’s
## writings on the class struggle Marx figured as the ultimate
## target of his criticism.

                Marx was also a proponent of the labour theory of value and we
                have already seen some of Hatta’s objections to this theory (as
                when he criticised Proudhon, for example). In the case of the
## labour theory of value, however, Marx was frequently the

174 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                direct object of Hatta’s critical attention. His two principal
                objections to the Marxian labour theory of value were, first,
## that value is a subjective quality which cannot be measured
## objectively and, second, that Marx debased communism by
                suggesting that it would have recourse, at least in its early
                days, to a value-based wages system. In the first place, Hatta
                asserted that the value of goods is determined neither by the
                labour incorporated into them nor by their scarcity. In Hatta’s
                opinion, the ‘value’ of an article for any particular person
## depends entirely on that individual’s inclinations and
                circumstances. Since no two individuals ever share precisely
                the same tastes or live under identical conditions, the value of
## an object can never be exactly the same for both of them.
## Hatta’s understanding of value was, in fact, one of the
## philosophical cornerstones of his support for anarchist
## communism. In Hatta’s view, only an economy functioning
                along communist lines could accommodate the infinite variety
## of personal ‘values’, because only communism—by replacing
## economic exchange by free access to goods—would dispense
                with the need for a universal standard of value. To put this in
                Hatta’s own words: ‘Let’s strive for an economic system
## without prices, an economics of the free communes organised
                on the basis of true, unmeasured value.’[278]
                Hatta’s second major criticism of the Marxian labour theory of
                value was that:
                as long as Marx adopted the labour theory of value, he could
                not escape from the fundamental principles of capitalism. On
## the one hand, his theory became collective individualism
                (where a collective engaged in a certain industry exclusively
175 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## possesses value created by the whole of society) and, as a
## result, was separated from true communism. On the other
## hand, an all-encompassing wages system was to be
                established with the state or a limited society (shō shakai) as
                the capitalist and the people all as workers. In this way, the
                people were to be permanently enchained.[279]

## Here Hatta was less concerned with Marx’s use of the labour
                theory of value as an instrument for analysing capitalism than
                he was with Marx’s proposal that it should be carried over into
                the notorious ‘first phase of communist society’.[280] In the
## Critique of the Gotha Programme, Marx claimed that in the
## ‘first phase’ of communism articles of consumption would in
## effect be purchased with labour vouchers received in
## accordance with the number of hours one had worked.
## According to the Marxian labour theory of value, under
## capitalism commodities exchange in proportion to the
## quantities of socially necessary labour incorporated within
## them. Marx had recommended that in his ‘first phase’ of
## communism the exchange of labour vouchers for means of
                consumption would operate in a similar fashion: ‘the same
## principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity-
## equivalents, so much labour in one form is exchanged for an
                equal amount of labour in another form’.[281] Following
                Kropotkin in The Conquest of Bread, Hatta insisted that there
## was no such thing as a ‘first phase’ of communism which
                featured a wages system or which used labour time as the unit
## of economic calculation. Any system which employed such
## devices would be no more than a variant of capitalism,
                maintained Hatta. It could not legitimately be considered as

## even a preliminary stage of communism, since ‘when labour
## becomes the basis of all value we are destroying the
                foundation of the concept of communism’.[282] Hatta refused
## to accept any watering down of the communist challenge to
## capitalism because for him communism necessarily entailed
                each individual’s free and unrestricted access to the entire
## array of available goods. As a member of the communist
## community, each individual would have the right of
## unhindered consumption because the goods in question would
## all be part of the common wealth created by applying the
                community’s collective talents and energies to commonly-held
                resources. Hatta was adamant that, compared to this vision of
                communism, Marx’s outline of the initial stage of a supposedly
## new society was in no way worthy of the name ‘communism’,
## not even in the qualified form of ‘first phase’.

## Hatta believed that there had been a time when anarchism
## had been in mortal danger of falling into the same trap as
## Marxism, since several of its best-known exponents had
## employed the labour theory of value. Not only Proudhon, but
                Bakunin too had incorporated this theory into his proposals for
## reorganising society and Hatta accused other prominent
## anarchists, such as Rudolf Rocker (1873–1958), Augustin
## Souchy and Alexander Berkman, of making the same mistake
                in later years. According to Hatta, it was Kropotkin who rescued
## anarchism from this fate when he put it on an unambiguously
## communist footing. Hatta believed that, had it not been for
## Kropotkin, anarchism would have been overwhelmed by
                Marxism:
                In the days of the First International, anarchism and Marxism

                gave the appearance of setting up in business together. In fact,
## it was thanks to Kropotkin that anarchism was rescued from
## this major crisis. If Kropotkin had not appeared, anarchism
                would have been taken over by Marxism in both its theory and
                practice.[283]
                Hatta saw himself as following in Kropotkin’s footsteps both
## when he opposed Marx’s theories and when he campaigned
## against syndicalism, since he interpreted the latter as an
                attempt to revive the Marxist-influenced variety of anarchism
                which had prevailed at the time of the First International.[284]

## The third theory of Marx’s which Hatta found it necessary
## frequently to challenge in his writings was the materialist
## conception of history. In advancing this theory, Marx had
                asserted that people’s ‘relations of production correspond to a
## definite stage of development of their material powers of
## production’, that their ‘social existence determines their
## consciousness’ and that ‘in broad outlines we can designate
                the Asiatic, the ancient, the feudal, and the modern bourgeois
## methods of production as so many epochs in the progress of
                the economic formation of society’.[285] While Hatta rejected
                all these propositions, he regarded as the most pernicious the
## idea that humankind progresses via capitalism due to
## capitalism allegedly creating the material conditions for
## achieving communism. Hatta dismissed this out of hand
## because he regarded capitalism as an unmitigated disaster
                which should never have been allowed to develop in the first
## place and whose further development should be
## uncompromisingly opposed. One of his most outspoken
                statements to this effect appeared in an article in Kurohata
178 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                (Black Flag) in 1931, where he wrote: ‘Capitalism is a disease
                which absolutely should not be contracted. It is a stage which
                absolutely should not be permitted to exist in history.’[286]
                Hatta contradicted Marx in this forthright fashion because he
## disagreed both with the general proposition of historical
                progress and with the specific claim that capitalism prepared
## the ground upon which communism could be built.

                As far as historical progress was concerned, Hatta argued that
## there was no such thing. History was no less important for
## Hatta than it was for Marx, since he held that it furnished
## numerous examples of periods in the past when anarchist
## communism had flourished, but he dismissed the notion of
                linear progression (as in the Marxian sequence of feudalism to
## capitalism to communism, for example). According to Hatta’s
                reading of history, ‘civilisation’ based on rule and exploitation
## had occupied no more than a few thousand years of the last
                100,000 years of human existence. In other words, for the bulk
## of its existence on the planet ‘humankind had been
                experiencing a peaceful society without rule or exploitation’
                and, furthermore, ‘a society without the distinction between
                town and country, without the division of labour’.[287] Even
## with the emergence of urban civilisation, all was not lost
## because much of the subsequent history of the human race
## could be interpreted as a continuing struggle between
## centralised power on the one hand and decentralised
## autonomy on the other. Hatta considered that the principal
## examples of the latter have been the uncountable number of
                villages, found in all countries throughout the ages, which have
## organised their own affairs and practised a natural

## communism, although he also pointed to those ‘free towns’
                which successfully threw off central authority in periods such
                as the European Middle Ages.[288] Hatta’s view was that,
## when these decentralised communities waxed, the urban
## centres of power waned and vice versa. He maintained that
## this inverse relationship between centralised power and
## autonomous community could best be conveyed by the notion
                that running through human history there is ‘a strong will for
## liberty—a will to live—which rulers and exploitation cannot
                eradicate’.[289] Hatta believed that it was this urge for liberty
## which creates history and not the successive replacement of
                modes of production occurring in conformity with the sequence
                laid down in Marx’s materialist conception of history. As he put
                it: ‘History does not repeat itself, nor does it progress. It is just
                that, albeit in pain and agony, a giant leap towards liberty is
                being prepared for.’[290]
                As for the specific, historical role of capitalism, Hatta did not
                see it in the same way as Marx did, principally because their
## ideas on how communism could be achieved were
## fundamentally different. Since Marx envisaged communism as
## the outcome of a struggle between the working class and the
## capitalist class, a struggle which would culminate in the
## workers taking over the capitalist means of production and
## adapting them for communist purposes, he naturally saw
                capitalism as creating both the subjective agent of revolution
                (the proletariat) and the material preconditions for
## communism (large-scale industry). Conversely, for Hatta
                capitalism merely erected obstacles in the way of communism.
                By siphoning off revolutionary energy into the class struggle
180 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                and accentuating the division of labour, it impeded progress
## towards communism. It should also be added that, because
## neither the wage-earning working class nor mass production
                for sale on the market had the same significance for Hatta as
                for Marx, they did not always use the term ‘capitalism’ in the
                same sense. Whereas for Marx ‘capitalism’ invariably meant a
## system based on wage labour and capital accumulation, Hatta
                sometimes used the word as a blanket term to cover all class
                societies which exhibited private property and exploitation.
## Hence we can find in his writings passages such as the
                following:
                It is not simply the wages system that constitutes capitalism.
                That being the case, capitalism existed in any number of eras.
                All exploitative economic systems that arise from the private
                ownership of capital are capitalism; it is not simply the one
                means of exploitation that takes the form of the wages system
                that is capitalism. In the history of humankind, capitalism has
                recurred again and again since ancient times.[291]

## However capitalism was defined, and whatever obstacles to
## communism it threw up, Hatta did not believe that the way
## forward to communism can be blocked either by the presence
                or by the absence of capitalist conditions. Indeed, one of his
## most fundamental beliefs was that communism is an option
## which remains permanently open throughout human history
## and that its achievement depends not on material
## circumstances but on human determination. This was another
                reason why he rejected the materialist conception of history.
## Looked at from this perspective, it struck Hatta as a
## ‘mechanical world view’ which lacked ‘poetry, creativity or

181 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                impulsiveness’.[292] For Hatta, communism could be achieved
                at any level of technological development, irrespective of the
                productive capacity that was available. All that was required
## for communism to blossom was readiness on the part of
                human beings to organise their lives on the basis of libertarian
                federation and solidarity with one another. This was why Hatta
## was especially dismissive of the dialectical component of
## Marxism, which he regarded as a species of philosophical
## opportunism. According to him, ‘by means of dialectics
                everything that exists is rationalised’, including capitalism,
                which Marxists had fined into the thesis-antithesis-synthesis
                equation.[293] In place of dialectics, which he described as one
## of ‘the most laughable things in the world’, Hatta
## recommended a ‘principle of action’ which would encourage
## people, no matter at which point in history they found
                themselves, freely to reject whatever they found unacceptable
                and freely to struggle for whatever form of society they wished
                to create.[294]

## Since Hatta was such a firm opponent of the materialist
                conception of history, the question arises whether we should
## regard him as a philosophical idealist. His idea that human
                history is the manifestation of ‘a strong will for liberty’ would
                certainly suggest as much and Hatta himself did not object to
## being called an idealist, although he was keen to emphasise
                that his thought was not what is conventionally understood by
                idealism.[295] In an article ‘What Is an Ideal?’, which was
                published in September 1931, he explained that his opposition
## to philosophical materialism derived from the fact that
## materialism lakes the principle of necessity and not the

182 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                principle of liberty as its fundamental point of reference.[296]
## On the other hand, in another article which appeared in
## January of the same year, he denied that his arguments
                against the materialist conception of history proceeded from
                philosophical idealism. On that occasion, he wrote that:
                ‘Idealists forget the existence of matter and materialists forget
                the existence of will.’[297]

## Although, on balance, Hatta seemed happier with being
                identified as an idealist rather than as a materialist, he did not
                attempt to explain his own thought in such terms. For him, the
                crucial distinction lay not between idealism and materialism,
## but between what he termed mechanical thought and
                biological thought He believed that mechanical cognition had
                dominated nineteenth century thought, with Marx as one of its
                exponents. By way of contrast, the twentieth century was to be
## ‘an era of biological cognition, the era of Kropotkin’ and,
## whereas ‘mechanical cognition acknowledges authority,
                biological cognition acknowledges anarchy’.[298] What did
                Hatta mean by ‘biological cognition’? His essential point was
## that humans are animals and that therefore their social
## relations, as well as their history, are best understood by
                referring to the principles which govern the existence of all
                living creatures. Hatta suggested that the most fundamental of
                these principles are:

             1. They live in accordance with their will to exist.

             2. Material circumstances condition the way they live.

             3. They alter material conditions by means of mutual aid, which is
                a manifestation of their will to exist.[299]
183 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Both idealist and materialist elements were interwoven here in
                the shape of ‘their will to exist’ and ‘material circumstances’
                respectively. Hatta’s objective, however, was not to identify his
                thought with either the idealist or the materialist philosophical
                traditions, but to argue that, whether material conditions are
## propitious or adverse, anarchist communism represents the
                social organisation of the human species which is biologically
                most advantageous. It followed from this that, just as humans’
## biological nature does not change to any appreciable extent
## over the ages, neither does their need for anarchist
## communism.

## 6. Hope for a New World

                It often happens that those who spend their time criticising the
## bad, old world are noticeably reluctant to offer a concrete
                alternative to it. A declared aversion to utopian speculation
                often becomes the convenient excuse for providing few details
                about a frequently invoked ‘new society’ which is alleged to be
## waiting in the wings. Whatever one thinks of the pure
## anarchists, one cannot accuse them of failing to provide an
## alternative vision of how society might be organised.
                Particularly in the writings of Hatta Shūzō one finds not only a
## sweeping critique of the old world but also a coherent
                explanation of the principal features of a new world which, he
## insisted (and many thousands agreed), was not merely
## desirable but attainable too.

## As has already been explained, the pure anarchists were
## anarchist communists. They followed Kropotkin and the other
## pioneers of anarchist communism in envisaging the new

184 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## society as a federation of autonomous communes organised
                on the basis of free agreement, well-being for all and mutual
                aid. Production and consumption were to accord with the wellworn formula that people ‘would work according to ability’ and
                receive shares according to need’ without recourse to buying
                and selling.[300] All were to take part in decision-making and
## no group within society would wield power over any other,
                hence eliminating the possibility of exploitation. Describing
                ‘our ideal society’, Iwasa Sakutarō wrote:
                Here, having abolished legal coercion, compulsion by hunger,
## economic incentives and so on, all of which force people to
## work, it will be an economic system based on free
## consumption—on consumption according to need. It will be a
## society where all people support each other and are
## themselves supported, where life is lived by relying on one
## another and helping one another. There will be no need for
## laws. This being the case, there will be nowhere where
## authority could take root and everyone will be a completely
## free man or woman. There will be neither rulers nor ruled,
                neither exploiters nor exploited. Since there will be no-one to
                buy labour, it follows that there won’t be anyone selling labour
                either. It could not be other than anarchy—in other words, a
## society without government—where all people can, in fact,
                realise their true personalities.[301]

## Social Physiology

                Outlined in these general terms, the pure anarchists’ vision of
                anarchist communism was little different from the way in which
## it has often been depicted before and since. However, Hatta

185 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                tried to get beyond the level of vague generalisation so as to
                discern in more concrete detail the essential contours of an
## anarchist communist society. In order to do this, he took a
                remark by Kropotkin that the study of the needs of humankind
                and the means of satisfying them with the least possible waste
## of human energy constituted the ‘Physiology of Society’ and
## tried to work out what anarchist communism, conceived as
                social physiology, would entail.[302] Physiology . seemed to
## Hatta to be a particularly important feature of anarchist
## communism, since it stood in such marked contrast to the
## pathological condition to which human society had been
                reduced by class domination and exploitation.[303] His
                intention was to investigate social physiology with the aim of
                replacing the conventional fields of study of economics, ethics
                and politics. Closely following Kropotkin, Hatta defined social
                physiology as the discovery of the means for satisfying human
                needs with the minimal expenditure of human energy ‘so as to
                realise universal happiness’.[304] Since health and happiness
## go hand in hand, ‘universal happiness’ was clearly an
## appropriate objective when attempting to arrive at a
## physiologically sound condition of society.

                One of the ways in which social physiology came into conflict
                with conventional economics was over the question of people’s
                wants or desires. These were every bit as important for Hatta
                as they were for conventional economists:

## Universal satisfaction is the satisfaction of everyone’s
                individual desires. To put it another way, it is to plan the
                satisfaction of individual desires. The fundamental principle of
                the communist system lies here. Kropotkin said that if one’s
186 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                point of departure is not the satisfaction of individual desires,
## one cannot reach a genuinely communist system. It has to be
                said that this remark of Kropotkin’s is truly the definitive
                statement on the subject.[305]

## Yet where Hatta differed from conventional economists was
                over their arbitrary, but none the less crucial, assumption that
                human desires are infinite and that, faced with a world of finite
## resources, it is necessary to economise—and hence to study
## the best means of achieving economies via the discipline of
                economics. Clearly, if conventional economics were correct in
                its belief that desires are insatiable, then the pure anarchists’
## goal of a society where people would freely consume on the
## one hand and work voluntarily on the other would remain
## forever unrealisable, no matter how physiologically
## advantageous it might be. The human condition would be
## doomed to remain one of men and women competing to grab
## whatever they could from permanently inadequate sources of
## supply, just as conventional economics asserts.

                Hatta rose to this challenge in the extended article ‘A Sketch of
                Social Physiology’ which was serialised in Rōdō Undō (Labour
## Movement) between June and September 1927. Confronting
## the views of academic economists, the type of questions he
                tackled there were:
                are desires as a matter of fact infinite, as they claim? Is it
                desire which, as they say, is the mother that gives birth to the
                giant monster of modern civilisation? ... Is the idea of freeing
                everyone from scarcity mere utopianism? Is it impossible for
## humans to escape from their fate of desires which are
                unlimited and scarcity which knows no bounds?[306]
187 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                Hatta’s answer was that, on the contrary, there were definite
                limits to desires and that it was quite possible, even on the
                basis of the existing forces of production, to attain a situation
## where no-one would need to go without and everyone could
## enjoy abundance. Hatta deployed various arguments to
                support his views and to expose the woolly thinking that lay
## behind the assertion that human desires are unlimited, but
## central to his case against conventional economics was the
## role that is played (and, even more so, could be played) by
                human solidarity (rentaisei). Quite reasonably, Hatta pointed
## out that conventional economists take the behaviour
                manifested by people within the sick society of capitalism and
## proceed to make unwarranted generalisations about the
## inherent nature of the human animal, as though the same
## characteristics apply whatever the circumstances. Hatta
## counter-attacked by insisting that it is precisely because
## capitalism tramples on solidarity that human desires become
## diseased. The analogy he drew was with cancer. What makes
                cancer a pathological condition is its tendency to spread out of
                control and so it is with unhealthily stimulated desires under
## capitalism, suggested Hatta. One could no more draw valid
                conclusions about the intrinsic qualities of human desires by

## generalisations about animal cells after observing only
                cancerous varieties:
                This is pathology. It is not physiology. In the brutal state of

                Hatta argued that, even in a diseased society like capitalism,
                pathology did not go unchallenged. Physiology was at work too
                and predictably he cited the farmers as evidence of this. As on
                other occasions, his argument here was that, without solidarity
                being practised in the farming communities, agriculture would
## become impossible and would grind to a halt. He also added
## that, even beyond the farming villages in the wider society
                generally, there was evidence of solidarity at work, particularly
                at times of crisis and disaster. The conclusion which Hatta drew
## from such observations was that, if even within the
## pathological society of capitalism, the physiology of human
                solidarity manifested itself in everyday situations, here was
## proof that solidarity was, biologically speaking, the basic
                instinct of human beings. Furthermore, it was impossible that
                human desires would be unaffected by this instinctual nature
                of the human animal.[308] Hatta freely acknowledged his debt
                to Kropotkin in developing this line of argument. Its main thrust
                was that in the new society, which would encourage solidarity
                rather than attempting to smother it as capitalism does, it was
## the bonding between people which would act as the limiting
## factor on their desires and induce them to harmonise their
## personal satisfaction with the well-being of the community.
## Perceptions of personal plenty would be influenced by the
## community of which one was a member and by the strong ties
## of affection and solidarity between individuals.

## Just as conventional economics rests on the bedrock of the
## assumed insatiability of human desires, so Hatta’s social
## physiology took solidarity between human beings as its
                foundation stone. Obviously, to build a physiologically sound

## society on this foundation meant to eliminate those
## pathological features which, in combination, constitute the
                disease of capitalism. In line with his critique of capitalist
## society, Hatta identified those pathological symptoms as
                centralised power (which he saw as being inextricably linked to
                the division of labour), exploitation and the tendency to give
## production precedence over consumption. A form of anarchist
## communism therefore had to be devised which, by acting in
## the same fashion as preventive medicine, would ensure
                society’s physiological health by blocking the recurrence of the
                symptoms of the capitalist disease. It was in the process of
                devising such built-in safeguards of social health that Hatta
                achieved a level of detail which outstripped that found in most
## other descriptions of anarchist communism.

## Decentralisation

                It might be argued that there was nothing special about Hatta
                favouring decentralisation. After all, anarchist communists of
## every description have envisaged the new society as a
                federation of autonomous communes. To that extent, anarchist
                communism by its very nature could be said to be a political
## arrangement which automatically stands at the opposite pole
                to the centralised power of the state. However. Hatta believed
                that simply breaking up the state into local, self-governing
## units would not be an adequate safeguard against the
## reappearance of power relations or, indeed, against an
                eventual relapse into centralisation. In his view, there would be
## a particular danger of this occurring if the politically
## decentralised communes continued to practise an economic

                division of labour. Economic specialisation within the commune
                could easily provide an opportunity for the emergence of new
## forms of social stratification, where those with particular
## expertise which was of crucial importance to the community
## could use their monopoly of certain fields of knowledge and
                skills to acquire power and privileges. Similarly, a division of
## labour between communes, such that each commune
                specialised in a particular economic activity, could just as
## easily give rise to an imbalance of power within society at
                large, due to the unequal degrees of importance of different
                lines of production. In other words, Hatta maintained that a
## network of communes which retained the division of labour
                would suffer from the same ills that, as we saw in the previous
## chapter, he predicted would overwhelm a society organised
## along syndicalist lines.

## To avoid this outcome, Hatta insisted that the political
                decentralisation achieved by dissolving the centralised state
## into a federation of autonomous communes would have to be
## matched by an equal degree of economic decentralisation. In
                place of steel-producing areas or agricultural districts, each
## local commune would need to engage in all-round economic
## activity and become a microcosm of the economy as a whole.
                As far as possible, each commune should produce its own food,
                manufacture its own industrial products, be self-sufficient in
                energy and so on. Hatta and the other pure anarchists did not
                make a fetish out of autarky and there was no reason why, at
## the margins, there should not be giving and receiving (as
## distinct from exchange) relations between communes. What
                had to be avoided, however, was reliance on external sources

## for vital supplies, since this would make any commune which
                was caught in that situation vulnerable to outside pressure. If
## articles in everyday use could not be produced locally,
## alternatives should be sought or, if needs be, the commune
                should be prepared to do without. Not that the pure anarchists
                thought that this turn of events was very likely. As Aizawa Hisao
                (b. 1908) put it in April 1930 in an article entitled ‘We Can
                Immediately Achieve a Libertarian Society’, ‘the development
## of a high level of productivity means that today we can
## produce sufficient quantities even by resorting to a
                decentralised system, in other words to a society where people
                consume according to their needs and work according to their
                abilities’.[309] Nevertheless, as Miyazaki Akira’s (1889--1977)
                Appeal to the Farmers made amply clear in February 1931, the
                pure anarchists did see political and economic liberty as taking
## precedence over convenience in everyday life. Perhaps
                because Miyazaki was discussing the situation that could arise
## in the agricultural villages as they engaged in the actual
## process of detaching themselves from urban capitalism and
## transforming themselves into libertarian communes, he
                considered such eventualities as the electricity current being
                cut off or supplies of paraffin oil running out. In addition to
                suggesting alternative, locally-produced energy sources, such
                as methane gas or vegetable oils, Miyazaki did not flinch from
## recognising the possibility that a newly emergent commune
                might even have to dispense with artificial lighting and adjust
                to living by natural daylight.[310] However unlikely such
                drastic measures might have been, the very fact that the pure
                anarchists openly considered them illustrates the lengths to
## which they were prepared to go, if necessary, in order to

192 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## safeguard decentralisation and to circumvent the power
                relations inherent in a situation where energy sources or other
## vital supplies lay outside the local commune’s control.

## Nevertheless, despite recognising certain problems which
                might possibly be associated with economic decentralisation,
## the pure anarchists naturally were inclined to stress the
## benefits of what Hatta called the ‘locally decentralised
                communist system’.[311] In an article on ‘The Two Meanings of
                the Decentralised System’ he claimed that, in the first place, it
                would be more productive than the division of labour and that
                its second (and more important) meaning lay in the fact that it
## could guarantee human liberty by sweeping away political
                power.[312] The pure anarchists expected a decentralised
                economy to be highly productive for a variety of reasons. First,
                by abolishing the wages system, it would be a society without
                alienation. People would work individually and collectively for
                their own satisfaction and benefit, thereby eliminating all those
## counter-productive practices which embody wage workers’
                resistance to their bosses or which express their dissatisfaction
## with the commodities they are forced to produce. Second, by
## dissolving the cities and hence dispersing the industrial
## workers among the agricultural villages, they anticipated a
## vast increase in productivity within the formerly backward,
## farming sector of the economy due to the application of
                industrial skills to agricultural production. As Miyazaki’s Appeal
                to the Farmers put it, ‘will this not speed up the pace of change
                whereby the villages cease to be mere communist agricultural
                villages and become a cooperative society which is a fusion of
                agriculture and industry?’[313] Third, due to the combined
193 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## effects of the reasons given above, they also expected that
## there would be an explosion of inventiveness and fruitful
## experimentation as the members of the communes pooled
## their knowledge and, by taking full advantage of their
                familiarity with local conditions, used their talents creatively for
## the common good. The point needs to be made that, despite
                the pure anarchists’ hostility to large-scale industry, they were
## not opposed to employing machinery or introducing new
                techniques of production. What they looked for was certainly a
## dismembering of the capitalist factory, with its inhuman
## production processes and industry designed with the
                capitalists’ interests in mind. Yet in its place they did not seek
                to resurrect the pre-industrial village of the past, but to move
## forward to a form of anarchist communism which would
                combine the best features of agriculture and industry both in
## the production undertaken in each local commune and in the
## lifestyle of each individual. Hatta explicitly rejected the
                machine breaker’s mentality when he wrote:

## We are completely opposite to the medievalists. We seek to
## use machines as means of production and, indeed, hope for
                the invention of yet more ingenious machines.[314]

## All the same, whatever the claimed increase in productive
## potential that decentralised communism was expected to
                bring, in the final analysis the pure anarchists did not seek to
                justify their preferred social system in terms of the economic
## advantages it might deliver. Scattered throughout Hatta’s
## writings are numerous remarks to the effect that ‘humankind
## cannot advance to happiness by means of a large volume of
                production’.[315] As has already been mentioned, the ultimate
194 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                meaning of political and economic decentralisation for Hatta
                was that he saw it as the key to people retaining control of their
                own lives and not finding themselves on the receiving end of
## decisions taken elsewhere. He believed that. without
## decentralisation, a stratum of specialised administrators,
                entrusted with the function of coordinating production, would
                be bound to emerge. Decentralisation could prevent this from
## occurring because, in the first place, the scale of the
                coordinating exercise would be held in check by confining it to
## the level of the local commune. Secondly. decentralisation
                would also act to preserve the transparency of the coordination
                process since, simply by virtue of living within the commune,
                everyone would be informed about local resources, productive
                activities and needs. Hence, just as Hatta expected that in an
## anarchist communist society everyone would participate in
## production in proportion to their talents and energies and
                inclinations, so it was anticipated that all people would similarly
## take part in running the commune and in coordinating
                production. Universal participation in all aspects of communal
                life would block the emergence of a privileged elite equipped
## with special knowledge and exempted from production
                because of its administrative duties. Hatta succinctly summed
                up this area of pure anarchist theory when he wrote:

## In a system of decentralised production, where people
                individually and collectively produce to satisfy their own needs,
## the producers will also be the coordinators. They will
## coordinate production in the process of producing and hence
## no special coordinating organ will be required. A superior
## organ, composed of people who coordinate production without

                taking part in production, will not be needed. In other words,
                coordination will occur internally, within the commune, so that
                there will be no danger, or even possibility, of power emerging.
                [316]

## Abolishing the Division of Labour and Exploitation

## To achieve a situation where everyone would be involved in
## growing the communal crops, manufacturing industrial
## products in the cooperative workshops, running the
                community’s affairs, contributing to cultural life and so on,
                would clearly depend on transcending the division of labour.
                Yet, however desirable that might be in theory, could it ever be
                realised in practice? Could any single individual conceivably
## have sufficient time and zest to engage in so many varied
                activities? At a more fundamental level, what exactly did Hatta
                and the other pure anarchists mean by ‘abolishing the division
                of labour’ anyway? Did this turn of phrase imply something as
                far-fetched as the entire commune engaging simultaneously in
                precisely the same activity? If so, would this not entail an
## entirely unacceptable degree of regimentation and
## conformity?

## The answers to several of these questions emerge once we
## recognise the distinction which Hatta made between the
## ‘division of labour’ (bungyō) and the ‘division of work’
                (tewake). Bun and wake are alternative readings of the same
                character [分] in Japanese, which has the meaning ‘division’.
                Gyo [業] is literally ‘occupation’. Hence, in combination with
                bun, we get bungyō [分業], meaning the ‘division of
                occupations’ or, more colloquially, the ‘division of labour’. Te
196 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                [⼿] is a character signifying ‘hand’, so that tewake [⼿分け]
## conveys the meaning ‘hands divided’ or, again more
                colloquially, the ‘division of work’. Bearing these lexicological
## distinctions in mind, we need to realise that, while Hatta
                believed that the division of labour (bungyō) was the cause of
## class divisions and exploitation, he did not see anything
                sinister in the division of work (tewake). On the contrary, Hatta
## believed that the division of work was a benign and
                unavoidable feature of any productive process: ‘it goes without
                saying that within society, whatever the kind of production,
                there has to be a division of work’.[317]

## To put it another way, the dangers to which Hatta drew
                attention did not arise from a situation where, at any one time,
## different people were engaged in different productive
                activities. This, he argued, posed no particular threat. What did
## spell danger, however, was when, either individually or
## collectively, people permanently divided along occupational
## lines and withdrew from the pool of communal knowledge
## expertise which henceforth became the property of a
## particular profession. It was this development, in Hatta’s
## opinion, which constituted the division of labour and which
                gave rise to the disastrous consequences that we noted in the
                previous chapter: the degrading of labour to a mechanical
                function; the lack of responsibility for, understanding of, or
                interest in other branches of production; and the need for a
## superior administrative organ to coordinate the various
                branches of production. It was Hatta’s belief that, within the
## context of the decentralised economy of anarchist
## communism, the division of work would not lead to these

## doom-laden consequences, both because of the limited
                geographical scale, and because of the intense solidarity, of
## the commune as a form of organisation. He argued that,
## because coordinated production would take place on the
## limited scale of the autonomous commune, people would not
## be alienated from one another even during periods when they
                were engaged in different branches of production:

## In Kropotkin’s commune type of organisation, everyone could
## take part in coordination at the same time as engaging in
                production. There would be [no] need for a special
                coordinating organ. This would be the case since, even as they
## engaged in one productive process, people could take direct
                responsibility for, understand, and have an interest in, other
## branches of production. This, in its turn, would come about
## because coordinated industry would be conducted within a
                limited, autonomous sphere.[318]
                Reinforcing this effect of living within a tightly knit community,
## there would be the additional characteristic of life in a
## commune that people would be moving frequently from one
## economic activity to another anyway. What incentive would
                there be for people to identify with one particular branch of
                production to the exclusion of others when, before long, they
## would be moving on to another?

                Further light can be shed on this area of pure anarchist thought
                if we examine the intimate connections which existed between
                Hatta’s proposals for abolishing the division of labour and his
## suggestions as to how exploitation could be eliminated. In
                Hatta’s view, the threat of exploitation always existed when
## people were reduced to dependency through being forced to

198 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                rely on others for the means of life. To avoid this predicament,
                people needed to achieve a situation where, individually and
                collectively, they were self-sufficient (jisoku) and practised self-
## support (jikyū) . Explaining how self-support and self-
## sufficiency would work in practice, Hatta described the
## organisation of production within the communes as
## conforming to the principle ‘the things that we need
                individually we will make as individuals and the things that we
                need together we will make together’.[319] In concrete terms,
                what did this mean? In outlining how it might work in practice,
## Hatta found it useful to distinguish between ‘essential
## production’ and ‘cultural production’. Under the heading
## ‘essential production’ would fall many products which
## everyone consumed and which therefore were regarded by the
## entire commune as essential for maintaining life as it was
                currently lived. Conversely, there would undoubtedly be some
                items which, while they were ‘essential’ for the life of certain
                individuals or certain minorities, would be of no interest to the
## majority of commune members. In line with his commitment to
                self-support and self-sufficiency on the one hand, and to the
                primacy of individual desires on the other. Hatta argued that all
                people would surely take steps to satisfy whatever needs they
## personally regarded as ‘essential’. Where the entire
## community was in agreement, all would participate in the
## communal production of goods which everyone considered to
                be essential. Although Hatta offered no examples of his own, in
                the Japanese context rice could usefully illustrate products in
                this category. Since rice has traditionally been the staple food,
## one could reasonably expect all members of a commune to
## take part in the production of a crop which is universally

199 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                recognised as ‘essential’ throughout Japan. In the case of a
## product such as tobacco, however, it would be reasonable to
                expect that only smokers would cooperate in the effort to grow
                that crop, since only they would regard it as essential . At the
                furthest extreme along this narrowing band of agreement over
## what was considered to be ‘essential’ might be a single
                individual who differed from the rest of the commune in finding
                life intolerable without some product or other. Should such a
## case occur, it would be up to that individual to take the
                necessary steps, either by producing individually the required
## product or perhaps by moving to another commune where
                perceptions of what was ‘essential’ were different.[320]
                Apart from such ‘essential production’, all other productive
## activity was seen by Hatta as falling under the heading of
                ‘cultural production’. ‘Culture’ in this widely defined sense was
## of great importance to Hatta. since he was far from seeing
## anarchist communism merely as the means for satisfying
## people’s physical requirements. On the contrary, he often
## described communism as a society ‘full of poetry and song’.
                [321] Hatta believed that, in the pursuit of self-expression, the
## commune’s members would spontaneously group themselves
## into any number of cooperative associations whose work
                would range over a wide variety of artistic and technical fields.
                Here creative individuals with enquiring minds would find likeminded people with whom to cooperate in the spirit of mutual
## aid. Here would be an environment in which joint production
                and experimentation could flourish across the entire range of
                arts and (to use current terminology) ‘sciences’ too.[322]
## Nevertheless, the same principle would apply as within the

                field of ‘essential production’. If any individual found himself or
                herself alone in the pursuit of certain cultural interests, there
## would be no impediments to single-handed enquiry and
## nothing to prevent the solitary expression of an individual
## taste.

## Having outlined Hatta’s ideas on the practical steps for
## eliminating exploitation, we can use the example of rice
                cultivation (as a case of ‘essential production’ involving the
## entire commune) to explain further why he drew such a sharp
                distinction between the ‘division of labour’ and the ‘division of
                work’. On the question of ‘essential production’ in general,
                Hatta wrote:
                Essential production is production of things which are essential
## for the commune as a whole (in other words, for ‘us’ in the
## plural) and which is undertaken by the entire community.
                Naturally, in the course of this production, a division of work
## can occur within the commune. However, this is not the
                division of labour. The reason why is because all the people
                engaged in production are producing by their own effort things
## which they themselves need. The opportunity simply does not
## arise for them to make things which they themselves do not
                need. Moreover, everybody understands, takes an interest in,
                and feels responsibility for the whole process of production.
                [323]

## As mentioned, we can flesh out the bare bones of this
                argument by considering it within the context of the commune
                producing a crop of rice. Rice cultivation is a multifaceted
## process which extends over many months and involves
## numerous distinct operations. To mention only the most

## obvious jobs involved, these include ploughing, tending the
## seedbeds, flooding the paddy fields, transplanting the
## seedlings, maintaining the irrigation system, harvesting,
                transporting, threshing, polishing, storing and so on. Clearly.
## there would be innumerable opportunities here for people to
                insert themselves into the overall production process at many
                different stages and in a wide variety of ways which reflected
                their particular aptitudes and interests. Even if the entire
## commune were to tum out at crucial junctures when large
## amounts of labour were required, such as transplanting time
                and harvesting, there is no doubt that throughout most of the
## process of cultivating rice a division of work would be
## operating. However, Hatta’s argument was that, because
                everybody would be a consumer of rice, would live in intimate
## contact with the growing crop, and would be accustomed from
## childhood to regard the cultivation of rice as essential to
                individual and communal well-being, all would take an interest
## in the health of the plants and would be familiar with the
## overall cultivation process. Hence responsibility for,
## understanding of, or interest in rice growing would not be
                restricted to one section of the population alone. Nor would any
                professional group of specialist ‘rice farmers’ be in a position to
                hold the rest of society to ransom by virtue of their control of
## this vital foodcrop.

## In summary, Hatta and the other pure anarchists saw the
                division of labour and exploitation as two sides of the same
                coin. The abolition of one depended on the elimination of the
                other and the means for achieving these twin goals lay in the
## decentralised commune practising the ‘division of work’ as

## distinct from the ‘division of labour’.

## Taking Consumption as the Basis

## Hatta maintained that one key difference between anarchist
## communism and all economic systems based on centralised
## power (which included capitalism) was that only the former
## would give precedence to consumption in economic decisionmaking. In his own words:

## In a locally decentralised communist system, production
                springs from consumption. In place of consumption arising out
## of production, as in a system based on centralised power,
## consumption becomes the causal source of production in a
## system of decentralised production. As far as this point is
## concerned, a decentralised production system and a system
## based on centralised power (which I shall abbreviate to ‘a
## centralised production system’) reverse the relationship
## between production and consumption.

                centralised production system ... production ... consumption

## decentralised production system ... consumption ...
                production[324]

## Hatta used the form of words ‘the principle of taking
## consumption as the basis’ (shōhikihonshugi) to express the
## idea that the members of each commune would independently
                decide the material standard of living they wished to enjoy and
## would then proceed to organise local production in whatever
                ways suited them best so as to achieve freely agreed levels of
                consumption. This is very different from existing society, where
                people’s desires for consumption are continually eclipsed by
203 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                production considerations, reflecting either the state’s interest
                in expanding production or the effect of capitalism’s economic
## laws. In an anarchist communist society neither of these
## factors could interfere with the communes’ priority of
## satisfying local consumption needs. Centrally planned
## production targets could only be imposed onto the communes,
## to the detriment of their members’ consumption, if a state
                were to exist which was provided with the power to force its
## decisions onto the rest of society. Anarchist communism’s
                declared purpose was precisely to remove the possibility of this
## occurring by destroying the state and shifting the locus of
## decision-making from an all-powerful centre to the
## autonomous communes. Similarly, the compelling need to
## accumulate capital, which likewise expresses itself as
## production taking precedence over consumption, only
## operates in a market economy where rival enterprises
                compete to outsell each other and acquire profits. Again, one
## of anarchist communism’s aims in abolishing buying and
                selling, and freeing production from considerations of profit,
## was precisely to eliminate the economic consequences of
## capitalism, such as compulsive capital accumulation.

## Hatta’s concern for ‘taking consumption as the basis’
                dovetailed with the other elements in his political philosophy.
                He believed that only by giving priority to consumption could
## the individual’s desires be satisfied and could liberty be
                guaranteed. Since the class struggle was rooted in the clash
                between workers and capitalists at the point of production, it
                was only to be expected that those whose strategy and tactics
                flowed from the class struggle would focus on production. This

## was how he explained the prevalence of slogans such as ‘the
                workers’ right to work’ or ‘the producers’ right to produce’
                among exponents of the class struggle. He argued that, for the
## same reason, Marxism and syndicalism both aspired to
                ‘distribute in accordance with the quantity of labour expended’
## in production and favoured a system where ‘those who do not
                work should not eat’.[325] By way of contrast, Hatta insisted
## that it was precisely because anarchist communists rejected
                the class struggle, and the bias towards production which went
## with it, that they were able to demand ‘the right of human
## beings to satisfy their desires whatever they might be’. In
                opposition to what he took to be Marxism’s and syndicalism’s
                principles of distributive justice, Hatta formulated anarchist
## communism’s alternatives as ‘distribute in accordance with
## everyone’s desires’ and ‘receive in accordance with desires
                and work according to abilities’.[326]
                Undoubtedly, Hatta believed that, compared to a social system
                such as capitalism which gives priority to expanding the means
## of production, the mass of the people would be materially
                better off in a society that ‘took consumption as the basis’. This
## was an important consideration because, as with Kropotkin
## before him, he understood that an anarchist communist
## revolution would succeed only if it could provide material
                security for all. Yet prioritising consumption was intended to be
                far more than an economic device for raising living standards.
                Hatta also saw it as the source of human liberty because, for
                him, liberty was defined as the freedom of people to realise
                their desires. That was why he denounced as inimical to liberty
                any social system which, by prioritising production, frustrated
205 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                people’s ability to satisfy their desires:

## In making production our economic starting point, human
                liberty is lost. This is because human liberty is realised when
## our desires are expressed in production ... Since making
## production our economic starting point is to determine
                consumption by means of production, it ends with the denial of
                liberty.[327]

## In Hatta’s opinion, human liberty would be part of the very
                fabric of an anarchist communist society exactly because the
## sole purpose of production in the decentralised communes
## would be the satisfaction of people’s desires. ‘Taking
## consumption as the basis’ meant that production would be
## moulded and adapted to meet those desires, thereby bringing
                about a physiologically sound state of affairs which would be
                reflected in people’s psychological as well as their physical
                well-being. This was why Hatta argued that when one looked at
## the two formulae

                centralised production system ... production ... consumption
                decentralised production system ... consumption ... production

## ‘one might think, at first glance, that it hardly makes any
                difference. Yet, in fact, these constitute the fundamental points
                of contrast between these two systems.’[328]

## A World to Win

## The pure anarchists were not content with simply dreaming
## about the new world of anarchist communism, but were
                committed to an all-out effort to bring it about. Commitment to
206 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                anarchist communism’s realisation, however, raised questions
## such as what form of organisation would be best suited to
## achieving this goal and what should be the relationship
                between the anarchist minority and the mass of the people in
                the course of bringing it about. Hatta pitched into the debates
                on these questions with characteristic fervour and expressed
                his views in a typically forthright fashion. In the final section of
                this chapter, we shall therefore briefly look at how he thought
## the new world could be won. The issue of organisation was a
## hotly contested subject within the anarchists’ ranks. To a
                certain extent, the debate over organisation was part of the
                wider controversy over syndicalism, but it also reflected the
                determination of some anarchists to meet the challenge of the
## bolsheviks’ ‘democratic centralism’ by devising an
                organisational theory of their own. As we saw in Chapter 1, this
                was the rationale behind the decision of the Group of Russian
## Anarchist Communists Abroad to issue the Organisational
## Platform of the General Union of Anarchists in 1926. The
## phenomenon of ‘platformism’ (as this tendency became
## known) provoked heated arguments even in distant Japan and
                it was partly in reaction to the Organisational Platform that
                Hatta joined the discussion on organisation.[329]

## Hatta was against any attempt to ‘organise’ the anarchist
                movement in the sense of inventing a theory of organisation to
                rival ‘democratic centralism’ which would then be brought into
## the movement. It was true that Hatta and the other pure
                anarchists favoured ‘libertarian federation’ (jiyū rengōshugi) as
## the organisational principle of the anarchist communist
## movement, but Hatta denied that this was one theory of

207 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                organisation among several contending theories. Rather it was
                the case, suggested Hatta, that libertarian federation has the
                status of a ‘fundamental truth’ (genri) which we all recognise
## from our own experience, knowing that without it society
                would simply collapse and life would no longer be truly human.
                [330] Understanding libertarian federation in this fashion,
## Hatta argued that it was a ‘natural’ (shizentuki) mode of
                organisation, as opposed to such ‘artificial’ (jin ‘iteki) forms as
## ‘democratic centralism’. It could be described as natural
## because it was widely practised among many species of
## animals and also within ‘the communist groups of primitive
                people’.[331] Yet its natural qualities had no connotation of
## backwardness or ineffectiveness for Hatta. On the contrary,
                they were evidence that it was biologically suited to the needs
## of the human species. By way of contrast, it was artificial
                organisation which clashed with the interests of the majority of
## human beings, since ‘artificial organisation is inevitably
                accompanied by power and coercion’.[332]
                Hatta did not agree with those who argued that the failures of
                the anarchist movement (as, for instance, in the case of its
## defeat by the bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution) were
                attributable to organisational failings. Instead, he maintained
                that anarchism’s strength lay in the fact that it did not resort to
## artificial organisation. To achieve an anarchist communist
                society, what was required was a method of organisation which
                was effective in coordinating the efforts of a widespread and
## sizeable movement at the same time that it provided ample
                scope for individual initiative and action. Hatta believed that
                libertarian federation met these requirements entirely. On the
208 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                one hand, it was ‘based on the freedom of will and spirit of
## independence of the individual’, but it also encouraged the
## individual to ‘federate with other individuals according to
                individual interests, tastes and inclinations, and by means of
                free agreement’.[333] Just like their members, the grassroots
## groupings of like-minded individuals which would emerge in
                this fashion would be free and independent in their turn. They
                too could be expected to federate with similar groups, again on
                the basis of commonly held ‘interests, tastes and inclinations’.
                Thus libertarian federation provided for a progression from one
                level of federation to successively higher levels, with the links
                at each stage being forged in a spirit of free agreement and
## unforced cooperation to attain common objectives. As can be
## seen, this was an argument intended to demonstrate that
## libertarian federation was a form of organisation uniquely
## suited to anarchism’s requirements. But it is important to
                realise that, for Hatta, the argument also flowed in the opposite
                direction: ‘outside of anarchism there is no genuine libertarian
                federation’.[334]

## One reason why Hatta felt that it was vital that the pure
                anarchists should adopt a form of organisation which allowed
                for maximum individual initiative was that he believed that the
                ‘creative violence of a minority’ would play a key role in the
## anarchist communist revolution. One can get an idea of the
## relationship which Hatta envisaged between the minority of
## anarchist activists and the majority of the people from his
## criticism of syndicalism. Hatta claimed that one of
                syndicalism’s contradictions was that it sought to combine the
                theory of creative violence by a minority, which it borrowed
209 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                from anarchism, with the theory of the class struggle, which
                derived from Marxism. In the course of criticising syndicalism’s
                use of what he regarded as these two contradictory theories,
                Hatta conceded that anarchist syndicalists did aim to ‘rouse
## the majority by means of the heroic, creative audacity of a
                minority of conscious militants’. His reaction to this stated aim
## was significant. ‘That is not the class struggle; that is
                revolution’, he retorted.[335] In other words, in this respect
## Hatta’s own image of revolution coincided with that of the
## anarchist syndicalists. He too thought In terms of a bold
                minority seizing the initiative and spurring the majority into
                action. In part, this concept of a revolution carried out by the
## majority but initially provoked by a minority seems to have
## derived from Hatta’s perception of the relationship between
## the cities and the countryside. The majority of Japan’s
## population was composed of peasants and tenant farmers in
## the agricultural villages, which were seen as reservoirs of
## naturally occurring anarchist communism. On the other hand,
                most of the pure anarchists were based in the cities and, in the
                pursuit of their struggle against capitalism, concentrated their
## activities within the urban centres. In the light of this
                relationship between the farming majority in the countryside
## and the activist minority in the cities, minority action to
                detonate the revolution was seen as justifiable. If the citybased militants took the initiative and acted to destroy urban
## capitalism, it was held that this would break the cities’
## stranglehold on the farming communities and hence enable
## the latter to flower naturally into the autonomous communes
                of the new society.[336]

## Nevertheless, despite the role which Hatta expected the
                anarchist minority to fulfil in the early stages of a revolution, it
                would be quite wrong to give the impression that he believed
## that social change could be engineered by a vanguard
## leadership. In his polemics against bolshevism, Hatta
## repeatedly emphasised that it was useless to resort to
## centralised power and that only the mass of the people
                (minshū), spontaneously organised into numerous groups
## through which they pursued their common interests, could
                bring the revolution to a successful conclusion.[337] For Hatta,
## revolution remained the responsibility of the people and
                whatever problems it threw up had to be solved by the people
## themselves. A good example of Hatta’s ‘Japanese style’ of
## thinking was his explanation that the revolution ‘should
## advance by means of the power that moves at the base of the
## belly of the people (minshū no hara no soko ni ugoite iru
                chikara). The power at the base of the people’s belly is their
                ardent desire for “supplying according to needs”. It is just this
## ardent desire that constitutes the driving force of the
                revolution. True revolution can be said to be rising up by means
                of this and beating a path in response to it.’[338] Not only was
                Hatta bitterly opposed to the bolshevik strategy of substituting
                vanguard power for popular initiative, but he was dismissive of
## any attempt to introduce centralised authority into the
## revolutionary process, even when this was excused as a
## ‘temporary’ measure during a supposed ‘transitional period’
## which would bridge the gap between capitalism and
## communism. Hatta denied that there was any need for a
                ‘transitional period’ to be interposed between the old society
## and the new. Looked at from an economic angle, he

## maintained that it would be positively harmful to institute
## centralised control of the economy, since it was turning
## immediately to decentralised production in the communes
## which would unblock the potential locked up in society’s
                productive forces.[339] But his principal argument against the
                notion of a ‘transitional period’ was that, despite its ostensible
                purpose of taking society beyond capitalism, its real effect
                would be to consolidate capitalist patterns of behaviour and
## control, and hence block the way forward to a new world. A
                ‘transitional period’, Hatta insisted, represents ‘an attempt to
## advance according to capitalism’s fundamental principles,
                such as the centralised, authoritarian state and the mode of
## production based on the division of labour’. Instead of
## transcending capitalism, ‘such a transitional period is a
                prolongation of capitalism’.[340]
                Hatta’s essential point in all his writings on how to achieve
## anarchist communism was that a movement organised for a
                particular goal must, as far as possible, prefigure the goal itself.
                If the aim is to achieve a decentralised society, the movement
                itself must be decentralised. If the objective is to abolish power
                relations, the means used must dispense with such relations. If
                the goal is to eradicate capitalism, there must be no flirting
                with elements of capitalism along the way. By sticking to this
## basic principle, Hatta managed to achieve a high degree of
                consistency between his vision of the new world of anarchist
## communism and his ideas on how it could be won.

## intensifying spiral of external aggression and internal
## repression. Externally, the Japanese army provoked the
## Manchurian Incident in September 1931, the puppet state of
                Manchukuo was declared in March 1932, part of Inner Mongolia
                was occupied by Japanese forces in March 1933, and the Marco
                Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937 led to full-scale war with
                China. Internally, the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai in
                May 1932 opened the way to an increasing role for the military
                in government and this trend was further strengthened by the
                attempted coup carried out by young army officers in February
## 1936. Accompanying these political developments, the
## economy was increasingly militarised, with spending on the
## armed forces rising from 31 per cent of government
## expenditure in 1931–2 to 47 per cent in 1936–7 and 71 per
                cent in 1937–8.[341] Needless to say, the period from 1931
                onwards was also characterised by a relentless tightening of
                the screws on all who offered resistance to these political and
## economic changes. The anarchists were prime targets of
## repression and this chapter deals with various strategies
                adopted by different tendencies among the pure anarchists as
## they attempted, against all the odds, to turn the tide.

## Broadly speaking, there were three strategies employed by
## different currents among the pure anarchists. As Zenkoku
                Jiren’s membership dwindled after 1931, there were those who
                advocated burying the hatchet with the anarchist syndicalists
                and reuniting with Jikyō so as to bring all the anarchist-inclined
                unions together again into a single, decentralised federation. A
## second tendency among the pure anarchists reacted to
                repression in the cities by turning even further away from the

## urban centres and adopting an even looser organisational
                structure than Zenkoku Jiren. This tendency is best represented
                by the Nōson Seinen Sha (Farming Villages Youth Association)
                whose full title was generally abbreviated to Nōseisha. As its
## name implies, Nōseisha was oriented towards the peasants
## and tenant farmers in the agricultural villages. It pushed
                decentralisation to the point where ultimately there were those
                in its ranks who questioned the need for any form of linking
                organisation whatsoever. As a complete contrast to Nōseisha,
## the Nihon Museifu Kyōsantō (Anarchist Communist Party of
                Japan, often abbreviated to ‘the Party’ [Tō] by Japanese
                anarchists—a practice which will be followed in the rest of this
                chapter in the interest of brevity) was organised in 1934 as a
## highly secretive and tightly structured group. It brought
## together a number of pure anarchists who believed that the
## situation was so threatening as to justify copying the
## bolsheviks’ organisational methods, even though anarchist
                communism remained the objective of their struggle. The fact
                that none of these strategies was successful and that by 1936
                the anarchist movement lay shattered (like all other organised
## opposition to the dominant power structures, it should be
                noted) is testimony to the hopeless predicament in which the
                anarchists found themselves. In retrospect, it is difficult to
## avoid the conclusion that, whatever strategy they had
## employed, the odds against them were too overwhelming to
                have offered any chance of success. Nevertheless, even if one
## concludes that they were doomed to failure all along, it is
                giving them no more than their due to recognise that behind all
                their efforts lay the determination to resist the capitalist state.
## Even if one judges some of the strategies they employed to

                have been seriously flawed, they surely deserve respect for the
                fact that the state had to crush them, since it could not win
## them over.

## Zenkoku Jiren after 1931

                The move towards reuniting Zenkoku Jiren and Jikyō, which was
## eventually accomplished in January 1934, was part of a more
## general trend towards compromise which became increasingly
                evident within some pure anarchist circles in the years after
                1931. Not all the pure anarchists succumbed to this spirit of
## compromise. Some protested that principles were being
## abandoned, but the threat hanging over the movement was so
                ominous that a majority felt that there was no point in worrying
## exclusively about the purity of the movement’s anarchist
## communist credentials when its very survival was in the
                balance. Hatta Shūzō played no part in the process which led
                to reunification, since he was an increasingly sick man during
## 1932 and 1933. When his death came on 30 January 1934, it
## was preceded only two weeks earlier by Jikyō’s reabsorption
## into Zenkoku Jiren, which took place on 14 January. Yet,
                although Hatta was not directly involved in the debates on the
                pros and cons of reunification, his article ‘Questions of the
## Day’, which appeared in January 1932, anticipated the
                direction that much of the pure anarchist movement was about
                to take. As we noted in Chapter 3, he wrote in that article,
                which proved to be his last contribution to the anarchist press,
                ‘we should establish close contact with the people and enter
## into their midst via those commercial transactions which
                constitute the labour movement’.[342] This certainly
215 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## prefigured the reassessment of the labour movement which
## many in Zenkoku Jiren were to undertake before long. In a
                sense it was fitting that, just as Hatta’s earlier writings had
                been pathbreaking in their formulation of pure anarchism, so
                his last article should have been one of the first indications that
## the bulk of the movement was in retreat from its former
## commitment to uncompromising and unambiguous anarchist
## communism.

                It is not difficult to discover the reason why in the years after
                1931 many Zenkoku Jiren members started to think that it was
## more important to find allies with whom jointly to resist
                repression than it was to castigate indiscriminately all who
## failed to measure up to the exacting specifications of pure
## anarchism. Although the available membership figures for
## Zenkoku Jiren and Jikyō are not entirely reliable, they do
                provide a useful indication of the prevailing trend. From a peak
## of 16,300 members in 1931, Zenkoku Jiren’s membership
## declined to about 11,000 in 1932 and was down to 4,359 by
                1933. In Jikyō’s case, the corresponding figures are 2,968 in
                1931, 2,850 in 1932 and 1,110 in 1933.[343] Faced with this
                drastic decline in their numbers as the state cracked down on
                all unions, voices were raised in both federations during 1933
## counselling unification. Both Zenkoku Jiren and Jikyō also
## started to look beyond the boundaries of anarchism towards
                other organisations with whom to engage in defensive, ‘united
## front’ activity. From a pure anarchist standpoint, there
## undoubtedly are grounds for criticising Zenkoku Jiren’s
## development in the years after 1931 as a slide towards
## compromise and away from anarchist communist principles.

                Yet, as the following account will attempt to convey, even if
                such criticism is legitimate, it should nevertheless be tempered
## by an adequate appreciation of the difficulties and dangers
## which confronted the pure anarchists.

                The most tangible signs that moves towards reunification were
                under way in 1933 were that representatives of Zenkoku Jiren
                attended Jikyō’s Kantō (Eastern Honshū) district conference on
## 5 March 1933 and Jikyō delegates were present at Zenkoku
                Jiren’s third national conference when that was held on 2 April
                1933. One indication of the mounting level of repression was
                that the police ordered the latter conference to stop after it had
                been in session for only half an hour and at the very point when
## Takahashi Kōkichi, representing Jikyō, was addressing the
## meeting and stressing the need for unity between the two
                federations.[344] A measure of the rising tide of reformism
## within Zenkoku Jiren is provided by the ‘action programme’
                (kōdō kōryō) which the third conference was intended to
## consider. That this was clearly a reformist document is
                revealed by its calls for ‘a struggle to oppose absolutely all
                wage cuts and for wage rises’, for ‘complete opposition to the
## intensification of labour and for improvement in working
                conditions’, for ‘securing a system of equal wages for equal
                work without distinction of race, sex or age’, and for ‘obtaining
                security of livelihood for the unemployed at the expense of the
                state and the capitalists’.[345] In contrast to these proposals
## for making capitalism less painful for the working class,
## demands for abolishing the wages system, the state and
## capital were conspicuously absent. It is true that the
## immediate demands of the ‘action programme’ were intended

217 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                to fit in with the strategy encapsulated in the first clause of the
## new ‘programme’ (kōryō) which the third conference was also
                intended to consider. This stated that ‘we shall advance to the
                liberation of the workers and farmers via all kinds of day-to-day
                struggles, conducted by means of voluntary solidarity’.[346]
## Ironically, however, the inadequacy of immediate demands
                that failed to challenge capitalism in a root and branch fashion
## was implicitly conceded in the programme’s second clause,
## which declared that ‘we firmly believe that the complete
                liberation of the workers and farmers is unrealistic without the
                establishment of a society based on libertarian federation’.
                [347]

## As it happened, Zenkoku Jiren was prevented from adopting
                the proposed ‘action programme’ at its third conference by the
                police forcing the proceedings to halt. Nevertheless, it is worth
## noting that many of the immediate demands which it
## incorporated resembled the reformist proposals which
                constituted Jikyō’s similar ‘action programme’. For example,
## Jikyō’s ‘action programme’ called for ‘a struggle to oppose
                industrial rationalisation, dismissals and closures of factories’,
## ‘a struggle to enforce a minimum wage system (¥2.50) and
                twice-yearly, regular wage increases’, ‘a struggle to secure
                equal wages for equal work, without distinction of sex, age or
                race’, ‘a struggle to make the capitalists responsible for the
                secure livelihood of those suffering from occupational injuries
                and the disabled’, and so on.[348] Hence it is fair to say that
## Zenkoku Jiren and Jikyō moved towards one another on the
## basis of an increasingly shared reformism. A few days after
                Zenkoku Jiren’s aborted third conference, its representatives
218 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                again met with delegates from Jikyō and decided to participate
## jointly in the coming May Day demonstration, using the
                common slogans ‘Against War’, ‘Against Fascism’ and ‘Against
                Unemployment’.[349]

## Another reason why reformism and its associated impetus for
## unification with Jikyō made such rapid progress within the
                ranks of Zenkoku Jiren during 1933 was the changed status of
## the journal Jiyū Rengō Shinbun (Libertarian Federation
## Newspaper). Until December 1932 Jiyū Rengō Shinbun was the
                organ of Zenkoku Jiren, but from January 1933 it ceased to be
                Zenkoku Jiren’s mouthpiece and was published henceforth by a
## newly formed, independent Libertarian Federation Newspaper
                Company. The formal reason for this change of status was that
                it was judged that, by loosening its ties with Zenkoku Jiren, Jiyū
## Rengō Shinbun could widen its appeal to the anarchist
## movement as a whole. Behind the scenes, however, more
                sinister motives were at work. Aizawa Hisao revealed in later
                years that from the end of 1932 he and a small group of other
                Zenkoku Jiren activists, who went on to form the Party, started
## to reassess their previous hostility towards anarchist
## syndicalism and their adherence to Kropotkin’s theories.
                Doubts were raised as to whether Kropotkin’s The Conquest of
                Bread had any useful lessons to offer on strategy and tactics
## and, instead, this group wanted Zenkoku Jiren to drop its
                hostility to participating in the class struggle and to come out
## strongly in support of workers’ economic interests within
                capitalism.[350] This group gained editorial control of Jiyū
## Rengō Shinbun and, having severed its association with
                Zenkoku Jiren, used the journal as a vehicle for promoting the
219 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## policies it favoured.

                The explanation for the relative ease with which Aizawa and his
                comrades took over Jiyū Rengō Shinbun lay in Zenkoku Jiren’s
## loose organisational structure. As a safeguard against
## bureaucracy, Zenkoku Jiren relied heavily on spontaneous
                initiatives by individuals and groups within its ranks and largely
## eschewed the delegation of duties or the appointment of
## office-holders who were answerable to the membership in a
## structured fashion. Zenkoku Jiren’s lack of organisational
## coherency left it wide open to manipulation by strongly
## motivated individuals or groups who, by attending key
                meetings, could play a disproportionate part in deciding policy.
                [351] Hence, not only did control of Jiyū Rengō Shinbun fall into
                the hands of the group around Aizawa which was later to form
                the Party but, by skilful manoeuvring, they influenced Zenkoku
                Jiren in other ways. For example, on the eve of Zenkoku Jiren’s
## third conference, a meeting of the conference preparatory
## committee was held in the house of one of the group,
## Umemoto Eizō (1904–43). At this meeting an intense debate
## ensued on reformism, as represented by the new ‘programme’
## which the conference was intended to discuss the following
## day. Although the proposed change of policy encountered
                fierce opposition from those at the meeting who continued to
                identify with the established tenets of pure anarchism, Aizawa
                and his comrades managed to win the support of a majority of
## those who took part in this session of the conference
                preparatory committee.[352]

## Developments abroad also helped to create an atmosphere in
                which the idea of a ‘united front’ had increasing appeal within
220 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## the ranks of Zenkoku Jiren. In Germany the Nazis came to
                power in January 1933. Reacting to this, both Zenkoku Jiren and
## Jikyō helped form the Kantō (Eastern Honshū) Labour Union
                Council in May 1933. This was an amalgam of left-leaning, antifascist unions and it was formed in opposition to the rightist
## Japan Labour Council. Following this excursion into ‘united
                front’ activity, a variety of unions and cultural groups organised
## the League for Opposing and Crushing Nazism and Fascism in
## Kantō and the League for Opposing Repression and Crushing
                Fascism in Kansai (Ōsaka-Kyōto-Kōbe region) in June and July
## 1933 respectively. Both Zenkoku Jiren and Jikyō again
                participated in these ventures. The recollections of the veteran
                anarchist syndicalist Yamaguchi Kensuke (1910–76) reveal the
## type of organisations with which the anarchists found
                themselves cooperating in the course of this kind of ‘united
                front’ activity. He recalled an attempt in the 1930s to hold a
                public rally against Nazism and Fascism at an indoor location in
## Tōkyō, when the police repeatedly interrupted the speeches
## and within five minutes the meeting was forced to close. As
## Yamaguchi explained, the thirteen organisations which
## sponsored this rally ranged across the ideological spectrum
## from ‘left social democrats, bolsheviks and anarchists to
                syndicalists’. In Yamaguchi’s words, ‘it was a united front body
## in the broadest sense’, embracing the Soviet Friendship
                Association as well as (incongruously) both the Anti-Religion
                League and the Buddhist Youth Federation.[353] It is no
## exaggeration to say that, from a pure anarchist standpoint,
## some of the groups with which from 1933 Zenkoku Jiren found
## itself aligned in ‘united fronts’ made strange bedfellows
## indeed.

## Yamaguchi’s recollections are also useful for conveying how
## the changing orientation of Zenkoku Jiren appeared to its
                erstwhile opponents in Jikyō. To anarchist syndicalists like
## Yamaguchi, it seemed that during the course of 1933 Zenkoku
## Jiren left off despising the class struggle as it had done
                previously and showed signs of taking on the authentic form of
                a workers’ movement’.[354] However, while such an
                assessment was not entirely mistaken, the real situation was
                considerably more complicated than this suggests. Despite the
                editorial control exercised over Jiyū Rengō Shinbun by Aizawa
## and his comrades, they were unable to squeeze out all views
                which ran counter to their own favoured policies of immersion
                in day-to-day struggles and unification of Zenkoku Jiren and
## Jikyō. Hence the numerous articles which appeared in Jiyū
## Rengō Shinbun throughout the course of 1933 revealed a
## range of views, extending from those who engaged in selfcriticism over Zenkoku Jiren’s established position on the class
## struggle to those who continued to criticise anarchist
## syndicalism from an anarchist communist perspective.

                Representative of the former point of view were two articles
## that appeared in the issue of Jiyū Rengō Shinbun which was
                published on 10 January 1933. One of these articles, entitled
## ‘Various Problems of Anarchism in 1933’, claimed that
## ‘formerly, it even reached the point where, as an extreme
                manifestation of rejecting syndicalism, the far-fetched opinion
                emerged that those participating in the labour movement were
                not anarchists’.[355] The accompanying article on ‘Various
## Problems of the Union Movement’ called for ‘rigorous self-
## criticism’ and sought to turn Zenkoku Jiren away from its

222 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## preoccupation with ‘ideological purification’ towards ‘the
                struggle of the masses to live’.[356] In a similar vein, an
## editorial on ‘Problems of Getting the Anarchist Movement
                Ready for Battle’ in the following issue of Jiyū Rengō Shinbun
                expressed dissatisfaction with past practice. It attributed the
                ‘stagnation’ of the anarchist movement to what it saw as the
                failure to establish ‘connections, based on struggle, with the
                problems arising out of people’s daily lives’. Furthermore, it
## asserted that ‘the trend towards realising that we must
## eliminate these past errors in our practice and launch
## ourselves positively into concrete struggles is now making
                itself felt throughout the entire movement’.[357] Another
## editorial in the July issue of the journal, entitled ‘Let’s
                Energetically Build a Grass Roots Movement’, also stated that
## there was ‘a danger of lapsing into a so-called idealistic
## movement, in other words of grasping the life of the masses
                purely conceptually and not establishing any direct links in the
                course of a concrete movement’.[358] Turning specifically to
                syndicalism, this editorial then continued:
                In the past, we came close to falling into this kind of danger in
## the course of our struggle against syndicalism. This is
## something we have come to recognise via the painful self-
## criticism in which we have been engaged since the spring.
                [359]

## One of the best examples of someone who stood at the other
                extreme to the views expressed above is provided by an article
## on The Libertarian Commune and Anarchist Syndicalism’,
## which appeared in Jiyū Rengō Shinbun on 10 September 1933.
                As we have seen, the pure anarchists’ vision of a new society
223 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                took the form of a federation of libertarian communes. In an
## attempt to find common ground with the pure anarchists of
                Zenkoku Jiren, a Jikyō study group issued a report during 1933
## which argued that libertarian communes could be achieved by
## means of a struggle conducted along anarchist syndicalist
                lines. The writer of the article on The Libertarian Commune and
                Anarchist Syndicalism rejected this, since he believed that the
                unions favoured by anarchist syndicalists could not form the
                basis of a genuinely new society. The nub of his argument was
## that, since unions are organisations formed by workers
                engaged in production, they inevitably would give priority to
## the interests of the producers rather than to the human
## community as a whole, thereby thwarting any attempt to
## establish anarchist communism by means of a union-based
                strategy:

## Generally, syndicalism takes groups of producers, in other
## words syndicats, as the nucleus of the revolution and,
## furthermore, as the nucleus giving form to the new society.
                However, the problem lies in the fact that such syndicats are
## taken to mean the present labour unions and farmers’ unions
                and, just as they are, these are supposed to lay the basis of the
                future society. In actual fact, we have considerable doubt as to
## whether syndicats can, by their very nature, become the
                nucleus of the revolution, but we are not afraid to say that,
                even if one initially granted it as a possibility, the result would
                be nothing but the dictatorship of the producers.[360]
                The writer of this article did not reject unions out of hand. On
## the contrary, he was quite prepared to concede that ‘in our
                opinion, labour unions are indispensable in present-day society
224 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                for purposes of struggle, training and preparation’, but he was
## nevertheless adamant that, in the event of revolution, they
                would be replaced by entirely different types of organisations.
                [361] It was clear that Kropotkin and Makhno remained his
## principal touchstones in the fields of theory and practice
                respectively, and he concluded the article by rejecting out of
                hand Jikyō’s attempts to present anarchist syndicalism as ‘a
## course which could be taken by the new anarchist communist
                movement’.[362]

## Between the two extremes of either abandoning or strictly
                adhering to the principles of pure anarchism, there were many
## writers who managed to combine criticism of anarchist
## syndicalism as a theory and Jikyō as an organisation with a
                positive attitude towards forming a ‘united front’ with anarchist
                syndicalists or even merging Zenkoku Jiren and Jikyō. It is clear
## from the articles which they wrote that holding such
## contradictory views often depended on a degree of selfdeception. For example, an article on ‘The Recent Tendency of
## Jikyō’, which appeared in Jiyū Rengō Shinbun on 10 March
                1933, described Zenkoku Jiren ‘s attitude towards syndicalism
                as follows:

## However far the development of the syndicalist movement is
                pushed in a revolutionary direction, it certainly cannot, of itself,
## develop to the point of anarchist revolution. Conscious
## conviction of this has governed Zenkoku Jiren’s attitude in
                practice ever since its second conference.[363]
                Yet, despite such outspoken support for Zenkoku Jiren’s long
## established scepticism with regard to syndicalism’s
                revolutionary credentials, the article still came out strongly for
225 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                a ‘united struggle’ with Jikyō. The writer of this article did not
                pretend that Zenkoku Jiren and Jikyō now saw eye to eye on all
                questions, but he did argue, with little evidence to support
                such a claim, that ‘a section of Nihon Jikyō has recognised the
                fallacy of unionism and is stressing the upsurge of libertarian
                federation’.[364]
                Similarly, an article entitled ‘Let’s Understand Correctly the
                Clamour for Unity’, which was carried by Jiyū Rengō Shinbun on
                10 October 1933, opened with the words:
                For us, the idea that anarchism and anarchist syndicalism are
## different systems of thought, and moreover that we take the
                anarchist position, is a first premise. This premise, or position,
## or attitude, is something to which we should continue to
                adhere even in relation to the so-called unity question, which
                recently started to be pushed by the Nihon Jikyō side in the first
                instance.[365]
                The same article also declared:

## however few in number we become, we must strictly uphold
## the banner of anarchist communism and not take even a
## single step which would compromise this theory. This is
## because we recognise the vital necessity of clear,
                revolutionary thought for achieving revolutionary action.[366]

## Nevertheless, despite this apparently uncompromising stand,
                the writer of the article excused Zenkoku Jiren’s participation in
                ‘united fronts’, such as the Kantō Labour Union Council, on the
                grounds that these were merely tactical moves and that joint
## struggles were justified in view of the period of reaction
## through which Japan was currently passing. One of the

                purposes of ‘united fronts’ was given as to ‘win over to our side
## the masses who have fallen under anarchist syndicalism’s
                influence, bring their ideas into line with ours and incorporate
                them into our camp’.[367] The writer also insisted that the only
## basis for unity between Zenkoku Jiren and Jikyō was for the
                latter to abandon anarchist syndicalism and accept anarchist
## communism. Although such hard line views were no doubt
## intended to impress on readers the strength of the writer’s
                pure anarchist convictions, they were in fact totally unrealistic.
                There was no more chance that Jikyō’s members would entirely
                relinquish anarchist syndicalism than that they would passively
                stand by as their ‘united front’ partners manipulated them and
                helped themselves to their supporters. If the writer had really
## not been prepared to give an inch of anarchist communist
## ground, as he stridently maintained, he ought to have
                dismissed outright the very notions of a ‘united front’ and unity
                with Jikyō. The fact that he did not do so is evidence that his
## ostentatious rejection of all compromise was ultimately no
## more than a device for saving face and salving conscience
## while the process of arriving at an accommodation with
## anarchist syndicalism went ahead.

## By the end of 1933, those who wanted to redefine the
                theoretical basis of Zenkoku Jiren ‘s activity and those who,
## often without openly admitting it, were prepared to
## compromise in order to increase the federation’s shrinking
## membership together outnumbered those who sought to resist
## any move away from the principles which defined pure
## anarchism. When the accommodation with anarchist
## syndicalism eventually came, it took the form of a joint

## statement issued by Zenkoku Jiren and Jikyō on 1 January
                1934. With evident high hopes, this claimed that:

## In their final impasse, Japanese capitalism and imperialism
                have already reached an extremity of chaos. The ineptness of
                their political policies and the crimes of the leading capitalists
                (zaibatsu shihonka) are revealed in the resentment now felt by
                the masses. Calls for the overthrow of capitalism and the tide
## of social reconstruction are on the increase throughout the
## country everywhere. Already we can hear the opening strains
                of the revolution.[368]
                Believing this to be the case, the statement was even-handed
                in its apportionment of blame for the ‘completely antagonistic
                relations’ which had existed between Zenkoku Jiren and Jikyō
## for the previous five years. Zenkoku Jiren was said to have
## been guilty of ‘abandoning the daily struggle, sectarian
                deviation and other regrettable tendencies’, while Jikyō had
                lapsed into ‘putting the labour unions above everything else’
                (rōdō kumiai daiichishugi)’ Now, however, both organisations
                were able jointly to announce: ‘Long live the fighting unity of
                Zenkoku Jiren and Nihon Jikyō’ and ‘Long live the strengthening
                and widening of the libertarian federation forces in Japan’.[369]
                Jikyō formally disbanded and merged with Zenkoku Jiren on 14
## January 1934. Two months later, Zenkoku Jiren’s fourth
## conference was held in Tōkyō on 18 March 1934. The
## conference’s objectives were summarised in a number of
                slogans:
                In these stormy times, we must strengthen our forces for the
## battle.

                Total opposition to sackings, wage reductions and short-time
## working (rinkyū).
## Down with fascism—the tool of the capitalists.
## Three cheers for the achievement of the union of the
## libertarian federation forces.
## Enlarge and strengthen Zenkoku Jiren; boldly and prudently
                defend the conference.[370]
                The ‘action programme’ before the conference was also set in
                the by now established reformist mould, but the most striking
## feature of the conference was the small number of delegates
## who attended. On this occasion, under 100 delegates were
## present, compared to the 150 who had attended the previous
## year’s third conference, or the 400 who had gathered at
## Zenkoku Jiren’s first conference back in 1926. As the 1934
## conference manifesto noted, ‘out of 5 million workers,
## organised workers are no more than a mere 360,000 and our
                Zenkoku Jiren has organised no more than a fraction of them’.
                [371]

## Even this fonn of words considerably understated the
## desperate situation which was engulfing Zenkoku Jiren. The
## hard truth was that, despite Zenkoku Jiren ‘s trading of
                principles for numbers, its membership continued to decline.
## Whereas Zenkoku Jiren had 4,359 members and Jikyo had
## 1,110 members prior to unification in 1933, the unified
## organisation had a membership of only 4,092 in 1934, and by
                1935 it had shrunk even further to 2,300.[372] As Yamaguchi
                Kensuke put it, even after unification, Zenkoku Jiren ‘was really,
                as a body, nothing more than a mere handful’.[373] Certainly it
## was a ‘mere handful’ who gathered in 1935 at Shibaura in

                Tōkyō for what proved to be the last May Day demonstration to
                be held in prewar Japan. The police were out in force to control
## a mere 300 demonstrators, the speakers addressing the crowd
## were repeatedly ordered to stop and there were several
## arrests. Although the demonstrators managed to march
                beneath the black flags for the last time through central Tōkyō,
## it was no more than a small gesture of defiance against a
                bloodthirsty state which was preparing Itself for total war. By
## 1936 the balance between the state and its opponents had
                tipped sufficiently for the former to be able to enforce a ban on
## all May Day demonstrations, while the right-wing unions
                contented themselves with taking part in Founding of the State
## Day (kenkoku kinenbi) celebrations on 11 February instead.
                [374]
                As we shall see, the coup de grâce to Zenkoku Jiren came with
                the mass arrests of anarchists in 1935 and 1936, following the
## discovery by the police of the Party’s existence. This was,
## however, merely the final turn of a screw which had been
                steadily tightening on Zenkoku Jiren over several years. With
                the benefit of hindsight, it is obvious that Zenkoku Jiren was
                doomed to extinction in the years after 1931 as it engaged in a
                hopeless battle with a state which was increasingly determined
                to crush all opposition. The pity is that, since it was doomed
## anyway, Zenkoku Jiren did not go down defending anarchist
                communist principles. These were diluted in a vain attempt to
## boost numbers and hence save the organisation’s skin. The
                ultimate tragedy was that Zenkoku Jiren failed in this trade-off
                and, in the final reckoning, ended up with both its organisation
## and its principles in tatters.

## Nōson Seinen Sha (Farming Villages Youth Association)

## The Nōson Seinen Sha (Nōseisha for short) was formed in
## February 1931 and disbanded in September 1932. Despite its
                short-lived existence, both the calibre of its militants and the
## distinctiveness of its theories made it an important
                organisation in the history of pure anarchism. In Chapter 4 it
                was mentioned that, after the split in Zenkoku Jiren’s ranks in
                1928, the confrontation between pure anarchists and anarchist
## syndicalists spread and led to the demise of the anarchist
## literary and theoretical magazine Kokushoku Sensen (Black
## Battlefront) in December 1929. The pure anarchist
## replacement for Kokushoku Sensen was a new journal,
                Kurohata (Black Flag), whose first issue appeared in January
## 1930. Several of those who went on to form Nōseisha were
## associated with Kurohata (as also was Aizawa Hisao, who
                played a key role in organising the Party) and it is noteworthy
## that Miyazaki Akira’s pamphlet Appeal to the Farmers, which
                has been described as the veritable ‘bible’ of Nōseisha, was
                first published in instalments in Kurohata.[375] Establishing
## the background of the group which formed Nōseisha is
                important, since it illustrates the point that their roots lay in
## ‘orthodox’ pure anarchism, as expressed in the writings of
## Hatta Shūzō and others, even though they gradually
## developed their own distinctive approach to organisational
## theory and other questions.

## One of the best ways of putting Nōseisha’s theories into
## context is to refer to Suzuki Yasuyuki’s (1903–70) pamphlet
                History of the Japanese Anarchist Movement, which he wrote in
231 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## 1932. Suzuki was one of Nōseisha’s most important
                theoreticians and in this pamphlet he traced, from Nōseisha’s
## perspective, the development of anarchism in Japan. Suzuki
## was critical of the anarchist syndicalism which Ōsugi Sakae
## had championed prior to his murder in 1923, claiming that
                Ōsugi ‘inducted anarchism into syndicalism’ and referring to
                ‘Ōsugi’s dictatorship of the producers by means of anarchism’.
                From Suzuki’s standpoint, anarchism as Ōsugi envisaged it was
                still ‘a system based on the division of labour’ and was not the
                ‘decentralised system of the libertarian communes’.[376] He
                therefore interpreted positively the pure anarchist reaction to
## anarchist syndicalism, symbolised by the emergence of
                Kokuren in 1926 and by the mounting hostility to the ‘extreme
                actualism of syndicalism’.[377] He also evaluated highly Hatta
                Shūzō’s theoretical writings, arguing that they had played an
## important part in enabling the Japanese anarchist movement
                to free itself from syndicalist influence. As Suzuki put it: ‘In this
                way, anarchism increasingly achieved ideological purity.’[378]
## Nevertheless, at the same time, he also criticised Hatta’s
                ‘idealistic anarchism’. Suzuki quoted Hatta to illustrate the
## latter’s belief that the conventional labour movement was
                engaged in essentially capitalist, commercial activity which
                had no bearing on the liberation of the workers. In place of
## such activity, Hatta urged unionists to become campaigners
## for libertarian federation, which would take them beyond
## capitalism to anarchist communism. Suzuki’s comment on this
                was:
                But Hatta does not say how this is to be put into effect. It goes
                without saying that herein lies the idealism of Hatta Shūzō’s
232 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                anarchism.[379]

## Suzuki was also critical of the organisational methods
## employed by many anarchists. He described Bakunin’s
                influential principle of organisation as ‘from the base to the
## apex’ or ‘from the periphery to the centre’ and argued that
## such pyramidal or centralised methods do not become
## acceptable to anarchists merely because the base takes
## precedence over the apex or the periphery over the centre.
                Suzuki insisted that, instead of trying to devise libertarian
## checks to organisational methods based on the authoritarian
## principle of ‘amalgamation’ (kesseishugi), what anarchism
                requires is ‘autonomous action in a decentralised organisation’
                without any apex or centre. Suzuki argued that understanding
                of this had recently spread among the anarchists in Japan and
## he believed that what was required was a movement which
                was anarchist not only in terms of the social changes it sought
                to bring about, but also with regard to its actual method of
                organisation.[380] In Suzuki’s opinion, one crucial difference
## between Nōseisha and the anarchist movement in its earlier
                phases was that, while previously the operational slogan had
                always been ‘To the Farmers’, Nōseisha had turned this round
## to become ‘From the Farmers’. Henceforth, the movement had
## to be based on local initiatives in the villages and on the
                recognition that those within each area know the local situation
                best.[381]

## The Nōseisha approach to anarchist communist revolution was
                essentially that the entire farming village would rise up, take
                control of the land, oust the landlords, sever its links with the
                urban capitalist economy, and resist the state’s demands, such

## as the payment of taxes and the conscription of young men.
## Comparing this projected revolution with such previous
## experiences as the French, Russian and German Revolutions,
## Suzuki claimed that past attempts had failed because ‘they
                were not cases of constructive destruction but of destructive
## destruction. They were emotional upheavals and certainly
## were not imbued with a clear social ideal.’ To correct this
                deficiency, Suzuki stressed that a future revolution would need
## to be both a mass movement and consciously under the
                banner of anarchism.[382] It is interesting to note that, in the
## concluding section of his pamphlet, Suzuki expressed the
                opinion that, in respect both of its critique of syndicalism and
## its ideas on organisation, he saw the movement in Japan as
                standing at the forefront of anarchist theory internationally.
                [383]
                Nōseisha’s theory, which we have introduced here by means of
## Suzuki’s History of the Japanese Anarchist Movement, was
## developed in a stream of texts which appeared during the
## period 1930–2. These were mainly written by Miyazaki Akira
## and Suzuki Yasuyuki. It is worth examining several of these
                texts in a little detail, since they can throw additional light on
## certain areas of Nōseisha’s theory, including some of the
                contradictions that were woven into it. One of the interesting
                things about Miyazaki’s Appeal to the Farmers is that, by first
## appearing in instalments, it demonstrated how Nōseisha’s
                distinctive doctrine emerged only gradually. The early chapters
                appeared in the issues of Kurohata that were published in May
## and June 1930, even before Nōseisha had been formally
## constituted. Here the handling of anarchist communism was

## unexceptional and there were many echoes of Hatta’s
## deliberations on the same subject. However, by the time the
                later chapters of the pamphlet were published in Kurohata in
## February 1931, Miyazaki was no longer discussing anarchist
## communism merely as an alternative to capitalism which
                might be realised at some indefinite time in the future. Instead,
                his purpose now was to consider, in extremely practical terms,
## how the tens of thousands of villages scattered across the
## length and breadth of Japan could shake off capitalism
## immediately and the concrete measures they would need to
                take in order to convert themselves into libertarian communes.
## In place of the abstract proposition to abolish exchange
## relations found in many accounts of anarchist communism,
## Miyazaki’s pamphlet was full of down-to-earth advice. For
## example, he urged the farmers to stop using commercial
                fertilisers, since this would release them from the consequent
## need to produce cash crops in order to meet the expense
                involved. Miyazaki argued that it was by taking practical steps
                such as switching from chemical fertilisers to nightsoil that
## buying and selling could be abandoned and production
## undertaken solely to satisfy consumption needs. This would
## then lay the basis for communist social relations, for as
                Miyazaki asked rhetorically: ‘If money disappeared from the
                village, why couldn’t the village live as one big family?’[384]
                In The Organisation of the Recent Movement and a Proposal on
## the Form It Should Take (published in August 1931) Miyazaki
                was strongly critical of ‘centralised organisation’. In developing
## his argument, he rejected not merely overtly centralised
                bodies but even large-scale federations, including those whose

                ostensible organisational principle was libertarian federation.
## Hence one section of the text was subtitled ‘The Fallacy of
## Amalgamation (Kesseishugi); the Dissolution of Kokuren and
                Jiren’. Here he called for the disbanding of large organisations,
                such as Kokuren and Zenkoku Jiren, on the grounds that ‘action
                proceeds from the individual’.[385] This was not intended as
## an argument against all organisation, however. On the
                contrary, Miyazaki made it clear that he expected local groups
                to be formed for propaganda purposes and joint activity, but he
                drew a sharp distinction between locally rooted, cooperative
                efforts by like-minded individuals to achieve specific objectives
## and large-scale bodies functioning as permanent
## organisations. The local groups favoured by Nōseisha were
## seen as temporary alignments which would exist only as long
## as it took to accomplish the tasks for which they had been
                formed. Miyazaki captured the essence of this organisational
## method in the motto ‘Group together according to need;
                disperse when finished.’[386] Clearly, it ruled out permanently
                organised, national federations, such as Kokuren and Zenkoku
## Jiren, which Nōseisha regarded as seed-beds for centralised
                control and power relations. Hence Miyazaki’s text ended with
                the slogans:
                Reject ‘From the base to the apex’ and ‘From the periphery to
## the centre’!
## From amalgamation to decentralisation!
                From centralisation to autonomous, decentralised action![387]

## Nōseisha’s criticism of Kokuren’s and Zenkoku Jiren ‘s
## organisational methods produced a fierce reaction from the
## latter and the situation was not helped when, in November

## 1931, Nōseisha secretly issued a ‘Report on the Situation
## Throughout the Country’ which, it was claimed, would prove
                useful to the authorities if it fell into the hands of the police. In
                the repressive conditions of the time, fear of police spies was
                rampant and what, in the event, proved to be totally unjustified
## suspicions about Nōseisha’s links with the authorities were
## easily aroused. Consequently, Hatta Shūzō denounced
                Nōseisha not merely as ‘nothing but a handful of big mouths’
                but also as a group which ‘gave off a treacherous smell’.[388]
## In the same issue of Jiyū Rengō Shinbun which carried these
                remarks by Hatta, there were several other articles by Zenkoku
## Jiren members which attacked Nōseisha with great venom.
                One vitriolic denunciation, which repeated the charge of spying
                and threatened Nōseisha with violence, was entitled ‘Looking
## Forward to the Complete Sweeping Away of These Foul
                Elements’.[389] In retrospect, we can dismiss the preposterous
## idea that Nōseisha’s members were helping the police as
## paranoia induced by the threatening conditions in which the
                anarchists were forced to operate. Unfortunately, however, the
                hue and cry over this issue distracted attention from the need
                to subject Nōseisha’s own organisational theory and practice
                to critical evaluation. Although not on the scale of Zenkoku
## Jiren, Nōseisha claimed to have a network of ‘700 comrades
                scattered throughout the entire country’.[390] Even allowing
                for a degree of exaggeration, it is clear that Nōseisha too, just
                like Zenkoku Jiren, therefore fulfilled some of the roles of a (by
                its own definition) ‘centralised’ organisation. For example, from
## March 1931 it started to issue the journal Nōson Seinen
                (Farming Villages Youth), which served as its national
## mouthpiece, and also its members in Tōkyō often assumed the

## functions of a de facto leadership. Contradictions between
                Nōseisha’s theory and practice of organisation thus evidently
## existed, but circumstances served to delay its members’
## appreciation of this until the latter half of 1932.

## Another related contradiction in Nōseisha’s theory was the
## tension which can be detected between its opposition to
## centralised leadership of the mass movement and the leading
## role it nevertheless assigned to a minority of anarchist
## revolutionaries, who were seen as distinct from, and yet
## supposedly were fused with, the masses. As we have seen,
                Nōseisha argued strongly against centralised leadership, which
## it saw as inevitably arising within ‘amalgamated
                organisations’. Decentralisation was presented as a safeguard
## against this, as also was the concept of ‘the whole village
                movement’ (zenson undō).[391] This latter notion expressed
                the idea of the entire village rising as one body to achieve its
                liberation and thereby prefiguring in the revolutionary act the
                free and egalitarian organisational structure of the emergent
                commune. What is striking about Nōseisha’s theory is the poor
                fit that existed between, on the one hand, its attachment to
                decentralisation and ‘the whole village movement’ and, on the
                other, its equally strong commitment to the idea that, albeit at
                the local level, anarchists should play a crucial role as an
## organised faction which guides the people’s rebellion in an
                anarchist direction. In his text What Is To Be Done? (written in
                September 1932) Suzuki maintained:

## We are anarchists. For that reason we must never forget,
## whatever the circumstances, that we are revolutionaries.
## However, we are not leaders divorced from the masses.

## Therefore we must always be prepared to act as anarchist
## revolutionaries who are with the masses and who are in the
                van of the revolution proceeding from the masses.[392]

## For all their denunciations of centralised leadership, what
## Nōseisha was recommending here and in other texts was
                vanguardism, albeit of a relatively ‘libertarian’ variety. To put it
## another way, throughout its existence Nōseisha was torn
                between the desire to fuse with the masses and the equal and
## opposite desire to lead them.

## Armed with the theory outlined above, Nōseisha attempted to
                fan the flames of revolution in the agricultural villages. In
## August 1931 Nōseisha’s members decided that the
## mountainous district of Nagano was the region where
## revolutionary potential was most developed. A plan was
                therefore agreed to support the anticipated uprisings in the
## impoverished villages of Nagano Prefecture with attacks on
                military installations and terrorist action in the cities. To raise
## the necessary funds, Nōseisha’s members in Tōkyō launched a
## campaign of robberies, but these resulted in most of its
## prominent members being arrested in the early months of
## 1932. Due to the consequent lack of resources, Nōson Seinen
                ceased publication in April 1932 and in September 1932 Suzuki
                and others, who were still at large in Tōkyō, issued a statement
## announcing that Nōseisha was disbanding. Far from conceding
                that dissolution was a defeat, the statement referred to ‘the
                anarchist agitation of the rising masses in all districts’ and
## claimed that the reasons for Nōseisha’s formation no longer
                applied since ‘the anarchist movement in the villages has risen
                beyond that originally planned by Nōson Seinen’.[393]

## Although Nōseisha had built up a network of several hundred
                supporters in Nagano Prefecture and elsewhere, there is little
                evidence to support the optimism it affected at the time of its
                dissolution. Nevertheless, disbanding Nōseisha did close the
## gap, which, as was mentioned earlier, had opened up between
## its organisational theory and practice.

## Nōseisha’s dissolution statement made clear that what was
                intended was a strategic dispersal and not the cessation of all
                activity by its former members. In fact, those of its militants
                who were still at large remained active in various ways, even if
## no longer under the Nōseisha banner, and those who had been
## imprisoned started to be released from September 1934.
## However, no sooner had this happened than there was a wave
## of repression in October 1934. This was associated with
## military manoeuvres which the Emperor was due to attend in
## Gunma Prefecture. Such events were normally accompanied
## by the mass arrest of known activists and in this case the
## round-up extended from Gunma into neighbouring Nagano
## Prefecture, which was the heartland of the Nōseisha
                movement.[394] As in Zenkoku Jiren’s case, the final blow
                came in 1935–6 when, as a result of their investigations into
## the Party, the police arrested hundreds of those formerly
                associated with Nōseisha, despite the fact that the group had
## dissolved more than three years earlier.

## Nihon Museifu Kyōsantō (Anarchist Communist Party of
## Japan)

## In December 1933 Aizawa Hisao and four similarly minded
## comrades, who were working within Zenkoku Jiren to bring

## about its reorientation towards the class struggle and its
## reunification with Jikyō, formed the Nihon Museifu
## Kyōsanshugisha Renmei (League of Anarchist Communists in
                Japan) which was the forerunner of the Party. This diminutive
                and highly secretive group saw itself as a band of professional
## revolutionaries. Its intention was to build a centralised
                organisation based on leadership and, since it expected total
## commitment from its members, it excluded any with family
                ties. It also attached great importance to discipline, insisting
## that, once decisions were taken, members must follow them
                without question, irrespective of their private views.[395]
## Those who formed the League saw their responsibility as to
## create the conditions in which revolution would become
                possible. They believed that the masses could not achieve this
## on their own because they had been suppressed for too long.
                However, they did concede that past revolutions demonstrated
## that, once a revolution has been ignited, the masses are
## capable of anti-authoritarian, autonomous and creative
## activity. On the other hand, previous revolutions were
                considered to be instructive in another respect too. They were
                interpreted as showing that, as revolutions move beyond their
## initial, destructive stage, the people habitually hand over
                control to those who are supposed to be their ‘representatives’
## but who, in fact, become the new wielders of power. The
                handful of activists who launched the League believed that, to
                prevent a future revolution from conforming to this pattern,
                ‘the anarchists must seize social hegemony’.[396] This would
## prevent the revolution from falling into the hands of false
                leaders. Needless to say, they trusted themselves to relinquish
## leadership once the revolution was secure.

                The bolshevik influence at work here is a point which hardly
                needs to be laboured. What is worth noting, however, is that
## none of those who set up the League came from a bolshevik
                background.[397] They had been members of Kokuren and/or
                Zenkoku Jiren and their enthusiasm for bolshevik tactics can be
                interpreted as a reaction against the pure anarchism which had
                previously claimed their allegiance. Nevertheless, in certain
                respects, they could be said to have remained pure anarchists.
## As we shall see when we examine the programme that they
                adopted after the League transformed itself into the Party, an
## anarchist communist society remained the object which they
## sought to achieve. Where they broke with pure anarchism was
                in their desire to become involved in the day-to-day struggles
                by workers to improve their conditions within capitalism. Yet,
## although involvement in the class struggle was now seen by
## Aizawa and his comrades as the means to win mass support,
                they could not entirely throw off their distrust of the reformist
## labour movement. This explains the importance they attached
                to their own role as a hard core of supposedly incorruptible
## revolutionaries operating within a wider, less fastidious
## movement, which they only half trusted on account of its
## reformism. In view of this perception of themselves as a
## leadership which would be the anarchist movement’s
                salvation, it is not a little ironic that it was they who became the
## movement’s Achilles’ heel and who brought about its
## destruction.

                On 30 January 1934, as Hatta Shūzō lay dying, the League was
## reconstituted as the Party. Although its membership was
## subsequently expanded, it continued to keep its existence a

## closely guarded secret and never had more than a few dozen
                members. Its membership was deliberately restricted, partly to
                guard against infiltration by the state but also because its
## limited number of hand-picked members was intended to
                enable it to exert influence on larger organisations without
## them even being aware of its existence. For example,
## Umemoto Eizō was invited to join the Party because he was a
## member of lhe Tōkyō Printworkers’ Union, a key figure in
                Zenkoku Jiren and (like Aizawa) one of the editors of Jiyū Rengō
## Shinbun. Another recruit was Tadokoro Shigeo (1907–45), a
                former secretary of Jikyō who was appointed to Zenkoku Jiren’s
                secretariat after these two union federations reunited.[398]
                This tactic of infiltration was so successful that, by the end of
                1934, the Party had come to regard Jiyū Rengō Shinbun as its
                ‘quasi-organ’. Many articles came to reflect the Party’s views,
                so that, for example, an article on ‘Our Attitude Towards the
## 1935–6 Crisis’, which appeared on 28 October 1934, was
## closely modelled on the Party’s ‘action programme’ and
## contained a list of 26 slogans which formed the concluding
## section of the Party’s pamphlet Proletarian Strategy and
                Tactics. Indeed, this Party pamphlet was itself published under
## the Libertarian Federation Newspaper Company’s imprint.
                [399]

## In August 1934 a meeting was held to decide the Party’s
## ‘programme’ (kōryō) and ‘action programme’ (kōdō kōryō).
## The eight-point general ‘programme’ which the Party adopted
                read as follows:-

             1. Abolition of power politics and the capitalist system.

             2. Establishment of a system of complete local autonomy.

243 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

             3. Abolition of the private property system.

             4. Common ownership of the means of production and the land.

             5. Abolition of the wages system.

             6. Control of production by the workers and farmers.

             7. Availability of education and culture.

             8. Abolition of artificial national frontiers.[400]

                Although the pure anarchist roots of those who had formed the
                Party were clearly visible in this statement of their ultimate
## objectives, the eleven-point ‘action programme’ was a
## contradictory hotchpotch of communist demands (such as
                ‘abolition of the capitalist system ‘) and reformist proposals
                (such as ‘unemployment insurance to be borne by the
                government and the capitalists’). Why ‘acquisition of voting
## rights by men and women over 18 years of age’ (clause 3)
## should have been of any interest to those who were also
## demanding ‘the dissolution of parliament’ (clause 2) was a
                mystery which was never explained.[401]
                The Party’s basic strategy was inherited from its predecessor,
                the League. In Proletarian Strategy and Tactics the case was
                made that, given the backward consciousness of the masses, it
                would be a mistake to rely on their spontaneous activity or to
                expect them, on their own initiative, to achieve ‘libertarian
                federation and free agreement’.[402] As Aizawa explained, the
                conclusion which was drawn was that it was therefore up to the
                Party to ‘seize social hegemony’. Only at a later stage of the
## revolution, when the people had asserted themselves
## sufficiently to engage in economic construction from the

244 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## bottom up and were ready to exercise their own control over
                society, would the Party ‘of its own accord relinquish power’.
                [403] In other words, the Party’s strategy, like the League’s
## before it, was derived from bolshevism, but the naive
## expectation was that a bolshevik outcome could be avoided
## because those carrying it out would be equipped with ‘an
                ideology which denied power’.[404] At about the time when
                this strategy was being urged on the anarchists in pamphlets
## such as Proletarian Strategy and Tactics and the Party’s
## clandestinely published Theses of the Anarchist Communist
                Party of Japan, Aizawa had a chance meeting with the veteran
                pure anarchist Iwasa Sakutarō. As Iwasa put it:

## These days strange pamphlets are appearing. They’re
                complete rubbish. They’re not anarchist, but bolshevik. Have
## you read them?

## Rationalising that this was criticism from an outdated
                anarchist, Aizawa (who was the author of both pamphlets) lied
                his way out of the situation: ‘I haven’t read them yet, but I’ll try
                reading them.’[405]

## The most powerful argument that can be directed against the
## Party’s theories is to give an account of where they led in
                practice. The Party was organised into various sections which
## assumed responsibility for different areas of activity. The
## member who was put in charge of the section with
                responsibility for the Party’s finances was Futami Toshio (1906–
                67). Futami came from a military family and, despite rebelling
                against his upbringing, was fascinated by strong-arm tactics
                and acts of violence. A plan was hatched to carry out a robbery
                in order to raise funds for the Party and a firearm was acquired
245 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                for that purpose. However, before this plan could be put into
## effect, Futami and others became suspicious of a member
                called Shibahara Junzō (?1901–35), believing him to be at best
                loose-tongued about the Party’s affairs and at worst a spy. The
## upshot was that, aided by other Party members, Futami shot
## Shibahara on the outskirts of Kōbe on 18 October 1935 with
## the pistol intended for the hold-up.

                After Shibahara’s murder, a bank in Tōkyō was selected as the
## target for the planned armed robbery. On 6 November 1935,
## Futami, Aizawa and Kobayashi Kazunobu (? h. 1910)
                attempted to hold up the Takada branch of the Agricultural and
                Commercial Bank, but the staff resisted, the pistol misfired and
## the three Party members fled empty-handed. Following this,
## the police launched a manhunt to find those responsible and
## Aizawa was arrested as he tried to escape from Japan and as
## he was about to board a ship bound for Shanghai. Once in
## custody, he was grilled remorselessly by the police and the
                existence of the Party gradually came to light. In the course of
## his questioning, he was beaten mercilessly, his tormentors
                screaming at him, ‘It doesn’t matter whether we kill one or two
                of you lot.’[406] As more and more details of the Party were
## revealed, the case rapidly snowballed from the routine
## investigation of a criminal act into a massive round-up of
## hundreds of anarchists. With complete disregard for whether
                they were Party members or not, approximately 400 anarchists
                were arrested in the closing months of 1935. The intensity of
## the repression was such that Zenkoku Jiren was forced to
                disband early in 1936. As Yamaguchi Kensuke recalled:

## This repression certainly mortally wounded Zenkoku Jiren.

## From factory and workplace, no matter whether they were
## men or women, those regarded as activists were arrested
                indiscriminately, without any distinction being made between
                anarchists and syndicalists. In the Tōkyō Printworkers’ Union
                alone, the best part of 100 workers were arrested.[407]

## Nor was the so-called ‘Anarchist Communist Party of Japan
## Incident’, which stretched far beyond the minuscule
                organisation of the Party, the end of the hammer blows which
## fell on the anarchist movement. As more and more anarchists
                were taken in for questioning at the end of 1935, the police
## gathered an increasing amount of intelligence on Nōseisha.
                Despite the fact that it had dissolved more than three years
                earlier, a ‘Nōseisha Incident’ was now discovered (‘invented’
## might be a more appropriate term) and a further 300
                anarchists were arrested in May 1936. Although it was only a
## few dozen leading members of the Party and Nōseisha who
## were eventually put on trial and given lengthy prison
## sentences, hundreds were locked up while their cases were
                investigated, often for months on end. When the trials had run
                their course, the leaders of the Party received variable prison
## sentences. Aizawa, for example, was given six years and,
## although Futami was initially sentenced to death, this was
## subsequently commuted to twenty years’ imprisonment.
                (Futami was still in prison at the end of the war. He was
## released by order of the Occupation authorities in October
## 1945.) Prominent members of Nōseisha, such as Miyazaki and
## Suzuki, were jailed for up to three years.

                As they hounded the anarchists, the authorities also used the
                press to justify the witch-hunt that they were conducting. With

                headlines such as ‘A Frenzied Bunch Dreaming of an Ideal’ or
## ‘Extending From Its Nagano Stronghold Across the Whole
## Country—A Black Encampment Expanding Itself Resolutely’
## adorning the newspapers, an atmosphere of hysteria was
                whipped up.[408] Under such circumstances, it was impossible
                for the anarchists to engage in organised activity or even to
## publish their views any longer. The merest whisper that
## someone had anarchist sympathies was enough to provoke an
                investigation by the special branch (tokkō). At the very least,
                this would result in being sacked from one’s job or turned off
                one’s farm by the landlord. Even the outbreak of the Spanish
                Revolution in July 1936 had only a minimal impact in far-away
## Japan. For most anarchists in Japan, there was from 1936 no
                alternative but to retreat into private life, think one’s own
                thoughts, and try to stay alive, while waiting for the day when
## the state would, in its turn, be brought to its knees.

                Many anarchists felt bitter resentment towards the Party for
## the fate which had befallen their movement. Although
## Yamaguchi spoke as an anarchist syndicalist, most pure
                anarchists could have endorsed his criticism when he stated:

## This party, centred on intellectuals, ignored objective
                circumstances and, due as much to its elitist heroics and self-
## righteousness as to its adventurism, which was completely
                isolated from the masses, delivered the final blow to an army
                already on the brink of defeat.[409]

## Certainly, he was right to complain that it was the Party’s
## foolhardiness which precipitated disaster. In the typically
## hothouse, claustrophobic atmosphere of a self-styled
## vanguard, the Party’s members increasingly lost touch with

                reality, even to the extent of bizarrely executing one of their
## number who fell under suspicion. Needless to say, Futami’s
                murder of Shibahara was a godsend to a state which wanted to
                blacken the very name of anarchism, since it provided an ideal
                opportunity to portray all anarchists as half-crazed assassins.
## Nevertheless, one should not overlook Yamaguchi’s final
                remark. By 1935–6 the anarchists truly were ‘an army already
## on the brink of defeat’. The state was determined to crush
## anything that would hinder the coming war effort, and the
                anarchists offended on every score, since their critique of the
## status quo took in every aspect of existing society—from
                capitalism to imperialism, from the Emperor to militarism, from
                parliament to the existence of the state institution itself. In that
## sense, the Party could be said to have merely provided the
## opportunity for what the state was determined to do anyway,
## under one pretext or another.

                In August 1945, some ten years after the end of our story, and
                with more than three million Japanese corpses by then strewn
                across the battlefields of Asia and the Pacific, the Japanese
                state finally admitted defeat. In the subsequent rush to jettison
## what was expendable, so as better to preserve the essential
## structures of capitalism and the state, it suddenly became
## fashionable to denounce the old regime. Opportunists of all
                descriptions wasted no time in distancing themselves from the
                former state and its by now discredited ways. But in their hurry
                to cast off the state’s militaristic and oppressive garb, and to
                redress it in liberal garments, few remembered those who had
                resisted authoritarian rule long before it was fashionable to do
                so. Fewer still remembered the anarchist maxims that there is

                no such thing as a ‘good state’ (as opposed to a ‘bad state’)
                any more than there is an ‘acceptable form of capitalism’ (as
## opposed to an ‘objectionable form of capitalism ‘). A new
                capitalist state rose in Japan from the ashes of the old—and
## with it the need to resist and overcome, just as the pure
## anarchists had attempted to do a generation earlier.

                8. Pure Anarchism: an Assessment

                For supporters of capitalism, there is a ready-made conclusion
## waiting to be drawn from the case-study of pure anarchism.
                Essentially, the argument is that pure anarchism is a particular
                manifestation of the strains inevitably induced by the process
## of economic development. They will argue that during the
                interwar years Japan was engaged in the further expansion of
                industry, to the detriment of agriculture; that this imposed
## burdens on the working population generally and on those in
                the agricultural sector in particular; and that pure anarchism
## was an expression of the unrealistic complaints and utopian
## yearnings uttered by hard-pressed farmers and first-
## generation workers as they witnessed the incorporation of
                their traditional communities into the market economy, with all
                its attendant, unfamiliar disciplines. As E.P. Thompson might
                have said, it is a verdict on the pure anarchists which reeks of
                ‘the enormous condescension of posterity’.[410] It assumes
## that the very idea of economic development as the pure
## anarchists envisaged it (without state power, without
## production for profit and without the wages system) was a
                utopian fantasy. And, although supporters of capitalism would
## prefer not to admit it, it also assumes that there was no

                alternative to Japan becoming an armed nation-state, ready to
## engage in war in defence of its economic interests, as
## eventually happened with such catastrophic consequences
## between 1937 and 1945. Supporters of capitalism regularly
## invoke parliamentary ‘democracy’ as the safeguard which,
## when present, can prevent the state’s warlike behaviour and
                they regret the fact that it was never properly consolidated in
## interwar Japan. Yet such faith in the saving grace of
                parliamentary ‘democracy’ is no more than a night of fancy of
                their own. As the pure anarchists never failed to point out,
                capitalist states of the ‘democratic’ variety, such as the USA or
                Britain, are no less likely to promote their interests militarily
                than is the type of despotic state that Japan was in the interwar
                years.[411] In other words, supporters of capitalism would be
## well advised to think through their own prescription for
                economic development, which is pregnant with the corollaries
                of war, exploitation and oppression, before they start levelling
## the charge of utopianism at others.

## It is necessary to set aside prejudices and ready-made
                conclusions, then, if we are to assess fairly how feasible the
## communes favoured by the pure anarchists would have been
## as an alternative socio-economic organisation and path of
                economic development. Before evaluating the pure anarchists’
                proposals, however, we first need to summarise the principal
## features of the communes as we identified them in earlier
## chapters. They were seen as small-scale communities, much
## reduced in size and population when compared to existing
                nation-states. For example, Miyazaki Akira suggested in Appeal
## to the Farmers that a country of Japan’s size would become

                ‘several hundred or so communal societies’.[412] Reduced to
                this scale, each commune would function largely on the basis
                of face-to-face relationships, without the need for extensive
                representation and certainly eliminating the possibility that a
                self-serving bureaucracy would emerge. Libertarian federation
                was expected to be the organisational principle observed both
## within the commune and between communes. By such means,
## the communes would prevent any centralised body from
                taking shape and imposing its decisions on the rest of society. It
                was argued that in this practical manner, the state could be
## eliminated and liberty guaranteed.

## Turning from the ‘politics’ of anarchist communism to the
                organisation of its ‘economy’, the land and all other means of
## production were to be owned communally, thereby entitling
## each member of the commune to lake freely from the common
## wealth. Production would be undertaken neither to meet the
                requirements of a market, nor in order to fulfil the norms laid
                down in a centrally devised plan. Rather, people would engage
## in both cooperative and individual production within the
## commune in which they lived so as to satisfy their freely
## determined consumption needs in the manner that was most
## congenial for them. The division of labour, both within the
## commune and between communes, would be consciously
## avoided in order to prevent the emergence of the power
## relations which inevitably accompany it. Since each commune
                would aim at economic self-sufficiency, there would be a mix of
                agriculture and industry, which would manifest itself both in
                the life of the commune as a whole and in the lifestyles of its
## individual members. Men, women and children were expected

## to become well-rounded individuals with many aptitudes and
                interests. rather than narrow specialists locked into a particular
## profession and perpetually practising a single skill.

## The above is intended as only a brief summary of arguments
## which have been well rehearsed throughout this book. One
                final point is worth re-emphasising, however. This is the crucial
                role which communal solidarity was expected to play. Anarchist
## communism as the pure anarchists envisaged it was expected
                to flourish not simply because the correct institutions had been
## set up or the goal of production had been redefined. By
## themselves these were only the dry skeleton of the proposed
                new society. What would animate it, put flesh on its bones and
## send blood surging through its arteries was communal
                solidarity. Bonds of affection and comradeship were expected
                to unite the commune, thereby providing all its members with
## physical and emotional security, and at the same time
                predisposing them to identify their own individual well-being
## with the common good.

## When considering the feasibility of the social system
## advocated by the pure anarchists, we need to be clear about
                the criteria against which it should be measured. It would, for
## example, be unreasonable to demand that it be assessed
                against such yardsticks of a capitalist economy as annual rate
                of growth, balance of trade and so forth. This is not only for the
## obvious reason that since anarchist communism was never put
                into practice, there are no data available for comparing and
                contrasting its economic performance with capitalism’s. If this
## were the only obstacle to gauging anarchist communism’s
## economic performance in terms of capitalism’s criteria, it

## might be possible to come up with a computer simulation of
                such an ‘economy’ and estimate its likely productive efficiency
                relative to that achieved by capitalism at an equivalent stage
## of technological development. However, evaluating anarchist
## communism by means of the criteria which have been devised
## to measure capitalism’s performance does not make sense for
## more fundamental reasons, which arc both philosophical and
## technical In nature.

                To take the philosophical reason first, capitalism is first and
                foremost an economic system. Its raison d’être is to achieve
## economics, in the sense of minimising economic inputs and
## maximising economic outputs. To the extent that this
## endeavour meets with success, profits are realised and
## economic indicators such as Gross National Product (GNP)
## register positive growth rates. Given capitalism’s
                overwhelmingly economic orientation, it is not surprising that,
## while it is acutely sensitive to the slightest fluctuations
## registered on an assortment of economic performance
                indicators, such as rate of growth and return on investment, it
                is notoriously ill equipped to take non-economic factors into
## account. In recent years many Greens have remarked on
## capitalism’s inability to handle problems such as the
                destruction of the environment, since these are not calculable
## in the only terms capitalism readily understands—the onesided, economic criteria of profit and loss. For similar reasons,
                capitalism would be no less baffled if it were demanded that it
## assess its operations against the performance indicators to
## which the pure anarchists attached most importance, such as
## personal liberty, communal solidarity and the individual’s

## unconditional right to free consumption. Faced with such
## demands, capitalism would either have to admit that these
## were not yardsticks against which it could sensibly measure
## itself or it would have to resort to the type of grotesque
## ideological subterfuges which it often employs, such as
                identifying human liberty with the market and therefore with
## wage slavery.

                This philosophical argument cuts both ways. Just as it would be
## unreasonable to impose on capitalism performance indicators
                which are alien to its very nature and purpose, so we have to
## evaluate pure anarchism against its own declared objectives
## and not against criteria derived from capitalism. The pure
## anarchists’ confidence in the alternative society they
## advocated derived not from an expectation that it would
## quantitatively outperform capitalism in terms of GNP,
                productivity or similar capitalist criteria. On the contrary, their
## enthusiasm for anarchist communism flowed from their
## understanding that it would be qualitatively different from
                capitalism. Of course, this is not to say that the pure anarchists
                were indifferent to questions of production and distribution. As
                we have seen, they had distinctive proposals to make in these
## areas and they certainly believed that anarchist communism
## would provide economic well-being for all. But neither were
                they prepared to give priority to narrowly conceived economic
                expansion, to the neglect of individual liberty and communal
## solidarity, as capitalism regularly does.

## The technical reason why anarchist communism, even if it
## could be simulated by computer, could not be evaluated by
                reference to capitalist criteria is that it was intended to be a

## moneyless society which would not employ a universal
## equivalent for measuring economic value. A capitalist state
                can quantify the sum total of economic activity occurring on its
                territory because all goods and services have economic values
                attributed to them, which are expressible in common monetary
## units. The pure anarchists had no need for money in the new
                society they sought to achieve, since the abolition of exchange
                relations would have made it superfluous. Similarly, since the
## inhabitants of an anarchist communist society would have
                been interested only in the physical and aesthetic qualities of
## the goods they produced, they would have been entirely
## indifferent to (indeed, would have regarded with
                incomprehension) the proposition that articles had a ‘value’
## separate from these qualities. This is not to imply that
## anarchist communists would have regressed to a level of
                statistical illiteracy. Clearly, the communes could have been
                expected to employ calculating techniques in all of the many
## fields of production and distribution in which they were
                engaged. But this would have been calculation in physical units
                (weight, volume, length, etc.) to which further computation in a
## common, monetary unit would have added nothing. Hence the
## point hardly needs to be laboured that, in the absence of
## money, GNP and similar measurements of economic value
                would have been inappropriate and, indeed, impossible.[413]

## Having established that the feasibility of an anarchist
## communist society cannot be assessed by employing
                performance indicators which are tailored to meet capitalism’s
## requirements, we can now evaluate it against those criteria
                which reflect its own priorities. Appropriate yardsticks would be

                the extent to which it could have provided for individual liberty
## and communal solidarity, and the extent to which it might
## reasonably have been expected to achieve economic well-
## being for all at the same time that it dissociated personal
                consumption from the individual’s productive contribution to
## society.

## As far as individual liberty and communal solidarity are
## concerned, there is every likelihood that an anarchist
## communist society could have successfully combined these
## two in a way which would have put contemporary Japanese
                capitalism to shame. It is reasonable to draw this conclusion
                because even a few moments’ reflection reveals that anarchist
## communism would have removed the main impediments to
## liberty in interwar Japan. During the interwar period and
                through to 1945, Japan was a despotic society where power lay
                in the hands of the upper echelons of the military, the state
## bureaucracy and the industrial conglomerates. The state
                pursued policies. such as military expansion and the promotion
## of heavy industry, which reflected the ambitions of these
                powerful interests but which cost the bulk of the population
                dearly in terms of material deprivation and ultimately blood. It
## is inconceivable that ordinary working men and women would
## have voluntarily subjected themselves to the degree of
## economic privation which millions experienced in interwar
                Japan in order to achieve objectives, such as building up heavy
                industry, which brought them no tangible returns. Similarly, it
                is equally far-fetched to imagine that millions of young men
## from impoverished villages and urban shuns would have
                voluntarily departed in order to kill and be killed on distant

## battlefields, whose geographical location they often barely
## comprehended, for reasons which bore no relation to the
                welfare of their communities at home. The fact is that millions
## of workers and farmers worked themselves into early graves,
                or threw away their young lives in battle, for goals which were
## not their own but which served the purposes of unscrupulous
                minorities who held the levers of power. These policies had to
## be imposed on the majority by the usual combination of
## coercive force and ideological mystification. Coercion was
                provided for by wide-ranging repressive legislation, such as the
## notorious Peace Preservation Law of 1925, which aimed to
                suppress all who sought to change Japan’s constitutional order,
## form of government or property system. This was enforced by
                the various arms of the state. such as the regular police, the
                special branch and the military police, although it should also
## be added that these forces were never overly concerned
                whether their repressive activities were legally sanctioned or
                not. Needless to say, ideological mystification took the form of
## the myths spun round the person of the Emperor. Once those
## wielding power had contrived to present their policies as
                expressions of the ‘imperial will’, all discussion was blocked off.

## did so at their peril.

                As for communal solidarity, throughout the interwar years this
## was increasingly eroded by the spread of economic
                competition and the strains induced by impoverishment. In the
                cities, workers competed to sell their labour power amidst the
                insecurity created by economic uncertainty and the perpetual
                fluctuations in the level of unemployment. In addition, urban

## workers were further divided against one another as
## employers played off males against females and ‘regular’
                employees against those relegated to ‘external’ or ‘temporary’
## status. Even in the villages, the heavy burden of taxation
                meant that peasants who could not pay their taxes lost their
## land and were reduced to renting a few tan from a landlord.
                [414] Under such circumstances. friction between those better
                off and those worse off, and particularly between landlords and
## tenant farmers, strained the traditional harmony of the
## agricultural communities. Despite what the ideologues of
                capitalism might say, none of this was due to quirks of human
                nature or a genetic predisposition to contend. Competition and
                contention were learnt behaviour, induced by a social system
## which set people against one another and which worked in
                such a fashion that the prosperity of the few depended on the
## deprivation of the many.

## It is no exaggeration to say that, had anarchist communism
                been achieved in the interwar years, it would have eliminated
                at one stroke the existing curtailments on individual liberty and
## the factors which were undermining communal solidarity. One
                can say this with confidence because the pure anarchists made
## no secret of the fact that they intended to dissolve the
                industrial conglomerates, dismantle the state bureaucracy and
## break up the military machine. Had these revolutionary
## changes been carried out, there would no longer have been
                powerful and privileged strata with interests different from
## those of the masses of the people, nor would they have been
## provided with any means to pursue their interests at the
## expense of the people. Both state and imperial institutions

## would have been swept away. leaving the people free to lead
                an independent and self-reliant existence in their communes,
## without any coercive or mystifying interference by outside
## forces. Decentralisation would have removed the scourge of
## war. since no commune would have been powerful enough to
                engage in the type of armed aggression for which the Japanese
## military was notorious. Furthermore, decentralisation would
                have introduced an additional safeguard against the possibility
## that war might have been undertaken by a federation of
## communes acting jointly. This safeguard was the deterrent
                inherent in a decentralised decision-making structure, where
                the gap between those taking the decisions and those carrying
## them out has been closed. Wars are invariably declared by
                those who are well insulated from their effects, not by those
## who have to risk life and limb in the fighting. Since the
## commune system would have removed the distinction
                between those deciding policy and those putting it into effect,
## people’s natural reluctance to expose themselves to the
## dangers and hardships of war would have been a powerful
                check on military aggression. Similarly, by eliminating stateimposed taxes, private property in land and other resources,

## communism would have eradicated the sources of
## impoverishment, competition and contention within society,

## Even if it is thus a reasonable conjecture that the society
                favoured by the pure anarchists could have met its objective of
                combining individual liberty with communal solidarity, this still
                leaves the question of economic well-being to be considered.
## Without a sufficient supply of consumer goods and services,
## liberty would soon have worn thin and solidarity would soon
## have been jeopardised. The pure anarchists were as aware of
                this as their critics and yet they still proposed to abolish largescale production in urban locations and switch to small-scale
## workshops set among the fields of the decentralised
                communes. As if this were not inefficient enough, when judged
## by capitalism’s standards, they also intended to rely on an
## entirely voluntary system of labour and dispense with any
## mechanism, such as wages, which would require people to
## earn the wherewithal to consume. How likely was it that
## economic well-being could have been achieved under such
## circumstances?

                The first point to make is that urban industry in interwar Japan
## was not primarily engaged in production to satisfy consumer
## demand among the bulk of the population. Relatively few of
                the products of large-scale industry found their way into the
                households of either the urban workers or the farmers in the
                villages. Throughout most of the interwar period industry was
## dominated by textile production, which was heavily skewed
## towards overseas markets and accounted for the bulk of
                Japan’s exports. Although the percentage of textile workers in
                the total workforce in the factories fell from 55 per cent in 1929
                to 41 per cent in 1936, textiles still accounted for 52 per cent of
                all Japan’s exports in the mid-1930s.[415] Being such an

## export-oriented sector, the textile industry was totally at
                variance with the pure anarchist principles of self-sufficiency
## and self-support. Hence closing down the large mills in the
## course of an anarchist communist reorganisation of society
## would not have had the detrimental effect that those
                accustomed to thinking along capitalist lines might imagine.
                Moreover, the relative decline in importance of textiles as the
                1930s progressed was due to a shift towards industries which
## were even further removed from ordinary people’s
## requirements, but which served instead the interests of the
## Japanese state as it prepared for all-out war. For example,
## during the period when the pure anarchists were locked in
                struggle with the capitalist state, industries such as metals and
## machinery, shipbuilding, and iron and steel all expanded by
                more than 300 per cent.[416] Once again, few if any of the
## products of such industries were destined for ordinary
## households and therefore shutting the enterprises which
## produced them would not have reduced the standard of living
## of the majority of the people. On the contrary, the pure
                anarchists were probably correct in their belief that it was
## encouraging workers with industrial skills and mechanical
                expertise to relocate in the villages which would have had a
                beneficial effect on general living standards. It was judged that,
## by setting up small-scale workshops in the communes, and by
                bringing people from industrial and agricultural backgrounds
                into intimate contact with one another, a ready supply could be
## obtained of farming implements, household goods, means of
                transport, and so forth, which precisely matched the needs of
                the local population. There was nothing inherently unrealistic
## about the pure anarchists’ confidence that the products of

## communal workshops could have enriched ordinary people’s
                lives immeasurably more than the often inappropriate (not to
## mention prohibitively expensive) commodities manufactured
## by large-scale industry in remote, urban locations.

                As for the pure anarchists’ plans to abolish the wages system
## and free consumption from monetary constraints, these are
                bound to jar against the prejudices of supporters of capitalism.
## Capitalism is underpinned by an ideology of human nature
                which asserts that no-one will work unless forced to do so by
## mechanisms such as the wages system and that greed is
## unlimited unless held in check by devices such as pricing.
                Obviously, the pure anarchists disagreed with such a patently
                un historical view of unchanging ‘human nature’. They argued
## that even within capitalism much human behaviour does not
                conform to this pattern, but that within the tightly knit and
## mutually supportive environment of the communes people
## would behave in a fashion which would expose the capitalist
## view of human nature as an ideological caricature. The pure
## anarchists did not pretend that men and women would
## suddenly become angels once anarchist communism was
## achieved. All they were suggesting was that work is a
                physiological need which people would be free to satisfy under
                conditions of comradeship, diversity and self-regulation in the
## alternative society provided by the communes. From the pure
                anarchists’ standpoint, the fact that capitalism’s supporters
## conceive of work as an activity in which people will engage
                only when forced to do so tells us infinitely more about wage
## labour and the nature of capitalist employment than it does
## about work per se or the nature of humans. Similarly, the

## equally ideological claims by supporters of capitalism that
                desires are infinite and that consumption will run riot unless
                held in check by monetary constraints tell us much more about
## the sick behaviour induced by capitalism than they do about
## the innate capacity of humans to consume. Not only is it
## blatantly ideological to talk about ‘infinite’ desire when
## physical reasons alone make that impossible but, as Hatta
                Shūzō argued persuasively (see Chapter 6), in a society which
## encouraged human solidarity, the bonds of comradeship and
                affection which united people could be expected to bring the
                individual’s perception of plenty into line with the level of
## consumption that a commune could support.

## In addition to the changes in attitudes towards work and
## consumption which have already been mentioned, neither
## should one overlook several other factors which would come
                into play in an anarchist communist society. In a society where
## production was consciously geared to the needs of the local
## population, where people no longer worked to enrich
## capitalists and landlords, and where the labour process was
## directly controlled by the producers themselves. one could
## reasonably expect a level of enthusiasm and interest which
## could never be achieved under conditions of capitalist
## alienation. One way in which people’s new-found enthusiasm
                for, and interest in, production would very likely be felt would
                be as a surge of experimentation and inventiveness. It is also
                important to remember the fact that within existing society in
## the interwar years whole sections of the population and
## enormous resources were committed to activities which are
## essential to capitalism but which would become entirely

## redundant with the achievement of anarchist communism. The
                vastly wasteful armed forces might be the example which first
## comes to mind, but to these could be added the legions of
                bureaucrats, police and lawyers which capitalist states require,
## or most working in sectors of the economy such as banking,
## insurance and advertising, to name only a few. Once one
                considers the implications of integrating the millions of such
## people into productive activity, the pure anarchist goal of
                achieving economic well-being for all becomes an increasingly
                realistic proposition. The failure of the pure anarchists to realise
                their vision of a new society can then be seen to have been due
                to the power of the state against which they struggled, their
                inability to win sufficient workers and farmers over to their
                point of view, and the difficulty of getting their message across
                internationally. Il was not due to any intrinsic lack of feasibility
## in their plans for social reorganisation along anarchist
## communist lines.

                To come down on the side of the pure anarchists’ proposals for
## realising anarchist communism is not to imply that their
                concept of an alternative society was entirely free of problems.
                One such problem was localism. The unit of the future society
## was seen as the autonomous commune, whose members
## would form a tightly knit community and which, as far as
## possible, was intended to be economically self-supporting.
## Hatta’s reasons for stressing communal autonomy and for
## avoiding a division of labour within society have been
                explained in detail, but it should be recognised that, in rightly
                establishing a link between economic specialisation and power
                relations, he probably went too far in the opposite direction. In

## other words, he neglected the danger posed by the emergence
                of strong local identities and loyalties in a society based on
## communes. Such attitudes already existed in the farming
                villages and there was a distinct possibility that, without taking
                conscious steps to head off the danger, the conversion of the
                villages into self-sufficient communes would have accentuated
                this localism further. The threat which this would have posed to
## anarchist communism as the pure anarchists envisaged it
                should not be underestimated. Since natural resources are not
                spread evenly, strict adherence to economic self-sufficiency
                would soon have led to significant differences in the standards
## of living achieved in different communes. This would have
## been a source of enmity, from which it would have been only
## one step further for poorer communes to have resorted to
## force in an attempt to redress the balance, or for better
## endowed communes to have used their advantage to
                subjugate others. Had this been the case, such actions would
## no doubt have been accompanied by an ideology of localism
                which would have been every bit as pernicious as nationalism
                or racialism. Incidental differences of style, speech or whatever
## would have been rationalised as evidence of superiority or
                inferiority and the whole basis of anarchist communism would
## have been undermined.

## To prevent these developments from occurring, pure
## anarchism would have needed to be modified in two respects.
## In the first place, it should have been recognised that the
## achievement of anarchist communism required a more
                significant leap in the realm of ideas than most pure anarchists
## allowed for. Whereas the pure anarchists generally

266 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                acknowledged that the process of ‘becoming an anarchist’ was
## a major step, which involved throwing off capitalism’s
## ideological domination and embracing a new view of society,
                they assumed that it was only a minority of activists who had
## to undergo the traumatic soul-searching which such a
## fundamental restructuring of one’s ideas involved. It was
                asserted that the majority of the population, who lived in the
## farming villages, had no need to tread this difficult path
                because they already led lives of ‘natural anarchism’. In the
                light of the danger posed by localism one can see that this was
## wrong. Anarchist communism is a universalist creed which
## demands the liberation of humankind as a whole. Thus it
                contains within itself an antidote to the poison of mean-spirited
## localism which could otherwise infect a society based on
## communes. However, for this to take effect, the communes
## would need to be populated by conscious anarchist
## communists, who were committed to the equality and the
                liberty of all humankind, and not by people who, for the most
                part, had never experienced the painful struggle to internalise
                the values of anarchist communism. To put it another way, one
## condition which anarchist communism would have had to
                meet, if it were not to degenerate rapidly into localism, was a
## revolution based on mass understanding of the nature and
## purpose of the new society. This was a far cry from Hatta’s
                concept of revolution, according to which ‘the creative violence
                of a minority’ of conscious activists was sufficient to spur into
## action a majority whose practice of ‘natural anarchism’ was
## local in the extreme.

## In the second place, some modification would have been

                needed to the principle of communal self-sufficiency. It is true
                that, as I have mentioned before, the pure anarchists did not
## make a fetish out of autarky and were prepared to
## contemplate, at the margins of economic life, giving and
## receiving (as distinct from exchange) relations between
## communes. Yet in their concern for avoiding the division of
                labour at all costs, they paid insufficient attention to the need
                to compensate for local deficiencies with supplies from outside
## in order to avoid marked discrepancies in living standards.
                Furthermore, they overlooked the extent to which this flow of
                products between communes (even if confined to a minority of
## economic activity) would need to be regularised. To take a
## concrete example, not every commune could have its own
## copper mine. In cases where there was no readily available
                local supply, the advantage of using copper would need to be
## weighed against the disadvantages of doing without, using a
## less satisfactory substitute or becoming dependent on an
                outside source. The choice would rest with each commune, but
                it would seem reasonable to argue, as a general rule of thumb,
## that there need be no fundamental risk to anarchist
## communism if communes made even regular use of some
## outside supplies, providing the bulk of production and
                distribution remained intra-communal and providing also that
## communes remained permanently alert to the danger of over-
## reliance on external sources and retained a psychological
                readiness to do without if needs be. To stick to the example of
## copper, Murray Bookchin (b. 1921) made some points which
## are relevant to this discussion when he wrote in 1965 in an
                essay ‘Towards a Liberatory Technology’:
268 of 298 3/17/25, 5:08 PM Hatta Shūzō and Pure Anarchism in Interwar Japan | T... about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
                ... let us grant that copper will fall within the sizeable category
                of material that can be furnished only by a nationwide system
                of distribution. In what sense need there be a division of labor
                in the current sense of the term? There need be none at all.
                First, copper can be distributed, together with other goods,
## among free, autonomous communities, be they those that
                mine it or those that require it. This distribution system need
## not require the mediation of centralized bureaucratic
## institutions. Second, and perhaps more significant, a
                community that lives in a region with ample copper resources
## would not be a mere mining community. Copper mining would
## be one of the many economic activities in which it was
                engaged—a part of a larger, rounded, organic economic arena.
## The same would hold for communities whose climate was
                most suitable for growing specialized foods or whose resources
                were rare and uniquely valuable to society as a whole. Every
## community would approximate local or regional autarky. It
## would seek to achieve wholeness, because wholeness
## produces complete, rounded men who live in symbiotic
## relationship with their environment. Even if a substantial
## portion of the economy fell within the sphere of a national
                division of labor, the overall economic weight of society would
                still rest with the community.[417]

## The balance which Bookchin struck here between basic
## economic self-sufficiency which is tempered by a limited
## intercommunal flow of otherwise unobtainable products
                conforms to the essence of pure anarchism. At the same time,
                it could prevent the emergence of significant discrepancies in
                living standards and the localist reaction which these could

## provoke.

                Mention of Murray Bookchin brings me to the final point I wish
                to make in this study of Hatta Shūzō and pure anarchism. Pure
## anarchism was not simply a missed historical opportunity of
                the interwar era. After lying all but dormant or many years,
                anarchist communism has recently stirred to life again in the
## form of ‘ecological anarchism’. Faced with the threat of
## environmental catastrophe, a reaction by some Greens has
                been to resurrect the idea of a society of decentralised and
                largely self-sufficient communes. As one writer has put it: ‘The
## classic ecocentric proposal is the self-reliant community
                modelled on anarchist lines.’[418] When ‘ecological anarchists’
                such as Bookchin maintain that ‘a national division of labor and
## industrial centralization are dangerous because technology
                begins to transcend the human scale; it becomes increasingly
## incomprehensible and lends itself to bureaucratic
## manipulation’ or that ‘workers’ control, long favoured by
                syndicalist tendencies in opposition to nationalized economies,
                has serious limitations of its own’, they are quite unconsciously
## echoing arguments which were advanced many decades
                earlier, often with considerable theoretical sophistication, by
                Hatta and other pure anarchists.[419] Since the pure
## anarchists’ vision of anarchist communism thus anticipated
## recent proposals for achieving an ecologically balanced
## society, their relevance to modern Greens is obvious and
                constitutes another reason for making their ideas available to a
                Western audience by means of this study.[420] Of course, the
## writings of Bookchin and other ‘ecological anarchists’ have
                been dismissed as utopian, just as Hatta’s were previously. But

                if a decentralised society of libertarian communes is a utopia, it
                is a utopia which surfaces repeatedly in various guises and in
                different historical periods, suggesting that it corresponds to
## certain deeply felt needs of humankind which capitalism is
## perennially unable to satisfy. Besides which, the charge of
                utopianism is a twin-edged sword, anyway. For as Oscar Wilde
                (1856–1900) reminded us, ‘progress is the realisation of
                Utopias’.[421]

## Great Kantō Earthquake, Furukawa Tokio argued that the
                Japanese anarchists ‘constantly warned about the tendency for
## the labour unions to compromise and to regard themselves as
## almighty (bannōshugiteki). They pointed out that the very
## existence of the cities makes centralised power necessary.
## They emphasised that the movement of the city workers
                should be a movement which rejects the capitalist system, the
## collectivist system. Instead it should be a movement for
                constructing a libertarian federation system of decentralised
## local production. And Kokushoku Seinen was the one which
## devoted the most energy to this.’ (<em>Nihon Museifushugi
