            Introduction
              It’is not widely known to the general reader that the largest movement in
            pre-Franco Spain was greatly inﬂuenced by Anarchist ideas. In 1936, on the
            eve of the Spanish Civil War, approximately a million people were members of
            the Anarchosyndicalist CNT (Confederation National del Trabajo, or National
            Confederation of Labor)—an immense following if one bears in mind that the
            Spanish population numbered only twenty-four million. Until the victory of
            Franco, the CNT remained one of the largest labor federations in Spain.
              Barcelona, then the largest industrial city in Spain, became an
            Anarchosyndicalist enclave within the republic. Its working class,
            overwhelmingly committed to the CNT, established a far-reaching system of
            syndicalist self-management. Factories, utilities, transport facilities, even
            retail and wholesale enterprises, were taken over and administered by
            workers’ committees and unions. The city itself was policed by a part-time
            guard of workingmen and justice was meted out by popular revolutionary
            tribunals. Nor was Barcelona alone in this radical reconstruction of economic
            and social life; the movement, in varying degrees, embraced Valencia,
            Malaga, CNT-controlled factories in the large Basque industrial cities, and
            smaller communities such as Lleida, Alcoy, Granollers, Girona, and Rubi.
              Many of the land laborers and peasants of Andalusia were also Anarchist in
            outlook. During the ﬁrst few weeks of the Civil War, before the south of Spain
            was overrun by fascist armies, these rural people established communal
            systems of land tenure, in some cases abolishing the use of money for internal
            transactions, establishing free, communistic systems of production and
            distribution, and creating a decision-making procedure based on popular
            assemblies and direct, face-to-face democracy. Perhaps even more signiﬁcant
            were the well-organized Anarchist collectives in Republican-held areas of
            Aragon, which were grouped into a network under the Council of Aragon,
            largely under the control of the CNT. Collectives tended to predominate in
            many areas of Catalonia and the Levant, and were common even in Socialistcontrolled Castile.
              These experiences alone, so challenging to popular notions of a libertarian
            society as an unworkable utopia, would warrant a book on Spanish
            Anarchism. But they also have a certain intrinsic interest. To anyone with a
            concern for novel social forms, the Anarchist collectives of Spain raise many
            fascinating questions: how were the collective farms and factories
            established? How well did they work? Did they create, any administrative
            diﬀiculties? These collectives, moreover, were not mere experiments created
            by idle dreamers; they emerged from a dramatic social revolution that was to
            mark the climax—and tragic end—of the traditional workers’ movement.
            Highlighting the reconstructive eﬀorts of the Anarchists was the Spanish Civil
            War itself, an unforgettable conﬂict that was to last nearly three’ bitter years,
            claim an estimated million lives, and stir the deepest passions of people

            throughout the world.
               No less signiﬁcant was the development of the Spanish Anarchist movement
            from the 1870s to the mid-1930s—its forms of organization, its inﬂuence on
            the lives of ordinary workers and peasants, its internal conﬂicts, and its varied
            fortunes. For Spanish Anarchism remained above all a peoples’ movement,
            reﬂecting the cherished ideals, dreams, and values of ordinary individuals, not
            an esoteric credo and tightly knit professional party far removed from the
            everyday experiences of the villager and factory Worker. The resiliency and
            tenacity that-kept Spanish Anarchism alive in urban barrios and rural pueblos
            for nearly seventy years, despite unrelenting persecution, is understandable
            only if we view this movement as an expression of plebian Spanish society
            itself rather than as a body of exotic libertarian doctrines.
               The present volume (the ﬁrst of two that will trace the history of the
            movement up to the current period) is primarily concerned with the
            organizational and social issues that marked the years of Spanish Anarchism’s
            ascendency and, ﬁnally, of its drift toward civil war—a span of time I have
            designated as its “heroic period.” Despite the fascination that the collectives
            of 1936–39 hold for us, I believe it is immensely rewarding to explore how
            ordinary workers and peasants for nearly three generations managed to build
            the combative organizations that formed the underpinning of these
            collectives; how they managed to claim for themselves and incorporate in
            their everyday lives revolutionary societies and unions that we normally
            relegate to the work place and the political sphere. Quite as signiﬁcant in my
            eyes are the organizational structures, so libertarian in character, that made
            it possible for workers and peasants to participate in these societies and
            unions, to exercise extraordinary control over their policies, and to gain for
            themselves a new sense of personality and inner individual strength.
            Whatever our views of Spanish Anarchism, it has far too much to teach us to
            remain so little known to the general reader, and it is primarily for this reader
            that I have written the present volume.
               To a certain extent I have been researching the materials for this book since
            the early 1960s. In 1967 I began systematically to gather data with a view
            toward writing it during a lengthy trip to Europe, where I interviewed exiled
            Spanish Anarchists. The present volume was almost entirely completed by
            1969. At that time virtually no literature existed in English on Spanish
            Anarchism except for Gerald Brenan’s empathetic but rather dncomplete
            accounts in The Spanish Labyrinth and the largely personal narratives of
            Franz Borkenau and George Orwell. Apart from these works, the scanty
            references to the Spanish Anarchists in English seemed appallingly
            insensitive to the ideals of a very sizable section of the Spanish people. Even
            today, most of the works on Spain by conservative, liberal, and Marxist
            writers oﬀer no serious appraisal of the libertarian viewpoint and exhibit
            shocking malice toward its so-called “extreme” wing as represented by the
            Anarchist action groups. It may well be felt by many students of Spanish
            Anarchism that I have gone to another extreme. Perhaps—but it seemed
            especially important to me, whatever my personal reservations, that the
            voices of these groups be expressed with a greater degree of understanding
            than they have generally received.
               The Spanish Civil War, in fact, was very much part of my own life and
3 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            aﬀected me more deeply than any other conﬂict in a lifetime that has seen a
            terrible international war and the decades of nearly chronic warfare that
            followed it. My sympathies, indeed my Utter devotion, lay with the Spanish
            left, which I initially identiﬁed as a very young man with the Communist Party
            and, later, as the Civil War came to its terrible close, with the POUM (Partido
            Obrero de Uniﬁcation Marxista). By the late 1950s, however, I had become
            more informed about Spanish Anarchism, a movement that had been little
            known to American radicals of the 1930s, and began to study its origins and
            trajectory. As one who had lived through the Spanish Civil War period, indeed,
            who vividly recalled the uprising of the Asturian miners in October 1934,1
            thought it all the more necessary to correct the false image that, if it existed
            in my mind, almost certainly existed in the minds of my less politically
            involved contemporaries. Thus this book is in part a rediscovery of a
            magniﬁcent historic experience that culminated in a deeply moving tragedy. I
            have tried to oﬀer at least an understanding voice to those liberty-loving
            people who marched, fought, and died by the thousands under the black-andred banners of Spanish Anarchosyndicalism, to pay a fair tribute to their
            idealism without removing their organizations from the light of wellintentioned criticism.
              Another, more contemporary factor motivated me to write this book. The
            appearance of the black ﬂag of Anarchism in the streets of Paris and many
            American cities during the 1960s, the strong anarchistic sentiments of radical
            youth during that fervent decade, and the wide interest in Anarchist theories
            that exists today, seem to warrant an account and evaluation of the largest
            organized Anarchist movement to appear in our century. There are many
            diﬀerences, to be sure, between the Anarchist movement of Spain and the
            anarchistic currents that seemed to ﬂow in the youth revolt of the 1960s.
            Spanish Anarchism was rooted in an era of material scarcity; its essential
            thrust was directed against the poverty and exploitation that had reduced
            millions of Spanish workers and peasants to near-animal squalor. Not
            surprisingly, the Spanish Anarchists saw the world through puritanical lenses.
            Living in a society where little was available for all to enjoy, they excoriated
            the dissoluteness of the ruling classes as grossly immoral. They reacted to the
            opulence and idleness of the wealthy with a stem ethical credo that
            emphasized duty, the jesponsibility of all to work, and a disdain for the
            pleasures of the ﬂesh.
              The anarchistic youth of the 1960s, on the other hand, held diametrically
            opposite views. Raised in an era of dazzling advances in technology and
            productivity, they questioned the need for toil and the renunciation of
            pleasure. Their credos were sensuous and hedonistic. Whether they were
            conscious of tradition or not, their plea for enlarging experience seemed to
            echo the writings of Sade, Lautreamont, fhe Dadaists, and the surrealists
            rather than those of the “classical” Anarchists of a century ago.
              Yet when I started this book, I could not help feeling that an aging Spanish
            Anarchist easily could have communicated with the revolutionary youth of the
            1960s and with the ecologically oriented young people of today. In contrast to
            Marxian movements, Spanish Anarchism placed a strong emphasis on lifestyle: on a total remaking of fhe individual along libertarian lines. It deeply
            valued spontaneity, passion, and initiative from below. And it thoroughly
4 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            detested authority and hierarchy m any form. Despite its stern moral outlook,
            Spanish Anarchism opposed the marriage ceremony as a bourgeois sham,
            advocating instead a free union of partners, and it regarded sexual practices
            as a private aﬀair, governable only by a respect for the rights of women. One
            must know the Spain of the 1930s, with its strong patriarchal traditions, to
            recognize what a bold departure Anarchist practices represented from the
            norms of even the poorest, most exploited, and most neglected classes in the
            country.
               Above all, Spanish Anarchism was vitally experimental. The Summerhtlltype schools of recent memory were the direct heirs of experiments in
            libertarian education initiated by Spanish intellectuals who had been
            nourished by Anarchist ideals. The concept of living close to nature lent
            Spanish Anarchism some of its most unique features—vegetarian diets, often
            favoring uncooked foods; ecological horticulture; simplicity of dress; a passion
            for the countryside; even nudism—but such expressions of “naturalism” also
            became the subject of much buﬀoonery in the Spanish press of the time (and
            of condescending disdain on the part of many present-day academicians). The
            movement was keenly preoccupied with all the concrete details of a future
            libertarian society. Spanish Anarchists avidly discussed almost every change a
            revolution could.be expected to make in their daily lives, and many of them
            immediately translated precept into practice as far as this was humanly
            possible. Thousands of Spanish Anarchists altered their diets and abandoned
            such habit-forming “vices” as cigarette-smoking and drinking. Many became
            proﬁcient in Esperanto in the conviction that, after the revolution, all national
            barriers would fall away and human beings would speak a common language
            and share a common cultural tradition.
               This high sense of community and solidarity gave rise to the Anarchist
            “aﬀinity group,” an organizational form based not merely on political or
            ideological ties, but often on close friendship and deep personal involvement.
            In a movement that called for the use of direct action, Anarchist groups
            produced individuals of unusual character and striking boldness. To be sure, I
            would not want these remarks to create the impression that the Spanish
            Anarchist movement was a revolutionary crusade of uncompromising, morally
            unblemished “saints.” Like all organizations in Spain, the movement had its
            fair share of self-seeking opportunists who betrayed its libertarian ideals in
            critical moments of struggle. But what made it unique, even in a land where
            courage and dignity have always been highly prized, were those remarkable
            personalities like Fermin Salvochea, Anselmo Lorenzo, and Buenaventura
            Durruti, who literally personiﬁed diﬀerent aspects of its temperament and
            libertarian ideals. It has been my good fortune to meet some of the best living
            representatives of this movement in their places of exile and to gain their
            assistance in gathering material for this book.
               I do not claim to have written an exhaustive account of Spanish Anarchism.
            For an author to make such a claim would require the backing of several
            volumes. The scholarly literature consists of sizable works that deal with
            periods of a decade or less, a literature that is not likely to command the
            attention of the general reader. Accordingly, I have chosen to dwell upon the
            turning points of the movement, especially those moments of social creativity
            which are likely to have importance for our own time. I have also tried to tell
5 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            the story of the more outstanding Spanish Anarchists: the saint-like ascetics
            and ﬁery pistoleros, the deﬁant terrorists and plodding organizers, the
            scholarly theorists and untutored activists.
               The Spanish Civil War came to an end almost forty years ago. The
            generation that was so deeply involved ih its aﬀairs, whether in Spain itself or
            abroad, is passing away. A real danger exists that the passions aroused by this
            immense conﬂict will disappear in the future literature on the subject. And
            without that passion, it will be diﬀicult to appraise the largest popular
            movement in the conﬂict—the Spanish Anarchists—for it was a movement that
            made spiritual demands of its adherents that are often incomprehensible
            today. Leaving aside the changes in life-style I’ve already noted, I should
            emphasize that to be an Anarchist in Spain, indeed, to be a radical generally
            in the 1930s, meant that one was uncompromisingly opposed to the
            established order. Even Socialists retained this high sense of revolutionary
            principle, in Spain and in many other countings, despite the reformism of the
            Communist and Social Democratic parties. To participate in bourgeois
            cabinets, for example, earned one the epithet of “Millerandism,” a harshly
            derogatory term which referred to the unprecedented entry of the French
            Socialist Millerand into a bourgeois cabinet prior to the First World War.
               Today, an ecumenical reformism is taken for granted by virtually the entire
            left. If the word “Millerandism” has been dropped from the political
            vocabulary of the left, it is not because revolutionary “purity” has been
            restored in the major workers’ parties but, quite to the contrary, because the
            practice is too widespread to require an opprobrious designation. The term
            “libertarian,” devised by French Anarchists to deal with the harsh antiAnarchist legislation at the end of the last century, has lost virtually all its
            revolutionary meaning. The word “Anarchist” itself becomes meaningless
            when it is used as a selfdescription by political dilettantes so light-minded
            that they move in and out of authoritarian or reformistic organizations as
            casually as they change a brand of bread or coﬀee. Contemporary capitalism,
            with its “revolutionary” motor vehicles and hand lotions, has subverted not
            only the time-honored ideals of radicalism, but the language and
            nomenclature for expressing them.
               It is emotionally refreshing as well as intellectually rewarding to look back
            to a time when these words still had meaning, indeed, when content and
            conviction as such had deﬁnition and reality. People today do not hold ideals;
            they hold “opinions.” The Spanish Anarchists, as well as many other radicals
            of the pre-Civil War era, still had ideals which they did not lightly discard like
            the brand names of products. The Anarchists imparted a spiritual meaning,
            intellectual logic, and dignity to the libertarian ideal which precluded
            ﬂirtations with their opponents—those not only in the bourgeois world but
            also in the authoritarian left. However unsophisticated they proved to be in
            many ideological matters, it would have seemed inconceivable to them that an
            Anarchist could acknowledge the coexistence of a propertied sector of society
            with a collective one, ignore or slight diﬀerences in class interests and
            politics, or accept a policy of accommodation with a centralized state or
            authoritarian party, however “libertarian” their opponents might seem in
            other respects. Basic diﬀerences were meant to be respected, not ignored;
            indeed, they were meant to be deepened by the logic of dispute and
6 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            examination, not compromised by emphasizing superﬁcial resemblances and a
            liberal accommodation to ideological divisions. The slaughter and terror that
            followed in the wake of Franco’s march toward Madrid in the late summer of
            1936 and the physical hemorrhage that claimed so many lives in the long
            course of the Civil War produced a spiritual hemorrhage as well, bringing to
            the surface all the latent weaknesses of the classical workers’ movement as
            such, both Anarchist and Socialist. I have pointed to some of these
            weaknesses in the closing chapter of this volume. But a high sense of
            revolutionary commitment remained and continued for decades. That events
            involving the sheer physical survival of people may induce compromises
            between ideals and realities is no more surprising in the lifetime of a
            movement than it is in that of an individual. But that these very ideals should
            be casually dismissed or forgotten, replaced by a ﬂippant ecumenicalism in
            which one deals with social goals like fashions, is unforgivable.
               My feeling for the Spanish Anarchist sense of commitment to a highly
            principled libertarian ideal—organizationally as well as ideologically—forms
            still another part of my motives for writing this book. A decent respect for the
            memory of the many thousands who perished for their libertarian goals would
            require that we state these goals clearly and unequivocally, quite aside from
            whether we agree with them or not. For surely these dead deserve the
            minimal tribute of identifying Anarchism with social revolution, not with
            fashionable concepts of decentralization and self-management that
            comfortably coexist with state power, the proﬁt economy, and multinational
            corporations. Few people today seem concerned to distinguish the Spanish
            Anarchists’ version of revolutionary decentralization and self-management
            from the liberal ones that are so much in vogue. Anselmo Lorenzo, Fermin
            Salvochea, and the young faistas of the 1930s would have been appalled at
            the claim that their ideas had found realization in present-day Chinese
            “communes” or in the European trade-union leaders who sit as “workers’
            representatives” on corporate boards of directors. Spanish Anarchist notions
            of communes, self-management, and technological innovation are totally
            incompatible with any system of state power or private property and utterly
            opposed to any compromise with bourgeois society.
               Contemporaneity alone does not, in my view, establish the need for a book
            on Spanish Anarchism. I could easily have adduced Franco’s death as
            justiﬁcation for oﬀering this book to the public, and certainly it could be cited
            as a good reason for reading such a work, but my motives for writing it are
            not to be explained by the current interest in Spain. The basic question raised
            by Spanish Anarchism was whether it is possible for people to gain full,
            direct), face-to-face control over their everyday lives, to manage society in
            their own way—not as “masses” guided by professional leaders, but as
            thoroughly liberated individuals in a world without leaders or led, without
            masters or slaves. The great popular uprising of July 1936, especially in the
            Anarchist centers of Spain, tried to approximate this goal. That the eﬀort
            failed at a terrible cost in life and morale does not qjxllify the inherent truth of
            the goal itself.
               Finally, I would like to remind the reader that Spanish life has changed
            greatly from the conditions described in this volume. Spain is no longer a
            predominantly agrarian country and the traditional pueblo is rapidly giving

            way to the modern town and city. This should be dearly borne in mind at all
            times while reading the book. The image of “eternal Spain” has always been a
            reactionary one. Today, when Spain has become one of the most industrialized
            countries in the world, it is simply absurd. Yet there is much of a preindustrial
            and precapitalist nature that lingers on in Spain, and it is devoutly to be
            hoped that the old Anarchist dream of melding the solidarity of earlier village
            lifeways with a fairly advanced technological society will have reality for the
            Spanish present and future.
               Before concluding this introduction, I would like to explain certain
            unorthodoxies in the writing of the book and extend my acknowledgement to
            individuals who rendered invaluable assistance in its preparation.
               Throughout most of their history, the Spanish Anarchists were adherents of
            a trade-union form of Anarchism which is generally designated as
            “Anarchosyndicalism.”[1] In contrast to many writers on the subject who see
            Spanish Anarchosyndicalism as a distinctly twentieth-century development,
            one that had its origins in France, I am now quite convinced that the Spanish
            section of the First International was Anarchosyndicalist from its very
            inception in the early 1870s. This tradition persisted, I believe, in virtually all
            libertarian unions up to and into the formation of the CNT. The tradition,
            moreover, applied as much to the land laborers’ unions of Andalusia as to the
            textile workers’ unions of Barcelona. French Anarchosyndicalism may have
            been the source for a comprehensive theory of the syndicalist general strike,
            but the Spanish Anarchists were practicing Anarchosyndicalist tactics
            decades earlier and, in many cases, were quite conscious of their
            revolutionary import before the word “Anarchosyndicalist” itself came into
            vogue.[2]
               Accordingly, I have used the terms “Anarchist” and “Anarchosyndicalist”
            almost intuitively, ordinarily combining libertarians of all persuasions under
            the “Anarchist” rubric when they seemed to confront the Marxists, the state
            power, and their class opponents as a fairly uniﬁed tendency in Spanish
            society and singling out “Anarchosyndicalists” when they were functioning
            largely from a syndicalist point of view. The mingling of these terms was not
            uncommon in many works on Spain during the 1930s, as witness Gerald
            Brenan’s The Spanish Labyrinth and Franz Borkenau’s The Spanish Cockpit.
               I should also note that I have abandoned the use of the usual accent that
            appears in many Spanish words. I fail to see why Lleida and Leon (the latter
            by no means consistently) have accents, while Andalusia and Aragon do not.
            For the sake of consistency, I have removed the accents entirely, air the more
            because this book is written for an English-reading public.
               The Spanish Anarchists were given to acronyms like faista, cenetista, and
            ugetista for members of the FAI, CNT, and the Socialist-controlled UGT: I have
            retained this vocabulary in the book but have avoided the more familiar
            diminutives they used for their periodicals, such as “Soli” for Solidaridad
            Obrera.
               Whatever originality this book can claim is due primarily to interviews I
            have had with Spanish Anarchists and with non-Spaniards who were
            personally involved with their movement. Although I have consulted a large
            number of books, periodicals, letters, and reports on the Spanish Anarchist
            movement, my most rewarding experiences have come from the individuals
8 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            who knew it at ﬁrst hand. Space limitations make it possible for me to list the
            names of only a few. I am deeply grateful to a very kindly man, Jose Peirats,
            the historian of Spanish Anarchism in its latef period^ for painstakingly
            explaining the structure of the CNT and FAI, and for many facts about the
            atmosphere in Barcelona during the years of his youth. Peirats, whom I view
            as a friend, has done more to convey the mood of the Spanish Anarchist
            movement in the pre-Civil War period than any text could possibly do. For this
            sense of personal contact as well as for his invaluable writings on the
            trajectory of Spanish Anarchism, I owe him an immeasurable debt.
               I have also learned a great deal from personal conversations with Gaston
            Leval. He has been an indispensable source of information about the
            Anarchist collectives in Spain during the Civil War (a ﬁeld in which his
            command of the facts is unparalleled); he has also given me the beneﬁt of his
            insights and, for the purposes of this ﬁrst volume, of his experiences in the
            CNT during the 1920s. Leval, who is no apologist for the CNT and FAI,
            contributed considerably to my appraisal of the exaggerated emphasis on
            Anarchist pistolerismo during that critical time and presented me with a more
            balanced picture of the early 1920s than I have received from the
            conventional literature on the subject.
               To Pablo Ruiz, I owe a truly immense debt for the detailed account he gave
            me of the founding and activities of the Friends of Durruti, the small but
            heroic group that did so much to uphold the honor of Spanish Anarchism
            during the diﬀicult “ministerial” crisis within the movement in 1936–37. The
            late Cipriano Mera provided me with invaluable details on the structure of the
            Anarchist militias during the £ivil War and on the movement’s activities in
            Madrid during the early 1930s. Although a movement in exile is ordinarily
            distorted by. its isolation and internal conﬂicts, I gained some sense of the life
            of Spanish Anarchism by attending meetings of the CNT in Paris, visiting the
            homes of its members, and hearing deeply moving accounts of the solidarity
            these individuals retained in the years following the defeat of their movement
            in 1939.
               I owe a great deal to two friends, Sam Dolgoﬀ and the late Russell
            Blackwell, for their assistance in assembling data for this book and giving
            freely of their personal recollections. That I dedicated this volume to the
            memory of Russell Blackwell is more than act of friendship. Blackwell had
            fought with the Friends of Durruti in Barcelona during the May uprising in
            1937. In time he came to symbolize the melding of Spanish and American
            libertarian ideals in a form that seemed unsurpassed by anyone I had known. I
            must also express my appreciation to Federico Arcos and Will Watson for
            making materials available to me that-are very diﬀicult to obtain in the United
            States; to my good friend, Vernon Richards, for his valuable critical insights;
            to Frank Mintz for sharing many facts drawn from this own researches; to the
            custodians of the Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan for
            permission to freely examine documents and unpublished dissertations on
            various periods of the movement’s history; to Susan Harding for sending me
            additional European material and oﬀering criticisms that have been useful in
            preparing the text.
               In writing a general narrative of this kind, an author must make a decision
            on where to draw the limits to his research if he is to complete the work in a
9 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            reasonable period of time. Despite the comparatively improved climate of
            Franco’s Spain a decade ago, my visit to the country in 1967 coincided
            precisely with the publication of an article in my own name-in a leading
            European Anarchist periodical, and I decided it would be imprudent to
            continue the research I had planned in that country. In any case, European
            archives on Spanish Anarchism are so immense that I could foresee many
            years of research abroad were I to sacriﬁce my goal of a general narrative for
            a detailed history based on primary sources. Accordingly, I decided to shift my
            research back to the United States after visiting various European cities
            where I was fortunate to gather much of the material I required to write this
            book.
              Since the late 1960s, a truly voluminous literature has been published on
            diﬀerent periods of Spanish Anarchism. Wherever possible I have made, use
            of these new studies to check and modify my own largely completed work.
            Happily, I have found surprisingly little that required alteration and much that
            supports generalizations that were partly hypothetical when they were ﬁrst
            committed to paper. In so far-reaching a project, it is inevitable that factual
            errors will pccu’r. I can only hope they will prove to be minimal and
            insigniﬁcant. The historical interpretations in this volume are my
            responsibility alone and should not be imputed to the many individuals who so
            generously aided me in other respects.

            Prologue: Fanelli’s Journey
              In late October 1868, Giuseppi Fanelli, a tall, heavily bearded Italian of
            about forty, arrived at Barcelona after a railroad journey from Geneva. It was
            Fanelli’s ﬁrst visit to Spain. He had reached the city without incident and he
            would leave it, a few months later, ^without any interference by the Spanish
            authorities. There was nothing in his appearance that would have
            distinguished him from any other visiting Italian, except perhaps for his
            height and his intense prepossessing stature.
              But Giuseppi Fanelli was not an ordinary visitor to Spain. His brief journey
            was to have a far-reaching inﬂuence, providing the catalyst for what was not
            only the most widespread workers’ and peasants’ movement in modern Spain,
            but the largest Anarchist movement in modem Europe. For Fanelli was an
            experienced Italian revolutionary, a supporter of the Russian Anarchist
            Mikhail Bakunin, and a highly gifted propagandist. His journey had been
            organized by Bakunin in order to gain Spanish adherents to the International
            Workingmen’s Association, the famous “First International” established by
            European workers a few years earlier.
              Fanelli’s trip should have been a complete ﬁasco. Financially, it was
            conducted on a shoestring. Bakunin had raised barely enough money to pay
            for the fare, with the result that Fanelli, chronically short of funds, was
10 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            constantly pressed for time. His knowledge of Spain was limited and he could
            speak scarcely a sentence in Spanish. In Barcelona, he managed after some
            diﬀiculty to ﬁnd Elie Reclus, the distinguished French anthropologist and a
            ﬁrm Bakuninist, who was visiting the Catalan port for journalistic reasons.
            Otherwise, Fanelli knew no one in the city. Apparently, the two men quarreled
            over Reclus’s accommodating attitude toward his Spanish Republican friends,
            for Fanelli, much to his host’s embarrassment, tried to win them over to
            Anarchism. After borrowing some money from Reclus to continue his journey,
            the Italian went on to Madrid where he met Jose Guisascola, the owner of the
            periodical La lgualdad. He put Fanelli in touch with a group of workers with
            “very advanced ideas” and a small, intimate meeting was arranged in the
            guest room of one Rubau Donadeu. Fanelli could only address them in Italian
            or French, and the workers, most of whom knew only Spanish, had neglected
            to bring along an interpreter. But once the tall, lean Italian began to speak,
            his rapport with the audience was so complete that all barriers of language
            were quickly swept away. Using a wealth of Latin gestures and tonal
            expressions, Fanelli managed to convey with electric eﬀect the richness of his
            libertarian visions and the bitterness of his anger toward human suﬀering and
            exploitation. The workers, accustomed to the moderate expressions of
            Spanish liberals, were stunned. Decades later, Anselmo Lorenzo, who
            attended the meeting as a young man, describes the talk with a vividness of
            memory that time seems to have left undimmed. Fanelli’s “black expressive
            eyes,” he recalls, “ﬂashed like lightning or took on the appearance of kindly
            compassion according to the sentiments that dominated him. His voice had a
            metallic tone and was susceptible to all the inﬂections •ppropriate to what he
            was saying, passing rapidly from accents of anger and menace against tyrants
            and exploiters to take on those of suﬀering, regret, and consolation, when he
            spoke of the pains of the exploited, either as one who yvithout suﬀering them
            himself understands them, or as one who through his altruistic feelings
            delights in presenting an ultra-revolutionary ideal of peace and fraternity. He
            spoke in French and Italian, but we could understand his expressive mimicry
            and follow his speech.”
               Fanelli scored a complete triumph. All those present declared themselves
            for the International. He extended his stay in Madrid for several weeks,
            cultivating his newly won adherents; together they had three or four
            “propaganda sessions,” alternating with intimate conversations on walks and
            in cafes. Lorenzo recalls that he was “especially favored” with Fanelli’s
            conﬁdences. If this is so, Fanelli showed excellent judgment: Anselmo Lorenzo
            was to live for many years, and he remained a dedicated revolutionary,
            earning the sobriquet “the grandfather of Spanish Anarchism.” His
            contribution to the spread of Anarchist ideas in Barcelona and Andalusia over
            the decades ahead was enormous.
               On January 24, 1869, Fanelli met with his Madrid converts for the last time.
            Although the small group, composed mostly of printing workers, house
            painters, and shoemakers, numbered little more than twenty, it oﬀicially
            declared itself the Madrid section of the International Workingmen’s
            Association. Lorenzo tried to persuade Fanelli to remain longer, but he
            declined. The Italian explained that he had to leave because it was necessary
            for individuals and groups to develop “by their own eﬀorts, with their own
11 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            values,” so that the “great common work will not lack the individual and local
            characteristics which make for a kind of variety that does not endanger unity,”
            but in fact yields a “whole that is the sum of many diﬀerent elements.” In
            these few remarks, summarized by Lorenzo, Fanelli touches upon the
            organizational principle and practice so basic to Anarchism, that order
            reaches its most harmonious form through the spontaneous, unhampered
            development of individuality and variety. Ultimately, the vitality of the Spanish
            Anarchist movement was to depend on the extent to which it made this
            principle a living force in its social and organizational activites.
              Before leaving Spain, Fanelli stopped again in Barcelona. This time he had a
            letter of introduction from Jose Rubau Donadeu, one of his Madrid converts,
            to the painter Jose Luis Pellicer, a radical democrat with strong Federalist
            convictions. Pellicer arranged a meeting in his studio that attracted some
            twenty Republicans, most of whom were individuals with established
            professional backgrounds.. This sophisticated, middle-class audience was
            more skeptical of Fanelli’s impassioned oratory than the Madrilenos. Probably
            no more than a handful of young men, mostly students, were inclined to
            commit themselves to the Italian’s Anarchist ideas, but they included Rafael
            Farga Pellicer, the nephew of Jose Luis, who was to play an important role in
            establishing the International in Barcelona. By this time, Fanelli was almost
            out of funds, and after a brief stay in the Catalan seaport, he departed for
            Marseilles.
              Guiseppi Fanelli never returned to Spain. He died only eight years later, a
            victim of tuberculosis at the age of forty-eight. Like so many young Italians of
            his day, Fanelli had given up a promising career as an architect and engineer
            to work for the revolution, at ﬁrst serving under Garibaldi and later as an
            emissary of Mazzini. With the victory of the national cause in 1861, he
            became a deputy in the Italian parliament. His oﬀicial position earned him the
            traditional free railway pass to travel all over Italy, and the government
            provided him with a modest pension for the loss of his health as a political
            prisoner of the Bourbons. He met Bakunin in 1866 at Ischia, only two years
            before his journey to Spain, and fell completely under the charismatic spell of
            the Russian revolutionary. For Fanelli, revolution was a way of life, not merely
            a distant theoretical goal, and his latter years as a deputy were spent on the
            railways, preaching social revolution during the day in peasant villages
            throughout Italy, later returning to sleep in the train at night.
              It is doubtful that he fully recognized the scope of his achievement in Spain.
            Previous attempts to implant Anarchist ideas there go as far back as 1845,
            when Ramon de la Sagra, a disciple of Proudhon, founded a libertarian
            journal in Coruna. But the paper, El Poruenir, was soon suppressed by the
            authorities and Sagra died in exile without exerting any inﬂuence in his native
            country.
              Fanelli’s achievement was unique and prophetic. Perhaps there is hyperbole
            in this story as it has come down to us. But even that is important because it
            shows the passionately imaginative elements that enter into the Spanish
            yearnings for freedom. And, we shall see, Spain was uniquely susceptible to
            Anarchist visions of liberation.
            Chapter One: The “Idea” and Spain
12 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            Background
              What was the “Idea,” as it was destined to be called, that Guiseppi Fanelli
            brought to Madrid and Barcelona? Why did it sink such deep and lasting roots
            in Spain?
              Few visions of a free society have been more grossly misrepresented than
            Anarchism. Strictly speaking,, anarchy means without authority, rulerless—
            hence, a stateless society based on selfadministration. In the popular mind,
            the word is invariably equated with chaos, disorder, and terrorist bombings.
            This could not be more incorrect. Violence and terror are not intrinsic
            features of Anarchism. There are some Anarchists who have turned to
            terrorist actions, just as there are others who object to the use of violence as
            a matter of principle.
              Unlike Marxism, with its founders, distinct body of texts,and clearly
            deﬁnable ideology, anarchistic ideals are diﬀicult to ﬁx into a hard and fast
            credo. Anarchism is a great libidinal movement of humanity to shake oﬀ the
            repressive apparatus created by hierarchical society. It originates in the ageold drive of the oppressed to assert the spirit of freedom, equality, and
            spontaneity over values and institutions based on authority. This accounts for
            the enormous antiquity of anarchistic visions, their irrepressibility and
            continual reemergence in history, particularly in periods of social transition
            and revolution. The multitude of creeds that surface from this great
            movement of the social depths are essentially concrete adaptations to a given
            historical period of more diﬀuse underlying sentiments, not of eternally ﬁxed
            doctrines. Just as the values and institutions of hierarchy have changed over
            the ages, so too have the anarchic creeds that attempted to dislodge them.
              In antiquity, these creeds were articulated by a number of highly
            sophisticated philosophers, but all the theories were pale reﬂections of mass
            upheavals that began with the breakup of the village economy and culminated
            in millenarian Christianity. Indeed, for centuries, the church fathers were to
            be occupied with mass heresies that emphasized freedom, equality, and at
            times, a wild hedonism. The slaves and poor who ﬂocked to Christianity saw
            the second coming of Christ as a time when “a grain of wheat would bear ten
            thousand ears,” when hunger, illness, coercion, and hierarchy would be
            banished forever from the earth.
              These heresies, which had never ceased to percolate through medieval
            society, boiled up toward its end in great peasant movements and wildly
            ecstatic visions of freedom and equality. Some of the medival anarchistic sects
            were astonishingly modern and aﬀirmed a freedom “so reckless and
            unqualiﬁed,” writes Norman Cohn, “that it amounted to a total denial of every
            kind of restraint.” (The speciﬁc heresy to which Cohn refers here is the Free
            Spirit, a hedonistic sect which spread throughout southern Germany during
            the fourteenth ^ century.) “These people,” Cohn emphasizes “could be
            regarded as remote precursors of Bakunin and Nietzsche—or rather of that
            Bohemian intelligentsia which during the last half-century has been living
            from ideas once expressed by Bakunin and Nietzsche in their wilder
            moments.”
              More typical, however, were the revolutionary peasant movements of the
            late Middle Ages which demanded village autonomy, the preservation of the

            communal lands, and in some cases, outright communism. Although these
            movements reached their apogee in the Reformation, they never disappeared
            completely; indeed, as late as the twentieth century, Ukranian peasant
            militias, led by Nestor Makhno, were to ﬁght White Guards and Bolsheviks
            alike in the Russian Civil War under Anarchist black ﬂags inscribed with the
            traditional demand of “Liberty and Land.”
              Anarchistic theories found entirely new forms as revolutionary passions
            began to surge up in the towns and cities. The word “Anarchist” was ﬁrst used
            widely as an epithet against the Enrages, the street orators of Paris, during
            the Great French Revolution. Although the Enrages did not make demands
            that would be regarded today as a basic departure from radical democratism,
            the use of the epithet was not entirely unjustiﬁed. The ﬁery nature of their
            oratory, their egalitarianism, their appeals to direct action, and their
            implacable hatred of the upper classes, menaced the new hierarchy of wealth
            and privilege reared by the revolution. They were crushed by Robespierre
            shortly before his downfall, but one of the most able Enrages, Jean Varlet, who
            managed to escape the guillotine, was to draw the ultimate conclusion from
            his experiences. “For any reasonable being,” he wrote years afterward,
            “Government and Revolution are incompatible....”
              The plebian Anarchism of the towns directed its energies against disparities
            in wealth, but like the peasant Anarchism of the countryside, its social outlook
            was diﬀuse and inchoate. With the emergence of the nineteenth century, these
            diﬀuse sentiments and ideas of the past were solidiﬁed by the new spirit of
            scientiﬁc rationalism that swept Europe. And for the ﬁrst time, systematic
            works on Anarchist theory began to appear.
              Perhaps the ﬁrst man to call himself publicly an “Anarchist” and to present
            his ideas in a methodical manner was Pierre Joseph Proudhon, whose writings
            were to exercise a great deal of inﬂuence in the Latin countries. Proudhon’s
            use of the word “Anarchist” to designate his views must be taken with
            reservations. Personally, he was an industrious man with ﬁxed habits and a
            strong taste for the quietude and pleasantries of domestic life. He was raised
            in a small town and trained as a printer. The views of this paterfamilias were
            often limited by the social barriers of a craftsman and provincial, despite his
            long stays in Paris and other large cities.
              This is clearly evident in his writings and correspondence. Proudhon
            envisions a free society as one in which small craftsmen, peasants, and
            collectively owned industrial enterprises negotiate and contract with each
            other to satisfy their material needs. Exploitation is brought to an end, and
            people simply claim the rewards of their labor, freely working and exchanging
            their produce without any compulsion to compete or seek proﬁt. Although
            these views involve a break with capitalism, by no means can they be
            regarded as communist ideas, a body of views emphasizing publicly owned
            property and a goal in which human needs are satisﬁed without regard to the
            contribution of each individual’s labor.
              Despite the considerable inﬂuence Spanish Anarchists have attributed to
            Proudhon, his mutualist views were the target of many attacks by the early
            Spanish labor movement. The cooperativist movement, perhaps more
            authentically Proudhonian than Anarchist, raised many obstacles to the
            revolutionary trajectory of the Spanish Anarchist movement. As
14 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            “cooperativists,” the mutualists were to seek a peaceful and piecemeal
            erosion of capitalism. The Anarchists, in turn, were to stress the need for
            militant struggle, general strike, and insurrection.
               Nevertheless, Proudhon, more than any writer in his day, was responsible
            for the popularity of federalism in the Socialist and Anarchist movements of
            the last century. In his vision of a federal society, the diﬀerent municipalities
            join together into local and regional federations, delegating little if any power
            to a central government. They deal with common administrative problems and
            try to adjudicate their diﬀerences in an amicable manner. Proudhon, in fact,
            sees no need for a centralized administration and at times seems to be calling
            for the total abolition of the state.
               Although his style is vigorous and often ringing, Proudhon’s temperament,
            methods, and his emphasis on contractual relations can hardly be called
            revolutionary, much less anarchistic. Nevertheless, his theories were to have
            enormous inﬂuence in France and on the Iberian Peninsula.
               Mutualism and Proudhon’s ideas became ﬁrmly rooted in Spam through the
            work of a young Catalan, Francisco Pi y Margall. In 1854 Pi published
            Reaction y Revolution, a work that was to exercise a profound inﬂuence on
            radical thought in Spain. Pi had been a bank clerk in Madrid who, in his spare
            hours, combined occasional ventures into journalism with the authoring of
            several books on art. Although he was not an Anarchist and was never to
            become one, his book contains thrusts against centralized authority and
            power that could have easily come from Bakunin’s pen. “Every man who has
            power over another,” writes the young Catalan, “is a tyrant.” Further: “I shall
            divide and subdivide power; I shall make it changeable and go on destroying
            it.” The similarity between these statements and Proudhon’s views has led
            some writers to regard Pi as a disciple of the Frenchman. Actually, it was
            Hegel who initially exercised the greatest inﬂuence on Pi’s thought in the
            early 1850s. The Hegelian notion of lawful social development and “unity in
            variety” were the guiding concepts in Pi’s early federalist ideas. It was not
            until later that the Catalan turned increasingly to Proudhon and shed many of
            his Hegelian ideas. Although keenly sympathetic to the wretchedness of
            Spain’s poor, Pi shunned the use of revolutionary violence. Their living
            conditions, he argued, could best be improved by reformistic and gradualistic
            measures.
               The book caused a great stir among the Spanish radical intelligentsia. To
            many, Federalism seemed like the ideal solution to Spain’s mounting social
            problems. The men whom Fanelli addressed in Madrid and Barcelona were
            largely Federalists, as were most of the Republicans in the two cities.
            Federalist ideas had become so widespread in Spain, in fact, that its
            supporters were to provide the most important intellectual recruits to the
            Anarchist movement.
               Mutualism became the dominant social philosophy both of the radical
            Spanish Republicans of the 1860s and of the Parisian Communards of 1871.
            But it was largely due to the work of a famous revolutionary exile—the
            “Garibaldi of Socialism,” as Gerald Brenan calls him—that the collectivist and
            Federalist elements in Proudhon’s theories were given a revolutionary thrust
            —and were carried into Spain as a ﬁery anarchistic ideal.

            Mikhail Bakunin
              The man who was most successful in providing the vast plebian elements of
            Spanish Anarchism with a coherent body of ideas was neither a Spaniard nor
            a plebian, but a Russian aristocrat, Mikhail Bakunin. Although a century has
            passed since his death, he remains one of the most controversial, little known,
            and maligned ﬁgures in the history of the nineteenth-century revolutionary
            movements. He enjoys none of the posthumous honors that are heaped on
            Marx. To this day, nearly all accounts of his life and ideas by non-Anarchist
            writers are streaked with malice and hostility. His name still conjures up
            images of violence, rapine, terrorism, and ﬂaming rebellion. In an age that
            has made the cooptation of dead revolutionaries into a ﬁne art, Bakunin
            enjoys the unique distinction of being the most denigrated revolutionary of his
            time.
              That the mere appearance of Bakunin would have evoked a sense af menace
            is attested by every description his contemporaries hand down to us. All
            portray him in massive strokes: an immensely tall, heavy man (Marx
            described him as a “bullock”), with a tousled, leonine mane, shaggy eyebrows,
            a broad forehead, and a heavily bearded face with thick Slavic features. These
            gargantuan traits were matched by an ebullient personality and an
            extraordinary amount of energy. The urbane Russian exile, Alexander Herzen,
            leaves us with a priceless description of the time when Bakunin, already
            approaching ﬁfty, stayed at his home in London. Bakunin, he tells us,

## argued, preached, gave orders, shouted, decided, arranged,
                 organized, exhorted, the whole day, the whole night, the whole
                 twenty-four hours on end. In the brief moments which remained, he
                 would throw himself down on his desk, sweep a small space clear of
## tobacco ash, and begin to write ﬁve, ten, ﬁfteen letters to
                 Semipalatinsk and Arad, to Belgrade, Moldavia, and White Russia.
                 In the middle of a letter he would throw down his pen in order to
                 refute some reactionary Dalmatian; then, without ﬁnishing his
                 speech, he would seize his pen and go on writing.... His activity, his
                 appetite, like all his other characteristics—even his gigantic size and
## continual sweat — were of superhuman proportions....

              This was written after the weary, politically disillusioned Herzen had parted
            company with the exuberant revolutionary. Nevertheless the description gives
            us an image of the sheer elemental force that emanated from Bakunin,
            qualities which were to carry him through trials that would have easily
            crushed ordinary men. Bakunin’s forcefulness, overbearing as it was to
            Herzen, was softened by a natural simplicity and an absence of pretension
            and malice which verged on childlike innocence. Like so many Russian exiles
            at the time, Bakunin was kindly and generous to a fault. There were some who
            exploited these traits for dubious ends, but there were others (among them,
            young Italian, Spanish, and Russian revolutionaries) who, strongly attracted
            by the warmth of his personality, were to turn to him for moral inspiration
            throughout his life.
              He was born in May 1814, in Premukhina, a moderately large estate 150
16 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            miles northwest of Moscow. A nobleman whose mother was connected by
            lineage to the ruling circles of Russia, Bakunin abandoned a distasteful
            military career and the prospect of genteel stagnation on his family estate for
            a life of wandering and revolutionary activity in Europe. The year 1848 found
            him in Paris, later in Prague, and ﬁnally in Dresden, where he literally
            journeyed from one insurrection to another in his appetite for action. From
            May 1849 he was bandied about from one prison to another—Saxon, Austrian,
            and Russian—before escaping from Siberia to arrive in London in 1863.
               Up to the 1860s Bakunin had essentially been a revolutionary activist,
            loosely adhering to the radical democratic and nationalist views of the day. It
            was in London, and especially during a long stay in Italy, that he began to
            formulate his Anarchist views. In the thirteen years of life remaining before
            him, he never ceased to be the barricade ﬁghter of 1848 and was involved
            repeatedly in revolutionary plots, but it was also in this period that he
            developed the most mature of his theoretical ideas.
               Bakunin’s Anarchism converges toward a single point: unrestricted
            freedom. He brooks no compromise with this goal, and it permeates all of his
            mature writings. “I have in mind the only liberty worthy of that name,” he
            writes,
                 liberty consisting in the full development of all the material,
                 intellectual, and moral powers latent in every man; a liberty which
                 does not recognize any other restrictions but those which are traced
                 by the laws of our nature, which, properly speaking, is tantamount
                 to saying that there are no restrictions at all, since these laws are
                 not imposed upon us by some outside legislator standing above us
                 or alongside us. These laws are immanent, inherent in us; they
## constitute the very basis of our being, material as well as
                 intellectual and moral; and instead of ﬁnding in them a limit to our
## liberty we should regard them as its eﬀective reason.

              The “immanent” and “inherent” laws that form the basis of human nature,
            however, do not lead to a rabid individualism that sees social life as a
            restriction; Bakunin emphatically denies that individuals can live as asocial
            “egos.” People want to be free in order to fulﬁll themselves, he argues, and to
            fulﬁll themselves they must live with others in communities. If these
            communities are not distorted by property, exploitation, and authority, they
            tend to approach a cooperative and humanistic equilibrium out of sheer
            common interest.
              Bakunin’s criticism of capitalism leans heavily on the writings of Marx. He
            never ceased to praise Marx for his theoretical contributions to revolutionary
            theory, even during their bitter conﬂicts within the International. The basic
            disagreement between Marx and Bakunin centers around the social role of
            the state and the eﬀects of centralism on society and on revolutionary
            organizations. Although Marx shared the Anarchist vision of a stateless
            society—the “ultimate goal” of Marxian communism,in fact, is a form of
            anarchy—he regards the historical role of the state as “progressive” and sees
            centralization as an advance over localism and regionalism. Bakunin
            emphatically disagrees with this viewpoint. The state, he admits, may be
            “historically necessary” in the sense that its development was unavoidable
17 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            during Ijumanity’s emergence from barbarism, but it is an “historically
            necessary evil, as necessary in the past as its complete extinction will be
            necessary sooner or later, just as necessary as primitive bestiality and
            theological divagations were necessary in the past.”
              The point is that Bakunin, in contrast to Marx, continually emphasizes the
            negative aspects of the state:

## Even when it commands the good, it makes this valueless by
                 commanding it; for every command slaps liberty in the face; as soon
                 as this good is commanded, it is transformed into an evil in the eyes
                 of true (that is, human, by no means divine) morality, of the dignity
## of man, of liberty....

               This intensely moral judgment plays an important role in Bakunin’s outlook,
            indeed, in Anarchism generally. Human beings, to Bakunin, are not
            “instruments” of an abstraction called “history”; they are ends in themselves,
            for which there are no abstract substitutes. If people begin to conceive
            themselves as “instruments” of any kind, they may well become a means
            rather than an end, and modify the course of events in such a way that they
            never achieve freedom. In erroneously prejudging themselves and their
            “function,” they may ignore opportunities that cou\d lead directly to liberation
            or that could create favorable social conditions for freedom later.
               With this existential emphasis, Bakunin departs radically from Marxism,
            which continually stresses the economic preconditions for freedom and often
            smuggles in intensely authoritarian methods and institutions for advancing
            economic development. Bakunin does not ignore the important role of
            technology in ripening the conditions for freedom, but he feels that we cannot
            §ay in advance when these conditions are ripe or not. Hence we must
            continually strive for complete freedom lest we miss opportunities to achieve
            it or, at least, prepare the conditions for its achievement.
               These seemingly abstract theoretical diﬀerences between Marx and
            Bakunin lead to opposing conclusions of a very concrete and practical nature.
            For Marx, whose concept of freedom is vitiated by preconditions and
            abstractions, the immediate goal of revolution is to seize political power and
            replace the bourgeois state by a highly centralized “proletarian” dictatorship.
            The proletariat must thus organize a mass centralized political party and use
            every means, including parliamentary and electoral methods, to enlarge its
            control over society. For Bakunin, on the other hand, the immediate goal of
            revolution is to extend the individual’s control over his or her own life; hence
            revolution must be directed not toward the “seizure of power” but its
            dissolution. A revolutionary group that turns into a political party, structuring
            itself along hierarchical lines and participating in elections, Bakunin warns,
            will eventually abandon its revolutionary goals. It will become denatured by
            the needs of political life and ﬁnally become’coopted by the very society it
            seeks to overthrow.
               From the outset, then, the revolution must destroy the state apparatus: the
            police, the army, the bureaucracy. If violence is necessary, it must be
            exercised by the armed revolutionary people, organized in popular militias.
            The revolutionary movement, in turn, must try to reﬂect the society it is trying
            to create. If the movement is to avoid turning into an end in itself, into
18 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            another state, complete conformity must exist between its means and ends,
            between form and content. Writing bn the structure of the International,
            Bakunin insists that it
                 must diﬀer essentially from state organization. Just as much as the
                 state is authoritarian, artiﬁcial, and violent, alien, and hostile to the
                 natural development of the people’s interests and instincts, so must
## the organization of the International be free and natural,
                 conforming in every respect to those interests and instincts.
              Accordingly, in the last years of the International, Bakunin was to oppose
            Marx’s eﬀorts to centralize the movement and invest virtually commanding
            powers in its General Council.[3]
              Bakunin places strong emphasis on the role of spontaneity in the revolution
            and in revolutionary activity. If people are to achieve freedom, if they are to
            be revolutionized by the revolution, they must make the revolution
            themselves, not under the tutelage of an allknowing political party. Bakunin
            also recognizes, however, that a revolutionary movement is needed to catalyze
            revolutionary possibilities into realities, to foster a revolutionary development
            by means of propaganda, ideas, and programs. The revolutionary movement,
            he believes, should be organized in small groups of dedicated “brothers” (the
            word recurs often in his discussion of organization) who single-mindedly
            pursue the task of fomenting revolution. His emphasis on smallness is
            motivated partly by the need for secrecy that existed in the southern
            European countries of his day, partly also by his desire to foster intimacy
            within the revolutionary movement.
              For Bakunin, a revolutionary organization is a community of personally
            involved brothers and sisters, not an apparatus based on bureaucracy,
            hierarchy, and programmatic agreement. More so than any of the great
            revolutionaries of his day, Bakunin sought a concordance between the lifestyle and goals of the revolutionary movement. He was unique in his
            appreciation of revolution as a festival. Recalling his experiences in Paris,
            shortly after the 1848 revolution, he writes:
                 I breathed through all my senses and through all my pores the
                 intoxication of the revolutionary atmosphere. It was a festival
                 without beginning nor end; I saw everyone and I saw no one, for
                 each individual was lost in the same innumerable and wandering
                 crowd; I spoke to everyone without remembering either my own
                 words or those of others, for my attention was absorbed by new
## events and objects and by unexpected news.

              Bakunin’s emphasis on conspiracy and secrecy can be understood only
            against the social background of Italy, Spain, and Russia—the three countries
            in Europe where conspiracy and secrecy were matters of sheer survival. In
            contrast to Marx, who greatly admired the well-disciplined, centralized
            German proletariat, Bakunin placed his greatest hopes for social revolution on
            the Latin countries. He foresaw the danger of the embourgeoisement of the
            industrial proletariat and warned of its consequences. Following a
            predisposition to mistrust stable, complacent, institutionalized classes in
19 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            society, Bakunin turned increasingly to decomposing, precapitalist classes of
            the kind that prevailed in Russia and southern Europe: landless peasants,
            workers with no stake in society, artisans faced by ruin, footloose declasse
            intellectuals and students. Marx regarded the formation of a stable industrial
            working class as a precondition for social revolution. Bakunin, however, saw
            in this process the ruin of all hopes for a genuinely revolutionary movement—
            and in this respect he proved deeply prophetic.
              Bakunin was not a communist. He may have recognized that economic
            development in his day did not admit of the communist precept, “From each
            according to his ability; to each according to his needs.” In any case he
            accepted Proudhon’s notion that the satisfaction of material needs would have
            to be tied to the labor contributed by each individual. Bakunin also closely
            followed Proudhon’s federalist approach to social organization. But in
            contrast to the French mutualist, he regarded the collective, and not the
            independent artisan, as the basic social unit. He was sharply critical of
            Proudhonian mutualists
                 who conceive society as the result of the free contract of individuals
                 absolutely independent of one another and entering into mutual
                 relations only because of the convention drawn up among them. As
## if these men had dropped from the skies, bringing with them
                 speech, will, original thought, and as if they were alien to anything
## of the earth, that is, anything having social origins.

               In time this view acquired the name “Collectivist Anarchism” to distinguish
            it both from Proudhonian mutualism and, later, from the “Anarchist
            Communism” propounded by Peter Kropotkin. (For a discussion of Kropotkin’s
            Communist views, see pp. 115–116 below.) A mere sketch of Bakunin’s
            theories does not capture the ﬂavor of his writings, the animating spirit that
            catapulted his personality into the foreground of nineteenth-century radical
            history. Although a deeply humane and kindly man (indeed because of his
            intrinsic humanity and kindness) Bakunin did not shrink from violence. He
            faced the problem with disarming candor and refused to dilute the need for
            violence—and the reality of the violence which the ruling classes practiced
            daily in their relations with the oppressed—with a hypocritical-stance of moral
            outrage. “The urge to destroy,” he wrote as a young man, “is also a creative
            urge.” His writings exude a sense of violent rebellion against authority, of
            unrestrained anger against injustice, of ﬁery militancy on behalf of the
            exploited and oppressed. There can be little question that he lived this spirit
            with consistency and great personal daring.
               Beneath the surface of Bakunin’s theories lies the more basic revolt of the
            community principle against the state principle, of the social principle against
            the political principle. Bakuninism, in this respect, can be traced back to
            those subterranean currents in humanity that have tried at all times to restore
            community as the structural unit of social life. Bakunin deeply admired the
            traditional collectivistic aspects of the Russian village, not out of any atavistic
            illusions about the past, but because he wished to see industrial society
            pervaded by its atmosphere of mutual aid and solidarity. Like virtually all the
            intellectuals of his day, he acknowledged the importance of science as a
            means of promoting eventual human betterment; hence the embattled
20 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            atheism and anticlericalism that pervades all his writings. By the same token,
            he demanded that the scientiﬁc and technological resources of society be
            mobilized in support of social cooperation, freedom, and community, instead
            of being abused for proﬁt, competitive advantage, and war. In this respect,
            Mikhail Bakunin was not behind his times, but a century or more ahead of
            them.
              To the young revolutionary Spaniards of the 1860s, to the militant workers
            of Barcelona and the restive land laborers of Andalusia, the ideas propounded
            by Bakunin seemed to crystallize all their vague feelings and thoughts into an
            inspired vision of truth. He provided them with a coherent body of ideas that
            answered admirably to their needs: a vigorous federalism revolutionary in its
            methods, and a radical collectivism rooted in local initiative and decentralist
            social forms. Even his militant atheism seemed to satisfy the strong wave of
            anticlerical feeling that was surging through Spain. The prospect of
            participating in the work of the International held the promise of linking their
            destinies to a worldwide cause of historic dimensipns. Finally, Spain had been
            prepared for Bakunin’s theories not only socially, but als^intellectually. If
            Bakuninist Anarchism was new to Fanelli’s audience, somfe of its elements,
            such as federalism, were familiar topics of discussion in Madrid and
            Barcelona.
              No less important than Bakunin’s federalist ideas were his atheistic views
            and his attacks on clericalism. We shall see that the Spanish church had
            become the strongest single prop of absolutism and reaction in the early
            nineteenth century, later rallying around the Carlist line (the reactionary
            pretenders to the Spanish throne) and the most conservative trends in
            political life. The collusion between the Catholic hierarchy and the Spanish
            ruling classes had completely “undermined the prestige of fhe clergy among
            the working classes,” writes Elena de La Souchere, “and brought about a deChristianization of the masses which is in fact the essential phenomenon of
            the history of Spain in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The
            Spanish bourgeoisie had constructed a perfect city from which the plebians,
            kept beyond the walls, enveloped the clergy in the hate they bore the
            institutions and castes which were admitted to that closed city.”
              Accordingly, as early as 1835, anger against Carlist atrocities in the north
            had led to church burnings in many large towns of Spain. The monks were
            detested as parasites and the higher echelons of the hierarchy were seen as
            simply the clerical equivalents of wealthy secular landowners and bourgeois.
            They were hated all the more fervently because of their religious pretensions
            and their invocations of humility and the virtues of poverty.
              Bakunin’s emphasis on collectivism, so much stronger than Proudhon’s, had
            a particularly wide appeal to the dispossessed rural classes. It conformed
            admirably to their sense of the patria chica, the autonomous village world that
            had been deserted by the ruling classes for a comfortable life in the larger
            provincial cities.
              Similarly, the Robin Hood mentality that permeates so much of Bakunin’s
            thought and, in its own way, forms a conspicuous trait of his own life,
            doubtless had a strong appeal in areas like Andalusia where the peasantry
            had come to venerate the social bandit as an avenger of injustice. In this land
            of the “permanent guerrilla”—a ﬁgure that reaches as far back as the Moorish
21 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            invasion—the lonely band, striking a blow for freedom, had become especially
            dear to the rural poor and nourished a multitude of local myths and legends.
               Finally, Bakunin’s appeal to direct action found a wealth of precedents in
            village and urban uprisings. Lacking even a modicum of protection by the law,
            the Spanish people increasingly relied on their own action for the redress of
            grievances. We shall see that the use of the ballot in Spain was to become
            meaningless, even after universal suﬀrage had been introduced. In many
            Spanish villages, local political bosses, the caciques (generally, landowners,
            but often lawyers and priests) held absolute control over political life. Using
            their economic power and, where necessary, outright coercion, the caciques
            appointed all the local oﬀicials of their districts and “delivered the vote” to
            political parties of their choice. This scandalous system of undisguised
            political manipulation, combined with the repeated coups d’etat—the
            notorious pronunciamientos—of Spanish military oﬀicers, created an
            atmosphere of widespread cynicism toward electoral activity. The Spanish
            people did not have to be convinced by a Russian aristocrat that the state was
            the private domain of the ruling classes; their education came directly from
            the arrogant land magnates and bourgeoisie of their own country.
               Thus, the fact that Guiseppi Fanelli could have scored an immediate triumph
            in Madrid may have been unique, but it need hardly seem too surprising. The
            views he brought with him did not require elaborate theoretical explanation.
            It suﬀiced for his audience to grasp mere shreds of Bakunin’s ideas to feel a
            living aﬀinity between their social problems in Spain and the passionate ideas
            of the Russian exile in Geneva.
            Chapter Two: The Topography of Revolution
              We must now try to see how remarkably well Bakunin’s ideas suited the
            needs of a revolutionary workers’ and peasants’ movement in Spain.
              To nineteenth-century liberalism, the problems of Spain could be reduced to
            a classic formula: a backward agrarian country, faced with the tasks of land
            reform, industrial development, and the creation of a middle-class democratic
            state. The parallel with France on the eve of the Great Revolution is
            unmistakable: a liberal bourgeoisie, demanding a governing voice in the state;
            an absolute monarchy, passing into an advanced state of decomposition; a
            stagnant nobility, lost in darkening memories of its past grandeur; a
            reactionary church, steeped in medievalism; and a savagely exploited working
            class and impoverished, land-hungry peasantry. The consciousness of this
            parallel, almost bordering on fatalism, was so strong that Spanish political
            factions often modeled themselves on Jacobins, Girondins, Royalists, and
            Bonapartists.
              But there were many profound diﬀerences between Spain in the nineteenth
            century and France in the eighteenth. Some of them, such as the emergence
            of a modern industrial proletariat, could be explained by the passage of time.
            Others, however, were peculiar to Spain, and had few historical precedents. It
            is these diﬀerences that account for the extraordinary popularity of Bakunin’s
            Anarchism below the Pyrenees.
              The most striking characteristic of the Iberian Peninsula is its startling
            variety—its variety of landscapes, land tenure, cultural features, and social
22 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            forms. It is the sudden changes in topography that catch the attention of a
            traveler in Spain. Within a few hours, one can pass from green, rolling
            country, with well-watered soil and abundant crops, to baked, arid plains,
            more reminiscent of North Africa than of Europe. “The north western
            provinces,” observed an English traveler a century ago, “are more rainy than
            Devonshire, while the centre plains are more calcined than those of the
            deserts of Arabia, and the littoral south or eastern coasts altogether
            Algerian.”
              For Spain, this has meant not only diﬀerent forms of land tenure, but
            diﬀerent types of agrarian unrest. In the well-watered mountainous north, the
            agricultural economy had long solidiﬁed around small, well-tended farms,
            based on mixed crops and dairy produce. Here, the democratic traditions of
            pre-Moslem Spain were ﬁrmly rooted, and independent peasants, tenants, and
            rentiers mixed on an easy, almost egalitarian basis. The long heritage of
            communal life, almost neolithic in origin, had produced a deeply conservative
            outlook whose spiritual focus was the church and whose anti-Christ was the
            emerging industrial world with its unsettling values, its startling products,
            and its invasive claims on village autonomy. The small, dull-colored villages of
            this great northern region, each hugging its hilltop or mountain ledge like a
            fortress, lived out their ﬁxed cycles of daily life by the incantations of
            dogmatic, often fanatical priests and by codes that often went beyond the
            memory of the most venerable myths.
              By the nineteenth century, these villages had emerged from lethargy and
            isolation to face a world of social and economic upheaval. In their volatile
            response, revolt took the anachronistic form of permanent counterrevolution.
            United by a passionate Catholicism, by an embattled sense of local
            independence, and by deeply rooted communal and patriarchal traditions, the
            peasantry of the northern mountains provided the largest single reservoir of
            political reaction in Spain. In the years to follow, these parochial villages
            produced wave after wave of peasant militia—fearsome men armed with
            scythes, cudgels, and antique guns—led by village priests with a sinister
            reputation for butchery. The ﬁrst of these waves rolled against Napoleon, who
            personiﬁed not only the traditional French invader but also the detested
            French Revolution. Later, in two bloody civil wars, the northern peasantry
            took up arms in support of the Carlist line. We shall see that as the nineteenth
            century drew to a close, new social forces were to dilute this reservoir of
            reaction with liberal, even Socialist, ideals; nevertheless, it was from the
            small landowners of the mountains of Navarre and nearby areas that General
            Franco was to recruit the most enthusiastic domestic masses for his infantry
            in 1936.
              If the north could be regarded as the reactionary Vendee of the French
            Revolution, the Meseta could be regarded as its moderate Gironde. On this
            great, treeless, windswept plateau of central Spain, reaction shaded into a
            cautious liberalism. From the time of the Reconquest, when the Moors were
            driven from the Iberian Peninsula, the Castilians of the central Meseta have
            regarded themselves as the wellsprings of Spanish culture and the
            indisputable heirs of the Spanish state. All other inhabitants of Spain are
            viewed as social inferiors. Yet rarely in history has a “master race” been
            conﬁned to a more inhospitable region of the country under its control. The
23 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            Meseta has a harsh, erratic climate. Its soil, in the absence of irrigation
            works, is poor and demanding. During Fanelli’s day, a traveler would have
            found all the conditions for chronic agrarian revolts: large estates, owned by
            absentee aristocrats and newly rich bourgeois, existing side by side with
            small, wretched farms. Usury and land speculation burdened the plateau to a
            point where many of the lesser nobility were reduced to the material status of
            a peasant. A large population of tenant families, working the land under
            precarious, short-term leases, eked out a miserable subsistence livelihood and
            were totally indiﬀerent to the needs of the soil.
              But this potential for agrarian revolt rarely exploded into a major uprising.
            In contrast to the north, where the church had shrewdly deﬂected peasant
            dissatisfaction into reactionary channels, on the Meseta, chauvinism served
            more as a political instrument of the central government in Madrid (and here
            any comparisons with the French Girondins end) than as the foundations of a
            coherent reactionary ideology. Nearly all social classes, wealthy and poor,
            upheld the supremacy of the central government over Carlism and
            regionalism, but beyond this chauvinistic umbrella, allegiances tended to
            follow economic lines. The landed aristocracy of the Meseta, like its peers
            elsewhere in Spain, remained Catholic and conservative; the rural bourgeoisie
            tended to support the policies of moderate liberalism, when social unrest did
            not stampede it into reactionary causes. The great mass of peasants and
            tenants were politically inert throughout most of the nineteenth century, the
            objects of manipulation by the large landowners; eventually, however, they
            drifted into orderly, bureaucratic Socialist unions.
              All further analogies with the French Revolution come to an end the
            moment one passes southward through the Sierra Morena, one of the most
            important mountain barriers in Spain. North of the Morena lies classical
            Spain: stern, morally rigid, obsessed by an unyielding sense of responsibility
            and duty. To the south lies Andalusia: easygoing, pleasure-loving, and
            delightfully impulsive. This large, populous region had been successively
            colonized by Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, German barbarian
            tribes, and Moors. The Moors held Andalusia for nearly ﬁve centuries and left
            behind a hedonistic tradition that survived the Holy Inquisition, the auto-dafe, and the rule of sullen Castilian bureaucrats. The Romans, who held the
            region even longer than the Moors, left behind the latifundium, a plantation
            economy based on gang labor and bestial conditions of exploitation.
              The latifundium could well be described as the agrarian ulcer of the
            Mediterranean world and in many respects bears comparison with the
            plantation economy of the antebellum American South. Historically rooted in
            slavery, the two shared identical traditions of labor management and common
            forms of land tenure. In the cotton districts around Seville, even the crops
            were the same. Most of the Andalusian latifundia cultivated olives, grapes,
            and grain—the typical crop pattern of Mediterranean agriculture. The long
            rainless summers of the region posed formidable problems of moisture
            conservation. In the absence of agricultural machinery, specially adapted to
            dry farming, large-tracts of land had to be left fallow and sown for crops every
            second or third year. The largest estates tended to congregate in the
            Guadalquiver valley, the huge triangular basin that lies between the Sierra
            Morena and the mountain chains of the southern coast. It was here, in the
24 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            best lands of the most fertile districts of Andalusia, that one found the largest
            holdings, the immense masses of gang labor, and those grotesque economic
            contrasts that gave the region its reputation for misery and agrarian
            rebellion.
               In Andalusia, as far back as Roman times, two classes stood opposed to
            each other: the land magnates and a huge population of landless laborers. If
            the land magnate lived on his estate, his presence was feared by all. If he
            lived in the cities, as was so often the case, the task of managing his
            properties was left to stewards who mercilessly extracted every bit of labor
            from the gang workers beneath them. Between this handful of land magnates
            and the great mass of landless there existed a chasm that few of the
            institutions of oﬀicial Spain could bridge. The church alone had been capable
            of doing so, but with its declining inﬂuence in the latter part of the nineteenth
            century, the last links were broken. It was here, on these immense estates of
            the south, that Spanish Anarchism was to ﬁnd massive popular support.
               To the west of the Meseta, in Estremadura, a traveler found a wild arid
            region stretching from the central plateau to the Portuguese frontier. Most of
            the land was held by a few absentee owners and cultivated by theyunteros, a
            class of rural proletarians who owned nothing but their mule teams. Work was
            seasonal, often uncertain, and rewarded by pittances. Further northward in
            Galicia, Spain’s westernmost province, rural life had sunk to an incredibly low
            material level. If Andalusia was the land of the latifundium, Galicia could be
            called the land of the minifundium, of plots so small that they could scarcely
            support a single family. Turning to the east, along the Mediterranean coastal
            region, the provinces of Valencia and Murcia (the Spanish Levant) included
            irrigated vegas (plains) which were parceled into small prosperous holdings of
            orange growers and inland mountain areas stricken by bitter poverty.
            Politically, the landlords of the vegas vacillated between the Liberal and
            Conservative parties. The peasants of the mountain region were destined to
            provide some of the most militant Anarchists in Spain.
               The uniformity of these major agricultural regions, however, is more
            apparent than real. Within Andalusia, for example, mountain districts
            contained mostly small holdings and communally owned pasture. In the
            lowlands there were many small farmsteads, worked by peasant owners and
            tenants. In the mountainous north, the highlands of Aragon, supported the
            impoverished sheepherders of the Maestrazzo—people who were to be drawn
            to Carlism not because they shared the material prosperity of their northern
            brethren, but on the contrary, because they did not. In the steppe country of
            Aragon, the*chronic material poverty generated by a combination of large
            estates, usury, and land hunger provided a hospitable climate for Anarchism.
            In the vegas of the south, Granada was to form an enclave of socialism,
            despite the surrounding Anarchist sentiment of the rural laborers, while in
            the reactionary mountainous north, islands of Anarchists and
            Anarchosyndicalist unions were to emerge in distant Galicia, in Asturias, and
            in the wine-growing districts of the upper Ebro valley.
               Spain, however, is a land of startling contrasts not only in its geography and
            land tenure. The contrasts extend also to cultures which, in the case of the
            Basques and Catalans, verge on fairly distinct nations. The Basques occupy
            the Atlantic area of the north forming a corner with France, in which live

            another sizeable portion of their people. Basque is an ancient language
            unrelated to any other in Europe. A deeply pious, outwardly stern people,
            whose sense of self-discipline is relaxed in buoyant songs and satiric
            pantomines, the Basques succeeded in holding ﬁrmly to their independence
            and unique ways of life for centuries. Economically oriented toward Atlantic
            Europe, they managed to resist Latinization and only nominally fell under
            Roman rule. During the Middle Ages, they successfully kept Visigothic,
            Frankish, and Moorish invaders from occupying their ancestral lands. For two
            centuries, between the tenth and thirteenth, nearly all the Basques of Spain
            were united in the Navarrese kingdom—the Christian kingdom that played so
            large a part in the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors.
               The advance of the Castilian state in the Meseta gradually pared away their
            liberties, driving them into unsuccessful revolts and ﬁnally into the Carlist
            camp. In the meantime, their ports began to grow and their trade with Europe
            expanded steadily. Bilboa, owing to its proximity to high-grade iron-ore mines
            and the Asturian coal ﬁelds, soon became the most important steel-produdng
            city in Spain. Basque ﬁnanciers played a leading role in all phases of the
            Spanish economy and Basque shipping magnates succeeded in gathering the
            bulk of Spanish merchant tonnage into their hands. This industrial and
            ﬁnancial bourgeoisie, one of the most modern and businesslike in Spain, soon
            began to subsidize a moderate nationalist movement— devoutly Catholic in
            religion, liberal in economic policy, reformist in social program and politics.
            The Basque working class, recruited largely from the conservative peasantry
            of the coastal mountains, was never infused with the kind of revolutionary
            fervor that emanated from Barcelona. Although some steel workers turned to
            Anarchosyndicalism, the majority of the Basque workers divided their
            loyalties between Catholic and Socialist unions.
               Traditionally oriented toward the north, beyond the Pyrenees, Catalonia was
            never an organic part of Spain. Rather, it belonged to the vigorous,
            progressive langue d’oc civilization of southern France, and northern Italy.
            The Catalan language is akin to Provencal, not to Spanish, although both are
            Latin tongues. The “crusade” against the Albigensian heresy in the thirteenth
            century shattered this colorful world but left many of its cultural roots intact.
            Deﬁnitively separated from France, their trade ruined by the Turkish
            conquest of Constantinople, the Catalans were compelled to turn away from
            the north and look toward the Iberian Peninsula. They never liked what they
            saw. A sophisticated merchant people, with an urbane cultural lineage of their
            own, the Catalans never ceased to harbor separatist tendencies. By the early
            nineteenth century, the centrifugal forces created by culture were reinforced
            by industrial development. At a point in history when all the institutions of the
            Castilian state in Madrid were in visible decomposition, a viable industrial
            bourgeoisie and proletariat had emerged not in the center of Spain, but on its
            periphery. The Basque country and Catalonia each presented economic,
            political, and cultural demands that threatened to undermine the entire
            traditional structure of Spain as it had been known since the Reconquest.
               Even more threatening to the centralized state than regional nationalism is
            the intense localism of Spanish social life: the patria chica (literally, “small
            fatherland”), an almost untranslatable term that denotes the. village and its
            immediate region—in short, the living arena of the rural Spaniard’s world.
26 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
               The Spanish word for village is pueblo. Pueblo also means “people,” and this
            is by no means accidental. J.A. Pitt-Rivers, who devoted years of study to
            Spanish village life in Andalusia, notes that “the Greek word for polis far more
            nearly translates ‘pueblo’ than any English word, for the community is not
            merely a geographical or political unit, but the unit of society in every
            context. The pueblo furnishes a completeness of human relations which make
            it the prime concept of all social thought.”[4]
               For the traditional pueblo, this completeness involved not only a deep sense
            of moral unity, common purpose, and mutual aid, but also a body of rights, or
            fueros, which deﬁned the community’s autonomy in local aﬀairs and protected
            it from the encroachment of outside authority. Many fueros were born from
            the needs of the Reconquest, when the kings of Spain granted local privileges
            for military aid against the Moors. Others were granted by the monarchy in
            order to gain municipal support against intractable nobles and military
            orders. But there were fueros, such as those of the Basques, which were
            never “granted” at all, indeed, which go back to a far-distant time when chiefs
            and later monarchs were democratically elected by popular village
            assemblies. Elena de La Souchere observes that the Moorish invasion, by
            shattering the Romano-Germanic state, indirectly fostered the resurrection of
            these very early social forms. The Iberians of the northern mountains who had
            successfully resisted Roman, German, and Moorish inﬂuence were destined
            not only to spearhead the Reconquest, “but to perfect and even bring back to
            other parts of the country their peculiar institutions and customs.”
               That the fueros retained their vitality after the Reconquest was due,
            ironically, to the nature of the Spanish monarchy and to its impact on
            economic life. The immense wealth that Spain had acquired from her empire
            did not go to the Spanish middle classes. It ﬁlled the coﬀers of the absolutist
            monarchy (perhaps the earliest of its kind in modern times) and was
            eventually dissipated in imperial adventures to control Europe and the
            peninsula. This steady drain of potential capital, of resources that might have
            been invested in industrial development, led to the contraction of domestic
            trade and the decay of the Spanish bourgeoisie.
               Marx, who understood Spain better than many of his Spanish disciples,
            notes that as commerce and industry declined and as the early bourgeois
            towns began to stagnate, “internal exchanges became rare, the mingling of
            diﬀerent provinces less frequent, and the great roads gradually deserted.”
            This sweeping economic decline in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
            greatly strengthened the local life of the pueblos and regions. Spain and the
            Spanish state began to acquire ineﬀable qualities. Although the monarchy had
            all the trappings of absolutism, its control over the country was often nominal
            or nonexistent. Spain could be deﬁned with geographic exactitude on a map
            in periods of peace, but an invader soon found, much to his chagrin, that it
            dissolved into many Spains in times of war. Marx shrewdly observes that
            Napoleon, who regarded Spain “as an inanimate corpse,” was astonished to
            ﬁnd “that when the Spanish State was dead, Spanish society was full of life,
            and every part of it overﬂowing with powers of resistance.”
               The fueros, which this unique development fostered, helped to provide a
            sturdiness to the pueblo that no amount of bureaucratic structuring could
            possibly match. They also generated those centrifugal forces that continually
27 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            threatened the central power, or at least challenged the validity of its
            functions. What need had Spaniards for a distant, bureaucratic, anonymous
            state when their pueblos, human in scale, intimate in cohesion, with a
            comforting solidarity and spirit of mutual aid, could meet most of their social
            and material needs? What need was there for a remote political entity, for
            vague legal generalities, when the fueros provided Spaniards with highly
            democratic guidelines for social management? Spaniards graded their
            allegiances from below to above, from pueblo to locality, from locality to
            region, and from region to province, reserving the least loyalty, if any still
            remained, for the centralized state in Madrid. This intense feeling for
            community, for the human scale, for selfmanagement, made the Spaniard
            highly susceptible to libertarian ideas and methods. Transported into an
            urban environment, this propensity for localism turned the city into a
            composite of pueblos, the trade union into a patria chica, the factory into a
            community.
            Chapter Three: The Beginning
            The International in Spain
              As for the nuclei Fanelli left behind in Spain in 1869, little was heard from
            them for a time.
              Before his departure from Madrid, the Italian had given his admiring group
            of workers a small miscellaneous legacy of written material: the statutes of
            the International, the program and regulations of the Bakuninist Alliance of
            Social Democracy, the rules of a Swiss workingmen’s society, and several
            radical periodicals which included articles and speeches by Bakunin. These
            precious texts were carefully studied, discussed, and passed around
            (presumably in translation), until the ﬂedgling Madrid Anarchists began to
            feel assured and conﬁdent of their views. They called themselves
            “Internationalists,” and were to do so for years, basking in the mounting
            prestige of the great workers’ International north of the Pyrenees.
              They also began to write letters to the International’s General Council in
            London, but rarely received a reply. It may have been that the General
            Council, dominated by Bakunin’s opponent, Karl Marx, was suspicious of the
            new “oﬀicial section” in Madrid, or it may have been sheer negligence; in any
            event, the Madrid Internationalists maintained close ties with Bakunin and his
            friends in Geneva, and they began to cast around for support in their own city.
              But this raised a diﬀicult question: what could a revolutionary group,
            oriented toward the working class, hope to achieve in the Spanish capital?
            Madrid, the administrative center of the Spanish crown, had no proletariat in
            any modern sense of the word. A new city by Iberian standards, Philip II had
            turned it into a capital in order to provide the country with a sorely needed
            geographic and political center. It was not until the eighteenth century, under
            the Bourbon kings, that Madrid reached sizable proportions. At the time of
            Fanelli’s visit, the capital city of Spain had no industry to speak of. Its
            proletariat consisted of craftsmen, working by traditional standards in small
            shops, and its market was composed of petty government oﬀicials, courtiers,
28 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            soldiers, an emerging commerical middle class, and a large number of
            intellectuals attracted by the University of Madrid and by the city’s
            burgeoning cultural life. Anarchism in the Spanish capital was largely to
            reﬂect these social traits. The Madrid organization eventually attracted many
            intellectuals and became one of the major theoretical centers of the Anarchist
            movement in Spain.
              The early Internationalists in the capital, however, began in confusion over
            their aims and methods. A substantial number of the original group, those
            who were actually Republicans, Masons, and cooperativists, simply dropped
            away. The remainder, after sorting out their ideas and the material ‘Fanelli
            had left behind, began to hold public meetings and attract local attention. The
            ﬁrst of these meetings was held in a barn-like warehouse on Valencia Street
            which the janitor, a newly won supporter by the name of Jalvo, had opened to
            the Internationalists. Typical of the early enthusiasm and recklessness that
            marked the movement, Jalvo’s gesture could have easily jeopardized his job,
            possibly exposing him .to arrest, for the warehouse was a municipal building
            used to store materials for public festivals. Fortunately, the authorities did not
            take the movement too seriously, and Jalvo suﬀered no reprisals.
              The Madrid section of the International expanded rapidly. The early
            meetings also attracted a number of canny Republican orators who were
            looking for a base in the labor movement and tried to take over the newly
            formed section. But Fanelli had done his work well, and they were ﬁrmly
            resisted. Faced with these well-attended meetings, Lorenzo and his comrades
            now began the diﬀicult task of giving their movement some organizational
            coherence. They threw their net far, reaching out to the Masons (whom
            Lorenzo describes sympathetically as “auxiliaries” of the International),
            cultural groups, mutual-aid societies, and even economic liberals. By early
            1870—a year after Fanelli’s departure—the Madrid section of the
            International claimed a membership of two thousand and had started
            publishing a local periodical, La Solidaridad, to propagate its views. This
            membership ﬁgure was probably inﬂated by the inclusion of many individuals
            and groups with a very tenuous relationship to the section and with no clear
            understanding of its revolutionary goals. Yet it is clear that by 1870 the
            Anarchist movement was ﬁrmly rooted in Madrid.
              If success is to be gauged by numerical following, the new movement was
            even more successful in Barcelona. In contrast to Madrid, the great Catalan
            seaport was a major textile center, the biggest in Spain, with a large industrial
            working class. Although Barcelona had been renowned for its cloth products
            for centuries the industrial development of the city in any modern sense of the
            word did not begin until the late 1840s, when steam-powered cotton factories
            were widely established. A decade later, engravings show the old port district
            surrounded by factory chimneys. Most of these concerns were not large; they
            normally employed between ten and twenty workers and were owned by
            moderately well-to-do bourgeois families. But there were also spectacular
            industrial dynasties, such as the Guells, the Muntada brothers, and the Serra
            brothers, employing thousands of unskilled workers and producing cheap
            cotton cloth for the villages and towns of Spain.
              The average Barcelona factory operative worked long hours and at nearsubsistence wages (see pp. 51–52 below), living with his or her family in
29 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            hovels that often lacked adequate ventilation and sanitary facilities. This
            degraded way of life, scarred by toil and poverty, was menaced continually by
            technological unemployment and by lay-oﬀs due to economic slumps. Reduced
            to an animal level of existence, the Barcelona proletariat seethed with a futile
            outrage that found partial outlet^n “Luddism”: the destruction of machinery
            and factory buildings. In 1836, during an upsurge of working-class unrest, a
            Barcelona crowd burned down the Bonaplata factory, a new steam-powered
            enterprise that produced not only fabrics but textile machinery. Factory
            burnings and the destruction of self-acting spindles also opened the labor
            struggles of 1854, but this time Barcelona was swept by a general strike in
            which workers marched under the slogan, “Association or Death.” The right to
            form trade unions, denied by law under nearly all the regimes of that period,
            had now become a paramount demand of the Catalan working class.
              Despite the failure of the strike, the movement toward association was
            irrepressible. This became evident in the mid-1860s when, under the tolerant
            administration of a Liberal government, underground workers’ organizations
            suddenly surfaced, established two successful, widely read newspapers, and
            in 1865 held an impressive congress. The movement was suppressed a year
            later with the fall of the Liberals, but it thrived below the surface, publicly
            appearing in such forms as cultural circles and educational societies. Around
            the time of Fanelli’s last visit to Barcelona, the most militant workers’ groups
            were organized around the Federal Center of Workers’ Societies (Centro
            Federal de las Sociedades Obreras). Politically, the Federal Center made
            common cause with the Republicans, supporting their demand for a federal
            republic. Economically, it favored privately ﬁnanced cooperatives. A workers’
            Congress of over sixty societies, held in Barcelona on December 12–13, 1868,
            declared its support for these moderate forms and circumspectly avoided any
            demands that might alienate their Republican allies.
              It was on this diﬀuse labor movement, committed to a bourgeois political
            alliance, that the Barcelona nucleus of the International went to work. The
            moving spirit of the nucleus was unquestionably Rafael Farga Pellicer, who
            had been deeply impressed by Fanelli’s speech in his uncle’s study. The group
            of Internationalists formed after the Italian’s departure was soon reinforced
            by new, extremely able people: the physican Gaspar Sentinon; Jose Garcia
            Vinas, a medical student from Malaga; Trinidad Soriano, a technical student;
            and Antonio Gonzalez Meneses, an engineering student from Cadiz. By May
            1869, the nucleus felt strong enough to constitute itself oﬀicially as the
            Barcelona section of the International Workingmen’s Association. To the call
            for a “federal democratic republic,” issued by the Workers’ Congress, the new
            group replied with a demand for “Socialism,” ﬁrmly declaring its
            dissatisfaction with mere reforms and change in government.
              Despite this strong expression of intransigence, the Internationalists
            proceeded slowly and cautiously. A printer by trade, Farga Pellicer attended
            the Workers’ Congress in December, two months prior to Fanelli’s second trip
            to Barcelona; there, he had openly congratulated the delegates on their
            support for a federal republic and their plan to establish a newspaper! His
            relations with the Federal Center were excellent and the pages of its newly
            established organ, La Federation, were open to the expression of
            Internationalist opinions. In a letter to Bakunin he describes the basic
30 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            strategy of the Barcelona nucleus as a threefold approach: to defend
            Socialism in “a prudent manner”in La Federation, to bring the regulations of
            the Federal Center into accord with the spirit of the International, and to
            strengthen the organizational inﬂuence of the nucleus on the workers’
            societies.
               Within a few months, this strategy succeeded. Internationalists were
            elected presidents of several workers’ societies and La Federation essentially
            became an Internationalist organ, the Barcelona counterpart of Madrid’s La
            Solidaridad. By 1870, the Federal Center and presumably most of its aﬀiliates
            declared for the International, bringing thousands of industrial workers into
            an Anarchist-inﬂuenced movement. This inﬂuence, it should be stressed, was
            exercised with care. The great majority of the workers and their leaders were
            not conscious Anarchists, certainly not in any revolutionary sense of the word.
            Indeed, as we shall see later, the entry of the Federal Center into the
            International was an alliance, not an act of organic unity, between a small
            group of Anarchist militants and a numerically larger trade-union apparatus.
            But it foreshadowed a time when Anarchist ideas were to saturate the Spanish
            labor movement and produce a genuinely revolutionary mass organization
            based on Anarchosyndicalism.
               From Madrid and Barcelona, the ideas of the International began to spread
            into the provinces of Spain. Newspapers and propagandists began to appear
            in Andalusia, Aragon, the Levant, and in rural areas of Catalonia, the two
            Castiles, and Galicia. Gradually the movement took hold outside of the two
            great cities. In February 1870, La Solidaridad issued a call for a national
            congress of all sections of the International in Spain. After consultations with
            the Catalans over a suitable place, it was decided to convene at Barcelona in
            late June.
               During those few months before the congress the Anarchists did a great
            deal of careful planning and preparation. After Fanelli’s ﬁnal departure from
            Barcelona in the winter of 1869, Farga and Sentinon had carried on a lively
            correspondence with Bakunin. About a half year later, in September, the two
            Spaniards attended the worldwide congress of the International in Basel,
            where Bakunin scored a shortlived triumph over Marx and his supporters.
            There, Bakunin not only solidifjgd their adherence to Anarchism but initiated
            them into a secret group, originally named the “International Brotherhood,”
            which the Russian had formed years earlier during his long sojourn in the
            heady, conspiratorial atmosphere of Italy. (Although the original “International
            Brotherhood” (Fraternit’e Internationale) was formally dissolved early in
            1869,[5] have retained this name in quotation marks to designate the small
            group of conﬁdantes who surrounded Bakunin during the later years of his
            life.)
               The key role played the various Bakuninist organizations—the “International
            Brotherhood” and its successor, the Alliance of Social Democracy—in the
            development of the International in Spain requires examination here before
            proceeding with our account of the planned congress in Barcelona.
               Bakunin’s “International Brotherhood” has been dealt with derisively as a
            hierarchical, elitist organization which stands in blatant contradiction to his
            libertarian principles. This contradiction in my view is very real. Bakunin had
            intended the “International Brotherhood” to be a secret organization of
31 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            Anarchist militants, led in tightly disciplined fashion by a highly centralized
            group of initiates—indeed, by what amounted to a revolutionary general staﬀ.
            The Russian never resolved the need to bring his organizational theories and
            practices into complete accord with his libertarian social ideals. He seemed
            quite sincerely to regard both his followers and himself as highly moral and
            dedicated individuals who could survive the sordid aspects of organizational
            life without becoming authoritarians, perhaps even shielding weaker
            individuals and less committed organizations from the temptations of power
            and authority. Bakunin’s followers often rebelled against this obvious
            contradiction between theory and practice, forcing the Russian to accede to a
            looser, more libertarian type of organization. The result is that the
            “Brotherhood” and its organizational heirs remained nebulous, shadowy, and
            never developed a hierarchy; indeed, it is doubtful if its numbers ever
            exceeded a few score individuals.
               The “Brotherhood” was expected to play a guiding role in still another
            organization, the Alliance of Social Democracy which Bakunin’s comrades had
            formed over his objections in 1868, shortly before Fanelli’s journey to Spain.
            Farga Pellicer and Sentinon, in fact, had helped form the Spanish section of
            the Alliance months before they knew anything about the “Brotherhood.” In
            contrast to the “Brotherhood,” this organization was to be an open, public
            movement and was clearly Anarchist in program despite the apparent
            innocence of its name. Declaring itself for the abolition of classes, property,
            and the right of inheritance, the Alliance recognized “no form of state” and
            demanded that “all the political and authoritarian states at present should be
            reduced to mere administrative functions of public services.”
               To Marx, the presiding spirit of the International’s General Council in
            London, this amounted to a de facto rejection of electoral and political
            activity, a position he strongly opposed. When the Alliance applied for
            membership in the Internationa] late in 1868, its rejection by the Genera]
            Council was almost preordained. In order to circumvent the Council’s
            decision, the Alliance oﬀicially dissolved itself, calling upon its sections to
            become sections of the International. In reality these sections continued to
            exist as secret Bakuninist nuclei. In Spain, the Alliance essentially became a
            small underground organization within the larger, open arena provided by the
            Spanish sections of the International. By the early summer of 1870, the
            sections numbered between twenty and thirty thousand members, with scores
            of groups in diﬀerent parts of the country.
               In the sixty years following Fanelli’g visit, the fortunes of Spanish
            Anarchism were destined to ﬂuctuate sharply and dramatically. During
            periods of repression, the movement was to contract to a few isolated nuclei
            of dedicated militants, only to surge forward and embrace ever larger masses
            of oppressed. Gradually, Anarchist groups were to take root in a multitude of
            Andalusian villages as well as in major cities and industrial centers. They
            were to establish tendrils in the mountain communities of Murcia, in the
            towns of the Ebro valley, in the remote ﬁshing villages of the Galician coast.
            Long after the Anarchist movement had waned in the rest of Europe, it was to
            ﬁnd a rich soil below the Pyrenees, nourished by the devotion of thousands of
            workers and peasants. Only the scythe of fascism could remove this wild
            luxuriant growth from the Iberian Peninsula—and with it the revolutionary

            passion of Spain.
            The Congress of 1870
              On the morning of Sunday, June 18, 1870, about one hundred delegates
            representing 150 workers’ societies in thirty-six localities of Spain convened
            in the Teatro del Circo of Barcelona for the ﬁrst congress of the Spanish
            section of the International. The congress proposed ﬁve months earlier by La
            Solidaridad, the Madrid organ of the International, had now become a reality.
              The Teatro was ﬁlled to overﬂowing. The ﬁrst rows of seats were reserved
            for delegates, but workers had come in large groups to express their
            solidarity, occupying every seat, ﬁlling the hallways, and spilling out beyond
            the entrance. A tribune occupied the center of the stage. In the background
            there was an array of red ﬂags, and overhead, a large red banner proclaiming
            in gold letters—“No rights without duties, no duties without rights!“1 Tools
            were decoratively arranged on both wings to symbolize labor and tables were
            placed on the extremes of the stage for pro tem secretaries of the congress.
              The congress was opened by Rafael Farga Pellicer, who appeared suddenly
            on the deserted stage, rang a hand bell, and extended the following greetings:
                 “Comrade delegates: those of you who gather here to aﬀirm the
                 great work of the International Workingmen’s Association, which
                 contains within itself the complete emancipation of the proletariat
                 and the absolute extirpation of all injustices which have ruled and
                 still rule over the face of the earth; those of you who come to
                 fraternize with the millions of workers, white slaves and black
                 slaves, under the red banner which covers us; dear brothers, in the
                 name of the workers of Barcelona, peace and greetings!”[6]
               The hortatory style with its use of superlatives, its largeness of perspective,
            its intense internationalism, and its high-minded tone, all sincere and very
            deeply felt, was to be characteristic of Anarchist speeches in Spain. Farga
            made no attempt to conceal or subdue tiis radical views. “The state,” he
            declared, “is the guardian and defender of the privileges that the Church
            makes divine.... We wish to end the rule of the capital, of the state and of the
            Church by constructing on their ruins Anarchy—the free federation of free
            associations of workers.”
               The speaker, we are told, was interrupted continually by “formidable
            thunderclaps” and the audience was “visibly moved.” An atmosphere of
            “felicity” and enthusiasm pervaded the Teatro, to which greetings from the
            Swiss and Belgian sections of the International added a sense of historic
            purpose and worldwide fraternity. In the afternoon, the delegates rose one by
            one to report on the conditions in their factories. Their accounts leave us a
            bitter picture of the misery that pervaded the lives of the Spanish workers
            during the 1870s. The report of Bove, a Barcelona textile worker, is typical.
            The workers, he tells us, are exploited from ﬁve in the morning to late at
            night. Women work from ten to ﬁfteen hours for less than a dollar, and in
            some factories, for as much as eighteen hours for little more than a dollar.
            Other delegates report that eleven, sixteen, and eighteen hours of daily work
33 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            are typical in the textile enterprises around Barcelona and Tarragona. Farres,
            a delegate of the steam workers, speaks for “a sad and lamentable group in
            which the capitalists have declared men useless for work and replaced them
            with women and children. Take this into consideration, for only the man is
            useful for this [heavy] work and not the women. The men do not know what to
            do because they were not born to steal but to work.”
               These harsh realities contrasted starkly with the glowing hopes that opened
            and animated the congress. Each session moved along smoothly, often in an
            atmosphere of spontaneous, even tumuluous enthusiasm, and no restraints
            were placed on controversy or the free expression of opinion. But as we have
            seen, the proceedings had been carefully planned and prepared by a
            conscious, well-organized group of Anarchists, members of Bakunin’s Alliance
            of Social Democracy.
               It was these Aliancistas—this hidden Anarchist faction in Spain, known
            perhaps to only a few hundred initiates—that guided the proceedings at the
            Teatro del Circo. They prepared the agenda of the congress, staﬀed its key
            commissions, and provided the most articulate and informed speakers at its
            sessions. The Aliancistas had little need of manipulation for they enjoyed
            enormous prestige among the delegates to the congress. They were the actual
            founders of the International in Spain. So closely were the origins of the
            International linked to the Alliance that Fanelli’s disciples had initially
            adopted the Alliance’s program for the Madrid and Barcelona sections. It was
            not until the spring of 1870, when the Alliance was formally established in
            Spain as an independent body, that the two organizations became
            ideologically distinguishable. At the congress of 1870, the Aliancistas set
            about to give the Spanish section of the International a broader program, one
            that would be more in accord with the needs of a loose federation of workers’
            and peasants’ trade unions.
               This new program, however, was not foisted on the congress. It developed
            out of controversies in the “commissions” on various social issues and in
            debates on the ﬂoor of the Teatro del Circo. In addition to the Anarchists, at
            least three tendencies surfaced at the congress: an ineﬀectual miscellany of
            “associatarians,” who were mainly interested in fostering producers’ and
            consumers’ cooperative associations within the existing social order; a
            “political” group which was occupied with mobilizing labor support for the
            Republican parties; and ﬁnally, the most important and enduring tendency of
            all, the trade unionists “pure-and-simple,” a group concerned largely with
            immediate economic struggles over wages, hours, and working conditions—
            and a group, as we shall see, that was to function in later periods as a
            restraining force on the more militant and revolutionary Anarchists. Virtually
            all of these tendencies employed an expansive revolutionary rhetoric, giving
            lip-service to a distant egalitarian future, but they divided sharply with the
            Anarchists on the critical issues of the speciﬁcs needed to achieve this new
            society.
               The views of the “associatarians” seem to have evoked very little interest
            from the congress. A report by a “commission on the theme of cooperation,”
            obviously Anarchist-inspired, dismissed the importance of producers’
            cooperatives under capitalism: they would represent simply one more
            institution within the bourgeois framework. But the report did emphasize the
34 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            practical role consumers’ cooperatives could play in promoting “cooperative
            habits” and a spirit of mutual aid among the workers. In dealing with
            cooperatives as an educational means, rather than as a social end that could
            achieve a new society within capitalism, the report scaled down the entire
            issue, boxing the “associatarians” into a faddist social limbo. On this issue,
            the congress of 1870 represented a turning point, marking the decline of the
            Proudhonian tradition which had once been so important in the Spanish labor
            movement. Henceforth, any discussion of cooperatives was to be tied to
            problems of social revolution, not piecemeal reform.
              Perhaps the sharpest conﬂict within the congress centered around the
            attitude of the Spanish section toward politics. The Aliancistas advocated
            political abstention. This position, as Casimiro Marti observes in his study on
            early Catalan Anarchism, “pointed up in a clear manner the immediate
            consequences of the new orientation adopted by the workers’ movement. It
            was not now a question of a simple complaint, of a protest, more or less
            violent, against particular injustices, but of refusing to participate in political
            activity by virtue of a, total and unconditional break with the constituted
            society.” Abstention from politics amounted to unconditional support for
            “direct action oriented toward the suppression of the State....”
              An overstatement, perhaps, but essentially true. Although the non-Anarchist
            tendencies at the congress were prepared to concede such abstractions as
            cooperative or communal visions of the future society to their Aliancisla
            opponents, they rallied against a strict policy of political abstention and direct
            action. After much dispute, a compromise was worked out in which the
            congress, while committing itself organizationally to an antistatist and
            abstentionist stand, left individual members free to act as they chose in the
            political arena.
              This was a serious setback for the Anarchists. They were not trying to make
            the International’s program identical to that of the Alliance, for that would
            have conﬁned the International exclusively to revolutionary forms of action.
            On the contrary, they were eager for the two organizations to be
            diﬀerentiated in many important respects, both programmatically and
            structurally. But they knew that any compromise on the issue of political
            abstention threatened to open the International to a reformist perspective,
            involving it largely in the amelioration of existing economic and political
            abuses. The compromise, in fact, was to have serious implications for the
            future, for it provided a formula by which the International and its heirs in
            Spain were to make theoretical acknowledgments to principle but function
            opportunistically in practice. Although the compromise was carried by the
            congress, it was scarcely hailed with enthusiasm: nearly 40 percent of the
            delegates either voted against it or abstained. Most-of these negative votes
            and abstentions came from delegates of the Barcelona working class.
              The most important single achievement of the congress was in the realm of
            organization. The “commission on the theme of the social organization of the
            workers” proposed a structure which was to remain the framework of the
            Spanish section for several years afterward and which the Aliancistas hoped
            to advance as a model for the International as a whole at its next conference
            in London in 1871. This structure is worth examining in some detail. It
            anticipates in many respects the syndicalist form of organization adopted by
35 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            the French labor movement in the 1890s, a form that later spread to other
            European countries and surfaced again in Spain.
               The commission proposed a dual structure for the Spanish section of the
            International (or as it was henceforth to be called, the Spanish Regional
            Federation): organization by trade and organization by locality. On the one
            hand, local trade organizations (Secciones de oﬁcio) grouped together all
            workers from a common enterprise and vocation into a large occupational
            federation (Uniones de oﬁcio) whose primary function was to struggle around
            economic grievances and working conditions. A local organization of
            miscellaneous trades (Secciones de oﬁcio varios) gathered up all those
            workers from diﬀerent vocations whose numbers were too small to constitute
            eﬀective organizations along vocational lines. On the other hand, in every
            community and region where the International was represented, the diﬀerent
            local Secciones were grouped together, irrespective of vocation, into bodies
            (Federaciones locales) whose function was avowedly revolutionary—the
            administration of social and economic life on a decentralized, libertarian
            basis.
               This dual structure forms the bedrock of all syndicalist organization. In
            Spain, as elsewhere, the structure was knitted together by workers’
            committees, which originated in individual shops, factories, and agricultural
            communities. Gathering together in assemblies, the workers elected from
            their midst the committees that presided over the aﬀairs of the Secciones de
            oﬁcio and the Federaciones locales; these were federated into regional, or
            comarcal, committees for nearly every geographic area of Spain. The workers,
            moreover, elected the delegates to the annual congresses of the Spanish
            Regional Federation, which in turn elected a Federal Council.
               Although all committees were directly accountable to the assemblies that
            elected them, bureaucratization was a constant possibility and concern. The
            danger of bureaucracy, manipulation, and centralized control exists in any
            system of indirect representation. It is not very diﬀicult for an elaborate
            network of committees, building up to regional and national bodies, to
            circumvent the wishes of the workers’ assemblies at the base of the structure.
            This actually happened in France, when a corps of opportunistic syndicalists,
            Socialists, and later, Communists acquired cpntrol of the French General
            Confederation of Labor (CGT).
               A bureaucracy never really solidiﬁed in the Spanish Regional Federation or
            its syndicalist heirs, at least not before the Civil War of 1936. Fortunately or
            not, the periodic waves of government or employer persecution that broke
            over the Spanish syndicalist unions made a union leader’s position an
            unenviable one. Moreover, the Anarchists functioned as a steady and
            unsettling counterweight to bureaucratization (despite their own occasional
            tendencies to manipulate the unions under their control). They kept the labor
            movement in a state of continual ferment and-never ceased to emphasize the
            need for decentralization, control from below, and direct action. Ultimately, it
            was their inﬂuence on the Spanish labor movement which proved decisive. In
            the decades to follow, they were to give it a depth of passion and an intensity
            of revolutionary idealism which has never been equaled by workers’ unions
            elsewhere in the world.
               We must look closely at these men and women, these Spanish Anarchists,
36 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            and try to gain an understanding of their lives, their fervor, and their
            dedication to the “Idea.” Although the founding nuclei of Spanish Anarchism
            included many intellectuals and students (such ﬁgures as Gaspar Sentinon,
            Trinidad Soriano, Antonio Gonzalez Meneses, and Fermin Salvochea), most of
            the individuals entering the growing libertarian groups of the cities were
            ordinary workers. Even the journalists, theoreticians, and historians of this
            movement were largely self-educated people of proletarian origin who often
            taught themselves to read and write or attended union and libertarian
            schools, acquiring their learning by sheer doggedness in the nighttime hours
            after work. The majority of them had been sent into factory jobs early in life.
            And later came the responsibilities of family life, of rearing children and
            maintaining a home. These Anarchists took great pride in their vocational
            skills and were viewed with immense respect by their fellow workers. Most of
            them were intensely serious and high-minded individuals. They were also
            open, candid, and like most Spaniards, passionately devoted to their friends
            and comrades.
              They were individuals with very strong personalities. For example, more
            dedicated men, once having decided to embrace the “Idea,” abjured smoking
            and drinking, avoided brothels, and purged their talk of “foul” language. They
            believed these traits to be “vices”—demeaning to free people and fostered
            deliberately by ruling classes to corrupt and enslave the workers spiritually. It
            was the duty of every obrera consciente, of every conscious’ worker and
            esp^ﬁally of an Anarchist, to live by his or her principles, not merely to avow
            them. By the example of the probity and dignity of their daily lives, such
            workers would help uplift the rest of their class. Without this moral
            regeneration of the proletariat, the revolution would eventually be vitiated by
            all the corruptive realities of bourgeois society.
              What these Spanish Anarchists aimed for, in eﬀect, was a “countersociety”
            to the old one. It is easy to mistake this for an “alternate society,” one that
            would coexist with capitalism as an enclave of purity and freedom, but
            nothing could be further from the truth. The Spanish Anarchists expressly
            rejected the concept of an “alternate society,” with its hope of peaceful
            reconstruction and its privileged position in a world of general misery. They
            regarded the cooperativist movement as a diversion from the main task of
            overthrowing capitalism and the state. Since social or personal freedom could
            not be acquired within the established order, they viewed a “countersociety”
            as a terrain in which to remake themselves into revolutionaries and remove
            their interests from any stake in bourgeois society. But this terrain was a
            completely embattled one. Eventually, Anarchist groups formulated their own
            revolutionary codes, their own concepts of freedom, and created a world of
            intimate comradeship and solidarity that proved almost impregnable to
            repression.
              The most dedicated Spanish Anarchists not only denied the laws, values,
            and morality of the existing society, but set out to translate precept into
            practice. They did not enter into legal marriages. They refused to register the
            births of their children or to baptize them. The bureaucracy, state, and church
            were the Anarchists’ mortal enemies; any voluntary dealings with these
            institutions were to be avoided. Children were sent to libertarian or union
            schools. If these were not available, they went to nonclerical institutions or
37 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            were taught at home. Parents would often give their children names like
            “Libertaria” (a favorite for the daughters of Anarchist militants) or
            “Emancipacion”; they might even exchange their own ﬁrst names for those of
            Anarchist heroes or martyrs. They disdained the accumulation of money, and
            if in later years there was much bank-robbing by Anarchists, the funds went
            entirely to the movement or to libertarian schools and publishing projects.
            They did not hesitate to use weapons in defending their own rights or in acts
            of retribution against oﬀicial violence.
               I shall take up the question of Anarchist violence in its proper context. At
            this point it might be more appropriate to give attention to the humaneness
            that permeated the outlook and ideals of Spanish Anarchism. The organized,
            oﬀicial violence that the Spanish worker encountered almost daily, even in the
            form of entertainment, genuinely horriﬁed these earnest libertarians. Shocked
            by the cruelty and brutalizing eﬀect of the bullﬁght, for example, the Spanish
            Anarchists waged a persisent campaign to discourage attendance at the
            corrida and to arouse in the workers and peasants an interest in books,
            culture, and the serious discussion of ideas. Accordingly, wherever the
            Spanish Regional Federation had a substantial following it established centros
            obreros, which functioned not merely as union headquarters but as cultural
            centers. Depending upon its resources, the centro obrero might provide
            literature, books, classes, and meeting halls for discussions on a wide variety
            of subjects. This institution exercised a profound inﬂuence on the personal life
            of the worker who belonged to Anarchist-inﬂuenced unions. Ricardo Mella,
            one of the most able Anarchist theorists and essayists of that period, recalls
            that in Seville “with its enormous centro obrero, capable of holding thousands
            of people, morality in the customs [of workers] took hold to such a degree that
            drunkenness was banished. No worker would have dared or have been
            permitted to appear drunk at the door of the great popular building.”
               Anarchist-inﬂuenced unions gave higher priority to leisure and free time for
            self-development than to high wages and economic gains. The expansive
            humanism of these Anarchists is probably best indicated by the actions they
            undertook to protest the persecution of revolutionaries abroad, whenever or
            wherever they might be. Great public rallies and bitter strikes were
            conducted not only on behalf of their own foreign comrades, such as the
            Chicago Anarchists of the 1880s and Sacco and Vanzetti decades later, but in
            support of men who would have strongly opposed their movement and ideas,
            such as Ernst Thalmann, the German Communist leader imprisoned by the
            Nazis.
               Their generosity of sentiment reached into the most intimate details of
            personal and family life. A male Spanish Anarchist, for example, rarely
            wavered in his loyalty to his compañera. He genuinely respected her dignity,
            an attitude he extended to his dealings with his children and comrades. The
            “Idea” was his passion. If he was a committeeman or occupied a union post,
            he regularly attended meetings and occupied himself with all the details of
            the movement, for the movement gave meaning and purpose to his life,
            removing it from the mediocre world of humdrum routine, vulgar self-interest,
            and banality.
               This devotion, however, did not reduce him to an organizational robot. He
            controlled the movement like everyone else in it and, despite the complexity

            of its structure at times, it was usually scaled to human dimensions. If this
            structure threatened to become too complex, he as an Anarchist threw the full
            weight of his prestige against the development and together with his
            comrades would rescale it to meaningful, comprehensible dimensions.
              Anarchism, moreover, gave his mind a profoundly experimental turn.
            Spanish Anarchism is rooted in the belief in a “natural man,” corrupted by
            propertied society and the state, who will be regenerated by a libertarian
            revolution. To many individual Anarchists, this corruption was ubiquitous; it
            debased not only people’s instincts and moral integrity, but also their diet,
            tastes, and behavior. Hence Anarchists experimented with a wide variety of
            ideas. They improvised new diets (many turning to vegetarianism), ﬂirted with
            naturopathy, studied Esperanto, and in some cases practiced nudism.
            Extolling spontaneity in behavior, they had a fascination for libertarian forms
            of education and for techniques of child-rearing that promoted the natural
            proclivities of the young. Their emphasis on freedom became the most serious
            challenge to the rigid mores and medieval fanaticism of the time.
              Many liberal and Marxian writers have described Spanish Anarchism as an
            atavistic attempt to turn back the historical clock. But in fact, the Anarchists
            placed a high premium on scientiﬁc knowledge and technological advance;
            they devoured the available scientiﬁc literature of their day and expounded
            continually on such themes as evolution, rationalist cosmolpgies, and the
            value of technology in liberating humanity. A very compelling case, in fact,
            can be made for the argument that Spanish Anarchism refracted the spirit of
            Enlightenment Europe through an Iberian-prism, breaking up its components
            and then reorganizing them to suit Spain’s distinctive needs.
              The Spanish Anarchists certainly were eager to preserve the rich,
            preindustrial tapestry of their country’s communal traditions—the emphasis
            on individuality and dignity, the high spirit of mutual aid, localism, the patria
            chica, and the pueblo. But they also realized that Spain needed the
            technological resources of the advanced capitalist world to create the
            material bases for a classless society and genuine freedom.
              The problem that confronted the Spanish Anarchists was crucial: how to
            industrialize Spain without destroying her communal heritage, debasing her
            working class, and rearing the soul-destroying monstrosity that the Industrial
            Revolution had inﬂicted on England. The attempt to deal with this problem
            accounts in part for their puritanical morality.[7] The Spanish Anarchists could
            not help but absorb the traditional puritanical atmosphere of Catholic,
            agrarian Spain; but simply to regard their movement as religious, to view it in
            Brenan’s terms as a nineteenth-century Reformation, is a crude
            oversimpliﬁcation. In the latter half of the nineteenth century Spain began to
            undergo an industrial revolution of her own, with many of the demoralizing
            eﬀects of the Industrial Revolution in England. Technological change and the
            erosion of traditional social relations began to undermine the family structure
            and the old system of morality. The demoralization of newly urbanized rural
            folk who were ﬂocking in great numbers into the cities looking for work and
            relief from chronic hunger was a visible feature of social life. Drunkenness,
            prostitution, broken families, and beggary had reached appalling proportions.
            Not only traditional society but the proletariat itself was in a state of decay.
              The Spanish Anarchists were determined to eliminate these demoralizing
39 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            features from working-class life. They were intent on restoring the moral ﬁber
            of the proletariat, on giving it inner solidity and ﬁrmness. In a society of
            scarce resources, where a life of idleness and dissipation was a function of
            exploitation and privilege, it was inconceivable that a revolution could occur
            without emphasizing the duty to work. The struggle of the Spanish Anarchists
            against alcoholism, dissoluteness, and irresponsibility became a struggle for
            the integrity of the working class, a validation of its moral capacity to
            reorganize society and manage it on a libertarian basis in an era of material
            scarcity.
              It was individuals of this moral caliber and social outlook who competed
            with cooperativists, trade unionists, political opportunists, and Socialists for
            inﬂuence in the congress of 1870. And they won this competition, at least
            until the next congress a year later. By the time Francisco Tomas declared the
            proceedings closed with “feeling and enthusiastic phrases,” the congress had
            elected a Federal Council of ﬁve members: Tomas Gonzalez Morago, Enrique
            Borrel, Francisco Mora, Anselmo Lorenzo, and Angel Mora. All of these men
            were Madrid Anarchists who had met Fanelli early in 1869 and were now
            members of Bakunin’s Alliance of Social Democracy. Aliancistas also occupied
            key positions in all leading sections of the Federation and played a decisive
            role in the forming of their policies. The Spanish labor movement had been
            founded on essentially libertarian lines and was soon to be plunged into a
            series of stormy upheavals.
            The Liberal Failure
              A large gathering of a revolutionary labor organization could not have
            occurred at a more favorable time than the summer of 1870. The founding
            congress of the Spanish Federation was held toward the end of an
            interregnum, when the entire country was in a state of confusion over its
            political future and its ruling classes were uncertain and faltering. For nearly
            two years the Spanish throne had been vacant while Madrid aﬀorded the
            spectacle of politicians quarreling among themselves over the choice of a
            monarch. This humiliating interregnum revealed with startling clarity the
            extent to which a permanent crisis had settled into Spanish society. The
            hurried ﬂight of Isabella II from Spain in September 1868 marks the climax of
            a historic conﬂict between an absolutist monarchy and the liberal middle
            classes, to be succeeded by a duel between the church and the army—the
            latter being guardian, for a time, of all elements that feared a theocratic
            government. Each of these conﬂicts rolled one upon the other like waves,
            loosening the traditional structure of the Spanish state. The monarchy had
            failed completely to restore the “old Spain” Of the ancien regime; the church,
            to straitjacket the country in a theocracy; the bourgeoisie, to follow in the
            steps of its predecessors north of the Pyrenees and create the institutional,
            economic, and cultural bases of a constitutional, democratic state. And now
            the plebians were beginning to enter the arena in force: the radical middle
            class, the peasants, and the growing working-class movement.
              The details of this succession of failures are too complex to explore in the
            space of a few pages, but the Very fact of their complexity is evidence of the

            nervous twitching, followed by periodic collapse, that marked Spanish
            political life from the opening decades of the rtineteenth century to Isabella’s
            removal from the throne.
              The occupation of Madrid by Napoleon’s armies in 1808 completely
            exploded the last remaining myths of the “Golden Age” when Spain aspired to
            hegemony in Europe and her empire encompassed vast territories in the New
            World. For the ﬁrst time since the Reconquest, her people acquired a vibrant
            sense of national identity. Every part of the country took up arms against the
            French invader, each region and locality acting independently under its own
            juntas and commanders. As noted by Charles Oman, the English chronicler of
            the peninsular war, “The movement was spontaneous, unselﬁsh, and reckless;
            in its wounded pride, the nation challenged Napoleon to combat, without any
            thought of the consequences, without counting up its own resources or those
            of the enemy.” Despite the divisions that pitted juntas, regions, and classes
            against each other, the long conﬂict with Napoleon could have created the
            point of departure for a national renaissance and the reentry of Spain into
            European society.
              It was not to be so. These hopes vanished with the return of Ferdinand VII
            from captivity in France. Supine before Napoleon, Ferdinand proved to be
            unrelenting in his eﬀorts to crush the Liberals of Spain. The Constitution of
            1812, which the Extraordinary Cortes had promulgated from Cadiz in the
            midst of the national war, was repudiated. Its provisions for a constitutional
            monarchy, universal suﬀrage, a single legislative chamber, and civil liberties
            were replaced by a harsh absolutism. For nearly six years, Ferdinand’s rule
            lay upon Spain like a shroud. Although the country began to regain its
            momentum with the successful pronunciamiento of Riego and Quiroga in
            January 1820, the ghost of absolutism was not consigned to its historic
            mausoleum until Ferdinand’s death in 1833. With the demise of absolutist
            rule, however, Spain now came face to face with the menace of a theocracy.
            The outbreak of the ﬁrst Carlist War in October 1833 marked the ﬁrst blow in
            the church’s attempt to gain mastery over Spanish political life. When
            violence failed to bring Ferdinand’s reactionary brother Don Carlos to the
            throne, the church turned to systematic penetration of the state. By the late
            1860s, the court camarilla was riddled with priests and clerical craftiness
            seemed on the point of achieving what had remained beyond the reach of
            insurgent peasant militias in years of bloody ﬁghting.
              However, neither the church, the army which contested its ambitions, nor
            the bourgeoisie were to gain lasting control of the Spanish state. The thirty
            years that followed Ferdinand’s death read like the temperature chart of a
            man in deathly fever. Ministries changed with bewildering frequency, carried
            away by political maneuvers, civil wars, and above all, by military
            pronunciamientos. The army, initially the defender of Liberalism against
            absolutism and clerical reaction, began to act alternately as a political master
            in its own right. Even the word “Liberalism” began to lose its meaning. The
            bloc that lay claim to this name divided into the Moderates, a reactionary
            grouping based on the landed bourgeoisie, and the Progressives, a prudent
            cabal of anticlerical “Europeanizers,” who leaned for support on the well-todo urban middle classes. Welling up from the depths of the disillusioned petty
            bourgeoisie came the Republicans—a conglomerate of radicals and
41 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            Federalists, the latter adhering to Pi y Margall’s doctrine of a Swiss-like,
            cantonal state.
               There was one thing that united this ﬂotsam of Monarchists, clerics,
            “liberals,” landed oligarchs, and army oﬀicers as they scrambled for control of
            the state. It was fear: a fear of the masses. Franz Borkenau notes that “in
            Britain, in America, and in Germany, every popular movement originated in
            the upper stratum of society and then permeated the masses.” In Spain, on
            the other hand,
                 no movement in the higher classes ever penetrated deeply the
                 masses. Spain is the country where the spontaneity of the “people”
                 as against the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie, the intelligentsia, and, in
                 the last decades, the clergy, is most conspicuous. Such a deep
                 severance of the people from the ruling groups; such a passing of
                 the initiative to the lowest stratum of society, is always a symptom
## of deep decay and disintegration of the old civilization.

              Sensing their own weakness and decadence, the ruling classes responded to
            the people with a combination of Olympian contempt and sheer panic. It is
            reported that after a terrifying experience with a riot, Charles III never
            overcame his fear of the Madrid “mob”; even street noises frightened him.
            Although national tradition credits “the people” with driving Napoleon’s
            armies from Spain, a contemporary of the period recalls the panic that seized
            the middle classes when the ragged militia of the “Valencian Army” entered
            Madrid.
              The job of dealing with the masses, of cultivating a watchful eye and a
            restraining hand, was left to the Spanish church. The historic isolation of the
            church from the people in the nineteenth century, a product partly of the
            Liberals’ agrarian policy, completed the isolation of the Spanish ruling classes
            from Spain.
              There had been a time, though, when the popular prestige of the church
            was enormous. The church bells of Spain had been the tocsins of the
            Reconquest, rallying the villages to war against the Moorish invaders. Clerics
            not only blessed the Christian armies but often led them into battle. During
            the “Golden Age,” the clergy provided Spain with its only social conscience,
            raising its voice on behalf of the exploited peasantry at home and the
            decimated Indians in the colonies abroad. Inveighing against the ravages of
            usury, privilege, and greed, it stood foremost among the ruling classes in
            defense of the communal institutions of Spain and the tribal institutions of the
            New World.
              Despite its imposing hierarchy, the Spanish church probably remained the
            most democratic institution in a society anchored in political absolutism. To a
            French nobleman visiting Spain in the early nineteenth century, the structure
            of the Spanish clergy was virtually republican (“tout a fait republicaine”).
            Raymond Carr, in a perceptive account of modern Spanish history, reminds us
            that “one eighteenth-century primate was the son of a charcoal burner, a
            situation inconceivable in France,” and most of the bishops were recruited
            from “the obscurity of the minor provincial nobility.” Nor was there a visible
            display of clerical luxury and opulence. A bishop, Carr adds,
42 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
                 was expected to give all his surplus income to charity once his
                 simple houshold needs were satisﬁed. The average parish priest was
                 poor and remained so throughout the nineteenth and twentieth
                 centuries; he earned less than a well-paid laborer and was often
                 dependent, in rural parishes, on the sale of eggs and on other minor
## agricultural pursuits.

              Lest this trait be overdrawn, however, the fact remains that with the
            passage of time, the church began to age and fatten, much like the courtiers
            whose lean, warrior ancestors had helped expel the Moors. By the close of the
            eighteenth century, the church had become the ■largest landowner and
            wealthiest institution in Spain, indissolubly linked with the monarchy and
            nobility. The gap between what bishops were “expected” to do and what they
            in fact did widened considerably, but the church’s prestige among the masses
            had not diminished. To the immense number of beggars—los miserables—who
            formed the recruits for “mob” riots and near-insurrections in the streets of
            Spanish cities, the church provided not only religious circuses but material
            sustenance. In Madrid, for example, the convents alone provided los
            miserables with 30,000 bowls of soup daily. In Valladolid, according to Carr’s
            estimate, a twentieth of the population depended on the church, “while soup
            and bread doles from episcopal palaces and monasteries were an important
            element in the budget of the urban poor.”
              But ties of this kind could exist only if the church retained the agrarian
            roots of a feudal estate, roots which nourished the medieval spectacle of
            public humility and charity toward the poor. When the Liberal premier
            Mendizabal initiated the conﬁscation of church lands on a major scale, these
            traditional roots were pulled up. Ostensibly, the conﬁscation was undertaken
            for two purposes: to ﬁnance the war against the Carlists and to create an
            agrarian middle-class base for the Liberals. Actually, the sale of the church
            lands did not achieve anything near the result intended. The conﬁscated
            estates became the object of crass bourgeois speculation, nourishing a new
            class of lay land magnates. The land hunger of the peasantry, satisﬁed in
            France by the Great Revolution and by Napoleon, was to remain an endemic
            feature of Spanish society.
              Having lost its lands and its agrarian roots, the church shifted all its
            resources to speculation and business. The higher clergy began to neglect its
            pastoral duties for the more lucrative realms of industry, commerce, urban
            real estate, and according to the gossip of the day, brothels. The new
            investments transformed the Catholic Church from the largest landowner in
            Spain into the largest capitalist; its ideology, the most medieval and atavistic
            in Western Europe, transformed it from the social conscience of the ruling
            class into the most reactionary force in social life.
              The decline of the church’s popular prestige left only one’eﬀective
            institution that could function politically without a popular base—the army.
            Initially, the army had been a bulwark of Liberalism and its early
            pronunciamientos enforced middle-class interests in Spanish politics. But a
            half century of meddling and manipulation had made it increasingly suspect
            as a corps of Praetorians, even to the Moderates. Having exhausted its
            alliance with the Liberals, embroiled in imperialist adventures in Morocco, the
43 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            Spanish oﬀicer caste began its slow, fatal drift to the right. If the Liberals,
            who still had illusions of acquiring popular support, regarded the army as an
            embarrassing and dangerous liability, the reactionaries in later years were
            only too glad to use it as a lever for social power. The history of the army after
            1870 is a numbing account of its growing sense of isolation, its preoccupation
            with pay, promotion, and graft, and its arrogance toward the canaille.
              The canaille, of course, were the masses of Spain—peasants, farm laborers,
            craftsmen, industrial workers, los miserables—the majority of whom lived in
            desperate poverty. Thousands of beggars ﬁlled the city slums or wandered the
            country roads. To the ruling classes, the Spanish people were a faceless,
            anonymous lot, volatile but inchoate, threatening but politically inert; and all
            the quarreling factions on the summits of society were united in the need to
            exclude their participation in the processes of institutional change.
              But if the word “mass” is meant to convey anything more than sheer
            numbers, it becomes meaningless in Spain. From the Spanish pueblo, with its
            remarkable sense of community, had emerged a people in which selfassurance, dignity, and a striking individuality seemed like inborn traits.
            Dignidad has a ﬁerceness of meaning in Spanish that has no parallel in any
            other European language, indeed, a ﬁerceness that the Anarchists were to
            cultivate in every nuance of behavior and action. They were not unique in this
            respect. Brenan reminds us that, north of the Sierra Morena at least, the
            preoccupation with dignity is deeply rooted in Spanish history—the peasant
            ploughing with a sword dangling from his waist, the cobbler and mason
            treating the grandee as their equal, the beggars expecting to be addressed as
            “Your Worship” are images that will be found centuries ago.
              It was this people whom the ruling classes ﬁnally divested of any
            meaningful relations with the institutions and values of oﬀicial Spain. By the
            late 1860s, a cultural, religious, political, and economic vacuum had been
            created for the Spanish masses. The church had betrayed its responsibilities
            and the politicians their promises. There was no way even to faintly reconcile
            the interests of rural laborers, land-hungry peasants, and bitterly exploited
            workers with those of the propertied classes. Caciques ran the villages with a
            ﬁrm hand. The Civil Guard patrolled the roads, railway stations, and streets.
            The workers, denied all recognition of their rights to organize, faced an
            almost solid phalanx of rapacious manufacturers. The guardians of the state,
            occupied with their narrow political interests, cast a blank stare on the
            frustrated masses below. For the great bulk of the Spanish people, civil life
            was as empty as the vacated throne in Madrid. Henceforth, after 1870, all
            that could ﬁll this vacuum were the Republican politics of the petty
            bourgeoisie, the Socialist doctrines of the radical intelligentsia, .and Anarchist
            ideals of a proletarian’or peasant variety.
            Chapter Four: The Early Years
            Proletarian Anarchism
              The founding of the Spanish Regional Federation opened an entirely new
            period in the modern history of Spain. Since the respectable Liberal parties
44 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            had shut themselves oﬀ from the masses of Spain the lower classes would try
            to form organizations of their own. The political polarization of rulers and
            ruled merely paralleled one that had long since developed on an economic
            and cultural level, but it was to lead to increasingly bitter confrontations in
            the years to come.
              The earliest of these were mild. The founding congress had evoked press
            attacks throughout Spain, particularly in Madrid where the Liberals and
            Republicans viewed the antipolitical stance of the new Federation as a threat
            to their waning inﬂuence on the working class. Fortunately, the most
            immediate practical result of the Barcelona congress was to furnish the
            Federation with the nucleus of its own national press; in addition to La
            Federation in Barcelona and La Solidaridad in Madrid, the Internationalists
            acquired El Obrera and Revolution in Palma and La Voz del Trabajador in the
            key industrial dty of Bilboa. The propaganda of the Spanish Federation
            probably represents the most important achievement of its ﬁrst six months of
            existence. Its literature reached thousands, evoking an additional press
            response that gave it wide and continual publicity. The Federation began to
            acquire larger dimensions in the public mind than it actually possessed in
            fact, an image which the Federal Cciuncil in Madrid and the sections shrewdly
            reinforced with numerous leaﬂets, statements, arid public meetings.
              But other areas of the Federation’s activities were less satisfactory. The
            enormous enthusiasm generated by the founding congress soon gave way to
            lassitude. The Federal Council’s attempt to achieve a working unity between
            the various sections throughout the country met with a disillusioning lack of
            response. Letters sent into the hinterlands of Spain went unanswered,
            responses were often delayed, and a chronic shortage of funds created
            diﬀiculties for the Madrid organization and severe hardships for members of
            the Council, most of whom gave generously of their time and resources. This
            in turn exacerbated relations between some of the Aliancistas who constituted
            the Federation’s center and were to lead to serious personal and political
            frictions.
              Even more serious were the problems that faced the Barcelona movement.
            Although Catalonia provided the largest single bloc of working-class recruits
            to the Spanish Federation, the Internationalists constituted a very small
            proportion of the Barcelona proletariat. Perhaps 9 percent of the working
            class in the city adhered to the new movement. Small as this ﬁgure is, it
            declined drastically when a yellow Jjever epidemic swept through the Catalan
            seaport, claiming many lives and stampeding thousands, into the countryside.
            Of the 10,000 members who belonged to the Barcelona movement in July
            1870, only 1,800 remained in January 1871, and scarcely more than 2,500 in
            August, a full year after the founding congress. The commonly repeated
            notion that the International in Spain enjoyed a spectacular growth during the
            ﬁrst year of its existence is a myth, certainly as far as Barcelona—its center of
            proletarian support—is concerned.
              Nominally, the Barcelona organization was controlled by Anarchists.
            Actually, the number of Anarchists in the sections was very small. In fact
            many outstanding ﬁgures in the Barcelona labor movement were pragmatic
            trade unionists whose social idealism was shallow at best. The International in
            the Catalan seaport was based on an alliance between a handful of Anarchists
45 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            and a larger group of opportunistic unionists who had been driven into an
            antipolitical, direct-actionist position by the intransigence of the Barcelona
            textile manufacturers. Between these two tendencies of the Catalan tradeunion movement existed an uneasy, even distrustful relationship which was to
            snap, reknit, and snap again in later years. The nature of this alliance and the
            maneuvering it entailed disturbed the gallant, honest Anselmo Lorenzo.
            Lorenzo had never forgotten Fanelli’s words on libertarian organization. “How
            much more beneﬁcial it would have been,” he opined, years later, “if instead
            of ﬁnding agreements and solutions by surprise, the Alliance [of Social
            Democracy] had engaged in a work of education and instruction to show the
            way of obtaining agreements and solutions as a conscious sum of wills.”
            Instead, the tensions in the fusion of trade-unionist demands with social
            revolutionary ideals was to have serious consequences throughout the history
            of the Spanish workers’ movement.
              Had the Catalan Anarchists rested their hopes solely on an alliance with an
            opportunistic union leadership, they surely would have lost the Barcelona
            labor movement to syndicalism of a reformist, French variety. Even the most
            dense, unreconstructed class of employers could not have deﬂected this
            development. What eventually gave Catalan Anarchism a mass following were
            the hordes of rural folk, the landless peasants and laborers, who streamed
            into Barcelona looking for work. Each year they came by the thousands, the
            great majority from the Catalan countryside itself, the next largest group from
            the Levant (Murcia, Valencia, Alicante, Castellon), followed by Aragonese
            from Saragossa, Huesca, and Teruel. Contrary to popular myth, only a small
            fraction of this inﬂowing labor force came from Andalusia. To the urbane
            Barcelonese, these destitute emigrants from the hungry Levant, with their
            country ways and course manners, were indiscriminately lumped together
            under the name Murcianos, in Barcelona a word equivalent to “nigger.”
              Pariahs in a strange, hostile urban world, the Murcianos encamped by the
            tens of thousands in squalid, miserable shacks. Their hovels ringed the great
            seaport and penetrated its suburbs, providing a huge reservoir of unskilled,
            menial labor exploited by the Catalan bourgeoisie. Disdained by nearly all the
            factions of the Liberals, later manipulated by such Radical demagogues as
            Lerroux, the Murcianos also provided a reservoir for the most volatile recruits
            to the libertarian movement in Catalonia. Without this transitional proletariat
            Anarchism would have lost its mass base in a broadly syndicalist labor
            organization, and it would have been impossible to reorient the reformist
            tendencies of the skilled and established Barcelona factory workers towards
            Anarchosyndicalism.
              The role of the Murcianos in rooting proletarian Anarchism in Spain’s
            largest industrial city, and the near-insurrectionary atmosphere they created,
            raises many fascinating problems. To Marx, the more the proletariat advanced
            from a craft to an industrial estate, and the more this class was “disciplined,
            united and organized by the process of capitalist production itself”—by the
            factory—the more of a revolutionary force it became. Marx’s theory viewed
            the craft worker as a backward and undeveloped proletarian, a member of a
            transitional class like the peasantry. It is certain he would have regarded the
            rural Murcianos, not to speak of (os miserables of the Spanish cities generally,
            with disdain—as a declasse ﬂotsam, a lumpen proletariat.

              This contemptuous attitude toward decaying classes at the base of society is
            evinced most clearly in his remarks on the Franco-Prussian War. “The French
            need a thrashing,” he wrote to Engels a day after the outbreak of hostilities.
                 If the Prussians win, then centralization of the state power is useful
                 to the centralization of the German working class. Furthermore,
## German predominance in Europe would transfer the center of
## gravity of the West European labor movement from France to
                 Germany, and one need only compare the movement from 1866 to
                 the present in the two lands to see that the German working class is
                 superior to the French in theory and organization. Its predominance
                 over the French on the world stage would at the same time be the
## predominance of our theory over that of Proudhon....

               As it turned out, Marx was wrong—-not only in prospect but also in
            retrospect. The classes that gave the cutting edge to the revolutions of 1848
            were not primarily factory workers, but craftsmen and workers in small
            shops, precisely those decomposing, preindustrial strata whom*Marx viewed
            with such contempt. The factory workers of Berlin, centered largely in the
            newly emerging locomotive industry, played a reactionary role in the
            insurrectionary movement of the period, even by comparison with pettybourgeois democrats. Later, a year after Marx’s letter to Engels, the declasses
            of Montmartre and the craftsmen and workers in small industry (the “luxury
            goods .workers,” as Marx disdainfully called them) raised red ﬂags and died
            by the thousands on the barricades in defense of the Paris Commune of 1871.
            And some sixty years afterward, it was not the sophisticated, highly
            centralized, and well-disciplined labor movement of Germany that was to take
            up arms against fascism, but the working class and peasants of Spain—both of
            which were unique in having retained the most preindustrial outlook in
            Western Europe.
               Ironically, the “process of capitalist production itself,” which Marx
            commended in Capital, served not-only to unite, discipline, and centralize the
            proletariat, but to vitiate its revolutionary attitudes. The more workers were
            conditioned to accept the factory routine, to bend their heads before the
            demands of its overseers, the more they tended to accept hierarchy, authority,
            and obedience as an unchallengable destiny. And the more the working class
            acquired a hereditary status in society, knowing no other way of life but the
            industrial routine, the less revolutionary were its descendants. It was
            precisely the continual ﬂow of Murcianos into Catalan industry, the continual
            leavening action of decomposing classes from the preindustrial pueblos, that
            renewed the revolutionary fervor of the Barcelona proletariat. These rural
            folk, uprooted from a precapitalist culture and life-style, imbued with values,
            codes, and tastes completely antithetical to the enervating culture of the
            cities, prevented the more stable and coopted sectors of the Catalan working
            class from hardening into settled social forms. The Murdanos were an
            immense social stratum that had absolutely nothing to lose. Accustomed to
            illegality, ebullient and riotous almost by nature, they added an electricity to
            the atmosphere of Barcelona that was to make it the most exciting, unruly,
            and revolutionary city in Europe.
               In the early 1870s, however, these large masses of semiproletarians had yet
47 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            to be won to Anarchism. The most dedicated early supporters of the Spanish
            Federation were craftsmen, not declasses or unskilled factory workers. As late
            as 1872, more than half of the delegates to the Cordoba congress of the
            Federation were printers, typographers, master masons, shoemakers, and
            bakers—in short, skilled or fairly skilled craftsmen who worked in small
            shops. Only one out of ﬁve delegates was a factory hand, and an even smaller
            proportion were peasants. The unruly miserables of Madrid, for instance,
            were by no means uniformly friendly to the Federation. On May 2,1871, a day
            which Spain celebrates in honor of the ﬁrst popular uprising against
            Napoleon’s armies, the Internationalists held a public meeting to counter the
            chauvinistic, anti-French spirit engendered by the holiday. It was mobbed and
            broken up by the local poor. A howling crowd laid siege to the
            Internationalists in a cafe well into the night.
               Time was on the side of the Federation, however, and it soon began to make
            headway among the workers and urban poor. A few successful strikes in
            Barcelona, coupled with the growing notoriety of the International at home
            and abroad, brought new, dedicated adherents into the movement. The
            prospects of rapid growth seemed, highly promising. In Barcelona,
            membership ﬁgures began to rise sharply from the low of January 1871; new
            periodicals were started or planned; and agitation began to spread in earnest
            beyond the cities into distant reaches of the countryside.
               But time was precisely what the Spanish Federation was to lack. When in
            March 1871, the Parisian workers rose and established the commune, tremors
            of fear shook all the palaces and chancellories of Europe. In Madrid these
            fears were compounded by the increasing instability of the government. In
            December 1870, Amadeo of Savoy had arrived from Italy to occupy the vacant
            Spanish throne, but instead of bringing peace to the warring political factions,
            his presence reopened all the inﬁghting and intrigues that had led to the
            isolation and ﬂight of Isabella. The new regime, high-strung and unsure of
            itself, became increasingly sensitive to the agitation initiated by the
            Internationalists. Soon press attacks began to give way to police repression.
            Internationalists were harrassed and jailed in growing numbers, and the
            Federal Council, alarmed by the turn in events, decided to emigrate to the
            less troubled atmosphere of Portugal. In June 1871, on Corpus Christi Day,
            Lorenzo, Morago, and Francisco Mora departed for Lisbon with the records of
            the Spanish Federation, leaving Borrel and Angel Mora behind to keep an eye
            on events.
               This ﬂight was probably premature. The government was still too weak and
            divided to crush the labor organization, and the pressure began to lift. After
            three months, the Internationalists returned to Madrid. During this brief exile,
            they went through another bitter round of material hardships and internal
            friction, but their stay in Lisbon had not been a complete loss. There they met
            two young intellectuals, Jose Fontana and Antero do Quanta], who helped
            them establish the ﬁrst stable nucleus of the International (and Bakuninist
            Alliance) in Portugal. A year later, the new Portuguese Federation claimed a
            membership of 10,000 in Lisbon and thousands more elsewhere in the
            country.
               The Spanish Federation, on the other hand, was badly in need of repair. The
            Federal Council had suﬀered the loss of two members: Borrel, who had
48 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            dropped out of activity, and Francisco Mora, who remained behind in Lisbon,
            nursing personal and political grievances that were later to bring him into the
            Marxian-inspired Spanish Socialist Party. Most of the work in the Council fell
            on the shoulders of Angel Mora and the indefatigable Anselmo Lorenzo.
            Although the membership had held its own and La Solidaridad in Madrid had
            been augmented by a new periodical, La Emancipation, the ties between the
            Federal Council and the various sections in Spain were looser than ever. The
            very life of the Federation as a national movement seemed in the balance.
               To meet this crisis, ﬁfty-four delegates of the Spanish Federation convened
            in Valencia on September 10, 1871 for a week of intensive organizational
            work. The conference met in secret owing to the atmosphere of repression
            that still lingered on from the spring. To ﬁrm up the organization, the
            conference divided the International in Spain into ﬁve large regional
            federations or comarca (north, south, east, west, and center). The trade
            sections or Secciones de oﬁcio, which existed in a very decentralized form,
            were federated on an occupational basis and still further centralized into craft
            unions. Finally, the powers of the higher committees which knitted the craft
            unions together were greatly ampliﬁed, giving them considerable authority
            over the local sections.
               In time, the new structure was to become so elaborate as to be virtually
            inoperable. By the end of 1872, the Spanish Regional Federation had turned
            into a bulky, complex organization composed of ﬁve hundred Secciones de
            oﬁcio and oﬁcio varios, 236 Federaciones locales, and ten Uniones de oﬁcio.
            Each of these bodies had a committee, subdivided into commissions for
            administration, correspondence, organization, and propaganda. Anselmo
            Lorenzo estimates that it would have required nearly 7,500 people to staﬀ all
            of the committees and local councils—a grave potential for bureaucracy,
            especially if one bears in mind that many Spanish workers were illiterate.
            Indeed, many committees could not ﬁnd a single worker to keep the minutes
            of the meetings and often had to call upon friendly students and intellectuals
            for aid.
               Had the members of the sections taken the structure and its requirements
            seriously (which they probably did not do), it would have been virutally
            impossible to have any concerted action and solidarity on any level beyond
            the locality. If a group of strikers wished to get support from sections outside
            their community or tried to draw on the strike funds of the organization, they
            were required to follow an elaborate procedure of “petitioning” the trade
            federation to which they belonged. It might easily have taken two months or
            more before the trade federation responded with some kind of decisive action.
            If the strike were strictly economic, it probably would have been defeated; if it
            were the opening act in a revolution, it almost certainly would have been
            crushed.
               Following the return of the Federal Council from Lisbon then, heroic
            measures were certainly necessary to prevent the Federation from dissolving
            as a national movement. But thf structure adopted at Valencia went far
            beyond what was needed to preserve the unity of the labor organization.
            Whence, then, came the impulse for the centralization of the Spanish Regional
            Federation? Frankly, the Federal Council was not composed entirely of
            Anarchists. In fact, it included the very men who in later years were to found

            the Spanish Socialist Party: Francisco Mora, Jose Mesa, and Pablo Iglesias.
            Within a few months of the Valencia conference, these men—the Autoritarios
            (Authoritarians), as they were called by the Anarchists—were locked in a
            furious conﬂict with the so-called Anti-Autoritarios. Neither side emerged very
            creditably.
              Although the conﬂict had obviously been simmering for some time, it was
            sparked into an open war by events and interference from abroad. In the
            same month that the Valencia conference was held, Anselmo Lorenzo had
            gone to London to attend a world conference of the International. There he
            not only saw Marx, but observed at ﬁrst hand the bitter inﬁghting that was to
            culminate in the expulsion of Bakunin at the Hague congress a year later.
            From the stormy discussions in London it was clear that a split was
            unavoidable. Two months later, in December 1871, Marx’s son-in-law Paul
            Lafargue appeared in Madrid, a refugee from the repression of the Paris
            Commune. Lafargue had been raised in Cuba and could speak Spanish
            ﬂuently. Through Mesa and Iglesias he acquired control over La Emancipation
            and began to press his attack against the Bakuninists in Madrid.
              The conﬂict, dragging well into the summer of 1872, ended shabbily. The
            London conference had prohibited the existence of secret organizations
            within the International. Accordingly, the mam thrust of Lafargue’s attack was
            to demonstrate that the Alliance of Social Democracy had never been
            dissolved and still played a hidden role in guiding the aﬀairs of the Spanish
            Federation. Lafargue, of course, was correct. The Aliantistas, embarrassed by
            the attacks, dissolved their organization, at least formally. The dispute,
            however, did not center merely on organizational issues. Lafargue had come
            to Madrid not only to recover the Spanish Regional Federation for Marx but
            also to reqjient it toward political action. He favored an alliance with the
            Republicans and the formation of a workers’ party. In Madrid, the dispute
            over these issues assumed a particularly bitter form when, in March 1872, the
            Marxian editors of La Emancipation, representing virtually no one but
            themselves, proceeded to use the periodical in the name of the Federal
            Council to make a rapprochement with the Republicans. The editors were
            expelled, and the Madrid Federation was faced with the prospect of an open
            split.
              One month later at Saragossa, the Spanish Regional Federation held its
            second national congress, where an attempt was made to heal the diﬀerences
            between the two factions. The editors of La Emancipation were taken back
            into the organization. The congress prudently elected a Bakuninist Federal
            Council, with Lorenzo as secretary general, and transferred its headquarters
            from Madrid to Valencia. Despite the compromise, within weeks the battle
            was resumed in full fury—and this time it was waged on both sides without
            scruple. By publicly casting doubts on the sources of Bakunin’s income, for
            example, the editors of La Emancipation tried to revive the rumor that
            Bakunin.was a police spy. The character assault occurred in September, well
            after they were expelled from the Madrid Federation, but it aﬀords a glimpse
            of the murky depths to which the “discussion” had descended. The Anarchists
            on the Federal Council, on the other hknd, were not immune to dishonorable
            tactics of their own. Suspicions of Lorenzo’s personal friendship with
            Lafargue, they surreptitiously opened his mail from Madrid and surrounded
50 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            him in an atmosphere of intrigue. Such tactics by his own comrades so
            infuriated Lorenzo that he resigned from the Federal Council and left
            Valencia. But he never gave up his Anarchist principles and soon returned to
            the Federation.
              The serious political diﬀerences between the two groups were increasingly
            obscured by gossip, slander, organizational maneuvering, and bitter invective.
            The climax of the sordid conﬂict was reached on June 3, 1872, when the
            Autoritarios were expelled from the Madrid Federation. A month later, they
            established a “New Madrid Federation” of their own and in reprisal for their
            expulsion they maliciously published the names of the Aliancistas in La
            Emancipation (Juty 27), exposing their former comrades to police reprisals. In
            the end, the conﬂict achieved virtually nothing for Lafargue, Mesa, Francisco
            Mora, and Iglesias. The overwhelming majority of the Madrid Federation,
            indeed of the entire Spanish Regional Federation, supported the Aliancistas.
              But the skirmishes in Madrid presaged a more historic conﬂict
            internationally, one which was to have a profound eﬀect on the revolutionary
            movement for decades to come. On September 2,1872, in a memorable
            congress at The Hague, Mikhail Bakunin and his young Swiss associate,
            James Guillaume, were expelled from the International for creating a secret
            organizatioii. The evidence for the charge came from Paul Lafargue. To be
            certain of his victory over Bakunin, Marx had packed the congress with his
            supporters, dispatched delegates with highly questionable credentials, made
            unprincipled deals with men who were soon to become his bitter opponents,
            and personally participated in the proceedings. He had even charged Bakunin
            with “swindling” for failing to return a modest publisher’s advance for an
            unﬁnished Russian translation of Capital. “This attempt to rob a famous rebel
            of his good name, an act of character assassination now condemned,
            apologetically, by most Marxist historians,” observes Max Nettlau, “was to
            poison well-nigh forever the anarchists’ personal feeling toward Marx.”
            Thereafter, Marx had the General Council transferred from London to New
            York, a move that virtually assured the death of the International.
              Two weeks later, the Anarchist delegates to the Hague congress,
            representing primarily Switzerland, Italy, and Spain, met at St. Imier in the
            Swiss Jura and formed an International of their own. The delegates from
            Spain included Farga Pellicer and Gonzalez Morago. After conferring with
            Bakunin, they hurried home and made plans to aﬀiliate the Spanish
            Federation with the new International. With all restraints removed by the
            isolation of the Madrid Autoritarios and the split in the International, the
            Aliancistas decided to act boldly. They convened a new congress, four months
            earlier than the date stipulated by the Saragossa conference of April 1872. On
            December 25, 1872, ﬁfty-four delegates representing 20,000 workers in 236
            local federations and 516 trade sections convened in the Teatro Moratin at
            Cordoba for the third congress of the Spanish Federation. This was to be the
            last public national gathering of the original International in Spain for the
            next nine years. In many respects, it was also the most important one.
              The Cordoba congress created what is generally regarded as the “typical”
            form of Anarchist organization in Spain. Although it is hard to speak of
            “typicality” with respect to the Spanish Anarchist movement, the congress
            basically abandoned the unwieldly structure created by the Valencia

            conference of the previous year. The Federal Council was shorn of its
            authority over local organizations and reduced to a mere “Federal
            Commission for Correspondence and Statistics.” The trade sections and local
            federations were elevated to “sovereignly independent” bodies, free at any
            time to renounce their aﬀiliation to the national organization. All restraints
            were removed from acts of solidarity for local strikes and uprisings. By the
            same token, no trade section and/or local federation could be coerced into
            initiating or supporting any actions. Henceforth, the Spanish Federation was
            to be a formally decentralized organization and its success as a movement
            was to depend largely upon initiatives from below.
               Nevertheless, some kind of cohesion was necessary. The responsibility for
            knitting the organization together was undertaken by the Anarchists, who,
            despite the formal dissolution of the Alliance, continued to retain close
            personal and organizational ties with each other. The Alliance, in eﬀect,
            continued to exist, which now meant that the Spanish Federation had a de
            facto leadership, albeit a libertarian one. With his typical honesty, Anselmo
            Lorenzo, refused to sugar-coat this fact. In the late years of his life, he wrote:
            “When a bourgeois expresses admiration for the working class organizations
            for not having a president who assumes the responsibility of leadership, the
            Internationals [Anarchists] smile with superior pride, as though they possess
            a secret that can not be penetrated by the short reach of the bourgeois
            interlocutor.” This pretension irritated the old Anarchist and he added: “There
            was no such secret nor was it true that we had a total lack of authority. What
            we did have was a convention that deceived the very workers who employed
            it.”
               Yet in a sense, both Lorenzo and the complacent Anarchists he takes to task
            miss an essential point. The great bulk of Internationalists worked their jobs
            for long hours and low wages. They were burdened by the need to make ends
            meet for themselves and their hungry families. Ordinarily, these workers had
            little time or energy to give to their organization. Only the most high-minded
            workingmen could play a routinely active role in the movement, which they
            did at enormous personal sacriﬁce. In these circumstances some kind of
            guidance was both unavoidable and necessary; to deny this fact would have
            been self-deception or hypocrisy.
               Certainly the Spanish Anarchists deceived themselves often enough, and it
            would have been miraculous if they were free of hypocrites. What deserves
            emphasis is that they tried to create an organization in which guidance could
            be exercised without coercion and a leadership, such as it was, removed
            easily when it was necessary or harmful. They also tried to encourage
            initiative from below and foster revolutionary elan in the sections, federations,
            indeed, in the factories and villages themselves. On this score, they were
            eminently successful, for until the outbreak of the Civil War, the Spanish
            libertarian movement never developed a bureaucracy. It had its share of those
            bureaucratic types and authoritarian personalities who are prone to ﬂock into
            any eﬀective mass movement. These people posed continuous problems for
            the original International and for its heirs. But their eﬀect was neutralized by
            a structural ﬂexibility, organizational looseness, and an atmosphere of
            freedom that has rarely been equaled by a mass labor movement in the
            history of our time. They had read their Bakunin well.

             Brenan gives us a superb account of how well their movement suited
            Spanish conditions. “The ﬁrst need,” he writes,
                 was to get hold of the half-starving, uneducated ﬁeld laborers and
                 factory workmen and ﬁll them with a consciousness of their own
                 grievances and their own power. These men could not, as a rule,
                 aﬀord to pay a regular subscription and they were suspicious of any
## inﬂuence from outside which might embroil them with their
## employers. Any regular trade-union organization with a paid
                 secretariat, acting on orders from Barcelona or Madrid and leading
                 its adherents like a bourgeois Republican party to the polling
                 booths, would have be£n doomed to failure. But the Anarchist
                 leaders were never paid—in 1936, when their trade union, the
                 C.N.T., contained over a million members, it had only one paid
                 secretary. Travelling about from place to place, on foot or mule back
                 or on the hard seats of third-class railway carriages, or even like
                 tramps or ambulant bullﬁghters under the tarpaulins of goods
## wagons, whilst they organized new groups or carried on
                 propagandist campaigns’, these “apostles of the idea,” as they were
                 called, lived like mendicant friars on the hospitality of the more
## prosperous workmen.

                 Their ﬁrst object was simply to enroll groups of poor workers,
                 whatever their political or religious opinions might be, for mutual
                 protection against employers: now and then there would be a small
                 strike, which, if it was successful, would at once double the
                 membership of the section and lead to other small strikes in
                 neighbouring districts. Then gradually the leaders would unfold
                 their anarchist creed with its hatred of the church, its wild idealism,
## its generous and humane outlook, and the imagination of the
                 hearers would be kindled. Thus it happened that, at moments of
                 enthusiasm, the number of the workers controlled by the Anarchists
## would double and treble themselves and, when the inevitable
                 reaction came, would shrink back to a small kernel of convinced
                 militants. This plasticity of the Anarchist movement enabled it to
                 survive persecutions and, soon as they were over, to reappear
## stronger than ever.

              The organizational plasticity created by the Cordoba congress was soon to
            receive a critical test. The political instability that had led to Isabella’s exile
            and the enthronement of Amadeo was now reaching serious proportions. In
            this mounting crisis, the agitation and strikes conducted by Spanish
            Federation did not pass unnoticed. Throughout the closing months of 1871,
            the Federation, its activities, and the fact of its’aﬀiliation to the “sinister”
            International beyond the Pyrenees had become the subject of increasing
            discussion within the Cortes. In January 1872, the Federation was oﬀicially
            ordered to dissolve by reason of its ties to a “foreign organization.” But the
            government was too weak to enforce its order and the Federation continued
            to function as publicly as ever, even calling large rallies to protest the ban.
            But its days as an open movement were numbered, for if Spain was in

            upheaval and faced with revolution, she was also faced with a reactionary
            military pronunciamiento that would decide her future for decades to come.
            Rebellion and Repression
              On February 11, 1873, Amadeo of-Savoy abdicated the Spanish throne and
            returned to Italy. After a reign of little more than two years, the “gentleman
            king,” as the Spaniards called him, had run through six ministerial changes
            and three general elections without bringing political stability to the country.
            From the start, Amadeo had never gained the popularity of his subjects. The
            aristocracy treated him with disdain, Madrid theater audiences openly
            insulted him, and in the last months of his reign he was virtually isolated in
            the Cortes. Faced with the choices of completely antagonizing the oﬀicer
            corps, provoking a Republican rebellion, or ruling by decree, this civilized
            monarch abandoned the throne, opening the way to a bloodless Republican
            victory.
              The declaration of a republic found its adherents as divided as the
            constitutional monarchists. The Unitarians, a cautious wing led by Spain,
            especially among the radical middle classes of Madrid. Opposing the
            centralist Republicans were the Federalists, inspired by Pi y Margall’s
            theories of a decentralized, Swiss-like republic based on the autonomy of the
            provinces. Not surprisingly, the Federalists acquired the bulk of their
            adherents from the petty-bourgeois radicals in the provincial cities and towns.
              But the Federalists were far from united. The immediate supporters of Pi
            were prudent men who, echoing his maxim that “force is legitimate only when
            right fails,” believed in achieving a republic by legal means. Together with the
            Unitarians, they had developed their forces around parliamentary and
            electoral contests, throwing their support to the more liberal constitutional
            monarchists in common battles against “reactionaries” in the Cortes. This
            parliamentary “benevolence” toward supporters of a liberal monarchy earned
            them the contemptuous sobriquet of benevelos. By the end of Amadeo’s reign,
            their tactics had thoroughly infuriated the more militant elements in the
            Federalist camp—the so-called Intransigents—who now veered toward an
            antiparlimentary policy of revolutionary action from below.
              The Federalists did not have a majority of the country behind them, yet
            everything favored their success. The anti-Federalist forces had exhausted all
            the alternatives in their political armory and, after an aborted attempt at a
            coup in Madrid, sank into complete demoralization. The workers and the
            great mass of land laborers were highly combustible. A meaningful Federalist
            program, responsive to their needs, might have easily kindled their support.
            Reassured by the anticonscription policy of the Federalists, rank-and-ﬁle
            soldiers deserted their regiments in droves, leaving the oﬀicer corps with
            inadequate forces to back up a pronunciamiento. The radical petty
            bourgeoisie of the provincial cities and towns were collecting into
            paramilitary groups. Only the Carlists were suﬀiciently armed and cohesive to
            uphold the interests of reaction, but except for the threat they posed in
            Catalonia, they were boxed into the northern mountains.
              It seemed for a time that the Federalists would succeed. A Constituent

            Cortes elected a few weeks after Amadeo’s abdication provided them with a
            working majority and the legality necessary to establish a decentralized,
            cantonal republic. E. Figueras, a cautious Federalist benevelo who had
            functioned as caretaker president since February, was succeeded by Pi y
            Margall, the father of the Federalist doctrine in Spain. On April 24, 1873, Pi
            took over the presidency of the new republic. The government and the fate of
            the Federalist movement he had helped to create lay in his hands. Looking
            back” years later, he recalled that “after April 23 I wielded immense power....”
            This “immense power” was to melt from his hands like ice under a blazing
            sun.
              In 1873, Francisco Pi y Margall had reached the age of forty-nine. The
            young, earnest Catalan who had threatened to “divide and subdivide power”
            until it was destroyed now found himself ensnared by the very system of
            power he was pledged to destroy. Nearly twenty years had passed since the
            publication of La Reaction y La Revolution. The Federalist cause had grown
            from a heretical sect into a’large movement embracing thousands of
            enraptured petty bourgeois. The severe repression initiated by Ramon
            Narvaez after 1856 had convulsed the lower middle classes, alienating them
            from the Liberal parties. From that point on, the Federalist movement began
            to grow and in 1869 Pi was elected to the Cortes, where he began to learn the
            techniques of parlimentary maneuvering.
              Having acquired the presidency, Pi began to maneuver with the factions of
            his own movement. The Intransigents embarrassed him by their “puerile
            impatience” and were treated cavalierly. This devotee of legality of whom
            Friedrich Engels oﬀered the curious description, “the only socialist in the
            Republican camp,” could oﬀer the lower classes little more than social
            abstractions. Although Pi probably had the broadest vision of all the
            politicians in the Federalist movement, his “socialism,” as Raymond Carr has
            observed, “did hot get beyond wage arbitration, a -minimum of state action to
            improve working conditions, agricultural credit, and a ‘generalization of
            property’ which would extend the liberal land revolution beyond the ‘new
            feudalism’ to the agrarian poor.” Thus, if the legal etiquette involved in
            establishing a federal republic goaded the Intransigents into action, the
            anemic Federalist program for social reform reduced the working glass and
            peasantry to passivity.
              In no sense could Pi be regarded as a revolutionary. His “socialism,”
            consisted of a hash of undeveloped notions, more akin to cooperativism than
            Anarchism or Marxian Socialism. Although the pressure exercised by the
            Intransigents was largely responsible for bringing him to power (a fact he
            well understood and used to advantage), Pi tended to rely on right-wing and
            centrist Federalists. He was quite prepared to use troops against Intransigent
            insurrectionaries and abhorred labor strikes. His “conciliatory” policies
            consisted largely of trying to cajole the Intransigents into making concessions
            to the moderate wings of the Cortes.
              The denouement came on July 12, when armed Cantonalists (as the
            Intransigents and their allies were knoyvn) took over the municipal
            government of Cartegena and declared themselves autonomous. The
            Cartegena revolt doomed Pi’s legalist “conciliatory” policy. The “father of
            Spanish Federalism” was now mistrusted by every faction in the movement.

            The right regarded him as too “socialistic” and “conciliatory”; the
            Intransigents, as treacherous and lacking in revolutionary zeal, although their
            deputies in the Cortes were prepared to support him against other
            tendencies. The Federalist center on which he rejied for parlimentary support
            had divided between the right and the Intransigents, leaving him isolated. On
            July 18, not three months after taking the presidency, Pi resigned his oﬀice
            and was replaced by Salmeron, who lacked Pi’s scruples and was prepared to
            jettison the federal republic for a more centralized state.[8]
              With Pi’s resignation, the Cantonalist revolt that had started in Cartagena
            now spread throughout the south. In a matter of days, July 19 to 22, armed
            Cantonalists took over the municipal governments of Seville, Cadiz, Valencia,
            Almansa, Terrevieja, Castellon, Granada, Malaga, Salamanca, Bailen, Andujar,
            Tarifa, Algeciras, and other smaller communities. The greatest support for the
            uprising came from Andalusia and the Levant. Madrid and Barcelona
            remained in the government’s hands* The Cantonalist revolt in the south was
            abetted by the outbreaks of a Carlist revolt in the Pyrenean passes and by
            disturbances in Madrid, which compelled the government to dispatch its best
            remaining troops to the north, leaving the key cities in Andalusia virtually
            unguarded.
              What role did the Spanish Federation play in these events? In reality, only a
            minor one. The Federation had anticipated that the political crisis in Spain
            would approach an acute stage and took steps to prepare for any contingency.
            In the spring of 1872, the Federal Council in Madrid sent Francisco Mora and
            Anselmo Lorenzo on tours of the sections—Mora to the eastern region,
            Lorenzo to Andalusia—with the aim of establishing an underground
            organization. The two men asked trusted militants in each section to form a
            special clandestine group called “Defenders of the International” whose
            function was to spearhead an insurrection or, in the event of repression, to
            engage in underground activity. These “Defenders” were the precursors of
            many other defense organizations that the Spanish Anarchists were to
            establish in the future.
              In the event of a successful insurrection, the “Defenders” were also
            expected to establish local revolutionary juntas that excluded bourgeois
            elements “if possible” (to use Lorenzo’s words). “Bourgeois elements,” of
            course, included Federalists as well as Liberals. But Lorenzo’s qualifying
            phrase is signiﬁcant; it reveals the ambiguity that had begun to permeate the
            Federation’s attitude toward the Federalist movement. Clearly, the Federation
            was nursing hopes for a Federalist victory in Spain, which it believed would
            provide the labor movement with a politically hospitable atmosphere. But
            since Anarchist principles required a resolutely antipolitical, class-oriented
            position, this dilemma was solved by a calculated form of “irresolution.” On
            the eve of the elections to the Constituent Cortes, the Federation aﬀirmed its
            antipolitical line by refusing to stand candidates. But it allowed the sections
            and individual Internationalists, if they so wished, to vote for the Federalists
            and cooperate with them.
              In practice, of course the Federation was too weak to follow an independent
            policy of its own except for Internationalist uprisings in Alcoy, San Lucar, and
            a few scattered communities in Andalusia. In Barcelona, the proletariat
            responded to the Federation’s plea for a general strike but refused to follow it

            along the path of social revolution. Intransigents and Internationalists worked
            together in establishing a Committee of Public Safety in Barcelona’s
            municipal’government. The Seville revolutionary junta was headed by the
            Internationalist, Mignorance. The Cartegena section may have played a role
            in winning the sailors over to the Cantonalist uprising, and Internationalists
            cooperated with Intransigents in Granada and Valencia. For the most part,
            however, the Cantonalist uprisings were followed by sharp recriminations
            between Anarchists and Federalists of all factions.
              The Cantonalists, although capable of mobilizing a much larger following
            than the Internationalists, were not strong enough to withstand a serious
            military assault by Madrid. With some three thousand troops, General Pavia
            captured Seville after two days of heavy ﬁghting and quickly reduced the
            rebellion in most Andalusian cities. Valencia held out for nearly two weeks
            against General Campos’s forces, and Cartegena, its landside protected by
            powerful ramparts and the naval base in Cantonalist hands, was enveloped by
            a long siege. But the city’s cause was doomed after the rest of the country had
            been subdued. After four’months it was taken owing to treachery by the
            oﬀicers of a key fortress.
              Generally, the Cantonalists dominated the struggle. But in Alcoy a
            community of thirty thousand people to the south of Valencia, the Spanish
            Federation managed to etch its own mark on the events of 1873. This old
            industrial town, a center of paper-making for centuries, and been penetrated
            and strongly inﬂuenced by Internationalists, and by early 1873 already
            enjoyed the distinction of furnishing outstanding Anarchist militants to the
            Spanish Federation. The Cordoba congress had decided to locate the Federal
            Commission at Alcoy because ﬁve of the Commission’s members came from
            the town. As a result, the relatively small industrial community became the
            center of the Spanish Federation on the eve of this nationwide rebellion.
              The street ﬁghting in Alcoy preceded by several days the Cantonalist
            uprising at Cartegena and almost stands out as a precursor of the
            insurrections that were to follow. Yet Alcoy exploded into insurrection not
            because of political or regional antagonisms, but as the result of an economic
            dispute between the paper workers and their employers.
              For some time there had been a vigorous agitation for an eight-hour day in
            the factories of Alcoy. The agitation, conducted by the local Internationalists,
            reached its climax on July 7, when an assembly of workers decided on a
            general strike to enforce its demands. On the following day, a delegation of
            factory employees appeared before the mayor at the City Hall, demanding
            that he summon the employers and present them with the workers’ demands.
            The mayor, a stolid Federalist by the name of Augustin Albors, decided to play
            for time. Assuring the workers of his neutrality in the strike, Albors
            treacherously urged the employers to stand ﬁrm and barricade themselves in
            their homes until military aid could be summoned. After dispatching a request
            for troops, he reversed his neutral stand and publicly denounced the strikers.
              It is doutbful if the Internationalists were really eager to foment an
            insurrection in Alcoy. They must have realized the vulnerability of an uprising
            in an isolated and patently indefensible town. Accordingly, they tried to
            negotiate with the municipal government. The next day a second delegation
            appeared at the City Hall with the warning that the mayor and his council
57 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            must either maintain their neutrality or resign if they wished to avoid a
            conﬂict. As the delegation was leaving, the police opened ﬁre on an unarmed
            crowd in the square. It was this stupid provocation rather than any “sinister”
            Internationalist design that triggered the Alcoy uprising. The senseless
            shootings infuriated the workers, who quickly gathered arms and besieged
            the City Hall. The police (numbering little more than thirty) ﬁnally
            surrendered after enduring a siege of twenty hours. They had simply run out
            of ammunition. Albors, adamant and stupid to the last, was shot and killed
            after ﬁring his pistol point-blank at the workers who were arresting him.
              The Alcoy uprising occurred on July 9, and its chances of enduring were far
            smaller than those of the later Cantonalist insurrections in the cities. The
            Internationalists established a Welfare Committee to manage the town, but its
            most pressing task was to negotiate favorable surrender terms from General
            Velarde, who was approaching from Alicante. Fortunately the committee
            received a promise of complete amnesty through the good oﬀices of a
            Federalist deputy, Cervera, and on July 12, Velarde entered Alcoy without
            meeting armed opposition.
              Many writers have dealt with the Alcoy uprising as a trivial episode that was
            submerged by the Cantonalist insurrections. In terms of its scope, they are
            correct. The entire event lasted little more than ﬁve days. By comparison with
            an historic event like the Paris Commune, Alcoy seems like a skirmish. That it
            occurred at all was due more to the dilatoriness of the military in Alicante
            than to the revolutionary fervor of the workers in Alcoy. Yet this brief episode
            created a sensation in Spain. Almost all shades of opinion, including
            Federalist, joined in condemning it. Doubtless, the well-to-do classes of Spain
            were haunted by images of the Paris Commune and the possibility of its
            recurrence in Spain. But there were also internal reasons for the fears Alcoy
            had aroused. For the ﬁrst time in Spanish history, an armed uprising had
            occurred that was orchestrated not by predictable elements such as the
            military, the church, or the Liberals, but by an avowedly revolutioriary
            working-class organization. For the ﬁrst time, the industrial proletariat in
            Spain had acted as an independent insurrectionary force.
              The uprising, coupled with the fall of Pi, guaranteed that the Spanish
            Federation would be physically suppressed. The organization, however,
            continued to maintain a public, if harrassed, existence for another half year
            while the bourgeois politicians in Madrid consummated the burial rites of the
            First Republic. Salmeron, who had taken over the presidency from Pi in July
            1873, was replaced in less than two months by Castelar, a Federalist whom
            the conservative classes and generals regarded as more pliable than his
            predecessors. Having strengthened the army’s position in Spanish politics,
            neither Salmeron nor Castelar could put it to rest. When it seemed that
            Castelar would not be able to stem a parlimentary drift back to the
            Federalists, the generals decided to act openly: In January 1874, General
            Pavia, the “savior of Spain” from a Cantonalist republic, pronounced against
            Castelar and installed General Serrano, a conservative military politician.
            Within a year it was clear that Serrano’s government could be little more than
            a transition to a restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. When a bloodless
            pronunciamiento by Martinez Campos brought Alfonso XII, Isabella’s son, to
            the throne a year later, it surprised no one in Spain or abroad. Even a
58 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            substantial number of Carlists defected to the new monarch.
              The Federalist movement, split irreparably by the Cantonalist uprisings,
            was to disappear under the Bourbon Restoration. Yet its importance for
            Spanish Anarchism can hardly be overestimated. Despite the sharp
            diﬀerences that were to emerge between the two movements during the
            revolt, they overlapped in many key areas. Both sought to weaken the central
            government (the Anarchists, of course, to abolish it) and to foster a vital
            regional and community life. The Intransigents, like the Anarchists, were
            prepared to use the most desperate insurrectionary methods to achieve their
            decentralized goals. Anarchists and Cantonalists fought together behind the
            same barricades in July 1873, and sat on the same revolutionary juntas in the
            provincial cities and towns. Later, many Federalists were to turn to Anarchism
            as the logical development of their decentralist aims. The Anarchists, in turn,
            were to elevate Pi y Margall to the status of a precursor of the libertarian
            movement in Spain.[9]
              No sooner had Serrano become president of the faltering republic in the
            early months of 1874, when he ruthlessly undertook the suppression not only
            of the more extreme Federalist groups, but also of the International. The
            meeting halls and workers’ centers of the Spanish Federation were closed
            down, its militants jailed by the hundreds, and its newspapers outlawed. At its
            high point in September 1873, the Federation probably numbered no more
            than 60,000 members, an insigniﬁcant fraction of the popular following the
            Federalists could muster. Even more telling than the arrests of
            Internationalists were the blows Serrano and the Restoration politicians
            struck at the movement’s base, the working class. Strikes were crushed at
            gunpoint and the right of workers to form labor unions was prohibited by law.
            In eﬀect the workers’ movement was thrown back nearly twenty years, when
            the cry “Association or Death” had rung in the streets of Barcelona. Nor did
            the persecution relent with the passing years. At La Carraca, as late as March
            1877, the police placed sixty-six Internationalists in weighted sacks and threw
            them into the sea. A doud, thick with fear and repression, had descended on
            Spain. It would last for nearly eight years.
              Somehow the Federation survived these persecutions. National congresses
            were abandoned for secret regional, or comarcal, conferences. Local
            underground presses replaced the editorial oﬀices of widely distributed public
            newspapers. Economic strikes were abandoned for revolutionary strikes—
            which essentially meant no strikes at all. Having drunk heavily from the fount
            of revolution, the Spanish Federation reorganized itself once again, this time
            into a small insurrectionary organization.
              A new structure geared almost entirely to armed revolt replaced the loose,
            informal public structure established by the Cordoba congress. In the tities,
            where it could once count on thousands of adherents and numerous sections,
            the International was reduced to a few dedicated Anarchists. The “Defenders
            of the International” were renamed the “Avenging Executive Nucleus,” a more
            aggressive title that accorded with the embattled and violent mood of
            Anarchism at the time.
              The fact is, of course, that the Internationalists in the tities were living on a
            myth. No revolution was in the oﬀing; indeed, the ﬁrst signs of mass urban
            revolutionary unrest were not to reappear in Spain until the turn of the
59 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            century. Lacking the power to conduct strikes for higher wages and better
            working conditions, the International had been deserted by the Spanish
            proletariat; hence it could feed only on ideology, hope, and conspiracy. Many
            native Catalan workers had never accepted the violent Anarchist theories of
            the Federation with enthusiasm. They might have entered typical reformistic
            labor unions in droves were it not for the continual inﬂux of Murcianos and
            the intransigence of the Catalan factory owners. In any case, with the
            increasing repression, the balance within the International began to shift from
            the north to the south. By February 1873, when the Spanish Federation’s
            membership had reached a peak of 60,000,two thirds were in Andalusia. It
            was in the agrarian south, in the mountain pueblos, the sun-drenched towns
            and cities, and on the ancient latifundia of Andalusia and the Levant, that
            Spanish Anarchism was to survive and grow during the early years of the
            Bourbon Restoration.
            Chapter Five: The Disinherited
            Peasant Anarchism
               To claim as some writers have done that Anarchism was imported into
            Andalusia and the Levant would not be entirely true. Perhaps it would be
            more appropriate to say that Anarchism was latent there, and the
            Internationalists evoked it. If the Anarchists of the cities had to build their
            own countersociety to an inhospitable and corrosive commercial world, the
            Anarchists of the countryside found one in their very midst. They had only to
            reshape some of its elements in order to create a living social milieu for
            libertarian ideas and ways of life.[10]
               The International had no diﬀiculty in winning over the braceros, the great
            mass of exploited gang workers who cultivated the latifundia of the
            Guadalquivir basin. But the real strength lay in the mountain pueblos, of
            Andalusia and the Levant—the “people of the sierra,” as J. A. Pitt-Rivers calls
            them. Here, where a few hundred families lived in compact towns surrounded
            by bare, jagged peaks, Anarchism struck its deepest and most lasting roots.
            Tenacity and continuity are among the most striking features of these
            communities and reveal themselves in many ways. The squat buildings of
            whitewashed granite boulders and uncut stone, so common in the mountains,
            are made to last, and village traditions often reach back for centuries of
            embattled Spanish history. The beginnings of some of these pueblos can be
            traced back to the Moorish invasions.
               In contrast to the rich Guadalquivir basin, the soil of the sierras is poor and
            marginal. Fighting an intractable land, the mountain peasants must coax out a
            mixed crop of vegetables and maize—this by hand labor, for machinery is not
            only costly but almost useless on the sloping, rocky soil. Olives, fruit, and
            stock-raising play a key role in the agricultural economy. Most of the
            mountain peasants own their own land, generally in plots of less than ﬁve
            acres. To compensate for the small size of these holdings, grazing is done on
            common land. A large pueblo of three thousand inhabitants or more, for
            instance, may own thousands of acres of forest and pasture. A substantial
60 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            minority, of peasants have larger holdings (in excess of ﬁve acres). Still
            another minority are essentially landless laborers who must contract for work
            in the pueblo or on large estates in the valley. The pueblo’s money is acquired
            mainly by selling fattened pigs for slaughter, but eggs, poultry, and a large
            part of the crop also ﬁnd their way to the market.
               Taken as a whole, the mountain pueblo is remarkably self-suﬀicient
            economically and almost wondrously self-contained culturally. The essential
            means of life—food, shelter, fuel, and in times past, clothing—come from
            within the pueblo itself; with the result that the mountain peasants are less
            vulnerable to economic vicissitudes than the braceros and industrial workers.
            The biggest problem they face is drought. In the arid lands of the south,
            rainfall and access to water are as close as one can come to an agricultural
            “mystique.” In other respects, mountain peasants have no love of nature, no
            mystical attitude toward the soil, no feeling for agriculture.
               Their deepest passion is social life: the joys of talk, argument, and
            companionship. Hence, houses cluster together, even if this means that
            peasants may have to walk long distances to their holdings. The virtues that
            are prized most highly are mutual aid, hospitality, loyalty, and honesty in
            dealings. So strong is this social cohesiveness that the pueblo answers for
            each of its members as a single community, and each in turn tends to value
            the good name of the pueblo over his or her own petty interests and concerns.
            Lope de Vega’s play Fuenteovejuna is based on the real story of a pueblo of
            the ﬁfteenth century that rose against a tyrannical knight and killed him.
            When the royal judges arrived and tried to determine who was responsible for
            his death, the only answer they could get was “Fuenteovejuna.” It was
            inconceivable that responsibility for an act by one of its members, which had
            the approval of the pueblo, should be regarded as anything but an act by the
            pueblo as a whole.
               This solidarity, reinforced by a harsh environment of sparse means and a
            common destiny of hard work, produces a ﬁerce egalitarianism. The preferred
            form of transaction between peasants and laborers is aperceria, or
            partnership, rather than wages. Although they own the land and work as hard
            as the laborers, the peasants may give as much as half the crop to their
            temporary “partners.” This type of relationship is preferred not only because
            it is wiser to share what one has in hand rather than to speculate on monetary
            returns, but also owing to a rich sense of fraternity and a disdain for
            possessive values. In the life of the pueblo, poverty confers absolutely no
            inferiority; wealth, unless it is spent in behalf of the community, confers
            absolutely no prestige. The rich who own property in or near the pueblo are
            generally regarded as a wicked breed whose power and ambitions corrupt
            society. Not only is the pueblo immune to their inﬂuence, but in reaction,
            tends to organize its values around the dignity of work and the importance of
            moral and spiritual goals.
               Before the 1870s the more energetic of these peasants might have turned to
            brigandage in their youth. The mountains were infested with bandits whose
            exploits as champions of the poor acquired, in some cases, larger-than-life
            proportions. But after the 1870s, the more capable of the mountain villagers
            became “los que tertian ideas” (“those who had ideas”). They embraced
            Anarchism with a devotion that was to survive every persecution but the

            meticulous execution squads of the fascist Falange.
              To be an Anarchist in the mountain pueblos involved adopting all the
            personal standards of the Anarchists in the cities. A man did not smoke, drink,
            or go to prostitutes, but lived a sober, exemplary life in a stable free union
            with a compañera. The church and state were anathema, to be shunned
            completely. Children were to be raised and educated by libertarian standards
            and dealt with respectfully as sovereign human beings.
              But there were also marked diﬀerences between the Anarchism of the
            industrial cities and the Anarchism of the countryside. As proletarian
            Anarchism drifted increasingly toward syndicalism, it gave a strong emphasis
            to organizational expediency. Peasant Anarchism retained its intertsely moral
            elements, often conﬂicting with the values and demands of the cities. As PittRivers observes, “the telegrams to the-congress of 1882 which came from
            Catalonia and the north ring with phrases like ‘anarco-sindicalistas.’ Those
            from the sierra talk only of justice and the cause of the people.” Such
            diﬀerences were to reemerge in every major dispute that divided the Spanish
            Anarchists. City and country were to conﬂict on the merits of national over
            local organization, on the value of libertarian communism as against
            Bakunin’s collectivism, on agrarian communes versus the division of the land
            into individual holdings (the reparto). But these disputes belong to later years,
            when peasant Anarchism began to give way to Anarchosyndicalism.
              Living in a world that demanded fewer of the compromises facing their
            urban comrades, the Anarchists of the sierra walked like unblemished
            prophets among their people. Their ascendancy was based on no authority or
            social position. As targets of the clergy, Civil Guard, and large landowners,
            the Anarchists of the sierra could command no resources other than a respect
            earned by the exemplary nature of their behavior and the relevancy of their
            ideas. Lacking any formal inﬂuence, they were utterly vulnerable. The Civil
            Guard often made its own law in the rural hinterland of Spain. That the village
            Anarchists could survive the mobilized institutions of the state and church is
            compelling evidence of the popular support they acquired.
              True, they were semi-educated men, and their ideas often seem crude to the
            more literate and sophisticated mind. But it is easy to forget that during the
            late nineteenth century in Spain, the village Anarchists were virtually the sole
            voices of science and modernism in the sierra. Only from the Anarchists could
            the peasants hope to learn of such men as Darwin, Helmholtz, Laplace—or, for
            that matter; Galileo and Copernicus. Always ready to expound upon their
            views, they formed the center of all discussions on religion, politics, science,
            morality, and education. Many children in the pueblos acquired the rudiments
            of reading and writing from these conscientious “apostles of the Idea.” And
            they were the only voices of protest against injustices by the local notables,
            bringing the complaints of the villagers to the outside world in the form of
            letters and articles to the Anarchist press. The people of the sierra, in turn,
            consulted them endlessly on all the petty details of village life. They were the
            arbiters of personal disputes and of malfeasances perpetrated by one villager
            on another— the source of advice on endless practical questions.
              The majority of villagers, to be sure, were never actively occupied with.the
            Anarchist movement. Although aroused to action in periods of distress or
            hope, in ordinary times they went about their daily business with very little
62 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            interest in anarchistic tenets. On the other hand, the convinced Anarchist
            militants formed a tight nucleus within the larger arena of the pueblo. They
            became, in eﬀect, a clan, even “intermarrying” and establishing blood ties.
            E.J. Hobsbawm, who made a close study of the Casas Viejas uprising, found
            that Maria (“La Liberteria”), the daughter of Curro Cruz, the old Anarchist
            militant who sparked the uprising, was “engaged” to Jose Cabanas Silva, the
            most outstanding of the younger militants. Another member of the Silva
            family was the secretary of the Laborers’s union. The Cruz and Silva families
            were united not only by the relationship of Maria and Jose, but by the tragedy
            of the uprising itself.
               In the valleys, and at lower elevations in the basin of the Guadalquivir, the
            smaller farms of the mountain peasants give way to large estates and ﬁnally
            to the latifundia, the great plantations that characterize the Andalusian
            countryside. It is here that one encounters the most glaring extremes of rural
            wealth and poverty, of extravagant opulence and chronic hunger. And it is
            here too, among the landless, rural proletarians—the braceros—that
            Anarchism found another kind of mass support, as shifting and changeable as
            the volatile moods of the Andalusian poor.
               If the tenacity of the Anarchist movement in the sierra can be explained by
            the solidity of the pueblo, the instability of this movement on the latifundia
            can be explained by the poverty of social forms among the braceros. Brought
            together and then scattered by the seasonal demands of plantation
            agriculture, these great masses of rural laborers lacked any deﬁnable social
            outlines or institutions. They did not live on the landlord’s estate like serfs, or
            in villages like peasants, or even in large cities as did the industrial workers,
            but rather in the slums of dismal Andalusian towns of 15,000 inhabitants or
            more. These towns were too large and formless to provide the solidarity of a
            sierra pueblo and too small to aﬀord the stimulation of a Barcelona.
               Drab and purposeless, the lives of the braceros were completely unstable.
            Hired by the season, the week, or the day (they were, in fact, commonly called
            jomaleros, or day laborers), they worked, with occasional smoking breaks, for
            twelve or more hours daily at considerable distances from home. During the
            plowing and harvesting seasons, when several months of continuous work
            could be guaranteed, the bracero would be expected to leave his family and
            live in the landlord’s ganania, a shabby, barn-like barracks, where his bed was
            some straw on the ﬂoor and his companions were lonely, miserable wretches
            like himself, torn from their home and families by the need to work.
               Their misery beggars description. The landlord fed them gazpacho, a soup
            of water, oil, vinegar, bread, and some beans or chick peas. Bread, eaten as a
            substitute for virtually all the alimentary staples, formed the basic diet of the
            Andalusian poor. A landlord who added other ingredients to this
            impoverishing and stunting diet could be expected to deduct his additional
            costs from the bracero’s wages. The inhuman neglect these people suﬀered as
            late as the 1930s is conveyed in an account by E.H.G. Dobby, an English
            geographer who spent two years engaged in ﬁeldwork in Spain:
                 I recall an incident during a visit to an experimental pig farm in an
                 out-of-the-way part of Andalusia. From the darkness at one end of
                 the building came a red glow. I went along and found a laborer’s
63 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
                 family crouched on the ﬂoor around a twig ﬁre with smoke so thick
                 that breathing was diﬀicult. The malodorous squalor contrasted
                 with the carefully washed sties that I had been seeing. To my query
                 an old woman mumbled: “Yes, we live here. Worse than the pigs.” At
                 which the owner beside me exclaimed indignantly: “You have a roof
## over your head. What more do you want?”

              The response of the oymer sums up, with priceless clarity, the attitude of
            the Andalusian landed classes toward the braceros: they were regarded as
            less than animals. And to form a complete picture of life in the gananias
            during sowing or harvesting time, one must add to this description twenty or
            more people of all ages. If a family was present, every member worked,
            including the children, often to the point of sheer exhaustion.
              Economically, the impoverished braceros were at the mercy of the landlord,
            who could lower their wages and break their strikes by hiring scab labor from
            the mountain villages or by simply cultivating the best land and letting the
            rest lie fallow. Indeed, large tracts of land were not placed under cultivation:
            some were returned to game for hunting, others to pasture for breeding
            ﬁghting bulls. Owing to their extreme poverty, the braceros could rarely
            conduct long attritive strikes; hence the violent, near-insurrectionary
            dimensions of labor conﬂicts in Andalusia. Indeed, the strikes had virtually no
            staying power without support from peasants who owned or leased land in the
            latifundia regions. If the landowners were not panicked into concessions by
            the fear of a widespread jacquerie or peasant war, the strikers usually lost
            out. Occasionally, public opinion shifted to their side and the less inhumane
            landowners made concessions on their own.
              To starving, landless proletarians who worked a half year or less for a
            pittance, the sight of large areas of untilled land could generate only one kind
            of feeling: a searing hatred for the landlord ancl the stewards who executed
            his orders. Their antagonism might have been contained in 1835, when
            Mendizabal and his Liberal ministry initiated the conﬁscation of the church
            lands. In the following years, immense tracts of ecclesiastical and common
            land were put up for sale in Andalusia. As noted earlier, this enormous legacy
            was snatched up by the bourgeoisie and turned, for the most part, into
            latifundia. The braceros acquired nothing. Agrarian unrest was answered not
            by land reform but by the use of the Civil Guard—the detested Guardia—
            against the peasantry and landless laborers.
              Historically, the role of this special police force in promoting revolutionary
            unrest in the countryside has been so important that it must be discussed as a
            distinct factor in the development of peasant Anarchism. An elite
            constabulary, carefully selected and well-disciplined, the Civil Guard was
            established in 1844 to deal with the growing banditry in the south. By this
            time, the great bulk of Andalusian bandits no longer even remotely
            approximated the heroic image they had acquired in popular legend. They had
            become the tools of the caciques. They were used to defend property against
            the upsurge of peasant unrest and intimidate the opponents of their corrupt
            political bosses in local elections. The alliance between the caciques and
            bandits served not to abate brigandage, but to expand it. Shielded from
            imprisonment by the patronage of their new employers, the bandits began to
64 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            raid with impunity. A point was ﬁnally reached where travel between
            Andalusian towns was virtually impossible without an armed escort.
              To restore the security of the roads by using the local militia and police
            would have been useless. Like the bandits, they too had been largely taken
            over by the caciques. Thus, when the Civil Guard was formed, strict measures
            had to be taken to insulate the new force from local inﬂuence. Its men were
            never recruited from the districts in which they served, and they were
            expressly forbidden to intermarry or establish familiar relations with the local
            population. Civil Guards occupied special fortiﬁed barrracks within the
            village. They invariably walked in pairs, fully armed, and exuded a mistrust
            toward the community that soon enveloped them in hostility. A force apart,
            increasingly detested, the Guardia became easily unnerved and trigger-happy,
            escalating minor protests into riots and riots into insurrections. Whatever
            support the revolutionary groups could not mobilize with their literature and
            oratory, the Guardia eventually gained for them with its carbines. Narvaez,
            who organized this force and sent it on its way into the countryside, deserves
            to be enshrined as one of the ablest propagandists of the Anarchist and
            Socialist movements in Spain.
              Frustrated by the disposition of the church lands, prodded by the carbines
            of the Guardia, and threatened by the values of a crassly egoistic business
            civilization, the peasantry and braceros of the south were to create their own
            unique form of social revolt. By the late 1860s, a new kind of restlessness
            began to stir the pueblos, gananias, and drab towns of the south: a sense of
            mounting exaltation that was to surge up at various points, suddenly
            enveloping the rural masses in hope and sweeping them into local
            insurrections. Often they occurred not merely for narrow economic gains, but
            to achieve comunismo libertario: the libertarian communism described in
            Anarchist pamphlets. Writers on the Andalusian uprisings—including the
            Anarchists themselves—tend to emphasize the millenarian quality of these
            outbursts; and it is true that in the naive and simple directness of their
            visions, the insurgent peasants and braceros of Andalusia seemed to parallel
            the rural folk of the late middle ages with their enraptured dreams of a
            “second coming.” Evil and wickedness would be banished from the earth. Rich
            and poor, enlightened by the bright reality of a new world, would embrace in
            a spirit of reconciliation and mutual aid. It would be an ascetic world—“a just
            sharing of austerity rather than a dream of riches,” as Hobsbawm notes—but
            peace, freedom, and equality would reign. Not only would money, wealth, and
            diﬀerences in social rank disappear, but to the more austere adherents,
            people would cease to partake of tobacco, alcohol, coﬀee, and other “vicepromoting” luxuries.
              This vision would percolate in the gananias of the latifundia and the
            mountain pueblos, .gradually building up until it seemed that nothing was
            worth discussing but its merits and possibilities. Then it would boil up,
            precipitated by a strike or a stupid act by the authorities. There would be a
            brief period of ﬁghting, followed by a period of repression in which the dream
            would seem to evaporate. Elation and hope would be succeeded by sullen
            despair and fatalism. Ricardo Mella, the sensitive Anarchist essayist who lived
            in Andalusia for many years, recalls the volatile temperament of the people,
            so quick to rise in boundless enthusiasm and then sink into dejection, lacking
65 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            doggedness and staying power. Later, however, passions would begin to surge
            up again, and the dream would reappear. The cycle would be repeated with
            the same fervor, as though a regeneration had occurred without a background
            of past defeats.
              But granting the cycles of periodic uprising and decline, the agrarian
            movement in the south had a solid economic core that accounts for its
            continual revival in the face of unfavorable odds. For many peasants and
            braceros, comunismo libertario was equated with the reparto—the redivision
            of the land. In Andalusia, where a vast acreage was needlessly left
            uncultivated or used with gross ineﬀiciency, a rational redivision of the land
            would have raised the standard of living enormously and provided a powerful
            spur to Spain’s economic development. In the 1870s and early 1880s, the
            reparto meant the division of the land into individual holdings, not collective
            farms. Even the peasant Anarchists adhered to this view. Later, with the
            growth of Anarchosyndicalist unions, the braceros and, to a lesser degree, the
            peasants were won over to a communal system of land tenure.
              What doomed the agrarian movement of the period was not the
            impracticability of its visions but its isolation. The upsurges were usually
            limited to a few localities, each following the other like ﬁrecrackers on a
            string. Rarely was there an explosion throughout the entire region. The
            pueblos had yet to be linked with the gananias. Periodicals were needed to
            bring tidings of the social movement in one district to the attention of others.
            Organization was necessary to coordinate the insurrections into a common
            movement. Finally, and most importantly of all, the barriers separating the
            industrial cities from the countryside had to be demolished and the workers’
            movement joined with that of the peasants.
            Agrarian Unions and Uprisings
              Andalusians such as Trinidad Soriano, Jose Garcia Vinas, and Antonio
            Gonzalez Meneses were active in establishing the Barcelona nucleus of the
            International and participated in the founding congress of the Spanish
            Federation in June 1870. They were students of technology, medicine, and
            engineering, residents of the Catalan seaport who had gathered around Farga
            Pellicer in the early days of Internationalist activity and were later to return
            to their homes in the south where most of them functioned as Anarchist
            propagandists. In addition, La Federacion had begun to reach a number of
            Andalusian cities, where it had a limited circulation among extreme left-wing
            Federalists, the more “socialistic” followers of Proudhon and Pi y Margall.
            Throughout 1870, however, the real strength of the Spanish Federation lay in
            the north, particularly in Barcelona and nearby textile towns. All seductive
            preconceptions aside, the fact is that Spanish Anarchism ﬁrst developed
            among urban industrial workers and craftsmen, not millenarian peasants.
            Dreaming millenarians and saintly apostles can, of course, be found but
            Spanish Anarchism’s earliest intellectual adherents contained a fair
            proportion of technicians and scientists.
              In 1871, the Spanish Eederation began to-make serious headway in the
            cities of the south, and thereafter it grew rapidly. A year later, Anselmo

            Lorenzo, touring Andalusia, could report with great satisfaction that viable
            groups existed in Seville, Carmona, Jerez, Malaga, and Cadiz. The Federation
            could also claim small groups in Cordoba, Aguilar de la Frontera, and other
            communities. In the years to come, these towns were to play a key role in the
            spread of Anarchist ideas among the braceros and peasants of the south. By
            the end of 1872, the Federation could claim close to 28,000 members in
            Andalusia, more than half its national following.
              Andalusia would have provided a fertile ground for the growth of Aﬁarchist
            ideas even in the absence of any Socialist or Federalist precursors. By the
            1860s, the south of Spain was slipping into a condition of chronic social
            upheaval. The sale of the church properties and particularly of the entailed
            lands (the latter, mostly held communally by the villages and municipalities)
            had upset the traditional equilibrium between the ruling classes and the
            oppressed of the region. For generations the walled, white-washed cortijo of
            the landlord and his overseers had dominated the latifundium like a selfcontained fortress of privilege and exploitation. In the ﬁrst half of the
            nineteenth century, a relationship still obtained in which the arrogance of the
            wealthy was pitted against the fatalism of the hungry and impoverished.
              It would have been bad enough if the expropriations of the church
            properties, after opening the prospect of a reparto, had cheated the peasants
            and braceros of their last hope to acquire land by legal means. The sale of the
            conﬁscated lands, however, not only severed the last ties between the landless
            and the state; it strengthened the power of a grasping bourgeoisie which
            lacked even the tempering aristocratic pretensions and paternalism of the
            traditional nobility. In the large cities, wealthy middle-class families became
            absentee landlords, owners of immense latifundia. In the rural communities,
            many local bourgeois (a class of usurers, produce dealers, bailiﬀs, and
            lawyers) acquired smaller but substantial properties of their own. From this
            latter stratum came the caciques of Andalusia—the men who made a mockery
            of every election in the countryside. In their abrasive exploitation and
            relentless pursuit of proﬁt, this rural bourgeoisie helped stoke a rebellion that
            could ﬁnd relief only in the uprooting of the entire structure of Andalusian
            society.
              The decay of traditional relations in Andalusia aﬀected not only the
            peasantry and braceros, but also the lower petty bourgeoisie of the provincial
            towns and cities. This large class of school teachers, civil servants, journalists,
            professionals, and shopkeepers lived in a genteel poverty that mingled
            insecurity with humiliation. By the midnineteenth century, the advance of
            capitalism into the south had stripped their vocations of all social prestige.
            They too, reduced increasingly to a reservoir of exploitable labor, began to
            suﬀer from the general exploitation of the area. The superﬁcial unity that
            Liberalism had created among all the middle classes during the early part of
            the century began to give way to a polarization of prosperous and
            impoverished classes, driving the petty bourgeoisie—particularly its
            intellectual stratum—into extreme Federalist and even vaguely Socialist
            groupings.
              Andalusia, it should be noted, is not lacking in a Socialist tradition of its
            own. Even before Fernando Garrido in Madrid had founded La Atraccion
            (generally described as the ﬁrst Spanish Socialist—actually Fourierist—
67 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            periodical), Juan Abreu had been propagating similar ideas in Cadiz. Later, he
            established a Fourierist colony near Jerez de la Frontera, but it was
            suppressed by the authorities. The expansion of a militant Federalist
            movement into the south had created a great interest in Socialist ideas, which
            was fed by pamphlets on Proudhon’s mutualist notions and by translations of
            his writings. A strong tradition of exaltado Republicanism from the 1820s
            provided a certain muscularity to these ideas by emphasizing the bitter’
            antagonism between the rich and poor, the owners of property and the
            dispossessed.
              This muscularity represents one of the most striking features of the radical
            movement in the south. It would be no exaggeration to say that, during the
            1850s and 1860s, the radical petty bourgeoisie of Andalusia had developed
            into one of the most insurrectionary strata in Europe. Only the Parisians could
            have matched the reckless propensity of the Andalusians to take up arms,
            build barricades, and do battle, often against hopeless odds. Major uprisings
            broke out in southern cities in 1857, in 1861, and again in 1873. The ﬁrst of
            these, led by the veterinarian Perez del Alamo in Loja, has earned a place in
            the annals of Spanish revolutionary history as an insurreccion socialista. By
            the early 1870s the social terrain of the entire region had been thoroughly
            prepared to receive the most advanced.ideas emanating from Madrid and
            Barcelona. It could be said, in fact, that Anarchism represented not the seed
            of a new social theory, which found a congenial soil in Andalusia, but the
            fruition of a great revolutionary development in ideas and social conditons
            that had been initiated decades earlier.
              In some respects, this cumulative development accounts for the slow
            growth of the Spanish Federation in the southern cities during 1870 and
            1871. The Federalist movement almost completely occupied the energies of
            the Andalusian revolutionaries, leaving little room as yet for the expansion of
            the International. Inquiries about the International had been received from
            Montilla, for example, as early as April 1871, but as Diaz del Moral tells us,
            municipal political conﬂicts so engrossed the radical movement of the
            Andalusian city that a viable section could not be formed until nearly two
            years later. Owing to the work of Diaz del Moral, however, we can form a
            fairly clear picture of how the earliest Andalusian sections were established
            and the kind of people they attracted.
              One of the most complete accounts of these beginnings can be given for the
            city of Cordoba. The earliest evidence of Internationalist activity appeared in
            the summer of 1871, when Rafael Suarez and the newspaperman Jose
            Navarro Prieto began to correspond with the Federal Council in Madrid.
            Later, they were joined by three others: the craftsman Francisco Barrado
            Garcia; a professor of canonical law, Augustin Cervantes, and a municipal
            employee, Eugenio Gonzalez. This curious assortment of vocations was not
            unusual in radical groups in the south. All ﬁve men were initiated into the
            Bakuninist Alliance and, by 1872, had established a “section of various
            trades” and later a local federation in Cordoba. Diaz del Moral leaves us a
            colorful description of the two intellectuals in the group, Navarro and
            Cervantes. Their contrasting personalities provide a fascinating picture of the
            varied human types who were drawn to Anarchism at that period.
              Jose Navarro Prieto had barely reached nineteen years of age when he
68 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            began his correspondence with the Federal Council. As was the case with so
            many young Andalusian radicals of the day, in his background we see an
            overlapping of the worlds of craftsman and middle-class intellectual. There
            was the father, a shoemaker who demanded a higher station in life for his only
            son; the university education, acquired at great parental sacriﬁce; the
            prospect of stagnating as a schoolteacher or a lawyer. Navarro, however, was
            much too restless and hedonistic to sacriﬁce his youth to an academic routine.
            The prospect of a niggardly professional life must have appalled him. He
            turned to journalism and began to develop a local reputation as a biting
            satirist. His wit and mental agility soon made him into one of the most
            outstanding Internationalists in the south, and by 1872 he enjoyed the
            conﬁdence of the Aliancistas in Madrid and Barcelona.
              But apparently he also enjoyed a reputation for cowardice in the face of
            physical danger. The defeat of the Federalist movement in 1873 and the
            prospect of repression under Serrano began to raise political doubts in his
            mind which carried him steadily toward the parties of “order.” Navarro soon
            became a complete conservative. In later years, he more than fulﬁlled his
            father’s aspirations by becoming a leading newspaper publisher and editor.
            After his death, he was remembered fondly by his conservative friends as an
            ingenious prankster, a jovial and agreeable character who, in Diaz del Moral’s
            words was “more dedicated to Dionysus than to Apollo.”
              Navarro’s amiable, fun-loving personality was very common in the south,
            contradicting the stereotype of the mystical Andalusian Anarchist, and many
            men with his youthful zest and tastes entered the International. Andalusia
            also had its share of sober ﬁgures like Augustin Cervantes, made of more
            spiritual stuﬀ than Navarro and able to withstand persecution with greater
            fortitude. The son of a Murcian lawyer, Don Augustin Cervantes del Castillo
            Valero attended the University of Madrid and ﬁnally acquired a doctorate,
            with degrees in law, philosophy, and letters. He was a serious student, a
            taciturn young man who presented a reserved and withdrawn mien. This
            imposing demeanor, coupled with great learning and a varied cultural
            background, carried Cervantes into the upper strata of the academic world.
            By the age of thirty he was already a professor in the University of Cordoba.
            His marriage two years later to Dona Julia Valdivia y Ruiz de Valenzuela
            brought him into the highest society of the city.
              Yet there was a passionate feeling for humanity in Don Augustin that
            manifested itself in visits to the poorer quarters of the city, where he gave
            money to the needy. The Cordobese notables knew nothing about these visits.
            A few months after his marriage, Cervantes openly espoused the cause of the
            International, and his peers were stunned. He published a propagandistic
            work. Three Socialist Discourses on Property and Inheritance, and
            participated in the Cordoba congress of the International as a delegate of the
            local federation of Solana. A social vacuum began to envelop Cervantes. His
            bourgeois friends—including Republicans—began to withdraw from him, and
            he soon found himself almost entirely in the company of the Internationalists.
            Finally, when he criticized Catholicism from his academic chair, he was
            savagely attacked by oﬀicial society. Finding it intolerable to stay at the
            university, Cervantes left Cordoba to take up an exchange professorship in
            Badajoz, where he died shortly afterward.

              Although their destinies were to diﬀer, Navarro and Cervantes were men of
            ability; more signiﬁcantly, they were surrounded by a complement of highly
            dedicated working-class elements. The Cordoba nucleus began to prosper.
            After June 1872, it increased to ﬁfty-four members and established itself
            among the shoe and hat workers of the city. At the Cordoba congress in
            December, the section played host to leading Internationalists from all over
            Spain and its members began to acquire a degree of national prominence. The
            declaration of a republic two months later gave tremendous impetus to the
            group. It led a successful strike of weavers, established a progressive school,
            and by June, managed to publish a newspaper of its own, El Orden. Riding on
            the Federalist groundswell of the late spring, the Cordobese Internationalists
            elected their own candidate, the Aliancista Barrado, to the municipal council
            without any demonstrable qualms over an Anarchist occupying a seat in a
            bourgeois legislative body.
              The agitation during these months was spectacular. Internationalist and
            Federalist propaganda rolled from the presses. The upheaval spread from the
            city to the countryside, breaking out in incendiarism. There were rumors of an
            impending Federalist and Internationalist revolt. Paramilitary groups were
            formed by Federalists and Monarchists, each threatening to take over the city,
            which was a strategic southern railroad hub. Anticipating a rising, the
            military governor, General Ripoll, arrested suspects from both groups. Later
            General Pavia and his troops took over Cordoba. The Republican militia was
            disarmed, with the result that the city never rose in the Cantonalist
            insurrections of July 1873. Their enthusiasm waning, the Federalists
            suspended the publication of their newspapers and began to make themselves
            scarce. It was around this time that Navarro began to defect from the
            workers’ movement and drift toward the governmental party. Even the worthy
            Don Augustin prudently withdrew from Internationalist activity. Led by the
            craftsman Barrado, the Cordobese section now consisted exclusively of
            workers. Yet, despite the mounting repression and the desertion of the
            intellectuals, it continued to grow; El Orden, for instance, reached its
            maximum circulation during the late summer of 1873.
              With the accession of Castelar to the presidency, however, a crackdown
            began in earnest. Constitutional guarantees were suspended, strikers were
            threatened with gunﬁre if they refused to return to work, the centros obreros
            were closed down, and the most militant Internationalists found themselves in
            jail. On October 1, 1873, Barrado was arrested and later deported to Alicante.
            The Cordoba section now began to decline rapidly. Under Serrano’s harsh
            dictatorship, which replaced the Castelar regime in January 1874, the entire
            Spanish Federation was forced underground. By April, after weeks of harsh
            persecution, the Cordobese section disappeared completely as an organized
            group. The hopes it had engendered throughout the spring and summer of
            1873 were to be nursed for years by a handful of isolated, scattered
            individuals. Not until 1881, when a resurgence of radical activity swept Spain,
            was the movement to revive in an organized form.
              The Cordobese section gives us a fairly typical picture of the development
            followed by the early Anarchist movement in the Andalusian cities.
            Intellectuals play the initiating role in establishing a nucleus, but they are
            soon surrounded by workers, usually craftsmen, who form the lasting bedrock
70 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            of the local organization. The movement in the cities is not millenarian or
            wildly apocalyptic. On the contrary, it takes root in a suprisingly stolid manner
            and grows rapidly only under the impetus of events. When the situation
            becomes too risky, the majority of intellectuals drop away or undergo a
            “modiﬁcation” of their faith that leaves the group in the hands of its workingclass adherents. From that point on, the Anarchist movement becomes a
            predominantly proletarian (or peasant) organization. Its outstanding militants
            are recruited from the shops and factories.
              It is interesting to note how closely the development of the Cordobese
            section was paralleled by the International in Seville, another major center of
            Andalusian Anarchism. Here too, a leading role in establishing an organizing
            nucleus was played by two intellectuals. Trinidad Soriano had by this time
            returned to his home in Seville and was playing a key role in establishing a
            movement in the city. Then there was Nicolas Alonso Marselau, a left-wing
            Republican who had come to Anarchism at the end of the 1860s. He
            established La Razon, the ﬁrst Internationalist newspaper in the city and one
            of the earliest in Andalusia. Marselau had been a theology student, and his
            background was very similar to that of Cervantes. His participation in any
            major decision of the local group was considered so important that, when
            Lorenzo visited the city to establish the “Defenders of the International,” the
            Aliancistas trooped to the Seville jail where Marselau was conﬁned and
            conferred with him there. But the onset of blindness and the upheavals of the
            1870s shattered all his left-wing convictions. He renounced Anarchism to
            become a Trappist monk. The movement he helped to create was destroyed by
            Pavia and Serrano. When it revived, its nucleus and supporters were mainly
            proletarian. There was, for instance, the cobbler Sanchez Rosa, who had only
            two years of formal education. After an embattled youth, in which he
            participated in the famous Jerez uprising and suﬀered imprisonment, Rosa
            became an outstanding Anarchist propagandist and educator. He founded
            progressive and libertarian schools and acquired a certain renown for his
            simple moral dialogues on the virtues of anarchy and the evils of capitalism.
              In the end, Serrano and his successor Canovas were not to prevail in their
            attempts to repress the Anarchist movement. The crushing of the Cantonalist
            insurrections were to turn many Federalists into active libertarians. The
            prestige that the International acquired among the ordinary workers was
            enormous. Later, with the revival of radical activity, they were to enter its
            successor organizations in greater numbers than before. No less important is
            the eﬀect the Federalist movement and insurrections had in disseminating
            radical ideas among the peasants and braceros. The shock waves of Federalist
            activity and the Cantonalist barricades radiated outward from the cities of
            Andalusia into the countryside. The rural poor, emulating the revolutionaries
            in the cities, set ﬁre to the landlord’s crops and haylofts, killed his watch
            dogs, injured his cattle, and tried to destroy some of the cortijos. Wandering
            Anarchist propagandists, many of them refugees or deportees from “urban
            repression, appeared in the pueblos and gananias, and their role in spreading
            Anarchist ideas can hardly by overestimated. Years after Serrano suppressed
            the International in the cities, Anarchist ideas were to percolate deeply into
            the Andalusian countryside.
              The Spanish Federation, however, was now in hopeless decline. Its history
71 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            between 1874 and 1880 is a humiliating one. The Federal Commission,
            continually in ﬂight from the police, clawed itself to shreds with internal
            bickering. A quarrelsome, unstable body with a waning following and obscure
            leaders, it had ﬁnally lost the respect of its small rank and ﬁle. Elections to
            the Commission were treated as a joke, an occasion for a good deal of
            malicious humor. The once-feared Spanish Federation simply faded away.
            When the revival of the 1880s came, the Federation was no longer to be seen
            in the major cities of Spain.
              The Federation’s sister organizations north of the Pyrenees also declined.
            The Bakuninist International, founded at St. Imier, held its last congress in
            1877 in the Belgian industrial town of Verviers. This libertarian organization
            had lasted only ﬁve years. Its decline is usually atributed to the destruction of
            the craft industry in the Jura, the famous Swiss watchmakers among whom
            the Bakuninists had acquired so much support in the previous decade, but
            this explanation is only partly true. Perhaps a more important reason for the
            decline of the libertarian International and the Anarchist movement generally
            in Europe was the economic stabilization that began in the mid-1870s, an
            upswing that fostered conservative attitudes in the working class. The
            Marxists, with their policy of electoral activity, parlimentarianism, and
            reformist unions, were to reap the rewards of the period and win the bulk of
            the workers outside of Spain and France.
              It was not merely police repression that destroyed the International in
            Spain, but also tactics nurtured by its isolation. In the autumn of 1878 Juan
            Olivia Moncasi, a young Internationalist from Tarragona, tried to assassinate
            Alfonso XII by ﬁring two shots at the king in the Calle Mayor in Madrid. The
            attempt failed, but the government used the occasion to heighten its
            repressive measures against the labor movement as a whole. Many union
            militants as well as Anarchists were arrested. The Catalan workers responded
            with retaliatory strikes and the peasants in Andalusia with a wave of
            incendiarism. The Spanish Federation’s commitment to terrorism and the
            reprisals provoked by the assassination attempt exacerbated the poor
            relationship between the Federal Commission and the working class. The
            greatest strain existed in Catalonia, where the International had its largest
            proletarian following. When the moderately Liberal government of Sagasta
            replaced the Canovas ministry in February 1881, the sentiment of the Catalan
            workers veered sharply away from the violent policies of the Federal
            Commission.
              An attempt was now made to establish a more conventional type of labor
            federation, avowedly Anarchist in theory but essentially opportunistic in
            practice. The founding congress of the Workers’ Federation of the Spanish
            Region, as the new organization was called, convened in the memorable
            Teatro del Circo of Barcelona on September 24, 1881. One hundred and forty
            delegates representing 162 federations through Spain answered the call—a
            remarkably large response if one considers that the labor movement had just
            emerged from years of severe repression. Although more than a decade of
            rich experiences separated the two founding congresses at the Teatro, the
            proceedings seem almost like a replay of the disputes that had occurred in
            1870. Republicans tried to gain a commitment to political action. Predictably,
            some of the more forthright trade unionists sought a conventional labor

            organization, explicitly aimed at reforms and economic gains. The congress
            rejected both of these positions by large votes, declaring Anarchism to be the
            social goal of the Spanish working class. It emphatically rejected political
            tactics as means for achieving its aims. Organizationally, the Workers’
            Federation modeled itself on the decentralized structure of the old Spanish
            Federation, but there were modiﬁcations in the local unions (uniones de
            oﬁcios smiles) which closely resembled the forms that were to be adopted
            later by the CNT.
               The vote accepting Anarchism as an ideal was overwhelming—110 to 8—but
            the rhetoric could barely conceal a basic shift toward conventional, indeed
            moderate, unionism. Over strong opposition by the more militant Anarchists,
            the new Workers’ Federation decided as a matter of policy to accumulate a
            strike fund. It also decided to limit rigorously the. use of the strike as a
            weapon. A strike, when unavoidable, was to be orderly and well-disciplined. It
            was to rely on attrition rather than compulsion to gain its ends. Essentially,
            this meant an end to labor violence and sabotage—in short, to militant, quasiinsurrectionary strikes.
               This approach marked a decisive defeat for the serious Anarchists in the
            union. That the more conventional Catalan union leaders could prevail was
            due in part to the disunity and ideological confusion among the delegates who
            called themselves Anarchists. The old Bakuninist Alliance of Social
            Democracy, which played so decisive a role in orienting the Spanish
            Federation, had gone down together with the International. By the 1880s
            there was no national Anarchist movement in Spain. Instead there was a
            quarreling multitude of Anarchist groups whose ideas ranged so far aﬁeld
            that at one extreme they were little more than Republicans and at the other,
            embattled, individualistic terrorists. There were also many outright reformists
            who called themselves “Anarchists” because of the prestige and romantic aura
            that had begun to surround the word among the workers.
               Another factor that accounts for the shift toward a policy of conventional
            unionism was the reprisals that had followed the militant policies of the
            International. Although already touched upon, this factor needs further
            explanation. The Catalan unionists viewed the Sagasta regime with extreme
            suspicion. The new prime minister, a notorious foe of the labor movement, had
            patched together an uneasy coalition of moderate Liberal groups in order to
            come to power. The unionists had every reason to fear that he had restored
            the legality of the trade unions as a kind of democratic window-dressing for
            the new ministry. However, the Catalan labor leaders were clearly intent on
            preserving this facade by avoiding any sharp confrontation with the new
            regime. Despite their revolutionary rhetoric, they dealt prudently with the
            Sagasta ministry. One of their manifestoes reads more like an appeal for
            restraint than a call to action; indeed, virtually any advocate of militant tactics
            is described as a provocateur.
               As it turned out, the mere growth of the union was enough to doom it. By
            the time of its second congress, held in Seville in late September 1882, the
            Workers’ Federation claimed a following of nearly 58,000 members organized
            into 218 local federations and 663 sections. The great bulk of the union’s
            membership—more than 38,000—was located in Andalusia, while only 13,000
            came from industrial Catalonia. To many delegates from the south, the
73 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            opportunistic policies of the Catalan labor leaders were nothing less than
            treachery. During the three-day congress a furious battle exploded between
            the two great regions of Spanish Anarchism. It was here, in the Seville
            congress, that the Workers’ Federation essentially deﬁned Anarchism as its
            long-range goal and the struggle for economic improvement as its day-to-day
            task—the same dichotomy that had faced the congress of 1870. Although this
            explicit formula was presented as a compromise, the Catalan viewpoint
            essentially prevailed.[11]
               But there was deep dissatisfaction among the Andalusians, particularly
            among the delegates from the southernmost comarcal of the peninsula. One
            group, calling itself the Desheredados (Disinherited), denounced the
            Federation’s policies and broke away, forming an organization of its own to
            engage in direct action. The Desheredados were probably one of many secret
            societies that were proliferating among the land laborers of the south. The
            late 1870s and early 1880s can be described as a period of economic
            expansion for the industrial north, but in Andalusia these decades were
            marked by severe drought and near-famine conditions. In Jerez, where the
            workers and land laborers had clung to Anarchism in the bleakest years of
            persecution, discontent ran especially high. Here, where the Desheredados
            had their strongest support, the vineyard workers received extremely low
            wages based on piecework and lived in desperate poverty.
               Although there may have been more talk than actual violence among the
            Desheredados, the Jerez district had already experienced many acts of
            incendiarism and a number of assassinations. The victims of the
            assassinations were mostly informers for the police and occasionally
            landlords. It is quite possible that the Desheredados, together with other
            secret societies in the area, were involved in some of the murders. The
            twilight zone in which these groups operated makes it impossible to
            distinguish fact from myth.
               A celebrated case of the 1880s points up both the myth-making that
            surrounded such incidents and the very real repression that came in their
            wake. In the midst of a promising strike by the vineyard laborers against
            piecework, a tavern keeper suspected of having been a police informer was
            killed. While the strike was still going on, the Civil Guard suddenly announced
            that its investigation of the murder had revealed the existence of an immense
            secret society, the Mano Negra or Black Hand, which was planning to
            slaughter all landlords in Andalusia. Despite recent arguments to the
            contrary, the sensational stories that the Guardia fed the public are, in my
            opinion, ﬁctitious. The distinguished Spanish sociologist Bernaldo de Quiros,
            who investigated the case for the government, doubted that the Mano Negra
            ever existed in Andalusia. But the case was used by the police to round up
            Anarchists and labor militants throughout the south. Hundreds were tortured
            to extract confessions, although the majority were ﬁnally released for want of
            evidence. The aftermath of the investigation in 1883 ended in the trial of a
            hundred alleged conspirators and in the garroting of seven out of the fourteen
            who had been condemned to death. But the legend of the Mano Negra
            lingered on for years, and Anarchists were arrested and accused of belonging
            to this spurious organization well into the 1890s.
               The Mano Negra persecutions destroyed the Workers’ Federation in
74 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            Andalusia and almost certainly contributed to its decline in Catalonia. An
            atmosphere of fear, nourished by memories of the repression in the 1870s
            settled over Spain and workers began to desert the movement by the
            thousands. The third congress of the Federation, held in Valencia in 1883,
            sharply denounced the violent tactics attributed to the Mano Negra but this
            did not end the continuous decline. Only 3,000 members remained in the nowunderground Andalusian sections. La Revista Social, an outstanding Anarchist
            theoretical magazine which had reached a circulation of 20,000, simply faded
            out of existence for want of subscribers. By 1887, when the Federation held
            its fourth congress in Madrid, only sixteen delegates showed up. Two years
            later, the Workers’ Federation of the Spanish Region, which had begun with
            such hope and promise eight years earlier, was oﬀicially dissolved.
               For the peasant Anarchists of Spain the medieval village had many
            limitations. As a community, however, it had many vital features. The
            Andalusian Anarchists valued the pueblo because its spirit of mutual aid,
            solidarity, egalitarianism, and sociability accorded perfectly with the goal of
            Anarchism, indeed, of any humane society. But they saw the village as a point
            of departure for a still better way of life, not as an end in itself. For them it
            was a springboard for a society in which material needs would be satisﬁed by
            modern technology and science; the human mind would be liberated, by
            reason and knowledge; the human spirit nourished by cooperation and
            frggdom.
               Accordingly, the Anarchists carried on an unrelenting war against the
            negative features of the pueblo—its parochialism, superstition, ignorance, and
            systems of authority. They encouraged a respect for culture and the boldest
            ideas in nearly every sphere of life. To the peasants and braceros they
            imparted a sense of dignity and self-worth, of generosity toward the
            oppressed of their own class, indeed, a view of humanity that was keenly
            internationalist in spirit and outlook. They brought to the pueblos a
            knowledge of sciences that had been forbidden by the clergy, a claim to a
            liberty that had been abrogated by the state, and a demand for material wellbeing that had been usurped by the ruling classes.
               It would be interesting in this respect to compare Andalusian Anarchism
            with another peasant movement, the Carlism of the northern mountains.
            Carlism, of course, was primarily an attempt’to preserve the pueblo and its
            clerical-patriarchal morality from modernism. Led by the church, this
            movement was atavistic: if could oﬀer no program other than a return to the
            past. In sharp contrast to peasant Anarchism, Carlism fostered a mindless
            obedience to the hierarchy of the church and the authority of the crown—at
            least the one it hoped to place on the head of the pretender. Provincial and
            dogmatic, it preached a gospel of hatred and ignorance toward scientiﬁc
            knowledge, experimentation, and intellectual independence. In three civil
            wars, the Carlist armies marched toward the Liberal cities of the north,
            burning railroad stations and destroying other “demoniacal” innovations.
            Fanatical priests, goading their ﬂocks to savage brutalities, terriﬁed the entire
            peninsula with an example of clerical reaction gone mad. Accordingly, the
            Carlist Wars served up some of the most frightful butcheries to be seen in the
            nineteenth century. From this quarter came the demand for censorship of
            periodicals and books, for clerical control over educational institutions, and
75 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            for a restoration of the Inquisition.
              Both Carlism and rural Anarchism, then, take their point of departure from
            the pueblo. But it would be diﬀicult to conceive of more divergent world
            outlooks than those of the two peasant movements. One turned toward the
            past, the other toward the future. Both explored entirely antithetical
            potentialities in the Spanish pueblo’s dissatisfaction with bourgeois society.
            Their common basis in village N society is entirely secondary to the fact that
            they fostered contradictory possibilities and moved in opposing directions.
            Chapter Six: Terrorists and “Saints”
              The 1880s in Spain were a period of rapid industrial growth and overall
            agricultural prosperity. British and French capital ﬂowed into the mining
            industry and turned the country into one of Europe’s leading producers of
            iron and copper. The development of Cuba as a market for cheap textiles
            served to buoy up the Catalan cotton industry, and when the French vineyards
            were nearly destroyed by the phylloxera virus, Spanish wines enjoyed a brief
            period of supremacy on the world market. With the coming of the 1890s,
            however, economic growth became spotty, broken by ominous years of
            stagnation and decline. If the earlier upswing had brought some limited
            beneﬁts to the urban and rural working classes, the decline was agonizing for
            them. What tormented the country were the contrasts between rich and poor.
            At the one extreme, Spain seemed to have plunged into a world of feverish
            business in which the wealthy classes were occupied with amassing immense
            fortunes, while those below lived in chronic destitution, misery, and
            hopelessness.
              This contrast grated against the senses in all the cities of Spain and much of
            the countryside. In Barcelona, while the textile manufacturers began to raise
            sumptuous neo-Baroque dwellings on the Tibidabo, the slums of the workers
            spread outward, joining the hovels of the newly arrived Murcianos on the
            outskirts of the city. Machinery cancerously invaded the traditional universe
            of the small workshop and threw thousands of craftsmen onto the labor
            market, skilled workers whose occupations that had been rendered useless by
            mass manufacture. Even more oﬀensive were the startling economic
            disparities that prevailed in the south. In many provinces of Andalusia, half
            the land was held in estates of 5,000 acres or more, while 80 percent of the
            population was made up of rural landless proletarians. Deﬁciency diseases
            from poor nutrition were endemic. The death rate soared. The ruling classes
            made no eﬀort to provide the people with an education: more than half the
            men and nearly all the women were totally illiterate.
              In addition, the greatest pains were taken to exclude the urban and rural
            masses from any role in governing the country. Between the 1830s and 1860s,
            Spanish political life had swung like a pendulum between fairly authentic
            Conservative and Liberal regimes, presided over by generals, civilians, and, in
            the late years of Isabella’s reign, by a court camarilla of priests. But with each
            oscillation the Conservatives became more liberal and the Liberals more
            conservative. The two factions were drawn together by a common fear of
            clerical, military, and radical uprisings. With the premature death of Alfonso
            XII in March 1885, the Conservative and Liberal parties of the Restoration

            period came to an agreement to share the state between themselves. A
            political system of Turnismo, or “rotation” was established in which the
            Liberal Party, under the ebullient Praxedes Sagasta, was given the reins of
            power whenever democratic window-dressing was needed to absorb social
            unrest or justify the passage of repressive legislation. The Conservative Party,
            led by Antonio Canovas del Castillo, occupied the ministry under conditions of
            relative stability. Except for an anticlerical tradition and an interest in secular
            education; the Liberals were indistinguishable from their Conservative ,
            counterparts. What really distinguished the two parties were the agrarian
            strata whose interests they reﬂected: the Conservatives spoke fox’the
            Andalusian landowners and the Liberals for the Castilian wheat growers.
              The chief architect of Turnismo was Canovas, a thorough cynic who
            combined political astuteness with a broad cultural background almost
            unmatched by any leading politician of his day. Before entering politics, he
            had already achieved a reputation of high standing as a historian. Canovas’s
            policy was directed toward the single goal of public order at any cost. This
            policy of deliberate political stagnation rested in turn on a massive system of
            corruption in almost every sphere of life. In theory, the Spanish government
            was a constitutional monarchy based on a limited (later,universal) suﬀrage
            with the usual rural caciques and urban jefes who tailored the vote according
            to the needs of Madrid. The nominally free press was bought oﬀ (almost any
            prominent journalist had no diﬀiculty obtaining a seat in the Cortes),while the
            generals were molliﬁed by adventures in Morocco.
              The problem of dealing with the bourgeoisie was more complex. Spanish
            industry had developed not in Castile or Andalusia but on the periphery of the
            country, in Catalonia and the Basque provinces, the two regions which had
            been traditional opponents of a centralized state. Somehow, Turnismo had to
            reﬂect the interests of the strategic industrial bourgeoisie without giving it
            too much authority in the management of the state. The problem was solved
            by subterfuge. A pplitical underground of intrigue and pressure groups
            developed in which the economic demands of the manufacturers were granted
            after exasperating negotiations and maneuvers. Power, however, continued to
            rotate between the two large agrarian groups.
              By the 1890s, the absurdity of this political structure was evident to almost
            everyone. In a period of unprecedented industrial growth, the state apparatus
            was owned and occupied by archaic agrarian interests, thus compelling the
            “progressive” manufacturing classes to enter it through the back door like
            beggars. The largely republican petty bourgeoisie was asked to be content
            with a monarch as the chief tenant and accept a rigged system of elections
            that eﬀectively denied its entry. The working class and rural poor were simply
            ignored. Virtually excluded from active political life, they were given the
            nominal right to bed themselves in “legal” unions which were consistently
            harassed by the police and destroyed outright when they became too large.
              The unions tried earnestly to accommodate themselves to this arrangement.
            The Workers’ Federation, as we have seen, foundered in its eﬀort to promote
            legal unionism. It was doomed by the mere fact that it attracted large masses
            of Andalusian laborers. A more cautious strategy was tried in 1881, the same
            year that the Workers’ Federation was founded, when the Autoritarios of the
            Old International established the Spanish Socialist Party.[12] Although
77 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            Marxian in rhetoric and organizational structure, it was basically reformist in
            politics and goals. What probably rescued the party from the fate of the
            Anarchists were the modest demands of its program, the prudent nature of its
            tactics, the respectable form of its propaganda. The party soon found itself
            traveling in a vicious’ circle. On the one hand, its program and tactics evoked
            little response from the restive Murcianos and braceros, who ﬂooded into the
            Anarchist unions. On the other hand, the skilled workers to whom it appealed,
            being bourgeois in outlook and political sentiment, placed their conﬁdence in
            the Republican parties.
               Hence it was not until 1888, seven years after the founding of the party, that
            the Spanish Socialists succeeded in establishing their own labor union, the
            General Union of Workers or Union General de Trabajadores (UGT). Guided
            by Pablo Iglesias, this cautious, stolidly bureaucratic labor organization made
            headway among the industrial workers of the Basque cities, the craftsmen of
            Madrid, and the peasants of Castile. It later developed a large following in
            Granada, the Andalusian province which Brenan regards as more “Castilian”
            than any other in the south. The inﬂuence of the Socialists on the rebellious
            miners of Asturias and the Rio Tinto (Anarchist competition was strong in
            both areas) is more diﬀicult to explain, although it was probably due to
            conjunctural factors rather than reformist, inclinations among the miners
            themselves. In any event, growth was slow and the UGT numbered less than
            twenty-ﬁve thousand members at the turn of the century, more than a decade
            after its founding. The union did encounter local hostility in its organizing
            drives. But it inspired very little fear in the government and escaped the
            repression that ﬁnally shattered the Workers’ Federation.
               To the European Anarchists of the late nineteeenth century, the ruling
            classes seemed more ﬁrmly in the saddle than ever. An oppressive
            atmosphere of bourgeois egotism had settled over life. Everything seemed to
            acquire a dull, gray, tasteless appearance. And Europeans of sensibility were
            repelled by the smugness and banality of the age. The spirit of revolt, blocked
            by the massive stability of ﬁn de siecle capitalism, began to burrow into the
            underground of this society. Arthur Rimbaud’s poetic credo of sensory
            derangement, Toulouse-Lautrec’s provocatively “lumpen” art, and the ﬂouting
            of middle-class conventions by Oscar Wilde and Paul Gauguin reﬂected the
            compulsion of writers and artists to provoke the bourgeois, to cry out against
            the deadening complacency of the period. A literary and artistic Anarchism
            emerged which included men like Barres, Mallarme, Valery, and Steinlen, in
            whom generous ideals for the liberation of humanity were marbled with a
            furious anger toward bourgeois mediocrity. The eﬀect of these cultural rebels
            on the social life of the time was virtually nil. At best, the bourgeois greeted
            them with scandalized outrage; more commonly they were met with
            uncomprehending indiﬀerence.
               There were also some individuals whose desire to provoke led them to
            terrorist actions. These men were not ignored. They often came from the
            lowest strata of the working class and petty bourgeoisie—true Desheredados,
            their lives crippled by poverty and abuse. A few—Auguste Vaillant, for
            example, who exploded a bomb in the French Chamber of Deputies—were
            members of Anarchist groups. The majority, like the Frenchman Ravachol,
            were soloists. They called themselves “Anarchists,” but belonged to no group,

            for the word had by this time become a synonym for “terrorist.” The
            identiﬁcation of Anarchism with terrorism was the result not merely of earlier
            bombings but of a new emphasis in libertarian circles on “propaganda by the
            deed.”
              The disappearance of the Bakuninist International after the Verviers
            congress of 1877 left behind small, isolated Anarchist groups all over Europe.
            Many of them lacked any strategy for revolutionary change; their members
            could oppose the entrenched power of the state with nothing but their
            writings and speeches. The growing Socialist movements of the day were
            utterly repellent. Authoritarian in structure and reformist in goals, they
            seemed to embody the pedestrian bourgeois spirit of the era.
              It was in this atmosphere, at a time of defeat and growing hopelessness,
            that a bold act in Russia illumined the way. On March 1, 1881, on the banks of
            the Catherine Canal in St. Petersburg, a small terrorist organization, the
            “People’s Will,” succeeded in assassinating Czar Alexander II. A politically
            hybrid group with strong Anarchist leanings, the band of young
            revolutionaries had publicly sentenced the Czar to death in 1879 and tracked
            him for two years until they were successful. The duel between a handful of
            terrorists and the massive Russian state had fascinated the world—and had
            brought the Czar .to the point of nervous collapse.
              The assassination electriﬁed Europe. Shortly afterward, when an
            international congress of Anarchists and left-wing Socialists convened in
            London, one of the main topics to be discussed was “propaganda by the
            deed.” The delegates concluded that “a deed performed against the existing
            institutions appeals to the masses much more than thousands of leaﬂets and
            torrents of words....” Much discussion centered on “chemistry.” It was
            resolved that “the technical and chemical sciences have rendered services to
            the revolutionary cause and are bound to render still greater services.” Hence
            aﬀiliated groups and individual supporters were asked to “devote themselves
            to the study of these sciences.”
              Among the supporters of the new tactic was a young Russian prince, Peter
            Kropotkin, who had broken with his class and entered the Anarchist
            movement. Although temperamentally the very opposite of Bakunin,
            Kropotkin shared the deep humanity of his predecessor. Despite his
            aristocratic lineage—or perhaps because of it—he spent two years
            .imprisoned in the dreaded Peter and Paul Fortress for his ideals. His
            dramatic escape and his distinction as a geographer gave him an international
            reputation. By the time of the London congress, Kropotkin had become the
            outstanding spokesman for “Anarchist Communism,” a theory he advanced
            with great ability against the prevalent “collectivism” of the traditional
            Bakuninists.
              Bakunin, it will be remembered, believed that the means of life individuals
            receive under Anarchism must be tied to the amount of labor they contribute.
            Although they are to receive the full reward of their labor, the quantity of
            what they receive is determined by the work they perform and not by their
            needs. Kropotkin did not diﬀer with Bakunin’s overall vision of a libertarian
            society. He too believed that it would mean a stateless society of free,
            decentralized communes joined together by pacts and contracts. What
            distinguished him from Bakunin was his insistence that directly after the
79 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            revolution each commune would be capable of distributing its produce
            according to need. “Need will be put above service,” he wrote; “it will be
            recognized that everyone who cooperates in production to a certain extent
            has in the ﬁrst place that right to live comfortably.” Underpinning this view
            was the conviction that technology had advanced to a point where
            everyone’s’needs could be satisﬁed. The famous communist maxim, “From
            each according to his ability; to each according to his needs,” would be the
            rule for guiding distribution immediately after the revolution.
               Kropotkin, it has been claimed, favored a purist Anarchist elite and rejected
            the Bakuninist demand for a close linkage between Anarchist groups and
            large mass organizations. This is not quite true. In a dispute with a number of
            Italian Anarchists who advocated a strictly conspiratorial type of organization,
            Kropotkin insisted,that the “small revolutionary group” has to “submerge”
            itself in the “organization of the people,” a view that closely parallels
            Bakunin’s organizational ideas.
               The diﬀerence between Bakunin’s and Kropotkin’s organizational views
            turned primarily around the issue of “propaganda by the deed.” As Max
            Nomad observes:
                 That tactic had not been in the armory of the Bakuninists; they
                 believed that the masses were essentially revolutionary, and hence
                 needed no terrorist ﬁreworks to stimulate their spirit of revolt. All
                 that was necessary, according to Bakunin, was an organization of
                 conspirators, who at the proper moment would capitalize on the
                 revolutionary potential of the m.asses. That view was no longer
                 shared by Kropotkin and his friends. It was replaced by a sort of
                 revolutionary “education” of the masses through acts of revolt, or
                 “propaganda by the deed.” Originally that sort of “propaganda,” as
                 ﬁrst discussed at the Berne Congress of the “Anti-Authoritarian”
## International (1876), referred to small attempts at local
                 insurrection. Somewhat later—after such actions had proven to be
                 quite ineﬀectual—the term was applied to individual acts of protest.
               None of these ideas had any signiﬁcant eﬀect on Spanish Anarchism until
            well into the 1880s, when translations of Kropotkin’s works were made
            available. At this time, Italian Anarchist Communist emigres in Barcelona
            began to promote the purist approach to organization and emphasize the
            importance of terrorist actions. The bitter controversies among Spanish
            Anarchists over the new ideas and tactics partly accelerated the breakup of
            the Workers’ Federation.
               When the once-promising Workers’ Federation dissolved in 1888, its place
            was taken by a strictly Anarchist organization and by ideologically looser
            libertarian trade unions. The former, the Anarchist Organization of the
            Spanish Region, was founded at Valencia in September 1888 and consisted of
            several libertarian tendencies, mainly Anarchist Communist in outlook. The
            base of this movement was organized around the tertulia: the small,
            traditionally Hispanic group of male intimates who gather daily at a favorite
            cafe to socialize and discuss ideas. Anarchist groups were usually larger and
            assuredly more volatile. They gave themselves colorful names expressive of
            their high-minded ideals (Ni rey, ni patria, Via Libre), of their revolutionary
80 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            fervor (Los Rebeldes), or of their sense of fraternity (Los Aﬁnes). Like the
            tertulianos, they met in cafes to discuss ideas and plan actions. Such groups
            had already formed spontaneously in the days of the International, but the
            new Anarchist Organization consciously made them its basic form of
            organization. Decades later, they were to reappear in the FAI as grupos de
            aﬁnidad (aﬀinity groups) with a more formal structure. The great majority of
            these groups were not engaged in terrorist actions; their activities were
            limited mainly to general propaganda and to the painstaking but
            indispensable job of winning over individual converts.
              The union movement, on the other hand, focused its energies on economic
            struggles, generally taking its lead from libertarian union oﬀicials. A number
            of these oﬀicials, anticipating the death of the Workers’ Federation, had
            decided to retain a loose relationship with each other which they formalized
            in 1888 as a Pact of Union and Solidarity of the Spanish Region. With the
            revival of the labor movement in 1891, the Pact of Union and Solidarity
            convened its ﬁrst congress in March, attracting Socialists as well as
            Anarchists. Although the congress was held in Madrid, the new organization
            was primarily a Catalan movement, inﬂuenced by Anarchist collectivists and
            by militant syndicalists.
              The Pact of Union and Solidarity was ill-fated almost from the start, for it
            emerged at a time when terrorist activity in Spain began to get underway in
            earnest. Although there had been no lack of bombings and assassination
            attempts in the 1880s, they had been isolated episodes, occurring as the
            background of a larger class struggle between unions and employers. The
            bombings that opened the 1890s were quite diﬀerent. They exploded across
            the foreground of the struggle and were destined to become chronic in
            Barcelona. The ﬁrst of these bombings occurred in the midst of a general
            strike for the eight-hour day which the Pact of Union and Solidarity had
            decided to call on May 1, 1891.
              The strike began peacefully enough with a large rally at the Tivoli Theater
            in Barcelona, followed by a street demonstration down the famous Ramblas to
            the civil governor’s palace. On the following day, however, it began to take on
            serious dimensions. Many factories closed down and violent clashes occurred
            between workers and police. Characteristiclly the government responded to
            the situation with a declaration of martial law. (In Spanish, literally, a “state of
            war.”). The next day a bomb went oﬀ before the building that housed the
            Fomento del Trabajo National (the “Encouragement of National Labor”, a
            euphemism for the powerful, notoriously reactionary association of Barcelona
            manufacturers).
              The strike was broken by violence and treachery, but from that point
            onward, bombings became a commonplace feature of labor unrest in
            Barcelona. They were invariably followed by arrests and by beatings of
            imprisoned militants, yet the explosions themselves did very little damage.
            Generally, their timing and location were planned to pose the least possible
            threat to human life. The intention of the “terrorists” was apparently to
            frighten rather than to kill; indeed, it is not certain how many of these
            bombings were caused by Anarchists who were protesting against the real
            injuries inﬂicted by the authorities on imprisoned labor militants, or by agents
            provocateurs of the Fomento and the police.

              The increasing drift of Spanish Anarchism toward terrorism was to be
            reinforced by an episode of agrarian unrest that became memorable in the
            history of the Andalusian movement. Its locale was Jerez, the center of the
            Desheredados and the alleged Mano Negra.
              Anarchist ideas had taken root in this famous wine district early in the
            1870s and, as we have already seen, held out tenaciously against the long
            years of repression initiated by Serrano. Pamphlets and periodicals sent by
            Anarchist emigres in the Americas kept alive the visions of the glorious spring
            of 1873 long after the movement elsewhere had dwindled to small groups and
            isolated individuals. The persecutions following the Mano Negra investigation
            did not extirpate the Anarchist groups in the district. On the contrary, the
            barbarities of the Guardia created pent-up feelings of anger and frustration
            that were certain to ﬁnd release with the ﬁrst revival of radical activity.
              The revival began in 1890. On May 1 of that year, great demonstrations
            celebrating the labor holiday swept through Andalusia, bringing thousands of
            deﬁant workers and peasants into the streets. The astonished authorities took
            reprisals: bombs were conveniently “discovered” in the oﬀices of El
            Socialismo, the Anarchist paper of Cadiz, and a new wave of arrests swept
            through the region. The persecutions continued into the next year when the
            authorities, invoking the discredited legend of 1883, imprisoned 157
            Anarchists and labor militants on charges of being members of the Mano
            Negra. The outraged laborers waited nearly six months before responding to
            this and other provocations; then they exploded.
              Toward midnight on January 8, 1892, a band of about ﬁve hundred vineyard
            workers, laborers, and a sprinkling of craftsmen marched into Jerez crying:
            “Long live anarchy!” “Death to the bourgeoisie!” “Long live the social
            revolution!” They were armed with pruning hooks, scythes, and whatever
            ﬁrearms they could gather. Outside, on the plains of Gallina and loitering on
            the road into the city were some thousands of men, ostensibly a reserve force,
            but actually stragglers who were too fainthearted to participate in the assault.
            [13] Precisely what the marchers hoped to achieve in the city is not very clear.
            There had been a great deal of revolutionary agitation in the area. Several
            suspicious outsiders, including a young man “from Madrid” (“El Madrileno”),
            had surfaced among the vineyard workers, calling upon them to prepare for a
            “social revolution.”[14] The vineyard owners were patently looking for a
            confrontation in order to suppress the unrest.
              Once inside the town, the marchers broke up into small bands. Disoriented
            and confused, they were hardly a serious threat to anyone but the few stray
            passersby who fell into their hands. One group made oﬀ for the Jerez jail to
            free the militants who had been imprisoned as members of the Mano Negra. A
            single shot, presumably ﬁred by the warden’s daughter, dispersed them.
            Others wandered through the city streets looking for “the bourgeoisie.” A few
            well-dressed people were stopped, insulted, and their hands examined for
            callouses. In the course of this enterprise, two clerks, mistaken for the class
            enemy, were killed.
              During all of this, Civil Guards and cavalry had been carefully posted
            throughout the city waiting for orders to intervene. The authorities apparently
            knew all about the thousands on the plains of Gallina, the march ir\to Jerez,
            and the bands wandering through the nearly empty streets. They did nothing
82 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            to stop them. With enough “incidents” to justify severe repression, the
            Guardia and cavalry were turned loose on the marchers who quickly
            dispersed into the countryside after some skirmishes. Despite the triviality of
            the whole incident, the police dealt with it as a major insurrection. Hundreds
            were rounded up and many savagely beaten. Sixteen men were tried and
            condemned to sentences ranging from ten years to life imprisonment. With
            incredible arrogance, the authorities placed Fermin Salvochea, the revered
            Anarchist “saint,” on trial before a military tribunal and charged him with
            inciting the Jerez uprising—this despite the fact that he had been locked up in
            the Cadiz prison throughout the entire incident. The oﬀicers unabashedly
            sentenced him to twelve years of hard labor. A few weeks later on February
            16, the Anarchists Lamela, Busique, Lebrijano, and Zarzuela were taken out
            to the main square of Jerez and garroted before a large, silent crowd. They
            died deﬁantly, shouting “Viva la anarquia!” Before he was strangled Zarzuela
            delivered a prophetic injunction. “People of Jerez!” he cried from the scaﬀold,
            “Let no one say we die as cowards. It is your task to avenge us against this
            new Inquisition!”
              With the repression of the Jerez uprising, terrorist activity reached a
            turning point: the garroting of the four Anarchists incensed revolutionaries
            throughout Spain and Zarzuela’s cry for vengeance did not go unheeded.
            Seven months later in Barcelona, a young Anarchist tried to assassinate
            General Martinez Campos as revenge for the Jerez executions. Two bombs
            were thrown at Martinez Campos, the oﬀicer whose pronunciamiento had
            paved the way for Alfonso XII and who now occupied the post of captain
            general of Catalonia. Martinez miraculously escaped serious injury, but the
            explosion killed a soldier and ﬁve civilian bystanders. The police quickly
            apprehended the assassin, Paulino Pallas, a young Andalusian Anarchist who
            had prospected in Patagonia with the famous Italian Anarchist Errico
            Malatesta. The Andalusian was tried by a court martial and sentenced to
            execution by a ﬁring squad. From the opening of his trial to the moment of his
            death, Pallas’s behavior was deﬁant. Before the bullets claimed his life, he
            repeated the ominous cry of the south: “Vengeance will be terrible!”
              The warning became a reality before the year was out. On November 7,
            during the opening night of Barcelona’s opera season, two bombs were
            thrown from the balcony of the Teatro Liceo into a gilded audience of the
            city’s most notable families. One of the bombs exploded, killing twenty-two
            and wounding ﬁfty. Panic gripped the bourgeoisie. Unleashed to do their
            worst, the police closed all the workers’ centers and raided the homes of
            every known radical. Hundreds were arrested and thrown into the dungeons
            of Montjuich Fortress, the military prison overlooking Barcelona’s port area
            and working-class districts. Five Anarchists, innocent of the bombing, were
            sentenced to death and later executed.
              The real assassin, Santiago Salvador, was not discovered until two months
            later. Salvador had been a friend of Pallas and was determined to answer his
            cry for vengeance. After failing at a suicide attempt on his arrest, Salvador
            succeeded in escaping the tortures that the police ordinarily inﬂicted on
            political prisoners by pretending to repent his act and feigning conversion to
            the church. For nearly a year his execution was stayed while Jesuits and
            aristocratic ladies petitioned the government for a commutation of sentence.

            When the young Anarchist ﬁnally stood on the scaﬀold, he abandoned his
            deception and died with the cry: “Viva la anarquia!”
              Salvador’s death was followed by another round of bombings, arrests, and
            executions. To quell the Anarchists with a more eﬀective counterterror, the
            government established a new unit, the Brigada Social, composed of specially
            assigned police ruﬀians. This new body of police was openly waiting for an
            opportunity to throw itself on the Anarchist movement—indeed, on all
            oppositional groups in Barcelona. There are, in fact, strong reasons for
            suspecting that it manufactured a provocation of its own three years after the
            Liceo bombing.
              On June 7, 1896, while Barcelona’s Corpus Christi Day procession was
            wending through the Calle de Cambios Nuevos into the church, a bomb was
            thrown to the street from a top story window. The procession was led by the
            most important notables of the city, such men as the governor of Catalonia,
            the Bishop of Barcelona, and the new captain general, Valeriano Weyler y
            Nicolau, whose cruelties in Cuba two years later were to earn him worldwide
            opprobrium. Yet with this alluring bait at the head, the bomb was aimed at the
            tail of the procession, whose ranks consisted of ordinary people. The
            explosion killed eleven and wounded forty. The assassin was never found. The
            bombing, however, provided Weyler with the excuse for rounding up not only
            Anarchists and labor militants, but Republicans and ordinary anticlericals as
            well. Over four hundred people were thrown into the Montjuich dungeons and
            left to the mercy of the Brigada Social.
              When revealed in the press, the tortures to which these prisoners were
            subjected produced a sensation throughout the world. One of the victims,
            Tarrida del Marmol, an Anarchist of a distinguised Catalan family and director
            of Barcelona’s Polytechnic Academy, reported his eye-witness experiences in a
            book, Les Inquisiteurs de I’Espagne, that caused a shudder of horror north of
            the Pyrenees. The tortures were so severe that several prisoners died before
            they could be brought to trial. Men were forced to walk for days at a time
            without rest; others were hung from cell doors for hours while their genitals
            were twisted with ropes and burned. Fingernails and toe nails were pulled oﬀ
            and savage beatings inﬂicted mercilessly all over the body. After spending the
            greater part of a year in the prison fortress, ninety were brought to trial in the
            spring of 1897. Of twenty-six convictions, eight received death sentences and
            the remaining eighteen were given long prison terms. While the convicted
            men were obviously innocent, ﬁve were actually executed. Nevertheless, the
            vindictive Canovas regime had the acquitted prisoners rearrested and
            transported to the African penal colony of Rio d’Oro, the Spanish equivalent of
            France’s Devil’s Island.
              Weyler’s attempt to crush oppositional sentiment in Barcelona backﬁred
            completely. Not only did he fail to extirpate the Anarchists, but a massive
            protest rolled in from Europe and South America. Mass meetings against the
            Montjuich atrocities were held in London, Paris, and other cities. Leading
            ﬁgures all over the continent expressed their outrage against the barbarities
            of Espagne inquisitorial. Despite its shortcomings, the closing years of the
            nineteenth century were a period when people could be genuinely angered by
            visible evidence of injustice.
              Finally, on August 8, 1897, only a few months after the Montjuich trials, the
84 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            terror reached the premier personally. Canovas was cornered on the terrace
            of a mountain resort in the Basque country by Michel Angiollilo, an Italian
            Anarchist, and shot to death. Although Angiollilo was garroted for the
            assassination, an unsuccessful attempt by the Anarchist Sempau, to kill Lt.
            Nardso Portas (one of the Civil-Guard oﬀicers who had presided over the
            Montjuich atrodties), ended in quite a diﬀerent way. Despite the fact that his
            assassination attempt occurred only a month after the death of Canovas, the
            Montjuich atrodties had produced such a profound reaction of shock that no
            judge would convict Portas’s would-be assassin and he was released.
               The men who performed these Anarchist atentados (as the terrorist acts
            were called) were not cruel or unfeeling like Weyler or Portas, wfco
            apparently relished their brutalities. The original bombings of 1891 and 1892
            had been relatively harmless acts. They were obviously not meant to claim
            lives but to shatter bourgeois complacency and provoke a spirit of revolt
            among the workers. The lethal bombings that followed were reactions to the
            barbarities of the police and the state. The atentados had developed from
            opera bouﬀe into desperate acts of vengeance. Despite the terrible price they
            took in life and suﬀering, these terrorist acts served to damage the “Liberal”
            facade of Turnismo and reveal the cold despotism that lay “behind Canovas’s
            mockery of parliamentary government.
               The Anarchists had been goaded from a generous humanism into a vengeful
            terrorism. The trend began early, as we noted, when the Internationalists,
            almost mortally wounded by the Serrano repression, established an “Avenging
            Executive Nucleus.” When the Cordobese section began complaining
            frantically to the Federal Commission about police repression, the answer it
            received is signiﬁcant: “Take note of the names of your persecutors for the
            day of revenge and justice.” Actually, the “Avenging Executive Nucleus” and
            the Cordobese section did very little to even the score; the government and
            police invariably came out ahead. But a time would come when the names
            collected by the police would be matched by the lists prepared by their
            opponents; then, the ﬁring squads of the Falange would be echoed by those of
            the FAI.
               Yet one is compelled to ask if this bloody imagery, so common in most
            accounts of the Spanish Civil War, gives an accurate picture of the Spanish
            Anarchists. In a period when even the Spanish Sodalists began to succumb to
            the bourgeois spirit of the 1890s, the Anarchist movement was still
            developing individuals whose humanity and unaﬀected sympathy for the
            suﬀering of their fellow human beings has been aptly described as “saintly.” It
            is fair to say that the deep humanity that turned Pallas into a terrorist served
            to make a great Andalusian Anarchist Fermin Salvochea into a “saint.” The
            two men were counterparts, not opposites. Salvochea’s “saintliness,”
            moreover, had very earthly dimensions.
               Fermin Salvochea was a man of broad culture, a rationalist and humanist
            whose parents had trained him for a business career, not a place in the church
            or the university. He was born on March 1, 1842, in Cadiz, one of Spain’s most
            important and thriving Atiantic ports, where his father had made a
            considerable fortune in commerce. At ﬁfteen he was sent oﬀ to London to
            learn English and prepare for the business world. The ﬁve years he spent in
            London and Liverpool brought him into contact with radical literature.

            Thomas Paine’s critique of religion and Robert Owen’s communist theories
            inﬂuenced him profoundly. Before he left England in 1864, the young
            Salvochea had become a convinced atheist and communist. Once back in
            Cadiz, he became active in the Federalist movement, living frugally and
            devoting the greater part of his fortune to the revolutionary cause.
               Soon he was participating in a host of remarkably audacious conspiracies.
            In 1866, for example, he plotted to free imprisoned artillerymen who had
            participated in a rebellion and were now awaiting deportation to Manila.
            Later, he tried to promote a military uprising in Cantabria. During the period
            of unrest that opened with Isabella’s ﬂight from the country, Salvochea was
            elected to the revolutionary commune of Cadiz and became a commanding
            oﬀicer in the most radical detachment of the Republican militia. When
            Republican Cadiz was attacked by government forces, he characteristically
            held out to the last with a poorly armed band against the invading troops.
               The courage of the man was extraordinary. When it ﬁnally seemed that
            resistance was utterly futile, he dispersed the militia and remained behind to
            assume personal responsibility for the uprising. His behavior gained the
            respect even of his enemies. Instead of executing Salvochea, the general sent
            him to the Fortress of San Sebastian as a prisoner of war. By this time, he was
            already idolized by thousands of poor in Cadiz. A few months later, while he
            was still in prison, they elected him to the Spanish Cortes. The Madrid
            government refused to recognize the election and Salvochea, denied his
            parliamentary seat, remained in jail. He was freed by the amnesty of February
            1869. Eight months later, when Amadeo was oﬀered the Spanish crown,
            Salvochea took to the ﬁeld again, leading six hundred armed Republicans to a
            rendezvous with other forces from Jerez and Ubrique. They clashed with
            pursuing government forces near Alcala de los Gazules and were defeated
            after three days of ﬁghting.
               The rebels dispersed. Salvochea escaped to Gibraltar and ﬁnally made his
            way to Paris where he entered the radical milieu of the periodicals La Revue
            and La Repell. After a brief stay in London, the exile returned to Cadiz
            following the amnesty of 1871, there to be elected the city’s mayor. The
            Cantonalist revolts of July 1873 found Salvochea involved in an unsuccessful
            eﬀort to bring Cadiz into the insurrectionary movement.[15] After suﬀering
            defeat, he again faced a court martial in Seville for rebellion. Condemned to
            life imprisonment in the African penal colony of Gomera, he now began to
            perform those self-denying services that make up the legend of the Anarchist
            “Christ.” He bore the sentence with calm and fortitude, sharing everything he
            received from his family with his fellow prisoners. When the governor of the
            penal colony read a pardon that his inﬂuential mother, aided by the Cadiz
            municipality, had ﬁnally obtained for him, Salvochea tore up the document
            and declared that there were only two ways he would leave prison: by an
            amnesty for all or by a revolt. Nine months later, he escaped and settled in
            Tangiers.
               Until his imprisonment in Gomera, Salvochea was not an Anarchist,
            although he had a strong aﬀinity for the libertarian movement. He belonged
            to the International almost from its earliest days in Spain, but it was only in
            the seclusion of the prison colony that he began to examine Bakunin’s
            theories with care. Having once adopted them, Salvochea became one of the
86 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            most fervent Anarchist propagandists in Spain. He remained in the libertarian
            movement until the end of his life.
               When Salvochea ﬁnally returned to Spain in 1885 after the death of Alfonso
            XII, it was during a time of intense Anarchist agitation in Andalusia. The
            libertarian press could now emerge legally and Salvochea established El
            Socialismo in Cadiz, spearheading the movement among the vineyard workers
            and braceros of southwestern Spain. He was arrested repeatedly, but his
            energetic defense in court proved more damaging to the government than any
            judicial impediments it could hope to place in his way. His practical abilities in
            the service of the movement were outstanding; it was Salvochea, apparently,
            who organized the great May 1 demonstrations that swept through Andalusia
            in 1890 and 1891. The Mano Negra case, followed by the “discovery” of two
            bombs in the oﬀices of El Socialismo, led to widespread arrests throughout
            the region, and by 1892 Salvochea found himself in prison again. Despite the
            fact that he was in the Cadiz jail during the Jerez uprising, a court martial
            sentenced him to twelve years for his alleged role in the event. The civil
            courts had refused to try him, and Salvochea in turn refused to participate in
            the proceedings conducted by his military judges. Imprisoned in Valladolid, he
            was exposed to worse hardships than any he had suﬀered in the African penal
            colony. He was placed in solitary conﬁnement and denied the right to write
            letters. The breaking point came when Salvochea refused the warden’s order
            that he attend mass. He was thrown into a damp, subterranean dungeon for
            months. Finally growing weak and despairing of release, he tried to commit
            suicide. This act was intensely human and understandable under the
            circumstances. It also disquieted the religious and most Christian warden.
            From that point on Salvochea’s prison life began to improve. After a while he
            was transferred to the jail in Burgos where he turned to intellectual activity,
            translating a work on astronomy and doing writing of his own.
               In 1899 Salvochea was freed in the general amnesty that followed the
            protest over the Montjuich atrocities. He returned to Cadiz where he was
            welcomed with enthusiasm and resumed his activities in the Anarchist
            movement. Now nearly sixty, his health broken by years of imprisonment, he
            devoted most of his energy to literary activities. His last work was a
            translation of Kropotkin’s Fields, Factories, and Workshops, one of the most
            perceptive studies on the liberatory role of modem technology to emerge from
            the Anarchist movemept.
               On September 8, 1907, Fermin Salvochea died in Cadiz, the gleaming white
            city he loved so dearly. Fifty thousand people, including hundreds from all
            over Spain, followed in the cortege to the cemetary. The greater part of this
            immense demonstration was composed of ordinary workmen of the Cadiz and
            Jerez area who had come to love this man for himself and as the embodiment
            of their hopes for a better world. As the coﬀin was slowly lowered into the
            grave, the great assembly of people, many in tears, suddenly raised their
            voices in a single, spontaneous cry: “Viva la anarquia!” This was a life that
            spanned the Anarchist movement in Spain from its beginnings to the point
            where it entered an entirely new phase—the period of Anarchosyndicalism.
               Salvochea was a man of rare generosity and sympathy. Anarchists such as
            Manuel Buenacasa, a historian of the movement, speak of him as “nuestro
            santo mayor”—“our greatest saint”—and recall how he would often be found
87 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            by his friends without a cap or a topcoat because he had given his own to the
            needy. He never married and he lived frugally. Yet Salvochea did not seek the
            ascetic’s mortiﬁcation of the ﬂesh, nor did he ﬁnd exaltation in hardship. A
            serene man, he was rarely austere or somber. His demeanor toward his
            friends was aﬀectionate, and toward his enemies he displayed an equanimity
            that verged on irony.
              Terrorists such as Paulino Pallas and “saints” such as Salvochea were to
            persist into the 1930s as examples of the dual personality of Spanish
            Anarchism. As a curious mixture of pistolerismo and humanism they were to
            express the underlying tension that alternately divided the Anarchists and, in
            moments of crisis, united them in a zealous devotion to freedom and a deep
            respect for individuality. Perhaps no movement combined such conﬂicting
            tendencies in a fashion that served to fuel the enthusiasm and attract the
            devotion of the most dispossessed elements of Spanish society. Only the most
            deep-seated changes in the latter-day history of Spain were to erase the
            memory of the saints and terrorists from the popular legends of the peninsula.
            For better or worse, the tradition deeply aﬀected the outstanding
            personalities of the movement itself and profoundly shaped its trajectory for
            nearly two generations.
            Chapter Seven: Anarchosyndicalism
            The New Ferment
              By the closing years of the nineteenth century, an organized libertarian
            movement in Spain had virtually ceased to exist. Police reprisals against the
            terrorists, coupled with repressive legislation, led to the dissolution in 1896 of
            the Pact of Union and Solidarity. The Anarchist Organization of the Spanish
            Region was in shambles. Workers began to leave libertarian organizations as
            rapidly as they had entered them several years earlier. In Cordoba, for
            example, after the promising revival of the 1880s, only a few acolytes could be
            persuaded to attend the May 1 celebration of 1893. In the following years, the
            rallies were given up altogether. In vain did leading Anarchists reverse their
            views and speak out against terrorism. As early as 1891, Kropotkin warned
            that while “the development of the revolutionary spirit gains enormously from
            heroic individual acts ... it is not by these heroic acts that revolutions
            are’made.” By 1900, all but a handful of the outstanding Anarchists who had
            supported “propaganda by the deed” had abandoned terrorist methods as a
            strategic form of direct action.
              Yet the “Idea” was far from dead in Spain, and Anarchist terrorism was
            never to disappear totally. Libertarian ideas now began to take root among
            the intellectuals. It was at this time that leading Spanish writers and painters
            such as the novelist Pio Baroja and a young artist, Pablo Picasso, began to ﬂirt
            with the “Idea.” Others, notably the astronomer Tarrida del Marmol and the
            engineer Ricardo Mella, were actively involved in the movement itself. La
            Revista Social, an outstanding Anarchist theoretical journal founded in 1896,
            became a forum for a wide range of professional people from the universities,
            arts, and sciences. Disillusioned by the failure of terrorist tactics, many

            Anarchists began to place their strongest emphasis on the importance of
            education in achieving their social goals. This period was the heyday of
            libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where
            Anarchists exercised some degree of inﬂuence. Perhaps the best-known eﬀort
            in this ﬁeld was Francisco Ferrer’s Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a
            project which exercised a considerable inﬂuence on Catalan education and on
            experimental techniques of teaching generally. The persecution to which
            Ferrer was subjected in later years brings into sharp focus the enormous
            problems and obstacles that faced almost every eﬀort to reform Spanish
            society. To promote the concepts of the Modern School, Ferrer was obliged to
            be more than an educator and his personal fate, in turn, became a political
            event of great importance in the early years of the twentieth century.
               There seems to be nothing in Francisco Ferrer y Guardia’s background that
            should have made him an educator or even an iconoclast. He was born on
            January 10, 1859, in Alella, twelve miles from Barcelona. His parents were
            devout Catholics who raised their son in the traditional manner of moderately
            well-to-do peasants (his father owned a small vineyard), and there is no
            evidence of any rebellion in the boy until he was sent oﬀ to work in a
            Barcelona ﬁrm at the age of ﬁfteen. The owner, a militant anticleric,
            apparently exercised a great inﬂuence on his young employee. In any case, by
            the time Ferrer had reached twenty he had declared himself a Republican, an
            anticleric, and joined the Freemasons, the traditional haven for liberal
            thought and political conspiracy in Spain.
               The young Catalan caught the attention of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla, the radical
            Republican who had been a former premier under Amadeo and who in 1885,
            was enjoying a lively conspiratorial exile in Paris. Working as a railway
            employee, Ferrer rode the trains between the French frontier and Barcelona,
            engaged in the precarious job of smuggling political refugees to France. He
            also functioned as a courier in Zorrilla’s eﬀorts to win over army oﬀicers to a
            Republican coup. When General Villacampa pronounced for a republic in
            September 1886, Ferrer participated in an aborted Catalan uprising. This was
            the last insurrectionary attempt to turn Spain into a republic for the next half
            century. Its failure found Ferrer in Paris, occupying the post of secretary to
            Ruiz Zorrilla.
               It was in the French capital that Ferrer began to abandon the party politics
            of the Republicans for education. This was a major shift that marked his
            development toward Anarchism, although he was careful never to describe
            himself as more than a “philosophical Anarchist,” an acrata. He was greatly
            inﬂuenced in that direction by Anselmo Lorenzo, whom he met in Paris. In any
            case, his new interests could not have been better placed. Almost any eﬀort to
            bring more schools to Spain would have fallen like rain on a parched land. At
            the turn of the century, nearly 70 percent of the Spanish population was
            illiterate. Teachers were grossly underpaid, and rural schools (where there
            were any) were often little more than shacks in which barefooted, illnourished children were given only the most rudimentary instruction.
               The project that Ferrer was to establish as the Modern School has many
            elements that would almost seem conventional today, but it was also
            distinguished by features that even now have scarcely advanced beyond the
            experimental stage. To understand the remarkable advance scored by the
89 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            Modern School, one must see it against the background of the Spanish
            educational system as a whole.
              Although Spain had a universal education law, the majority of schools were
            run by clerics who used brutal teaching methods and emphasized rote
            instruction in Catholic dogma. These clerics openly inveighed against any
            political group, scientiﬁc theory, or cultural tendency which displeased the
            church. Coeducation, tolerated in the countryside only for want of school
            space, was rigorously prohibited in the cities.
              To this bleak establishment Ferrer opposed a program and method of
            instruction that the clerics could regard only as “diabolical.” He planned to
            establish a curriculum based on the natural sciences and moral rationalism,
            freed of all religious dogma and political bias. Although students were to
            receive systematic instruction, there were to be no prizes for scholarship, no
            marks or examinations, indeed no atmosphere of competition, coercion, or
            humiliation. The classes, in Ferrer’s words, were to be guided by the
            “principle of solidarity and equality.” During a period when “wayward”
            students in clerical schools were required to drop to their knees in a penitent
            fashion and then be beaten, the teachers in the Escuela Moderna were
            forewarned that they must “refrain from any moral or material punishment
            under penalty of being disqualiﬁed permanently.” Instruction was to rely
            exclusively on the spontaneous desire of students to acquire knowledge and
            permit them to learn at their own pace. The purpose of the school was to
            promote in the students “a stem hostility to prejudice,” to create “solid minds,
            capable of forming their own rational convictions on every subject.”
              To Ferrer, however, “the education of a man does not consist merely in the
            training of his intelligence, without having regard to the heart and will. Man
            is a complete and uniﬁed whole, despite the variety of his functions. He
            presents various facets, but is at the bottom a single energy, which sees,
            loves, and applies a will to the prosecution of what he has conceived.” One of
            the most important tasks of the Escuela Moderna, Ferrer insisted, was to
            maintain this unity of the individual, to see to it that there was no “duality of
            character in any individual—one which sees and appreciates truth and
            goodness, and one which follows evil.” The school itself must be a microcosm
            of the real world, embodying many diﬀerent sides and human personalities.
            Hence, Ferrer insisted not only on coeducation of the sexes but on a
            representative variety of pupils from all social classes. Every eﬀort must be
            made to bring the children of workers together with those of middle-class
            parents in order to create a milieu for the young that is fully liberatory, a
            “school of emancipation that will be concerned with banning from the mind
            whatever divides men, the false concepts of property, country, and family...
            Much of this is pure Anarchism and reveals the inﬂuence of Lorenzo and
            Kropotkin on Ferrer’s mind.
              It was not until September 1901, that Ferrer established the Escuela
            Moderna in Barcelona. He had been a teacher during his long stay in Paris.
            There he had befriended an elderly student in one of his Spanish classes,
            Mile. Ernestine Meunier, who left him a substantial legacy after her death.
            With these resources, the ﬁrst Modem School was started with an original
            class of twelve girls and eighteen boys. Within ten months, the number of
            students had more that doubled, and in the next few years ﬁfty schools based

            on the principles of the Modern School were established in Spain, mainly in
            Catalonia. Ferrer, who had invested Mile. Meunier’s money in well-paying
            securities, built up suﬀicient funds to establish a publishing house that turned
            out small, inexpensive, easily understood books on a variety of scientiﬁc and
            cultural subjects. These were distributed widely throughout Spain to
            peasants, braceros, and workers, often by wandering Anarchist
            propagandists. It was from these booklets that the poorer classes of Spain
            acquired their ﬁrst glimpse into the strange, almost totally unknown world of
            science and culture that lay beyond the Pyrenees. Although more guardedly
            than in Paris, Ferrer maintained his association with Anarchists, taking a
            number of them on his staﬀ and giving employment to his friend, the aged
            Anselmo Lorenzo, as a translator.
              The growth of the Escuela Moderna and the wide distribution of its booklets
            infuriated the clergy. But for years there was little they could do beyond
            denouncing the school and pouring vituperation on Ferrer’s personal life.[16]
            The opportunity to restrict Ferrer’s work ﬁnally came in 1906 when Mateo
            Morral, a member of Ferrer’s staﬀ, threw a bomb at the royal couple of Spain.
            The assassination attempt miscarried, and Morral committed suicide. Ferrer
            and the Modern School were held responsible, although the young assassin
            had explicitly denounced the Catalan educator and Anselmo Lorenzo for their
            opposition to atentados. Such was the state of Spanish justice at the time that
            Ferrer was held in jail for an entire year while police professed to be
            accumulating evidence of his complicity in the Morral attempt. A review of
            the case by the civil courts established his innocence, and he was released,
            but he never reopened the original Modem School in Barcelona.
              This strong emphasis on education did not mean that Spanish Anarchism
            vyas not still occupied primarily with the tasks of the class struggle and the
            building of a revolutionary movement. Syndicalism was gaining in popularity.
            The idea, ostensibly French in origin, that an economic organization of
            workers—a revolutionary union as distinguished from a political party—can
            take over society by means of a general strike can be traced back to the days
            of the Industrial Revolution. In the 1830s, the Chartist movement in England
            had advanced the proposal of a “Grand National Holiday” (a euphemism for a
            general strike) to fulﬁll the demands of the workers. This alluring concept of
            social change soon faded away once the British labor movement became
            reformist, only to reappear in 1869 at the famous Basel congress of the
            International Workingmen’s Association. Here, in a debate initiated by the
            Belgian section with the support of delegates from Spain, the Swiss Jura, and
            France, the proposal was advanced that the unions should provide the nuclear
            structure of a future Socialist society. Eugene Hins, the Belgian delegate,
            outlined the actual form of organization these unions should take. He called
            for a “dual form of organization”: a federation of industry-wide “workers’
            associations” on the one hand and a federation of local, regional, national, and
            international “labor councils” on the other. This structure forms the model of
            the syndicalist type of labor organization. As we have seen, the old Spanish
            International adopted it from the very outset. The “workers’ associations”
            were the Secciones de oﬁcio, or trade sections, and the “labor councils” were
            the Federaciones locales, or local federations.
              To understand clearly syndicalist organization, it should be examined in two
91 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            periods: before a revolutionary change, and afterward, when the “syndicates”
            are expected to take over the management of the economy. Under capitalism,
            the federation of “workers’ associations,” organized by trades, is engaged in
            conducting the day-to-day class struggle and dealing with the immediate
            grievances of the workers. In this period, the “labor councils,” organized
            geographically, have the tasks of education, propaganda, and the promotion of
            local solidarity between the “workers’ associations.” After the social
            revolution, the “workers’ associations” assume the responsibility for the
            overall administration and technical coordination of the economy. They see to
            it that the productive units throughout the country are supplied with raw
            materials, means of transportation, machinery, etc. The “labor councils,” in
            turn, which contain representatives from each trade and enterprise in the
            locality, administer the economic operations of the community or region,
            determine its needs, and arrange for the distribution of goods. In this dual
            system of organization, the local “workers’ associations” and the “labor
            councils” are federated into parallel municipal, regional, and national bodies
            until, at the summit of society two councils emerge—one composed of
            representatives of the trades and the other of the regions—which coordinate
            the total production and distribution of goods. Inasmuch as representatives of
            the trades also constitute the “labor councils,” the two parallel organizations
            tend to intersect at every geographic level, but each obviously has separate
            functions in economic life.
              This model, of course, is abstract and overly schematic. Its purpose is to
            explain the essential structure of a syndicalist organization in the simplest
            possible terms. In practice, syndicalist federations have been far more ﬂexible
            than any model could possibly indicate and they incorporated long-established
            unions that retained distinctly nonsyndicalist features. Moreover, there is no
            model that, in itself, provides a guarantee that a labor federation is syndicalist
            in a revolutionary sense. The avowedly reformist American labor movement is
            also organized on a dual basis. “International” unions in the United States—
            such as the automobile and steel workers’ federations, for example—might be
            said to correspond in a very rough way to the “workers’ associations” and the
            various city, county, and state labor councils to the “labor councils” described
            by Hins at the Basel congress. In all other respects, however, the diﬀerences
            between revolutionary syndicalist and reformist unions are more decisive than
            the similarities.
              For one thing, the goal of syndicalism is the elimination of capitalism, not
            merely the amelioration of the workers’ immediate economic problems and
            labor conditions. Its aim is admittedly revolutionary. Not less important is the
            syndicalist goal of vesting all economic and social decisions in the hands of
            the direct producers— the workers in each speciﬁc enterprise. The guiding
            and most important principle of syndicalism is that the management of
            production occurs at the base of society, not at its summit, and decisions ﬂow
            from below to above. Hence, syndicalism is anti-authoritarian. The
            democratic, federalist, and decentralized economic organs of the proletariat
            replace the political agencies of the state. Authority that is currently vested in
            political organs is turned over to the economic units of society and the actual
            producers who operate them.
              Accordingly, each enterprise is administered by its own workers through an
92 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            elected committee whose members are presumably (although not necessarily)
            removable. The various committees are linked together by delegates on local
            “labor councils” and on an industry-wide basis through the “workers’
            associations,” or trade unions. Obviously, the pivotal bodies in this structure
            are the workers’ committees which administer the individual factories,
            systems of transportation, etc., as well as the “labor councils” which deal with
            the aﬀairs and needs of the localities. The vocationally structured trade
            unions (as distinguished from the geographically organized unions), although
            useful in organizing industry-wide strikes under capitalism, have no real
            function after the revolution. The task of coordinating production, which the
            syndicalists vest in the unions, can be handled just as easily by the local,
            regional, and national “labor councils.” Indeed, it was to be symptomatic of
            the decay of syndicalist ideals in France that increasing authority was vested
            in the trade unions while the “labor councils” were permitted to atrophy.
              In its emphasis on economic control at the base of society, syndicalism is
            consciously antiparliamentary and antipolitical. It focuses not only on the
            realities of power but also on the key problem of achieving its disintegration.
            Real power in syndicalist doctrine is economic power. The way to dissolve
            economic power is to make every worker powerful, thereby eliminating power
            as a social privilege. Syndicalism thus ruptures all the ties between the
            workers and the state. It opposes political action, political parties, and any
            participation in political elections. Indeed, it refuses to operate within the
            framework of the established order and the state. What, then, will be the
            substitute for these traditional methods? Here, syndicalism turns to direct
            action—strikes, sabotage, obstruction, and above all, the revolutionary
            general strike. Direct action not only perpetuates the militancy of the workers
            and keeps alive the spirit of revolt, but awakens in them a greater sense of
            individual initiative. By continual pressure, direct action tests the strength of
            the capitalist system at all times and presumably in its most important arena
            —the factory, where ruled and ruler seem to confront each other most
            directly.
              At the same time that syndicalism exerts this unrelenting pressure on
            capitalism, it tries to build the new social order within the old. The unions and
            the “labor councils” are not merely means of struggle and instruments of
            social revolution; they are also the very structure around which to build a free
            society. The workers are to be educated in the job of destroying the old
            propertied order and in the task of reconstructing a stateless, libertarian
            society. The two go together. When all the conditions have ripened to a point
            where social revolution is possible, the workers go on a general strike with
            the avowed aim of toppling capitalist society. All means of production and
            transportation cease to operate. The capitalist economy is brought to a
            standstill.
              In the 1870s, almost two decades before syndicalism was to become popular
            in France, Friedrich Engels attributed the concept of the revolutionary
            general strike to the Bakuninists. His criticism is worth examining. “One ﬁne
            morning,” he writes, “all the workers of all trades in some country, or even all
            over the world, down tools and thus, in at most four weeks, force the
            possessing classes either to eat humble pie or let loose their violence against
            the workers, so that the latter then have the right to defend themselves, and
93 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            while doing so bring down the whole of the old society.” After examining the
            pedigree of this notion, Engels adds: “On the other hand, the governments,
            especially if encouraged by political abstention, will never let the
            organizations or the treasury of the workers get that far; and on the other
            hand, political events and the excesses of the ruling classes will eﬀect the
            liberation of the workers long before the proletariat gets to acquiring these
            ideal organizations and this immense reserve fund. Moreover, if it had them it
            would not need the circuitous path of the general strike to achieve its aims.”
               This description, with its crass political perspective and bookkeeping, is
            demagoguery, yet it is interesting that Marx’s closest collaborator was
            compelled to use such an approach. In admittihg that the Bakuninists were
            prepared to “defend themselves” (that is, to rise in insurrection), Engels
            plainly indicates that the’Anarchists were not prepared to stop with a peaceful
            strike—indeed, that they were only too mindful that a strictly economic test of
            strength in “at most four weeks” was four weeks too long for the workers to
            endure. To the Anarchists, the general strike was the steppingstone to an
            insurrectionary confrontation between the two classes, a confrontation in
            which the proletariat also exercised its economic power to paralyze the
            functions of the state and block the movement of troops.
               Even more interesting is Engel’s remark that the state, “encouraged by
            political abstention, will never let the organizations or the treasury of the
            workers get that far.” Ironically this statement could apply more readily to a
            political party than to a syndicalist union. Sixty years later German fascism
            was to annihilate two huge Marxian political parties with scarcely a ﬂicker of
            resistance by their leaders and following. The German proletariat, in fact, was
            to become so completely divested of revolutionary initiative by its welldisciplined Social Democratic and Communist parties that Hitler marveled at
            the ease with which it was shackled to the totalitarian state.[17]
               Syndicalism, to be sure, has many shortcomings, but its Marxian critics
            were in no position to point them out because they were shared by Socialist
            parties as well. In modeling themselves structurally on the bourgeois
            economy, the syndicalist unions tended to becorrfe the organizational
            counterparts of the very centralized apparatus they professed to oppose. By
            pleading the need to deal eﬀectively with the tightly knit bourgeoisie and
            state machinery, reformist leaders in syndicalist unions often had little
            diﬀiculty in shifting organizational control from the bottom to the top. Many
            older Anarchists were mindful of these dangers and felt uncomfortable with
            syndicalist doctrines. Errico Malatesta, fearing the emergence of a
            bureaucracy in the new union movement, warned that “the oﬀicial is to the
            working class a danger only comparable to that provided by the
            parliamentarian; both lead to corruption and from corruption to death is but a
            short step.”[18] These Anarchists saw in syndicalism a shift in focus from the
            commune to the trade union, from all of the oppressed to the industrial
            proletariat alone, from the streets to the factories, and, in emphasis at least,
            from insurrection to the general strike.
               In France, where syndicalism initiated a worldwide radicalization of the
            unions in the 1890s, all the latent dangers in the movement’s structure were
            cultivated to produce a reformist organization. Under Leon Jouhaux, the
            syndicalist Confederation Generate du Travail (CGT) became bureaucratized
94 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            and, apart from its revolutionary rhetoric, a fairly conventional trade union.
            Almost exclusively proletarian in composition, it exercised very little inﬂuence
            in rural areas. The word syndicalisme acquired a neutral meaning
            —“unionism”—and revolutionary adherents of the original doctrine by
            contrast were to be called “Anarchosyndicalists.” A few intellectuals were
            attracted to the promise of the old syndicalist goals and especially to its
            militancy. Georges Sorel, who sought in proletarian aggressiveness a
            regenerative force to overcome bourgeois decadence, attempted to give
            syndicalism a heroic philosophy of its own. But his works exercised very little
            inﬂuence among the French workers and none whatever on the Spanish labor
            movement. Like the majority of intellectuals who were captivated by
            syndicalism, Sorel soon became disillusioned with the movement’s pragmatic
            and opportunistic goals.
              In contrast to France, syndicalism in Spain developed a ﬁery elan as far
            back as the days of the International, and reached out to embrace the
            countryside. It would be more precise to say that Spanish syndicalism was
            compelled to evolve in a revolutionary, Anarchosyndicalist direction because
            of the social and political conditions that prevailed below the Pyrenees. Yet in
            the opening years of the twentieth century, this overall development was not
            easily discernable. The Madrid government seemed to be more stable than
            ever, and economic life had begun a surprising recovery from the low
            produced by the losses of Cuba and the Philippines’in the Spanish-American
            War. In restive Catalonia, local political life was parceled out between the
            Lliga Regionalista (Regionalist League), a bloc of right-wing autonomist
            groups favored by the manufacturers, and the Radical Republican Party, a
            political machine led by an unscrupulous demagogue, Alejandro Lerroux y
            Garcia. The Lliga had mustered the support of those well-to-do Catalans who
            were not committed to the Madrid parties. The Radicals, buoyed up by the
            inﬂammatory rhetoric of Lerroux, enjoyed the support of the great majority of
            workers and middle-class democrats in Barcelona. Apart from its incidental
            nuisance value, the Anarchist movement, after a brief resurgence in the
            strikes of 1901–03, had been virtually extirpated by the repression of the
            Barcelona labor organizations. Indeed for a time, it appeared that the
            industrial workers of Catalonia would drift toward the Socialist rather than
            the Anarchist fold.
              Yet the-very opposite was to occur. The assassination of Canovas in August
            1897 produced no change in Turnismo, the politically deadening system in
            which Conservative and Liberal ministries alternated with each other. This
            blocked any serious parlimentary expression of ferment in the country. In the
            period between 1899 and 1909, the ministry was occupied by three
            Conservative premiers, Silvela, Villaverde, and Maura, followed by the
            Liberals Montero Rios and Moret, and ﬁnally, for nearly three years, by Maura
            again. This ﬁnal Maura ministry was to undermine Turnismo almost
            completely, opening the way to one of the most stormy periods in modern
            Spanish history.
              For a point was now being reached where Canovas’s old strategy of
            calculated political stagnation could no longer contain the new demands that
            were emerging in Spanish society. The 1880s and 1890s as we have noted,
            were decades of major industrialization, indeed, of overexpansion. The
95 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            Catalan manufacturers, burdened by large surpluses of textiles and by the
            high price of raw cotton, began to press for tax relief and higher tariﬀs. When
            their demands were ignored, they were forced into a fatally discordant
            strategy: independent political action on the one hand, and wage-cutting on
            the other.
              Although by 1907 the government yielded to the manufacturers’ demands,
            virtually closing the internal Spanish market to foreign competition,
            irreparable damage had already been done to the political stability of
            Catalonia. A system of “degenerative feedback” had been initiated which was
            not to be arrested for the next three decades. Despite its Catalanist
            pretensions, the right-wing Lliga was opportunistic to the core. The
            manufacturers who subsidized it could not divest themselves of old habits and
            continued to make concessions to Madrid in exchange for econogiic
            privileges. This vacillating policy promoted the expansion of Lerroux’s Radical
            Party, which now gathered behind it many Republicans who were disillusioned
            with the Lliga’s opportunism. The Lliga had raised the specter of Catalan
            nationalism to frighten Madrid; Lerroux was eager to rally the great mass of
            Murdanos who were indiﬀerent or even hostile to Catalanism, so he
            unleashed a violent antinationalist campaign in Barcelona. This campaign was
            spiced with a bitter anticlericalism, giving the Radical Party an aura of
            militancy without endangering the position of the bourgeoisie. The Madrid
            government in turn decided to play the Lliga and Radicals against each other
            on the principle that the greater the instability in Barcelona, the less likely Ihe
            Catalans were to unite against the central power.
              Mysterious funds began to ﬂow into Lerroux’s coﬀers. At the same time,
            bombs began to explode on the premises of Catalan textile manufacturers
            who were known to belong to the Lliga. “Anarchist” terrorism seemed to
            revive with every upsurge of Catalan nationalist activity. Having raised
            violence in Barcelona to extravagant proportions, the Madrid government
            created an ongoing crisis in the city—a crisis it would henceforth be unable to
            control short of dictatorship or civil war. Lerroux, in turn, was to saddle
            himself with an irresolvable contradiction between word and deed that
            eventually undermined the last ties of the Barcelona working class to political
            parties.
              But these factors, undeniably important in themselves, merely exacerbated
            a mounting class war between the Barcelona working class and the textile
            manufacturers. Although the cotton industry had expanded greatly over the
            1880s and 1890s, it did not expand suﬀiciently to absorb the enormous inﬂdw
            of Murcianos and rural Catalans into industrial areas. The urban population in
            Barcelona had increased by 10 percent between 1900 and 1910—an accretion
            composed overwhelmingly of people from the countryside. For many of the
            new rural immigrants there was no steady work and no adequate shelter.
            Demoralized and semistarved, this desperate mass formed an excitable
            reservoir of discontent that Lerroux stirred with appeals to violent action
            against the clergy.
              No less disaﬀected were the industrial workers in Barcelona and outlying
            factory towns. Rising prices had made it impossible for a working-class family
            to live on the father’s wages. Although it required about 112 pesetas for a
            family of four to satisfy its minimal needs, a day laborer ordinarily received 60

            pesetas, a plasterer 96, and a metallurgical worker 108. Three quarters of a
            worker’s wages went to food. To surive, a working-class family had no
            alternative but to send the wife or children to work. It would have been
            diﬀicult enough for a worker to accept this bleak situation as a ﬁxed way of
            life. To also be confronted with a wage-cut hanging over one’s head, however,
            was intolerable. Faced with, such grim prospects, the Catalan proletariat was
            seething with discontent.
               The conﬂuence of growing economic problems with syndicalist ideas from
            France soon led to the formation of a new Anarchist labor organization. On
            October 13, 1900, a conference of unions, organized on the initiative of a
            Madrid bricklayers’ union, was held in Madrid. Delegates claiming to
            represent some 50,000 workers were sent from Catalonia, Andalusia,
            Valencia, Asturias, the Basque country, Coruna, Valladolid, and other areas.
            Many represented local aﬀiliates of the old Workers’ Federation and Pact of
            Union and Solidarity that had survived the repression of the 1890s. With
            syndicalism in the air and new union organizations forming throughout the
            country, the prospects seemed particularly bright for a new labor federation
            based on Anarchosyndicalist principles.
               The organization called itself the Federation of Workers’ Societies of the
            Spanish Region, adopting the structure of its predecessors of 1873 and 1881.
            It was scarcely in existence for more than a year when it found itself riding a
            wave of general strikes in Valencia, Seville, Saragossa, and other Anarchist
            strongholds. In Andalusia, town after town went on strike, in some cases
            posing only one demand— comunismo libertario. There were even minor
            insurrections reminiscent the Jerez uprising. The movement in the
            countryside continued for several years and did not come to an end until
            1905, when famine in the south litefally starved it into quiescence.
               The Federation of Workers’ Societies was suppressed, but not before it had
            initiated one of the most portentous general strikes in the early history of the
            Catalan labor movement. The strike was to reveal the extraordinary sense of
            solidarity that by this time had developed among the workers of Barcelona
            and the intractability of the manufacturers in dealing with labor grievances. It
            was a portent of the years to come and of the new relationship of forces that
            was emerging in the great Catalan seaport.
               The ﬁrst skirmishes occurred in the spring of 1901, when the yarn
            manufacturers of the Ter valley attempted to ﬁx a lower wage scale by
            replacing men with women on newly installed automatic spinning machines. A
            strike followed in which the workers fought bitterly with strikebreakers and
            police. The Ter valley strike was answered with a lockout: the manufacturers
            closed down the plants in order to starve the workers into obedience. It
            seemed probable that an employer victory in the Ter valley would lead to
            lower wage scales not only for textile operatives but for workers in other
            branches of industry. As the summer of 1901 came to an end, the key unions
            in Barcelona began to gird themselves for a confrontation with the
            manufacturing class as a whole.
               The obstacles the unions faced were enormous. Less than a third—indeed
            closer to a quarter—of the city’s labor force belonged to labor organizations.
            In the large textile industry, the overwhelming majority of operatives were
            women and children—the groups most intractable to union inﬂuence. In

            formulating strategic decisions, the union leadership was sharply divided
            between syndicalists, Anarchists, and Socialists, not to speak of ordinary
            unionists whose outlook was shallow and whose capacity for class solidarity
            was limited. An immense reservoir of unskilled and illiterate rural
            unemployed was available to the employers as scab labor. The textile workers
            were scattered over nearly 750 factories, many of them widely dispersed and
            diﬀicult to coordinate for common actions. Finally the employers were united
            in a tightly knit organization of their own, the powerful Fometito del Trabajo
            National, and could count on the full cooperation of the police and military. It
            was with these elements that the Federation-of Workers’ Societies, a
            decentralized, libertarian organization, would have had to piece together an
            eﬀective general strike. Yet the strange dialectic of the strike is that it
            occurred precisely because the Barcelona proletariat, schooled in direct
            action and Anarchist tactics, had developed a remarkably high degree of
            initiative. Without that initiative, the strike would have been virtually
            impossible.
              The strike was touched oﬀ by a limited, almost peripheral conﬂict. On
            December 6,1901, the metallurgical workers of Barcelona walked out. Despite
            the absence of strike funds, they remained out for the next three months
            pressing their main demand for an eight-hour day. The employers were
            uncompromising, ﬂatly refusing all oﬀers of mediation and turning a deaf ear
            to public criticism. The Republican newspaper El Diluvio warned that if the
            workers were defeated, they would interpret this as an indication of the
            uselessness of peaceful strikes. The observation proved to be acutely
            perceptive, as the employers were to learn several years later. As the weeks
            passed and it became clear that the strike was turning into a confrontation
            between the Barcelona proletariat and the manufacturers, a show of workingclass solidarity became absolutely necessary. The municipal organization of
            the Federation of Workers’ Societies thereupon decided to intervene and on
            Monday morning, February 17, 1902, declared a general strike throughout
            the entire city.
              The strike lasted a full working week. Its scope was enlarged by employers
            who closed down, fearing damage to their businesses. Some street ﬁghting
            developed between the strikers and the army, but for the most part the strike
            was peaceful. On the following Monday, February 24, most of the workers
            returned to their jobs, and the general strike was over. The strikers had raised
            no demands and, despite the participation of the Federation of Workers’
            Societies, had conducted the action without any visible leadership. The
            general strike, in short, was not only an act of solidarity with the metal
            workers but a superb demonstration of working-class initiative and capacity
            for self-organization.
              These lessons were not lost on the employers and government, who
            combined their forces to smash the Barcelona labor movement. More strikes
            followed in 1903 as the proletariat tried desperately to resist the oﬀensive of
            the state and manufacturers. Carlos Gonzalez Rothwos, the new governor
            appointed by the Liberals, arrested more than 350 militants that year and
            closed down a large number of workers’ centers. By 1904, the strike
            movement had begun to subside. Most of the strikes had been lost, leaving
            two thousand unemployed. Between 1902 and 1909, Barcelona’s union
98 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
            membership had been reduced from 45,000 to 7,000, and the employers could
            congratulate themselves that the labor movement had been all but obliterated
            in that city.
               The Spanish Socialist Party, which had played no role in the strike, drew its
            own conclusions. The general strike, it warned, was a threat to public order,
            inviting grave reprisals that would diminish all possibilities of collective
            bargaining. This reaction is signiﬁcant as an indication of the party’s policy at
            the time. Politically and organizationally, the Spanish Socialist Party had
            become another branch in the tree of European Social Democracy:
            opportunistic in method and reformist in policy. In Barcelona, where employer
            and police violence tended to turn every major strike into a near-insurrection,
            the party was simply irrelevant and its isolation from the workers complete.
            That the Socialist Party and the UGT did not succeed in remaining
            consistently reformist is due more to the mounting crisis in Spanish society
            than to any latent militancy in the Socialist leadership. Brenan observes that
            where Anarchist unions were strong, the Socialists were usually reformist;
            where they were weak, the Socialists behaved as radicals. Perhaps it would be
            more pointed to say that where the Anarchist unions were strong, they
            became the brunt of employer oﬀensives while the UGT, shielded by its
            libertarian rivals, tried to make deals with the employers at the expense of the
            Anarchists. Where the UGT was the larger organization, it was goaded into
            militancy by the intransigence of the employers and by the demands of its
            rank and ﬁle.
               These traits were not lost on the workers in Barcelona. The UGT tried
            energetically to bring the Catalan proletariat-into the Socialist fold. Indeed,
            the ﬁrst national oﬀice of the UGT had been established in Barcelona, where
            the union made some inroads among skilled workers. Caught between
            Anarchist militancy and employer intransigence, it could make very little
            headway. In 1898 its headquarters were ﬁnally transferred to the more
            congenial environment of Madrid. Yet here too it encountered Anarchist
            competition, never gaining complete control over the key construction
            workers, who eventually drifted into Anarchosyndicalist unions.
               In Madrid a vigorous eﬀort was made to get UGT backing for the general
            strike, and Pedro Vallina leaves us a priceless account of what happened.
            After a meeting at the Casino Federal del Horno in the capital, where the
            Anarchists unanimously pledged their support to the Barcelona workers, a
            committee was appointed to visit the UGT headquarters. “One of the UGT
            leaders, Largo Caballero, received us in his oﬀice,” writes Vallina, “and
            without consulting anyone rejected our demand. In a joking, derogatory
            manner, he asked if we believed in the possibility of a successful strike. I
            answered we did, even if the Socialists did not help us, because we had
            conﬁdence in the good will of the workers of Madrid. The attitude of Largo
            Caballero was so disagreeable that one of our delegates, becoming indignant,
            threatened to punch him. In fact, the Socialists declined all participation in
            the conﬂict. They were at that time a model of commonsense.”
               The juxtaposition of the cynical Socialist union boss with the idealistic,
            volatile Anarchists forms a perfect study in contrasting humantypes. As it
            turned out, both the Catalan employers and Madrid Socialist leaders were to
            be proven wrong in their assessments. The Barcelona union movement would

             recover and call a second general strike. This would develop into a week of
             full-scale insurrection. It too would be defeated, becoming known as the
             “Tragic Week.” But instead of falling apart, the Barcelona labor movement
             would emerge in a more vigorous—and more revolutionary—form than at any
             time in the past.
             “The Tragic Week”
                The collapse of the Catalan unions after the general strike of 1902 shifted
             the center of conﬂict from the economic to the political arena. In the next few
             years, the workers of Barcelona were to shift their allegiances from the
             unions to Lerroux’s Radical Party.
                The Radical Party was not merely a political organization; it was also a man,
             Alejandro Lerroux y Garcia, and an institutionalized circus for plebians. On
             the surface, Lerroux was a Radical Republican in the tradition of Ruiz Zorrilla:
             bitterly anticlerical and an opponent of Catalan autonomy. Lerroux’s tactics,
             like Ruiz’s, centered around weaning the army and the disinherited from the
             monarchy to the vision of a Spanish republic.
                In his younger days, Lerroux may have sincerely adhered to this program.
             The son of an army veterinary surgeon, he became a deft journalist who could
             mesmerize any plebian audience or readership. After moving from Madrid to
             Barcelona in 1901, Lerroux openly wooed the army oﬀicers while at the same
             time, in the exaltado tradition of the old Republican insurrectionaries,
             shopped around Europe looking for arms. Had he found them, however, he
             probably would never have used them. His main goal was not insurrection but
             the revival of the dying Republican movement with transfusions of workingclass support. This he achieved with dramatic public rallies, violently
             demagogic oratory, and a network of more than ﬁfty public centers in
             Barcelona alone. It was Lerroux who introduced into Spain the Casa del
             Pueblo (People’s House), an institution of the Belgian Socialists that combined
             meeting halls, classrooms, a library, and a tavern in a single building. Later
             the Spanish Socialists were to establish People’s Houses of their own as
             means of expanding their movement. In addition to the People’s Houses,
             Lerroux and the Radicals provided the Barcelona poor with food cooperatives,
             mutual beneﬁts, day and evening classes, and inexpensive theatrical
             productions. Part of the money for initiating this costly establishment came
             from secret government funds that the Liberal premier, Moret, fed to the
             Radicals in hopes of counteracting the Catalan autonomists.
                The masses ﬂocked to the Radicals in droves. More than two-thirds of the
             party were made up of workers, including tough working-class women who
             formed their own Radical organizations—the Damas Radicales and Damas
             Rojas. The more volatile youth of Barcelona were incorporated into the
             Juventud Republicana Radical—the Jovenes Barbaros (Young Barbarians), as
             they were called—whose task it was to protect Radical rallies and break up
             those of opponent organizations. This apparatus spread through Barcelona
             into the workers’ suburbs, collecting thousands into a far-reaching political
             network.
                There was nothing to equal this network among Catalan autonomists or the
100 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             unions. By March 1907, the autonomists had been compelled to join forces
             against the Law of Jurisdictions which gave the military authorities the power
             to try by courts martial all civilian acts mimical to the army. The new electoral
             bloc,Teamed Solidaridad Catalana, included moderate Republicans, the
             business-oriented Lliga, and Carlists. Despite its popularity at the polls,
             Solidaridad Catalana held no attraction for the workers and Murcianos, who
             no longer took elections very seriously in any case.
                The unions were still in debris. Many sindicatos (as they were now called)
             had simply disbanded or were shadow organizations, although their leaders
             retained contact with each other in the years following the general strike. It
             was not until 1907 that the Barcelona labor movement recovered suﬀiciently
             to hold a local congress. In June a commission composed of metallurgical
             workers, typesetters, bakers, painters, and store clerks gathered in the store
             clerks’ union headquarters to lay plans for a municipal federation. The
             federation, called Solidaridad Obrera (Worker Solidarity), was founded on
             August 3 and two months later began publishing a newspaper of the same
             name. Although the new organization grew slowly, it managed to take hold
             among workers outside the city. A year later, in September 1908, it was
             expanded into a regional federation embracing 112 labor syndicates
             throughout Catalonia with a membership of twenty ﬁve thousand workers.
             The Radical leaders were disconcerted by the emergence of this new rival for
             working-class support. After an exchange of suspicious cordialities, they
             began to move against it with the intention of either dominating or destroying
             it.
                Initially, the Radicals had very little to fear. Solidaridad Obrera was a “pure
             syndicalist” union, organized entirely around immediate demands and
             collective bargaining. The, union declared that it was not under the “tutelage
             of any political party or ... either of the two branches of socialism” (Marxism
             or Anarchism). It enjoyed the favor of the governor, Angel Ossorio y Gallardo,
             who liked its Socialist members and lamented the weakness of their party in
             Catalonia. Inevitably, however, the labor federation became a battleground
             between the Socialists and Anarchists. The Socialists, led by union oﬀicials
             like Antonio Badia Matemola, Arturo Gas, and the Catalan intellectual Antonio
             Fabra Rivas, were intent on bringing Solidaridad Obrera into the UGT. They
             strongly approved of the union’s opportunism; indeed, as Arturo Gas was to
             emphasize, “Workers conscious of their position emerge from strong
             syndicates, and from such workers emerge good Socialists.” Like the
             Radicals, the Socialists regarded Solidaridad Obrera as a rival to their own
             organization and were intent on absorbing it or crushing it. That they were in
             the new union at all was due to the Catalan Socialist Federation’s lack of
             inﬂuence in Barcelona.
                The Anarchists in Solidaridad Obrera were Anarchosyndicalists who
             believed in operating within large labor movements—workers like Jose
             Rodriguez Romero, Tomas Herreros, and the publicist Leopolda Bonofulla.
             Encouraged by Ferrer, they opened a concerted attack on the Socialists and
             tried to guide the labor federation toward revolutionary goals. Their eﬀorts,
             fostered by the drift of the early French CGT toward revolutionary
             syndicalism, were to be marked by increasing success. The periodical
             Solidaridad Obrera soon fell under Anarchosyndicalist control and on June 13,

             1909, a congress of the labor federation voted overwhelmingly to accept the
             general strike tactic “depending upon circumstances.”
               The Anarchosyndicalists were viewed with disdain by the Barcelona
             Anarchist Communists associated with the periodical Tierra y Libertad and
             the terrorist-oriented Grupo 4 de Mayo (May 4th Group). This handful of
             purists was all that remained of the much larger Anarchist Communist
             movement formed in the 1890s. Their ranks had been terribly depleted by
             arrests and persecutions. Owing to a lack of funds, they were compelled to
             give up their headquarters and meet in the oﬀices of the newspaper. The
             editors, Juan Baron and Francisco Cardenal, regarded the Anarchosyndicalists
             as deserters to reformism and held faithfully to the doctrines that had formed
             the basis of the old Anarchist Organization of the Spanish Region.
               Although there were no visibly organized libertarian federations at this
             time, Anarchists were numerically signiﬁcant in the Catalan labor movement.
             A large number of Anarchosyndicalists were united informally by their
             common objectives in Solidaridad Obrera. Lerroux’s own party contained
             many ex-Anarchists whose commitment to Republican politics was superﬁcial.
             These “anarchistic” types (if such they can be called) were to contribute
             materially to the destruction of the Radical Party merely by doing what it had
             preached. Yet in the end it was not numerical strength that was to establish
             Anarchist inﬂuence in the Barcelona labor movement, but the sharpening
             struggle that developed between the Catalan proletariat and the employers.
               By the spring of 1909, the class conﬂict between the Barcelona workers and
             the textile manufacturers began to look like an uncanny replay of the events
             that had led to the general strike of 1902. On May 15, the Rusinol factory in
             the Ter valley was closed down, and 800 workers were discharged. The
             lockout was the opening blow in another campaign to lower wages throughout
             the textile industry. At a two-day assembly of Solidaridad Obrera in July,
             speakers exhorted the delegates to throw the full weight of the labor
             federation behind the textile workers and to plan for a general strike. There
             seemed to be broad agreement among the delegates on this proposal.
             Although most of the workers outside the textile industry were apathetic, the
             idea of a general strike had been accepted by the union not merely in the
             abstract but concretely—as a strategy that would be translated into action if
             there were suﬀicient provocation from the manufacturers or the government.
               It was against this background of mounting crisis in Barcelona that the
             Maura ministry, on July 11, announced a call-up of military reserves for active
             duty in Morocco. The call-up was not entirely surprising. Skirmishes and
             sporadic encounters between Riﬀ tribesmen and Spanish troops had been
             going on for weeks. The odor of an impending war was already in the air. It
             was no secret that the Riﬀ forays were menacing the supply routes to valuable
             iron mines owned by major Spanish capitalists. To the Spanish workers, the
             prospect of shedding their blood to protect the colonial holdings of a few
             wealthy magnates was not particularly alluring. Maura’s call-up had produced
             heartrending scenes in Barcelona, the main port of embarkation for Morocco.
             Many reservists were desperately poor Catalan workers whose families were
             in no position to lose their breadwinners even for a few days, much less allow
             their lives to be endangered in imperialist adventures. Antiwar feeling ran
             high throughout the country. On July 18, Pablo Iglesias, a man who for
102 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             decades had made prudence the keystone of Socialist policy, warned an
             antiwar rally in Madrid that “if it is necessary, workers will go out on a
             general strike with all the consequences.”
                But when would it be necessary? On the very day of Iglesias’s speech, the
             Riﬀs attacked the Spanish supply lines for the ﬁrst time, turning what had
             been sporadic engagements into a full-scale war. Demonstrations at the
             Catalan port spread to train stations in other cities where reservists were
             being called up. This crisis was raised to acute dimensions in Barcelona when
             on July 21 El Poble Catala published a petition by the Catalan Socialists to
             their Madrid headquarters, calling for a general strike throughout Spain.
             Nearly a week had passed since Iglesias’s warning without any follow-up
             action being taken by the UGT. In the meantime, the turmoil in Spain
             continued to mount. As El Poble Catala editorialized: “The valves have been
             closed and the steam is accumulating. Who knows if it will explode?”
                The stalemate was suddenly broken on the night of July 24, when two
             Barcelona Anarchists, Jose Rodriguez Romero and Miguel Villalobos Morena,
             decided to constitute themselves as the nucleus of a Central Committee for a
             strike. Rodriguez Romero was an Anarchosyndicalist oﬀicial in Solidaridad
             Obrera, and Villalobos Morena had been a schoolteacher in a mining village
             who was forced to leave his post for publicizing Anarchist ideas. During the
             events discussed above, Villalobos was on the staﬀ of Ferrer’s Modern School
             and later represented the “syndicalists” on the Central Committee for a
             Strike. Both men, of course, were Anarchists in their dedication to a
             libertarian society and libertarian methods of struggle.[19]
                Collecting whatever support they could ﬁnd among the militant oﬀicials of
             Solidaridad Obrera, they fanned out through the city to gain commitments
             from other leaders. Faced with a fait accompli, the Catalan Socialists, who
             had been waiting for word from Madrid, now had no choice but to join the
             Committee. To have remained outside would have cost them the opportunity
             of playing a leading role in the strike action.
                Among the Radicals there was to be a division in attitude between the top
             leaders and rank-and-ﬁle militants. Lerroux had gone abroad in February
             1909 to escape trial on an old charge of writing a seditious article. He
             prudently remained away until October 1909, long after the upheaval had
             subsided. The leadership of the party fell to Emiliano Iglesias Ambrosio, a
             shrewd lawyer and politician whose sole policy was to prevent a revolution
             without damaging the Radicals’ reputation for militancy. In trying to curry
             favor with both the army oﬀicers and workers—two essentially antagonistic
             camps—the Radical politicians succeeded in satisfying neither group.
             Although a year later the Radicals were to score a large electoral victory, the
             Catalan workers were to abandon the party and turn away from politics. The
             army, for its part, was to develop its own organizations, the Juntas de Defensa
             (Committees of Defense), after which it drifted almost completely toward
             reaction.
                The Central Committee for a Strike had been formed on a Saturday night.
             By Monday the strike was underway. In the morning hours, strike delegations
             appeared at the factory gates to call out the workers. To protect their
             property, the employers closed down the factories, once again swelling the
             ranks of the strikers as they had in 1902. From the outset the Anarchists
103 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             associated with Tierra y Libertad tried to turn the strike into an insurrection,
             but their most able activists were quickly arrested by the authorities for
             inciting crowds to attack the police stations. They were removed from the
             scene almost as soon as the strike began. The Socialists on the other hand,
             fearful of “Anarchist turmoil,” tried to conﬁne the strike to an antiwar protest
             and regarded any attempt at a revolt as adventuristic.
               The events were to astonish everyone. During the week of July 26 to August
             1, Barcelona would present the spectacle of a full-scale insurrection, a largely
             spontaneous uprising that received little guidance from the union or Radical
             leaders. As Anselmo Lorenzo wrote to Tarrida del Marmol in London: “What is
             happening here is amazing. A social revolution has broken out in Barcelona
             and it has been started by the people. No one instigated it. No one has led it.
             Neither the Liberals nor Catalan Nationalists, nor Republicans, nor Socialists,
             nor Anarchists.”
               Had he known all the details, Lorenzo might have added that the civil
             government in the city had collapsed. On the ﬁrst day of the strike, the
             governor of Catalonia, Don Angel Ossorio y Gallardo, became locked in a feud
             with his superior, the minister of interior Don Juan de La Cierva and his
             military counterpart, Santiago, the captain general of Catalonia. He resigned
             in a huﬀ from his post and withdrew to sulk in his summer mansion on the
             Tibidabo. Santiago, mistrustful of the local garrison, conﬁned most of his
             troops to their barracks, abandoning the streets to the revolutionaries.
               Whatever leadership emerged came from the militants in the Radical Party
             and Solidaridad Obrera. “By default the leadership of the uprising passed to
             the militants ...” observes Joan Connelly Ullman in her detailed study of the
             insurrection. “They were anarchist by conviction, although nominally
             members of the Radical party or Solidaridad Obrera.” Their eﬀorts were
             never coordinated by the Committee, which stonily refused to issue any
             directives and wasted much of its time trying to coax the Radical jefe,
             Iglesias, into joining it. Iglesias, now concerned only with his personal safety,
             refused. Thus from the outset the insurrection followed its own course. The
             crowds roaming the main street were careful to distinguish between police
             and soldiers. The latter were wooed with cheers and antiwar appeals
             whenever they appeared; the police stations, on the other hand, were
             attacked with ferocity. This canny approach proved to be highly successful.
             The police made themselves scarce while at the Paseo del Colon, a group of
             dragoons refused to obey an order to open ﬁre on the crowd. Railroad lines
             leading into the dty were blown up, temporarily isolating Barcelona from
             garrisons outside the city. Barricades were thrown up in the working-class
             districts and arms distributed. Women played a very important role in the
             revolt, often joining the men in the actual ﬁghting. The struggle aroused not
             only the workers and Murcianos but also elements of Barcelona’s déclassés,
             especially prostitutes.
               Nor was it for want of leadership that the insurrection was suppressed, all
             myths about the limits of popular spontaneity notwithstanding. The crucial
             problem was the lack of support outside Catalonia. The breakdown in
             communications between Barcelona and the rest of Spain worked to the full
             advantage of the government, which misrepresented the uprising as an
             exclusively autonomist movement. The non-Catalan working class and
104 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             peasantry, lulled by a false picture of the events, made no eﬀort to aid the
             revolutionaries. Except for workers in a number of industrial towns nearby,
             the Barcelona proletariat fought alone. And it fought with great courage and
             initiative. By Wednesday, July 28, large troop detachments reached the city
             and were deployed against the insurrectionaries. Intense ﬁghting continued
             well into the next day. In the Clot and Pueblo Nueva districts, the resistance
             of the workers was so furious that artillery was needed to clear the
             barricades. Even after the barricades were demolished, dogged ﬁghting was
             carried on in buildings and from rooftops.
               Elsewhere, the ﬁghting was sporadic. The morale of the workers had been
             shaken by the news that their revolt was an isolated one. For instance, the
             UGT, the only national labor federation in Spain at the time, did not issue an
             appeal for a general strike until Tuesday night, July 27, two days after
             Barcelona had risen. Moreover, the appeal was not distributed until
             Wednesday, and it scheduled the strike for the following Monday, August 2—
             two days after the Barcelona insurrection had been suppressed.
               There was little clarity about the aims of the insurrection. The Socialists, as
             we have noted, saw the uprising as an antiwar protest, the Anarchists as a
             social revolution, and the Republicans as a blow against the monarchy. By
             Tuesday the ‘Tragic Week” had developed a sharp anticlerical edge that was
             to characterize it almost to the very end. Before the week was over, an
             estimated eighty churches, monasteries, and Catholic welfare institutions
             were destroyed. It is fairly evident now that this widespread damage to
             clerical institutions was instigated by the Radical politicians’ who were eager
             to divert the workers from revolutionary paths into well-grooved anticlerical
             channels.
               Very little was required to launch this eﬀort: the church was thoroughly
             detested by the workers and middle-class radicals in Barcelona. The
             monasteries and nunneries were regarded as prisons in which recalcitrant
             novices were tortured into obedience or (as popular rumor had it) simply
             killed. The aura of torture and terror which suﬀused popular attitudes toward
             the church led to a number of macabre incidents. Having “liberated” the
             monks and nuns, the well-meaning attackers proceeded to exhume bodies in
             the monastic vaults and cemeteries, looking for evidence of ill-treatment
             before death. When some cadavers were found with bound limbs (a practice
             of the Hieronymite nuns), they were carried to the City Hall as evidence of
             torture. In one case, a number of bodies were deposited on the doorsteps of
             several prominent Catholic laymen. While this was going on, a young, simpleminded coalman, Ramon Clement Garcia did an obscene dance with one of
             the corpses as an “amusement.” He was arrested by the Civil Guard and later
             shot, ostensibly for “building a barricade.”[20]
               The ﬁghting in Barcelona came to an end on Saturday, July 31, when Horta,
             the last outpost of rebel resistance, was overcome. The rebels there had
             fought until further combat was impossible. They had insisted they were
             going to “carry out the revolution” despite the overwhelming odds against
             them. When the “Tragic Week” was over the police had lost a total of only
             eight dead and 142 wounded; the fatalities among the civilian population
             were oﬀicially reported as 104, but this ﬁgure is almost certainly an
             understatement and should be weighed against Buenacasa’s claim of 600
105 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             dead (Buenacasa was one of the participants in the uprising and his ﬁgure,
             although almost six times the oﬀicial one, should not be totally discounted).
             The number of wounded will never be known. Although the reactionary press
             bellowed about attacks on the clergy, only two monks had been deliberately
             killed. Clearly, in the assaults launched upon religious instituions, the
             objective was not to take life but, as Joan Connelly Ullman has noted, “to
             destroy the property—the wealth—of the clergy.”
                No sooner was the revolt over when courts martial were established to
             punish the revolutionaries. According to oﬀicial reports, 1,725 individuals
             were indicted by military courts in the ten-month period following August 1.
             Two hundred and fourteen had escaped the reach of the army and were never
             captured. On closer examination, the courts were obliged to dismiss the
             charges against 469 and acquit another 584. In the end, this left about 450
             people to be tried and sentenced, mostly to varying terms of imprisonment.
             Seventeen were sentenced to death, but only ﬁve were executed in Montjuich
             prison. The remainder had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.
                In four of the ﬁve capital cases, the trials were almost completely without
             juridical foundation: the victims were executed not because they had
             committed the most serious oﬀenses with which they were charged, but
             because the authorities wanted to make examples of them. The military had
             apparently decided to shoot at least one individual for each of the major acts
             committed in the insurrections. Thus its selection of victims was largely
             arbitrary. The ﬁfth and last person to be executed was Francisco Ferrer.
             Ferrer had been abroad between March and June of 1909. He had returned to
             Barcelona in order to be at the sick bed of his sister-in-law and dying niece.
             During the uprising he had spent most of the time at his farm, some ﬁfteen
             miles outside of Barcelona, and his movements had been watched closely by
             the police.
                Ferrer had very little inﬂuence on rank-and-ﬁle revolutionaries and Radicals
             in the city. Although he had befriended such outstanding Anarchists as
             Anselmo Lorenzo and Federico Urales, the ordinary Anarchists and
             syndicalists had been scandalized by his ﬁnancial activities and the publicity
             given to his relations with women. The Radicals were interested mainly in
             Ferrer’s ﬁnancial contributions to their cause. The Socialists, for their part,
             detested him. Nearly everyone regarded his political support as a liability.
             They were ready to take his money (Solidaridad Obrera’s headquarters, for
             example had been rented with a loan from Ferrer) but few were willing to
             listen to his advice.
                Yet this man was a sincere revolutionary. In contrast to Radical leaders like
             Iglesias, he devoutly hoped that the general strike would turn into a
             revolution. The government and clerics hated him and were intent on
             destroying him. When he was captured on August 31, after hiding for ﬁve
             weeks in caves on his farm, the prelates of Barcelona sent a letter to Maura
             openly demanding vigorous action against Ferrer and the Escuela Modema.
             Maura publicly replied that the government “will act in the spirit of your
             letter and follow the line of conduct you indicate.”
                Accordingly, Francisco Ferrer was tried for his life by a military court that
             had arrived at its verdict well in advance. The proceedings lasted only one
             day. The prosecution was allowed liberties that scandalized world opinion:
106 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             anonymous aﬀidavits and hearsay accounts were admitted into evidence
             against the defendant; prisoners who were faced with serious punishment for
             their own oﬀenses were evidently given the opportunity to trade heavy
             sentences for testimony against Ferrer. Evidence in Ferrer’s favor was
             suppressed, and cross-examination by the defense circumscribed to a
             shocking extent, even by Spanish standards of the day. One witness claimed
             that Ferrer had participated in the burning of convents in a community where
             none in fact had been burned at all.
               On the morning of October 13, 1909, Ferrer was executed by a ﬁring squad
             in Montjuich prison. He is said to have died serenely and with great courage.
             As the men were aiming their weapons at him, he cried out: “Look well, my
             children! I am innocent. Long live the Escuela Moderna!
               The judicial murder of Ferrer was an act not only of gross injustice but
             political stupidity. The case led to demonstrations throughout Europe and
             contributed directly to the downfall of Maura’s ministry. No less important
             were the long-run eﬀects of the repression that followed the uprising. The
             government used the revolt as an excuse to suppress the Catalan unions,
             suspend the publication of opposition newspapers, and close virtually all
             private lay schools in the restive province. Although Spain had been placed
             under martial law directly after the outbreak of the insurrection, full civil rale
             was not restored in Catalonia until November 7, almost six weeks after its
             restoration in the rest of the country. As we shall see, these measures further
             radicalized the Catalan proletariat and increased the inﬂuence of the
             Anarchosyndicalists in the labor movement.
               The “Tragic Week” rallied the manufacturers around Madrid and marked
             the ﬁrst major step toward ending independent bourgeois politics in
             Catalonia. Indeed, almost everyone in Spain became mis-trustful of electoral
             methods and drifted toward political subterfuge or the use of direct action.
             The industrial bourgeoisie returned to its old practice of making behind-thescene deals. The Conservatives and Liberals, although falling out increasingly
             between themselves, became uneasy about calling elections. All the members
             of the privileged classes began to live under a single cloud: the danger of a
             mass uprising by the urban proletariat. The inner paralysis of these classses
             increasingly tended to paralyze the entire constitutional system, restricting
             political life to maneuvers within the government.
               Ironically, the Barcelona uprising might have breathed some life into the
             dying system of Turnismo—just as the Federalist revolt of 1873 had evoked it
             —had it not been for the political machinations of the young king Alfonso XIII.
             His overt intervention in parliamentary aﬀairs was to prove a fatal blow to
             electoral politics, leading directly to the Primo de Rivera dictatorship of the
             1920s.
               The ﬁrst monarch of the Restoration, Alfonso XII, had accommodated
             himself to the constitutional regime of the 1870s and 1880s. The landowning
             oligarchy mled, and the monarchy for the most part obeyed. The death of the
             king in November 1885 would have been greatly lamented had the oligarchs
             been able to foresee the role that his successor would play. They were to be
             spared this vision for two decades; the second Restoration monarch Alfonso
             XIII, was a posthumous child, born six months after his father’s death. His
             mother, Dona Maria Cristina, did nothing to threaten Canovas’s scheme for

             stability, and these decades were the most stable in modern Spanish history.
             Industrial development proceeded at a fairly brisk pace. The army’s role in
             politics was curbed, the Carlists were slowly assimilated into the established
             order, and the labor movement was periodically crushed when its growth
             became worrisome.
               But while Canovas was building up this new political establishment, the
             young king was being taken over by the army. Educated in the fashion of a
             military prince, he lived amid parades, swords, uniforms, and oﬀicers who
             schooled him in the prerogatives of command. On ascending the throne in
             1902, this half boy, half general began to exhibit an annoying interest in his
             kingly privileges. The Restoration Constitution of 1876 had given the monarch
             the right to appoint and dismiss the premiers of Spain and as 1909 drew to a
             close, Alfonso decided to exercise his royal authority in a more direct fashion.
             When Maura, confronted by Liberal obstruction in the Cortes, tried to bolster
             his position by asking the throne for a renewal of conﬁdence, Alfonso
             astonished the Conservative premier by accepting his formal oﬀer of
             resignation and replacing him with the Liberal, Moret. With this treacherous
             act, Alfonso virtually terminated the Turnismo, a system that had stabilized
             the Spanish government for a quarter of a century.
               If Maura entertained any hope of using the repression to strengthen his own
             grip on the government, he was soon to be disenchanted. Although he had a
             majority in the Cortes, he was dropped because his handling of the “Tragic
             Week” and the Ferrer case had deepened the split within the country and
             turned world opinion against Spain. How long Maura could have survived had
             the king supported him is diﬀicult to say. Obviously the whole structure
             created by Canovas was already disintegrating and Alfonso’s intervention in
             the aﬀairs of the oligarchy was doubtless an eﬀect, not merely a contributory
             cause, of its decline. In any case, with the passing of the Maura ministry, the
             Canovite system of a disciplined alternation of parties began to give way to
             irresponsible inﬁghting between unprincipled political factions, leading
             inevitably to the piecemeal crumbling of the constitutional structure.
             Chapter Eight: The CNT
             The Early Years
               The decade following the “Tragic Week” opens the mature period of Spanish
             Anarchism, when the movement assumed massive dimensions and fully
             developed its tactics and organizational forms. At this time we also witness
             the emergence of the CNT, the largest of the libertarian organizations that
             were to play a role in the Spanish Civil War.
               The maturing of Spanish Anarchism was a complex process of rounding out
             earlier methods of struggle which had been used too one-sidedly, almost to
             the exclusion of all others. During the period of the International, the
             Anarchists were trying to ﬁnd their way to a coherent body of theory and
             practice, and their inﬂuence on the laboring classes of Spain was very limited.
             This was probably the most experimental period in the early history of the
             movement. Its methods—the general strike tactic combined with local
108 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             insurrections—could be deployed only on a very small operational stage,
             against an historic back-drop dominated by Federalism. By the 1880s and
             early 1890s, Anarchist tactics had veered over to a policy (inﬂuenced largely
             by the Andalusians) of local insurrections, culminating in the Jerez uprising.
             Then another shift took place, this time to the atentados and conspiratorial
             activities of the 1890s. Throughout this period, moreover, there were always
             Anarchists who emphasized the less dramatic tasks of propaganda and union
             organization. In time, all of these tactics began to fall together and were no
             longer regarded as mutually exclusive. Having exhausted the possibilities of
             using any one method as a panacea, the Spanish Anarchists now began to
             unite them as diverse elements in the totality of Anarchosyndicalism. The
             general strike was combined with local uprisings, a steady barrage of
             propaganda, direct action by individuals or small groups, and dogged union
             organizing, each ﬂexibly deployed to reinforce the others. It is this resilience,
             ttiis uncomplicated, free-wheeling combination of tactics, that accounts in
             great part for the remarkable growth of the movement in the years to come.
             The main problem now was to evolve libertarian forms of organization
             capable of encompassing this wide range of tactics and of promoting their use
             on a national scale.
                Such organizational forms ripened gradually, almost unconsciously,
             nourished by the disintegration of social and political institutions in Spain.
             After 1909, the constitutional system became so weakened by internal
             political divisions that neither eﬀective repression nor satisfying reforms
             could be undertaken. Maura had genuinely tried to buttress the oligarchy and
             crush the labor movement. He had attempted in June 1907 to undermine
             popular suﬀrage and lessen the inﬂuence of the caciques by establishing
             “corporate” vote-granting electoral privileges to institutions and limiting
             those of individuals. The Liberals and Republicans were alienated by this
             policy; to them it seemed to portend a drift toward a monolithic Conservative
             regime. Seven months later, when Maura’s minister of the interior, La Cierva,
             presented a “Terrorist Law” that gave special provincial juntas sweeping
             powers to suppress Anarchist “terrorists,” suspend their periodicals and exile
             labor militants, almost all opposition opinion in Spain was aroused.
                The Liberal Party, more mindful than the Conservatives of the need to
             neutralize revolutionary discontent with concessions, formed an alliance with
             the Republicans to unseat the ministry. When the Liberal Moret replaced
             Maura as premier on October 21, 1909, he was publicly committed to a less
             repressive program. In November, four Anarchists charged with rebellion in
             the “Tragic Week” were removed from military jurisdiction and turned over to
             civilian courts. A few days later, martial law was lifted in Catalonia. Finally, a
             general amnesty was declared for the imprisoned rebels of July. This less
             oppressive atmosphere continued into the following year, when Moret was
             replaced by the Liberal Jose Canalejas, whose ministry was avowedly oriented
             toward reform and greater political freedom.
                The Catalan labor movement now began to reemerge. On December
             18,1909, Solidaridad Obrera held a special assembly to piece the organization
             back together. It was attended by delegates from only twenty-seven unions
             with pledges of adherence from an additional forty—a substantial decline
             from the 108 that were represented in its April assembly eight months earlier.

             The membership of the labor federation had dropped from 15,000 to about
             4,500. A pathetically defensive atmosphere prevailed at this gathering. The
             delegates were at pains to disclaim any oﬀicial connection with the general
             strike of the previous July or any ideological association with Ferrer. In June
             Solidaridad Obrera had entertained hopes of expanding the Catalan regional
             federation into a national organization; now, these optimistic plans seemed
             quite remote. “Without doubt,” notes the Anarchist historian, Jose Peirats,
             “the tremendous repression culminating in the Montjuich shootings retarded
             the confederal crystallization.”
               Within months, however, the tide once more began to turn in favor of the
             formation of a national confederation. The decline of Solidaridad Obrera after
             the “Tragic Week” had at least one favorable aspect: the more moderate labor
             leaders had withdrawn for a time, giving freer play to Anarchist inﬂuence.
             This inﬂuence was strengthened by the rehabilitation of Ferrer’s name. The
             injustice of the charges against him, followed by the drama of his martyrdom,
             produced (in Diaz del Moral’s words) “an exaltation of syndicalism and of
             anarchism in the peninsula.” Finally, strong sentiment for a national
             confederation began to build up within unions outside of Catalonia, where
             Maura’s repression had been less severe.
               On October 30, 1910, delegates from local confederations throughout Spain
             convened at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Barcelona for an informal three-day
             exchange of views and experiences. It was at this gathering, called by the
             reconstituted Catalan Labor Confederation (the regional organization of
             Solidaridad Obrera), that a decision was ﬁnally made to establish a new
             national labor confederation: the National Confederation of Labor
             (Confederation National del Trabajo)—the famous CNT. The movement really
             got underway at the CNT’s ﬁrst congress, also held in the Bellas Artes,
             between September 8 and 11 of 1911. By this time a surprising unanimity of
             opinion in Anarchist ranks favored the establishment of the new organization.
             Owing largely to the eﬀorts of Anselmo Lorenzo, many Anarchist Communists
             of Tien a y Libertad began to express the need to work in mass labor
             movements. The new Confederation, to be sure, was still very small: the
             delegates represented no more than 30,000 members in some 350 unions
             throughout Spain. But discussion was animated, and a lively spirit pervaded
             the proceedings.
               We must pause here to examine how this new labor organization was
             structured. The CNT was built up organically, initially around the Catalan
             Regional Confederation (Confederation Regional del Trabajo de Cataluna).
             Later, other regional confederations were established from local unions in
             each province until there were-eight by the time of the Second Republic. The
             national organization was in eﬀect a loose collection of regional
             confederations which were broken down into comarcal (local and district)
             confederations, and ﬁnally into sindicatos, or individual unions. These
             sindicatos (earlier known by the dramatic name of sociedades de resistencia
             al capital—societies of resistance to capital) were established on a vocational
             basis and in typical syndicalist fashion grouped into local and trade
             federations (federaciones locales and sindicatos de oﬁcio). To coordinate this
             structure, the annual congresses of the CNT elected a National Committee
             whose primary functions were correspondence, the collection of statistics,
110 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             and aid to prisoners.
                The general secretary of the National Committee and the secretaries of the
             Regional Committees were the only paid oﬀicials in the Confederation. During
             the ﬁrst few years, the post of general secretary was occupied by Jose Negre.
             In contrast to its Socialist rival, the CNT shunned any manifestation of
             bureaucracy and centralization. It relied primarily on the initiative of its local
             bodies, comarca, and regional confederations to carry out the work of the
             organization. No strike funds were established. Strikes were expected to be
             short, and if necessary, violent as beﬁtted a revolutionary organization whose
             primary aim was the overthrow of capitalism. The purpose of the CNT—or so
             its Anarchist militants believed—was to keep alive the spirit of revolt, not to
             quench it with piecemeal reforms and long, attritive strikes. Regular funds
             were established, however, for aid to prisoners and their families, and to some
             degree for “rationalist schools.” There have been few unions more concerned
             than the CNT with the defense of its imprisoned members and the cultural,
             spiritual, and moral elevation of the working class. The phrase emancipation
             integral de los trabajadores (integral emancipation of the workers) recurs in
             all the leading documents of this extraordinary organization.
                How did the CNT function? For part of the answer we may turn to the
             statutes of the Catalan Regional Confederation, which established the
             guidelines for the national movement as a whole. The organization was
             committed to “direct action.” It rejected all “political and religious
             interference.” Aﬀiliated comarcal and local federations were to be “governed
             by the greatest autonomy possible, it being understood by this that they have
             complete freedom in all the professional matters relating to the individual
             trades which integrate them.” Each member was expected to pay monthly
             dues of ten centimes (a very small sum), to be divided equally among the local
             organization, the Regional Confederation, the National Confederation itself, a
             special fund for “social prisoners,” and the union newspaper, Solidaridad
             Obrera.
                The Regional Committee—the regional equivalent of the CNT’s National
             Committee—was an adminstrative body. Although it played a clearly directive
             role in coordinating action, it was bound by policies established by the annual
             regional congress. In unusual situations, the committee was obliged to consult
             local bodies, either by referendum or written queries. In addition to the
             annual congress of the national movement, a regional congress was to be held
             every year at which the Regional Committee was elected. The statutes
             contained no provision for the recall of the Committee members—a signiﬁcant
             omission—but extraordinary congresses could be held at the request of the
             majority of local federations. Three months’ notice was to be given to the local
             federations before a regular congress was held “so that they may prepare the
             themes for discussion.” Within a month before the congress, the Regional
             Committee was obliged to publish the submitted themes in the union
             newspaper, leaving suﬀicient time for the workers to deﬁne other attitudes
             toward the topics to be discussed and instruct their delegations accordingly.
             The delegations to the congress, whose voting power was determined by the
             number of members they represented, were elected by general assemblies of
             workers convened by the local and comarcal federations.
                In practice, the CNT was more democratic than these statutes would seem
111 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             to indicate. There was a throbbing vitality at the base of the organization, a
             living control and initiative from below. The workers’ centers (centros
             obreros) which the Anarchists had established in the days of the International
             were not merely the local oﬀices of the union; they were also meeting places
             and cultural centers where members went to exchange ideas, read, and
             attend classes. All the aﬀairs of the local CNT were managed by committees
             staﬀed entirely by ordinary workers. There were no paid oﬀicials, of course.
             Although the oﬀicial union meeting was held only once every three months,
             there were “conferences of an instructive character” every Saturday night
             and Sunday afternoon. The junta of the local union characteristically included
             a president, several vice-presidents and secretaries, a small battery of
             “accountants” to keep a watchful eye on the funds, and a librarian.[21] The
             solidarity of the sindicatos was so intense that it was not always possible to
             maintain an isolated strike in a locality. There was always a tendency for one
             strike to trigger oﬀ others in its support or generate active aid by other
             sindicatos. This was especially true of strong Anarchist centers like
             Saragossa, where the movement had established deep and vitaf roots.
                Obedience to the wishes of the membership was a cardinal rule. At the
             annual congresses, for example, many delegations arrived with mandatory
             instructions on how to vote on each major issue to be considered. If an action
             was decided upon, none of the delegations which disagreed with it or felt it
             was beyond the capacity of its membership was obliged to abide by the
             decision. Participation was entirely voluntary. Quite often this voluntaristic
             approach led to all the practical results imputed to centralization—but
             without the need for creating the same deadening structural forms. On other
             occasions, it led to sporadic, ill-timed outbursts, easily crushed by the
             government. But such outbursts were usually due to overconﬁdence on the
             part of the CNT’s local unions, a zealousness that could only be corrected by
             experience.
                In 1911, the CNT was still very immature, and its radiant optimism about its
             prospects very nearly had disastrous results. No sooner had the congress
             established a national confederation when it secretly decided to call a general
             strike in support of strikers in Bilbao and as a protest against the war in
             Morocco. The action was scheduled for September 16—only ﬁve days after the
             founding of the CNT. The general strike started in Saragossa and spread
             rapidly to Gijon, Valencia, and Seville. Partial strikes also broke out in Oviedo,
             La Coruna, Malaga, Santander, and other cities. In Cullera, a town near
             Valencia, the general strike exploded into full-scale insurrection. The workers
             took over the community for several hours and in the course of the uprising
             killed the mayor and a judge. In Madrid the movement was aborted by the
             Socialists, who used their inﬂuence in the capital to prevent a strike from
             getting underway. Surprisingly, no strike developed in Anarchosyndicalist
             Barcelona, where the CNT had held its congress only a few days earlier.
             There, the authorities had been alerted to the strike plans by Sanchez
             Villalobos Morena, the brother of Miguel, who had helped constitute the
             strike committee of July 1909. On the night of September 15, the Barcelona
             police rounded up ﬁve hundred CNT militants or cenetistas (as members of
             the organization were soon to be called) and, with the cooperation of Lerroux,
             who regarded the union as a rival of the Radicals, managed to stop the strike

             movement.
                Canalejas, the Liberal premier, reacted energetically. Troops were moved
             into all the major cities and the entire country placed under martial law. The
             CNT’s centros obreros were closed down, along with the Casas del Pueblo of
             the Socialists, whom the government suspected of planning to support the
             strike. The Anarchist press was suspended and a partial censorship imposed
             on other periodicals. Arrests of labor militants were made everywhere. Heavy
             sentences were meted out to those strike leaders who could be found. With
             this began the ﬁrst ﬂight (to be repeated many times) oicenetista militants to
             France. On January 10, 1912, ﬁve Anarchists were given death sentences for
             their part in the Cullera uprising, but these were commuted to life
             imprisonment. The last of the group, Juan Jover Ferrer (“Chato de Cuqueta”),
             was spared the garrot by Alfonso XIII who was now eager to curry favor with
             the left.
                The CNT went underground. Its press disappeared and its membership
             dropped precipitously. Canalejas, who had been welcomed as a reformoriented premier, began to curb the entire labor movement, even alienating
             the moderate Socialists and Republicans. To break a railway strike in 1912,
             Canalejas drafted 12,000 of the workers into the army. The Liberal premier
             was to pay dearly for his energy. He was shot to death in the Puerta del Sol,
             the main plaza of Madrid, by a young Aragonese Anarchist, Miguel Pardinas.
             Pardinas, whom Buenacasa knew personally as a mild-mannered, inoﬀensive
             boy, took his own life to escape capture. With the repression of the movement
             came a new wave of atentados. In April of the following year, another young
             Anarchist from Barcelona, Jose Sancho Alegre, tried to kill Alfonso XIII at a
             military parade in Madrid. Although the attempt failed, Sancho Alegre was
             condemned to death. Again the indulgent monarch commuted the sentence.
                By degrees, the fortunes of the Anarchosyndicalist movement began to
             change, although it was to grow slowly in the next few years. In 1913,
             Canalejas’s successor, the Liberal premier Romanones, declared an amnesty
             for all imprisoned oﬀenders in the general strike of September 1911. The CNT
             still remained an illegal organization, however. It had originally been banned
             by the judiciary of Barcelona, and the courts refused to revoke their decision.
             But the intrepid union conftnued to function in the underground, still
             conducting strikes and carrying on agitation in the factories.
                The outbreak of the First World War divided virtually all the working-class
             organizations north of the Pyrenees. The defection of outstanding Anarchist
             leaders like Kropotkin, Grave, and Malto to the Allied side, followed by a small
             number of Spanish Anarchists and their periodicals, shocked the movement,
             which came out overwhelmingly against the war. “Rather than war—
             revolution!” cried the Ateneo Sindicalista of Barcelona in a manifesto written
             by Antonio Loredo and signed by hundreds of organizations. Tierra y Libertad
             remained fervently internationalist, advocating an antiwar position from the
             very outset of the conﬂict.
                Buenacasa was convinced that the defection of Kropotkin and other leading
             ﬁgures in the international Anarchist movement hastened the death of
             Anselmo Lorenzo. In any case this grand patriarch of Spanish Anarchism died
             on November 30, 1914, having devoted almost a half century to the
             libertarian movement. The CNT, whose formation had meant so much to
113 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Lorenzo, numbered no more than 15,000 members at the time. By 1916 the
             labor organization had recovered suﬀiciently to publish Solidaridad Obrera as
             a daily newspaper, but the movement was still subjected to severe
             harrassment. The Anarchists’ militant antiwar position greatly displeased the
             authorities. Although Spain remained neutral, its ruling classes were
             emotionally committed to the belligerents and proﬁted greatly by the
             continuation of the war.
               In the spring of 1915, the Ateneo Sindicalista of Ferrol tried to hold an
             international antiwar congress, an event which attracted delegates from
             Portugal, Brazil, and other countries, including representatives of Socialist
             youth groups in France. Eduardo Dato, the Conservative premier, fearful of
             oﬀending the warring powers in Europe, banned the meeting shortly after the
             delegates arrived, but the ban did not prevent the Catalan cenetistas from
             holding a clandestine conference of their own with a view toward rebuilding
             the badly fractured CNT.
               To the Spanish masses, the war had brought jobs and a certain amount of
             economic improvement. But it had also brought a spectacular price inﬂation
             which outstripped the increases in wage earnings, particularly for unskilled
             and semiskilled workers. Once again a wave of dissatisfaction began to sweep
             the country. This time disaﬀection developed not only among the workers but
             also in the Spanish army, middle classes, and industrial bourgeoisie. The
             social situation in Spain began to take a very curious turn. The Conservative
             and Liberal parties had virtually dissolved into factions, making the old
             parliamentary system increasingly unmanageable. The army, riddled with
             dissatisfaction, had begun to form Juntas de Defensa. This was a system of
             councils which seemed to resemble the workers’ syndicates, at least in their
             demands. They asked for seniority in promotions, pay increases, and the right
             to bargain with the government for overall improvements in the military
             service. Their chief, Colonel Marquez, was regarded as a simple, honest
             soldier with Republican sympathies who desired not merely army reforms but
             an end to oligarchic rule and caciquismo.
               By 1917 a strange spectacle was unfolding: the army, banished decades
             earlier from politics to almost everyone’s relief, was now being wooed as the
             hope for political regeneration. The industrial bourgeoisie, irked by economic
             restrictions and high taxes, began to see the military as a possible lever for
             overthrowing the landowning oligarchy and taking political power for itself.
             Francisco de Asis Cambo, the Catalan industrialist and leader of the Lliga,
             established contact with Colonel Marquez, to be joined by Lerroux and a
             variety of Republicans, Radicals, and Catalan Conservatives. The linkage
             extended to the labor movement by means of alliances that had been
             cultivated between the Socialists and Republicans. For the ﬁrst time, Spain
             seemed to be working toward a loose coalition of conservative industrialists,
             middle-class Republicans, petty-bourgeois democrats, and, through the
             Socialists, a major labor federation. This agglomeration of basically hostile
             elements was’ united by a ﬁxed desire to overthrow the landowning rulers of
             the state and establish a freely elected Constituent Cortes that would write a
             new, enlightened Constitution for Spain.
               To what extent was the CNT drawn into this curious bloc? The
             Anarchosyndicalist union found itself involved to the degree that it was
114 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             committed to common action with the UGT. The CNT, it must be emphasized
             at this point, was not homogeneous in its outlook. It contained a strong
             syndicalist tendency, represented by Salvador Segui, the general secretary of
             the Catalan Regional Confederation, and later by Angel Pestana, the editor of
             Solidaridad Obrera. Both men believed in Anarchism as a social ideal and
             were unquestionably individuals of great sincerity and capacity for sacriﬁce,
             but their practical views were shaped by day-to-day issues and organizational
             exigencies. They placed a strong emphasis on the need for immediate gains,
             often at the expense of their libertarian principles. Moving increasingly into
             opposition to them were the more principled Anarchists, who were concerned
             mainly with the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and the establishment
             of a libertarian society.
                Segui was eager to promote cooperation with the UGT. It is likely that he
             found practical Socialists like Pablo Iglesias and Largo Caballero more
             compatible than the “zealots” of Tierra y Libertad. By late 19J6, the idea of
             establishing a working cooperation between the two great labor organizations
             seemed irresistible. The political parties were in shambles; the manufacturers
             and oligarchy were more deeply divided than ever; the unions were growing
             rapidly; and the army’s loyalty to the crown seemed equivocal. Massive
             discontent existed among the workers over the soaring cost of living. What
             could be more natural than to establish a cooperative relationship within the
             union movement?
                This prospect began to take on practical dimensions when an assembly of
             the CNT in Valencia decided formally to explore opportunities for joint action
             with the UGT. After an “exchange of impressions,” the two organizations
             established a working agreement which came to be known as the “Pact of
             Saragossa.” The agreement centered primarily around economic issues: the
             CNT and the UGT decided to call on the government to reduce the cost of
             living by curbing monopolists, speculators, and food exporters. A plan was
             drawn up to initiate a series of escalated actions to reinforce these demands.
             The movement reached its culmination when on December 16, 1916, the two
             labor organizations carried oﬀ an impressive twenty-four-hour general strike
             throughout Spain to protest rising prices.
                By the summer of 1917, the link between the two unions was becoming
             increasingly political. The time had come for the manufacturers, the
             Republican middle-classes, and the Lerrouxistas to be catapulted into direct
             confrontation with the oligarchy. In June, Dato, the newly appointed premier,
             responded to the mounting revolutionary threat by dissolving the Cortes and
             suspending constitutional guarantees. The Catalan deputies, called back to
             Barcelona by the Lliga, thereupon declared themselves to be a National
             Assembly with the mission of renovating the entire political structure of
             Spain. The assembly managed to collect about seventy deputies out of 760
             and hold twb secret sessions before it was dispersed by the police.
                At this point, the government shrewdly decided to provoke the labor
             movement into premature action. Dato’s intention was fairly clear: to
             stampede the Lligistas back to the governmental camp and quell the maturing
             revolutionary unrest among the workers before it went too far. The occasion
             for this ploy arose when the railroad workers of the Compania de
             Ferrocarriles del Norte in Valencia decided to go out on strike. Why the strike
115 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             occurred is unclear. It is quite possible that it was the work of an agent
             provocateur, although it may have also been the result of the hopes produced
             by the assembly of parlimentarians in Barcelona. In any case, the government
             counseled the company to take a ﬁrm stand against the railroad union, an
             aﬀiliate of the UGT. Although the Socialists managed to get the workers to
             return to their jobs, the company provoked a crisis by refusing to take back
             forty-three militants. The railroad workers thereupon walked out again.
               Feeling had now risen to a fever pitch in nearly all the working-class
             districts of Spain. In Vizcaya, 25,000 metallurgical workers had walked out,
             supported morally and materially by the miners of the region. The Socialists
             found themselves in a desperate position. Convinced that a general strike was
             doomed to failure owing to lack of suﬀicient preparation, they had managed
             to persuade the CNT to call oﬀ all strike actions in Barcelona. At the same
             time, grossly mistaking the intent of the government, they had threatened it
             with a general strike if the forty-three railroad workers were not given back
             their jobs. This threat, which the Socialists were convinced would suﬀice to
             cow the government, was precisely what Madrid wanted. Moreover, it was
             generally regarded by the tJGT rank and ﬁle as the opening shot in a social
             revolution. Everyone was straining at the leash, but this time the leash was
             held by the UGT leadership, and was rapidly slipping from their hands.
               The general strike was called on August 13, and in most areas it was
             smashed within a few days. Heavy ﬁghting had broken out in a number of
             cities, particularly in Barcelona, where the CNT reluctantly honored its
             agreement with its Socialist allies. Barricades went up in the Atarazanas
             district and the sharpest encounters occurred when the strikers tried to keep
             the trolleys from operating. Signiﬁcantly, the troops came out on the side of
             the government, raking the streets with machine guns and artillery. They even
             accepted Civil Guard oﬀicers as commanders. Oﬀicially, the ﬁghting left
             seventy persons killed, hundreds wounded, and some two thousand arrested.
             Martial law was declared throughout Spain. But this time, the main burden of
             the repression fell on the Socialists: Largo Caballero, Anguiano, Besteiro, and
             Saborit were arrested and received life sentences. In the following year,
             however, they were elected to the Cortes by working-class majorities and
             freed in the general amnesty that followed the period of repression. On the
             whole, Dato had shown more determination in quelling the labor movement
             than Canalejas—and several years later he was to pay the same price as his
             Liberal predecessor.
               The strike proved to be entirely political, its demands inﬂuenced not by
             Anarchist ideas but by those of the Socialists. The CNT program in Barcelona
             for example, went no further politically than a demand for a republic, a militia
             to replace the professional army, the right of labor unions to veto (not enact)
             laws, divorce legislation, the separation of church and state, and the closing
             of churches “for a certain period.” Economically, the union asked for a sevenhour day, a minimum’ wage of four pesetas daily, the nationalization of the
             land, the abolition of piecework, stronger child labor regulation, and sojorth.
             In demanding a plebiscite for declarations of war, the program ironically
             stipulated that “those who voted for it... be enlisted ﬁrst.” However moderate
             these demands, at least by Anarchist standards, they did not placate the
             bourgeois parliamentarians in Barcelona. Predictably, the Lliga and its allies
116 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             completely deserted the labor movement.
               The general strike of August 1917, however, marks a turning point in the
             modern history of Spain. It ﬁnally sealed the alliance of the Catalan
             bourgeoisie with Madrid: henceforth, the Lliga and its wealthy industrial
             supporters were openly to subordinate their autonomist visions to brute class
             interests. To the Catalan bourgeoisie, the main enemy was to be the Catalan
             proletariat, not the landowners of Castile and Andalusia. Thus was created
             the social setting that eventually would lead the manufacturers of Barcelona
             into the arms of General Franco.
             The Postwar Years
                The end of the European conﬂict brought an economic crisis to Spain—and
             nearly four years of bitter social war. The contraction of the wartime market,
             together with the closing down of shipyards, steel plants, mines, and the
             withdrawal of land from cultivation, produced widespread unemployment in
             the cities and countryside. Intent on reducing wages, the manufacturers
             began to gird themselves for a struggle with the unions. To this end they were
             prepared to use lockouts, the black-listing of union militants, the sindicatos
             libres (the so-called “free unions,” many of which the employers promoted as
             substitutes for the CNT) and, as we shall see later, private gangs of gunmen—
             the pistoleros—-to intimidate and kill union leaders.
                The main target of this oﬀensive was the CNT. The labor organization had
             emerged from the war years and the general strike stronger than ever: by
             1919, the CNT numbered fron 600,000 to a million members. It had absorbed
             nearly all the older and established unions in Catalonia whose prudence led
             them to resist entry into Solidaridad Obrera and its predecessors. This
             expansion of the Anarchosyndicalist union after the failure of the August
             general strike is highly signiﬁcant. In the past, Anarchist-inﬂuenced unions
             were easily repressed. After each defeat, they either emerged weaker than
             before or disappeared entirely. Now the CNT had not only survived major
             government attacks but had grown into a formidable revolutionary force in
             Spain.
                To a large extent, the growth of the union can be attributed to the
             intransigence of the Catalan bourgeoisie. The militancy of the manufacturers
             evoked a corresponding militancy in the working-class; the failure of political
             methods promoted antipoliticism and direct action. Certainly this had
             occurred before, but in the past it had always left the eﬀectiveness of
             repressive measures undiminished. Obviously other factors had now emerged
             which promoted the growth of the union despite vigorous eﬀorts to destroy it.
                The most important of these was the postwar revolutionary crisis of 1918–
             20. The Spanish laboring classes shared the sense of exhilaration that swept
             over the world with the success of the Russian Revolution. The fact that the
             Czar had been overthrown, followed by the Bolshevik takeover—an
             insurrection that proclaimed Socialist ideals—produced wild enthusiasm in
             every comer of the peninsula. The ruling classes were terriﬁed. “The
             imminence of a political revolution,” writes Diaz del Moral, who lived through
             those upheavals, “worried even the most optimistic.... The clear vision of
117 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             these events and the examples of eastern Europe animated all of the
             proletarian strata with hopes of victory. At this point, the most potent labor
             agitation in the history of our country was initiated.”
                This agitation reveals the considerable role Anarchist militants played in
             fostering the CNT’s growth and giving it a revolutionary direction. In the
             winter of 1918 a national Anarchist conference was held in Barcelona to
             deﬁne a common policy toward the CNT. The union, it was agreed, could not
             be regarded as an Anarchist organization in the strict sense of the word. But
             it was decided that the CNT should be a major arena of Anarchist activity.
             Anarchists throughout Spain were urged to enter the union and proselytize it.
             “The results of the conference in Barcelona could not have been better,”
             observes Buenacasa. “Within a few months, all the entities of the CNT were
             perfectly penetrated by the Anarchist spirit and idea.”
                Buenacasa’s conclusion, however, should not be too hastily accepted, as
             witness the results of the congress of the Catalan Regional Confederation (the
             famous “congress of Sans”) convened in Barcelona on June 28,1918. This
             four-day assembly was attended by 164 delegates, representing some 73,860
             members in twenty-seven local federations. So important were the decisions
             of the congress to the future development of the CNT that they must be
             examined in some detail.
                The syndicates were completely restructured on what, in the United States,
             would be called an “industrial basis.” Until the congress of Sans, the workers
             in the same factory had been divided among separate, independent craft
             syndicates, based on trades; now they were to be organized as a sindicato
             unico, uniting all the workers of the same enterprise in a single union. This
             reorganization did not eliminate all of the established craft unions in the CNT,
             a number of which still persisted in areas dominated by the craft-oriented
             UGT, nor did it eliminate representation by trades within the sindicato unico
             itself. Workers of diﬀerent skills were grouped into trade “sections,” then
             united in a common industrial union.[22] In an industrial dispute, all the
             sections acted as a single entity. The sindicato unico formed the basis of the
             Catalan Regional Confederation and of the unions that were to enter the CNT
             in the future. By uniting the skilled and unskilled in a single enterprise, the
             unions not only increased their ﬁghting power but also made it possible for
             the poorly paid, unskilled workers to exert a radicalizing inﬂuence on the
             better-paid craft elite.
                To further stiﬀen the militancy of the union, the congress reaﬀirmed its
             opposition to cajas de resistencia, or strike funds. This stand met with general
             approval. As Pestana declared, the “Catalan worker from time immemorial
             has always resisted the cajas de resistencia because he felt that this dulled his
             desire to struggle....” At the same time, Pestana recognized that many
             employed members would probably want to levy a contribution on themselves
             —as they had done in the past—to aid strikers in major labor conﬂicts. Such
             arrangements, however, had to be made privately, not within the union
             structure. And if there were to be no cajas de resistencia, militant tactics
             would be necessary to settle strikes. At the same time, however, the congress
             of Sans articulated its commitment to direct action with prudence— merely as
             a “preferred means”—and only indirectly expressed its opposition to political
             methods. It refrained from declaring its support for comunismo libertario. As

             Buenacasa disapprovingly noted, the congress “did not endorse a frank
             declaration of libertarian principles.”
                Yet suprisingly, when the delegates took it upon themselves to elect a new
             National Committee (at least until the next national congress) they chose
             Buenacasa as secretary general and Anarchists such as Evelio Boal and
             Vincente Gil as secretaries, Jose Ripoll as auditor, and Andres Miguel as
             treasurer. “These ﬁve,” notes Buenacasa, “constituted themselves into an
             Anarchist group and, in line with their ideas, they oriented the Confederation
             until the Congress of Madrid” (the second national congress of the CNT in
             1919).
                The regional congress of Sans, in eﬀect, regarded itself as an interim
             national body. Its authority to do this, and its choice of a temporary National
             Committee composed exclusively of Anarchists, may seem as questionable as
             it was ambiguous. But the Catalan gathering had been inspired in great
             measure by Anarchist Andalusia, where a regional confederation had been
             established on May 1st in a congress at Seville. It was at this Seville congress,
             in fact, that the sindicates unicos were adopted for the ﬁrst time by a Spanish
             syndicalist union, paving the way for their acceptance in Catalonia and ﬁnally
             by the CNT as a whole. Since Catalonia and Andalusia were now in close
             contact, the Catalans were doubtless conﬁdent that their actions reﬂected the
             wishes of the labor federation as a whole.
                At this time the south was in a fever of expectation. Gone were the
             memories of the defeats suﬀered at the turn of the century, of the 1905
             famine that had starved out the very spirit of agrarian rebellion. Signs of a
             recovery were already evident in the spring of 1913, when a congress at
             Cordoba had led to the founding of the Federation National de Agricultores
             (FNA). Generally, the success of this new organization had been modest
             although it succeeded in holding regular annual congresses up to 1919, when
             it dissolved into the CNT. Most important of all, it had won the greater part of
             Murcia and Valencia to the libertarian fold and provided a springboard for
             steady agitation to promote the simple demand of the reparto: “The land for
             those who work it!”
                With the outbreak of general strikes in the north and the success of the
             Russian Revolution, an intoxicating wave of hope swept through the south
             initiating the Trieno Bolchevista or “Bolshevik Triennium” of 1918–20. The
             popular writings of Sanchez Rosa, Kropotkin’s famous Conquest of Bread,
             Medico’s To the People! together with periodicals like Accion of Seville, La
             Voz del Campesino of Jerez, and Solidaridad Obrera of Valencia, began to
             inundate the countryside. Sanchez Rosa personally conducted a propaganda
             tour of the region, followed by Diego Alonso, Higinio Noja, and Francisco
             Cabello, to mention only a few of the popular Anarchist speakers of the time.
             By December 1919, a major campaign had been launched to sweep Andalusia
             into the CNT. Local newspapers were started up in dozens of towns, and a
             stream of Anarchist speakers, pamphlets, and leaﬂets ﬂowed through the
             south.
                Diaz del Moral, who witnessed the eﬀects of this Anarchist propaganda at
             ﬁrst hand, describes it with great verve and color:
                  Those who were present at the time in 1918–19 will never forget the

                  astonishing spectacle. In the ﬁelds, in the shelters, and in the
                  courtyards, wherever peasants gathered to talk, to everyone’s
                  recurring delight there was one topic of conversation that was
                  discussed seriously and fervently: the social question. During the
                  smoking breaks during the day and at night after supper, the most
                  educated would read the leaﬂets aloud while others listened with
                  great attention. Then came the perorations, corroborating what had
## been read and followed by unending praise. They did not
## understand everything; some words they did not know; some
                  interpretations were childish, others malicious, depending upon the
                  personalities involved; and basically all agreed with each other. How
                  could it be otherwise? For they had all heard the pure truth that
                  they had experienced all their lives, even though they had never
                  been able to express it! Everyone read continually; curiosity and
                  thirst for learning was insatiable; even along the roads, the
                  horseback riders read on their animals leaving reins and halters
                  trailing; when they packed their food, they always put a pamphlet
## into their sacks.

               The account, written after the upsurge had subsided, is inadvertently
             patronizing. Similar descriptions can be found in the writings of travelers to
             Paris on the eve of the Great Revolution: the cab driver holding slackened
             reins while his eyes devour a seditious pamphlet; the soldier on guard duty
             avidly poring over a radical newspaper; the heated discussions in the Palais
             Royal, in the narrow streets, and in the cafes. In the case of France, however,
             this was taken as evidence of the harvest produced by the “Enlightenment”
             and as testimony to Gallic civilisation; in the case of Spain, it was regarded as
             “fanaticism” and “infantile millenarianism.” The point is that Andalusia in
             1918–19, like France in the 1780s, was teetering on the brink of revolution.
             The prudent Cordobese lawyer had come face to face with the insurgent
             Cordobese peasant—and he was frightened.
               In all revolutionary situations, the sedition spreads rapidly. So it had been in
             France, and so it was in Andalusia. In Diaz del Moral’s account, we get not
             only the facts but also the fears of the privileged classes, who saw this
             movement only as a terrible contagion spreading across the land:
                  Within a few weeks, the original nucleus of ten or twelve adepts
                  expanded into one or two hundred; in a few months, almost the total
                  working population, captured by ardent prosleytism, frantically
                  propagated the ﬂaming ideal. The obstinate few who resisted either
                  for reasons of discretion, passivity, or for fear of losing their status,
                  would be harassed on the hillsides as they plowed the furrow, in the
                  cottage, in the tavern, in the streets and squares by committed
                  groups with reasons, with imprecations, with scorn, with irony, until
                  they agreed, for resistance was impossible. Once the village was
                  converted, the agitation spread to those nearby; it suﬀiced for a
                  worker of one pueblo to speak to a comrade of another. In all jases,
                  the eﬀect was successful; with more or less ability, all were
                  agitators. Thus the ﬁre spread rapidly to all ‘combustible’ villages.
                  The propagandist’s task was easy; it suﬀiced that he read an article
120 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
                 from Tierra y Libertad or El Productor for the hearers, like those of
                 Fanelli in Rubau Donadeu’s guest room, to feel themselves suddenly
## illuminated by the new faith.

                Then would come the strikes. Many of them exploded spontaneously,
             sweeping in everyone from day laborers and craftsmen to the house servants
             and wet nurses of the privileged classes. Stores would close, the cafes would
             empty, and the ﬁelds would go untended. If provoked by the Guardia there
             might be violence—rioting, acts of incendiarism, the killing of watch dogs and
             cattle. Quite often, however, nothing would stir; an eerie silence would
             descend upon the entire town. Although many of these strikes would raise
             speciﬁc demands (and in 1918, Diaz del Moral tells us, the majority of them
             wgre successful), others were strictly revolutionary. The strikers would pose
             no demands. Their purpose was to achieve comunismo libertario. When at last
             it was clear that this was not to come, the strikes would end as suddenly as
             they had begun, and everyone would quietly return to work. Then the town
             would wait for the next opportunity. The swollen groups would shrivel back to
             a small nucleus of devoted revolutionaries until another upsurge swept across
             the land.
                The coming of the CNT gave these agrarian movements greater cohesion.
             The union established a centro obrero in each town and created permanent
             organizational forms with regular meetings and experienced organizers. In
             time, even the most isolated towns developed large, reliable memberships and
             became linked to other communities by regional conferences and newspapers.
             This was a vitally important advance. In the past, strikes had been sporadic,
             often doomed to failure by isolation. In later years, they were to be linked
             together into great provincial movements, sometimes leading the way for the
             cities, sometimes reinforcing urban struggles. Speakers from the large cities
             and occasional visitors from abroad would tour the centros obreros, bringing
             the culturally starved country people into living contact with the most
             talented individuals in the movement. Here would come the theoreticians of
             Anarchism, its most capable organizers, its most renowned journalists. These
             would be great moments, like important holidays, when enraptured audiences
             would listen to the newest ideas or heatedly debate the most objectionable
             policies. Then there would be periods when the local speakers, each in turn,
             would expound “the Idea” in all its nuances to neighbors and friends.
                Local newspapers played a major role in this development, not only by
             informing and coordinating the agrarian movement, but also by providing the
             braceros and peasants with a source of expression. CNT and Anarchist
             periodicals were remarkable human documents. They were ﬁlled with letters
             —some barely literate—from all parts of the district. The sindicatos unicos
             would post notices of their activities; individual braceros and peasants would
             discuss a host of issues ranging from politics to morality; experiences would
             be exchanged, and, of course, there would be news of all important events
             that concerned the interests of the laboring classes. The periodicals, in short,
             were living organs; their readers devoured them avidly and wrote to them
             frequently. Devoted Anarchists might subscribe to a number of papers: usually
             Tierra y Libertad or one of the Solidaridad Obreras, several of which were
             published in the large cities. In addition there were scores of local
121 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             newspapers to choose from in Andalusia alone. These periodicals were
             supplemented by pamphlets and books on geography, history, science, and
             agronomy, as well as social issues, and included morally elevating dialogues,
             poems, and novels. Many of them were printed in very large editions on cheap
             paper and usually sold for a fraction of a peseta.
               In Andalusia and the Levant the sindicato utiico usually embraced the entire
             town, bringing together workers, craftsmen, peasants, braceros, and even
             shopkeepers in a single union. Thus any strike involved everyone to some
             degree and usually took on the proportions of a general strike. In small
             communities, the Sunday meetings of the sindicato were simply village
             assemblies. Anyone was free to attend, to speak and vote on the topics at
             issue, which often included not only union business but all the aﬀairs of the
             community. Women participated as freely as men. Between the weekly
             assemblies, the adminstration of the community’s aﬀairs was vested in the
             Junta del Sindicato and its committees. The assemblies made all decisions of
             policy and the committees executed them, imposing ﬁnes if necessary. Any
             action of the committees, however, could be challenged and revoked at weekly
             assemblies. During periods of upheaval, the sindicato as a whole became a
             “dual power” in the full sense of the word, often completely undercutting the
             authority of the oﬀicial municipality.
               Although recent evidence suggests that the braceros were already
             organized in quasi-syndicalist unions as early as the 1880s and were hardly
             the amorphous mass described by Brenan and Hobsbawm, the richly
             articulated forms described above did not fully emerge until the Second
             Republic. In 1918 the CNT was still a new organization in the south and the
             sindicato unico, although initiated by Andalusia, had yet to develop stable
             roots. In any case, time was working against the rebellion in the countryside.
             For years the ruling classes of the south had answered the demands of their
             laborers with an arrogant indiﬀerence, safe in the knowledge that they
             wielded complete power over their domains. With the upsurge of 1918, they
             panicked completely. The early concessions to the rural strikes were made as
             a result of fear, not in a spirit of compromise. Many landowners responded to
             the demands of their laborers by packing oﬀ to the provincial cities, in some
             cases leaving Spain altogether. Those who remained behind—the more
             determined proprietors, the caciques and their ruﬀians, the conservative
             middle classes—mobilized into armed groups. Every cortijo became an armory
             bristling with weapons.
               Finally, in May 1919, the new Maura ministry sent General La Berrera into
             the south with a division of troops. The soldiers, divided into small
             detachments, occupied vitually all the restive towns and villages. With the
             declaration of martial law that accompanied this invasion, workers’ centers
             were closed down, radical newspapers suppressed, and thousands arrested.
             Those who were not conﬁned fo jail were simply expelled from the region. The
             rural movement now began to roll back. The ebbing of the tide was hastened
             by demoralizing quarrels between the Socialists and Anarchists and by bitter
             inﬁghting between the Anarchists and syndicalists in the local federations of
             the CNT.[23] Finally, where all repressive measures had failed, the strikes
             were literally starved out by the deepening economic crisis that followed the
             war. A quiet once more descended upon the south, not to be broken until the
122 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             1930s.
               In the north, repression had started even earlier, under the Liberal premier
             Romanones, but its eﬀects were to backﬁre completely on the government.
             During the summer of 1918, the CNT launched a massive propaganda
             campaign throughout most of Spain to win over the working class. Within six
             months, the labor organization had increased its Catalan membership nearly
             ﬁvefold, leaping from 75,000 in June to 350,000 by the end of the year. CNT
             speakers crisscrossed the country addressing large meetings and winning
             adherents by the thousands. In some cases, the gains were utterly
             spectacular: in December, for example, while stopping at Valencia, Buenacasa
             and his comrades won over to the CNT the entire Federation National de
             Agricultores, which was then holding its ﬁfth national congress. In addition,
             the CNT gained the adherence of the Regional Workers’ Federation of
             Andalusia, bringing two of the largest rural unions into its fold.
               As the agitation continued to mount, the government became increasingly
             alarmed. Finally, on January 16, 1919, Romanones decreed the suspension of
             all constitutional guarantees in Catalonia. Nearly all the top CNT oﬀicials,
             including Buenacasa, Segui, Herreros, and Negre, were rounded up and
             imprisoned in the battleship “Pelayo” lying at anchor in Barcelona. Pestana
             managed to escape arrest, but Solidaridad Obrera, on which he served as
             editor, was suppressed.
               These arrests produced an uproar in Catalonia. Although the labor
             organization had been driven underground, it continued to grow. In fact, it
             was at this point in the CNT’s fortunes—when it was technically an illegal
             organization, its top oﬀicials in jail and its newspaper suppressed—that
             Barcelona was rocked by one of the most memorable general strikes in the
             history of the Spanish labor movement.
               The strike began with a minor dispute in the “Canadiense,” the popular
             name for an Anglo-Canadian hydroelectric company (Reigo y Fuerza del Ebro)
             that furnished Barcelona with power and light. Here the CNT had organized
             one of its strongest sindicatos unicos. However, it was not with the wellorganized utility workers that the strike of the “Canadiense” began, but with
             the oﬀice employees. Toward the end of January, a number of clerks had
             received wage-cuts, and they turned to the sindicato for assistance. The union
             made an attempt to negotiate the dispute, but the English director of the ﬁrm,
             Peter Lawton, though at ﬁrst disposed to deal with the workers, ﬁnally
             responded by discharging eight of them. Three days later, on February 5, the
             entire clerical staﬀ declared a sit-in strike and sent a committee to the highest
             public oﬀicials of Catalonia requesting their intervention in the conﬂict. They
             were answered by the arrival of the police, precipitating a strike by the
             majority of the workers in the plant.
               The intransigence of the “Canadiense” director requires an explanation. At
             this time in Barcelona, a policy conﬂict existed between the civil and military
             authorities. Reﬂecting the state of mind in Madrid, the civil governor
             Gonzalez Rothwos was inclined to deal amicably with the moderate oﬀicials in
             the CNT. He sensed that a policy of brute repression strengthened the
             Anarchist militants in the union, undercutting the position of Segui. On the
             other hand, the captain general Milans del Bosch was a harsh reactionary of
             the old school who had only one answer to labor unrest: dar la batalla—“to
123 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             give battle.” In this stance he was completely supported by the newly
             organized Employers’ Federation, which sought to establish an antilabor,
             militaristic regime in open deﬁance of the civil authorities in Barcelona and
             Madrid. As Brenan notes, the paradoxical union of the “nationalistic” Catalan
             manufacturers with the anti-Catalan army had turned Milans del Bosch into
             “a sort of Viceroy,” clearly demonstrating that “for the Lliga, the social
             question took precedence over the Catalan one.” Apparently, it was the
             captain general and the Employers’ Federation which stiﬀened Lawton’s
             attitude in the dispute with the sindicato.
               Before Milans del Bosch could “do battle,” however, the strike began to
             spread—and to the most strategic sectors of the economy. On the same day
             that the “Canadiense” went on strike (February 8), the workers of the Energia
             Electrica de Cataluna followed them in an act of solidarity, sitting-in in their
             own plant. Nine days later, on February 17, the textile workers walked out.
             They were followed by a nearly complete strike by all the electrical workers of
             Barcelona. The city was plunged iijto darkness. The government, faced with a
             desperate crisis in Spain’s leading industrial region, brought in the army to
             restore electrical service, but it could do so only partially, and 70 percent of
             the factories in the area were paralyzed.
               The conﬂict between civil and military authorities now came into the open.
             While Gonzalez Rothwos was trying to restore negotiations, Milans del Bosch
             placed the entire province of Barcelona under martial law. For its part, the
             “Canadiense” issued a proclamation warning that any worker who failed to
             return to his job by March 6 could consider himself ﬁred. At this point, an
             extraordinary thing occurred: the Sindicato Unico de Artes Graﬁcas informed
             the Barcelona newspaper publishers that they would refuse to print anything
             that was prejudicial to the interests of the strikers. When Romanones in
             Madrid tried to break the strike by calling up the workers for military service,
             the printers kept the proclamation but of the newspapers. At length, this
             document found its way into print, only to be answered by a strike of all the
             railway and trolley workers. The majority of the mobilized strikers refused to
             answer the call-up, and those who reluctantly did so refused to act as
             strikebreakers. Some 3,000 of them were packed oﬀ to the Montjuich
             Fortress. By March 13, the frantic Romanones, pursuing a policy of
             negotiation with the strikers, installed Carlos Montanes as civil governor and
             Gerardo Doval as Barcelona police chief—both well-known for their liberal
             views. By now, the “Canadiense” equipment was suﬀering from major
             deterioration; the company, in fact, was facing bankruptcy.
               A settlement was ﬁnally negotiated by Jose Morote, an oﬀicial in the Catalan
             government. Although the strikers had been motivated largely by solidarity
             for their fellow unionists, most of them asked for wage increases, an eighthour day, recognition of the sindicatos by management, and the reinstatement
             of discharged personnel. All of these demands were granted. In addition, the
             workers compelled the employers to reimburse them for the earnings they
             had lost while striking. As for the government, it was required to release all
             those imprisoned for “social questions,” including the CNT oﬀicials who had
             been arrested in January. There remained one qualiﬁcation: the authorities
             refused to release anyone who was currently on trial.
               On the night of March 16, the settlement was submitted for approval to a
124 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             huge mass meeting of strikers at Barcelona’s plaza de toros de Las Arenas.
             The workers agreed to everything except the qualiﬁcation on the “social
             prisoners.” A cry went up over the entire plaza: “Free everybody!” Indeed,
             feeling ran so high that the settlement was nearly rejected; but Segui, by
             arguing that nothing short of an insurrection could free those prisoners,
             gained the provisional approval of the audience. It was agreed to return to
             work for now, but to resume the strike if the government failed to release all
             the prisoners in seventy-two hours.
               This general strike had lasted forty-four days, paralyzing virtually the entire
             economy of Barcelona and the towns in the surrounding area. The strikers
             had resisted a military call-up, thus risking imprisonment for four years. Not
             only workers in industry and transportation but shop clerks and dvil servants
             had walked oﬀ their jobs. Thousands had been packed oﬀ to the Montjuich
             Fortress. Finally, on March 11, Romanones had tried to curry favor with the
             strikers by decreeing an eight-hour day for the construction workers, which
             was to be extended to all trades on April 3. The decree made Spain the ﬁrst
             country in the world to enact the eight-hour day into law.
               The workers knew that they had won an historic victory—but so did the
             employers. Now the hand of Milans del Bosch began to be felt, and it
             tightened into a ﬁst. Despite pleas by union oﬀicials, the government let the
             seventy-two hours pass without releasing the remaining prisoners. There was
             no way to avoid this challenge, and on March 24, wisely or not, the strike was
             resumed in full force.[24] This time the captain general acted with energy and
             decisiveness. Troops were stationed at all strategic points in the city with
             machine guns and artillery. To reinforce the soldiers, Milans del Bosch called
             up 8,000 men of the archaic Civic Guard, a volunteer militia recruited
             overwhelmingly from the bourgeois classes. Stores were forced open with
             riﬂe butts, even though the clerks were still on strike. Members of the Civic
             Guard transported supplies into the city, and armed troops patrolled the
             streets.
               The government ﬂatly refused to make any compromises with the strikers.
             To the contrary: the police launched a massive roundup of all the CNT
             oﬀicials, strike committees, and union militants they could ﬁnd. By March 28,
             the strike had begun to follow a noticeable downward trend. First the store
             clerks and oﬀice workers returned to their jobs, followed by workers in light
             industry, transportation, and utilities. The metallurgical workers held out to
             the last, but by April 7 the general strike had essentially come to an end. A
             key factor in bringing about the resumption of work in an enterprise was the
             arrest of the strike committee and the demoralization that ensued. Although
             workers remained out well into April (partly because of lockouts) and the
             conﬂict lingered on in outlying industrial communities, the backbone of the
             strike had been decisively broken. Milans del Bosch, acting for the army and
             the arrogant Employers’ Federation, capped his victory with an act of
             deﬁance that virtually shaded into a pronunciamiento: he removed Montanes
             and Doval from oﬀice, packing oﬀ the civil governor to Madrid. This action
             toppled the Liberal government, and Romanones was replaced by Maura.
               Milans del Bosch, whatever may have been his expectations, did not smash
             the CNT. The union was evidently a formidable power in Catalonia, and in the
             following year its strikes were to increase in number. The captain general,
125 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             however, succeeded in realizing all the fears of his former civil governor,
             Gonzalez Rothwos: the violent tactics advocated by Anarchist militants were
             to replace the moderate methods of the syndicalists. Pistoleros, or gunmen,
             would soon begin to operate more frequently on behalf of both the union and
             the employers.
               The last serious attempt to resolve the bitter conﬂict in Barcelona was made
             in the latter half of 1919, when Maura, repudiated by the electorate, was
             replaced by Sanchez de Toca. The new ministry, composed entirely of
             Conservatives, made a last ditch eﬀort to reconcile the two classes. That the
             ministry was formed at all is almost miraculous; the king had begun to meddle
             in parliamentary aﬀairs in a manner that verged on the erratic. The military
             juntas, now extremely reactionary, supported the employers in their policy of
             dar la batalla. Despite these formidable obstacles, Sanchez de Toca made an
             unusual eﬀort to arrive at a modus vivendi with the labor movement. His cool
             and conciliatory behavior in the great strikes that swept Malaga, Valencia,
             and Saragossa in 1919 stand out in sharp contrast to the mindless repression
             initiated by Maura and his aide La Cierva.
               Barcelona was dealt with cautiously. The new civil governor, Julio Amado,
             tried to create a stable system of labor arbitration by establishing a Mixed
             Commission of Labor (Comision Mixta de Trabajo), on which sat an equal
             number of employer and union representatives.[25] For a while, it almost
             seemed that Amado’s policy of conciliation might succeed: the number of
             atentados fell oﬀ sharply, and an agreement was reached in September for the
             return of 70,000 workers (many of them lockouts as well as strikers) to their
             jobs.
               But this period of conciliation was to be very shortlived. In October 1919, a
             congress of the Employers’ Federations in Barcelona secretly voted to initiate
             a general lockout in Catalonia and, if necessary, throughout Spain, in the
             event that the government should fail to end the “present situation of social
             disorganization.” The decision was followed by a month of maneuvering
             between the union and the manufacturers, in which the latter tried to create
             the very “social disorganization” they had been complaining about.[26] When,
             on November 25, some 25,000 construction workers went on strike, the
             employers apparently decided that-the opportune moment for their oﬀensive
             had arrived. The lockout began on the very same day, throwing 200,000 out of
             work. The action lasted well into January of the following year—a period of
             ten bitter weeks, during which virtually all industry in Barcelona was brought
             to a standstill.
               It was in the midst of the lockout—indeed, during one of its worst phases
             —-.that the CNT decided to hold its second national congress. Since
             Barcelona was no longer safe for such a gathering, it was to take place in the
             Socialist stronghold of Madrid.[27] On the morning of December 10,1919,437
             delegates gathered in the aristocratic Teatro de la Comedia, ﬁlling most of the
             orchestra seats and boxes. The remaining sections of the Teatro were
             occupied by a large assortment of artists, writers, poets, and academicians; in
             short, that unique peripheral group of intellectuals that had collected around
             the Madrid Anarchist organizations from the days of the First Republic. It was
             truly a people’s congress, with each delegation wearing its own regional garb:
             the Basques in their berets, the Andalusians in their large Cordobese hats and
126 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             peasant blouses, and so forth. The delegates represented over 700,000
             members. The overwhelming majority— 427,000—were located in Catalonia,
             while the Levant claimed 132,000. The Andalusian delegation—“the most
             anarchist delegation,” according to Buenacasa—-represented less than
             90,000, a reﬂection of the harsh repression Maura had inﬂicted on the region.
               Although somewhat formally structured, with a credentials committee and
             special committees to report on important issues, the congress was highly
             democratic. From the outset it was decided to grant everyone present the
             right to speak, although many individuals in the Teatro were not members of
             the CNT. Voting privileges, of course, were reserved for the authorized
             delegates. From beginning to end, it was a stormy congress. For eight years,
             repression had prevented a representative, national assembly of this kind
             from convening. Passions and ideas were pent up in all of the delegates. No
             sooner had the lean ﬁgure of Boal called, the crowded meeting to order than
             scores of delegates sprang to their feet, demanding the ﬂoor. Later, an
             extremely able chairman, Jose Maria Martinez of the Asturian delegation,
             managed in an aﬀable but decisive manner to keep the proceedings orderly,
             but “vivas” to Anarchism and to the CNT exploded throughout the sessions.
               The congress unequivocally declared its belief in comunismo anarquico. It
             adopted the Sindicato Unico de Ramos e Industrias (single union of branches
             and industries) for large cities and the more encompassing Sindicatos Unicos
             de Trabajadores (single union of workers) for the smaller towns and villages.
             This merely acknowledged the fact that craft sections within the sindicato
             unico were not feasible for unions in small or rural communities.
               With the adoption of the sindicato unico, the congress annulled the
             Federaciones de oﬁcio (the federations organized by trade and industry),
             replacing them by simple Comites de relation profesional (committees of
             professional relations). No longer was the labor organization to have the dual
             aspects advocated by traditional syndicalism: there were to be sindicatos
             unicos, grouped into local or territorial federations. Craft problems were to be
             handled by the trade sections within each sindicato unico and, on a larger
             scale, by simple, loosely organized committees of professional relations. “The
             National Confederation will be composed basically of its Regional
             Federations,” declares the resolution adopted on this issue, “these by the
             Local and Comarcal Federations and these by the Sindicatos.” With this
             structural change, the CNT was now essentially decentralized and its internal
             relations made entirely organic. Although a National Commitee continued to
             exist, the autonomy of the local and regional federations was no longer
             abridged by the existence of parallel, separately organized craft bodies.
               The congress called upon the printers’ sindicatos to refuse to publish any
             periodicals in localities where authorities had suspended the CNT press.
             Furthermore, the printers were asked to exercise a “red” censorship in direct
             proportion to the censorship imposed on labor periodicals. The delegates
             aﬀirmed their commitment to accion directa and declared their support for
             the “intelligent,” “opportune” use of sabotage. They condemned any
             participation by the CNT unions in the Mixed Commissions. By this time, the
             Catalan Regional Confederation had acknowledged its error in joining the
             Mixed Commissions organized under the Sanchez ministry, an act of selfcriticism that the delegates accepted without reproaches.

               The biggest problem facing the congress was its attitude toward other
             movements, notably the UGT and the Communist International. A strong
             sentiment for fusion with the Socialist union existed among delegates from
             Asturias and Castile, the two areas where the UGT had deep roots in the
             working class. The Saragossa delegate supported fusion, reminding the
             congress that workers from his area were not yet aligned with either labor
             organization. On the other hand, the Andalusians as a bloc and Anarchist
             militants from other regions opposed it furiously. The ill-feeling of many
             cenetistas toward the Socialist union can best be conveyed by referrring
             directly to one of the resolutions condeming fusion. The ugetistas (UGT
             members) were described as amarillos y al margen del movimietito obrero
             “yellows and on the margin of the labor movement.” Nourishing this sharp
             language were bitter memories of strikes in which ugetista workers had
             scabbed against their brothers in the CNT and the cynical advantage the
             Socialist leadership had taken of Anarchist defeats. Yet the use of these words
             produced a sensation at the congress, and for three days the delegates
             heatedly debated the issue. When it ﬁnally came to a vote, the fusionists were
             defeated by 324,000 to 170,000. The number of abstentions was fairly large
             and, unaccountably, delegates representing some 200,000 members did not
             participate in the voting at all.
               By contrast, the Bolshevik Revolution was greeted with unrestrained
             enthusiasm. The congress called upon all Spanish armament workers not to
             produce any weapons destined for use against the Red Army and threatened
             to call a general strike if Spain sent troops to Russia. After avowing their
             support of Bakunin’s principles in the First International, the delegates voted
             for provisional adherence to th^Communist International.
               “In spite of the fact that not one of the four hundred anarchist delegates of
             the Spanish organization in Madrid was disposed to cede a single point of our
             ideological convictions,” observes’Buenacasa, “the truth is that the immense
             majority behaved like perfect Bolsheviks. This was in spite of the great love
             we felt toward the libertarian ideal. It had an explanation: the Russian
             Revolution impressed us to the extreme that we saw in it the revolution we
             dreamed of.” The Asturian delegate, Quintanilla, warned against this naivete:
             “The Russian Revolution does not embrace our ideals; it is a socialist type of
             revolution, common to all the revolutionary socialist tendencies started in
             Europe. Its direction and organization does not correspond to our concept of
             workers’ intervention, but to that of political parties.” While calling upon the
             delegates to oppose European intervention in the Russian Civil War, the
             Asturian urged them not to join the Communist International.
               The relationship of the CNT to the Russian Bolsheviks was to follow a
             strange trajectory. In June 1920, Angel Pestana was sent to Moscow to
             represent the labor organization at the Second Congress of the Communist
             International. In Moscow he was courted by Zinoviev and Losovsky, but he
             soon began to sense the enormous gap that existed between the libertarian
             ideals of his movement and the authoritarian practices of the Bolsheviks. The
             Russians tried to be accommodating; to lure Anarchosyndicalist unions into
             the Communist fold, they established the International of Red Trade Unions
             (“Proﬁntern”), presumably an independent body that accepted all
             revolutionary unions irrespective of their political views.

                These ﬂirtations did not last long. In March 1921, the Soviet regime harshly
             suppressed the Kronstadt sailors uprising. The Kronstadt issue, coupled with
             a mounting campaign against Russian Anarchists, began to alienate the
             libertarian movement throughout the world. The relations between the CNT
             and Moscow became increasingly taut. Pestana, returning to Spain, reported
             on his bleak experiences. His account was corroborated by Gaston Leval, who
             had gone to Russia separately as a representative of the Catalan Anarchists.
             On June 11, 1922, a conference of the CNT at Saragossa rejected aﬀiliation
             with the Bolshevik movement, and the CNT together with other independent
             syndicalist unions in Europe, began to explore the possibility of forming a new
             international. Bearing the traditional name of “International Workingmen’s
             Association,” the syndicalist international was founded at a congress held in
             Berlin from Decemeber 26, 1922, to January 3, 1923. The adherence of the
             CNT to the new body ﬁnally ruptured all ties between the Spanish labor
             organization and Moscow.
                The Bolsheviks, however, did not suﬀer a complete loss in Spain. In April
             1921, a group headed by Andres Nin and Joaquin Maurin surfaced in Moscow,
             professing to represent the CNT. Actually, Nin and Maurin represented
             virtually no one but the Lleida local federation (their stronghold), which they
             had persuaded to send them to Russia.[28] Both men were deeply enamored of
             the Bolsheviks and, without consulting the movement they professed to
             represent, proceeded to aﬀiliate it to the Communist International. Their
             actions and claims were disavowed by a plenum of the CNT at Logrono the
             following August. After a futile attempt to return to Spain, Nin went back to
             Moscow to become head of the. “Proﬁntern.” Maurin managed to reach Spain
             and together with Anarchosyndicalist and Socialist dissidents, established a
             Communist-syndicalist group of his own, largely independent of the newly
             founded Spanish Communist Party. In later years, both he and Nin were to
             combine and establish the semi-Trotskyist Partido Obrera de Uniﬁcation
             Marxista (Workers’ Party of Marxist Uniﬁcation): the ill-fated POUM.
                The Madrid congress of the CNT in December 1919 marks the high point in
             the postwar development of Spanish Anarchosyndicalism. The movement had
             taken on a more national character, expanding beyond the conﬁnes of
             Catalonia and Andalusia. It had become a serious competitor of the UGT in
             the mining districts of Oviedo and had established roots in the steel plants of
             Gijon and La Felguera. Saragossa was a center of “pure” Anarchism—a “Jerez
             of the north”—with tendrils extending into the estates of the steppe country
             and the vineyards of Rioja. A strong Anarchosyndicalist movement existed in
             La Coruna, particularly among the dock workers, as well as in the
             surrounding rural districts. In most Spanish ports the majority of sailors and
             stevedores favored the CNT. The union had wide support among the mountain
             peasants of the Levant and strong sindicatos in the Rio Tinto mining district.
                Anarchist groups, as distinguished from Anarchosyndicalist unions, were
             forming into regional federations after having existed for years in relative
             isolation from each other. An Andalusian Anarchist Federation had been
             established in 1917, and now there was one in Catalonia as well as other
             provinces. These ﬁnally collected into a loosely organized National Federation
             of Anarchist Groups, later establishing an exile oﬀshoot in France called the
             Federation of Anarchist Groups of the Spanish Language. In the late 1920s,

             the two federations were to form the basis of the Federation Anarquista
             Iberica, the redoubtable FAI of the Republican years and the Civil War.
               In Catalonia, however, the CNT had entered a period of deep crisis. The
             lockout was to completely exhaust the labor organization and the pistolero
             war was to claim a disastrous toll in dead and wounded among its most
             capable militants. Indeed, this savage duel l^tween armed Anarchists and
             employer-hired thugs was to cost many lives not only among the unionists but
             also among public oﬀicials, manufacturers, and the highest echelons of the
             state.
               No less important than the claim it made in humanlife was the atmsophere
             of illegality it generated. After the street war, the country would never again
             be the same. Everyone, from Cortes deputies to Anarchist militants, pocketed
             revolvers, and almost every large organization had some kind of paramilitary
             force at its disposal. On an ever-increasing scale, political disputes involved a
             recourse to arms. The return of the “permanent guerrilla” to Spanish society
             is vitally important in understanding the social atmosphere that produced the
             Civil War.
             The Pistoleros
               In 1916 Angel Pestana, who at that time was editor of Solidaridad Obrera,
             was privately approached by two young workers who, without any
             preliminaries, declared:
                  We are going to pose a question to you. We belong to an Anarchist
                  action group and are disposed to continue the work already started.
                  We come to propose that you be our spokesman in the confederal
                  committees, especially in the Regional Committee. Our proposal is
                  as follows: we are willing to make an alentado against any employer
                  or factory director the organization considers it advisable to
                  eliminate. In exchange for this sacriﬁce, which we are willing to
                  make for the organization, we only ask that you pay us the expenses
## which we incur and the wages of the days lost from work.
                  Furthermore, that there be a reserve fund of two or three thousand
                  pesetas so that in case of the necessity for ﬂight, if our identity is
                  discovered, we can put our hands on it immediately. And if anyone is
                  imprisoned, as you can understand, we want you to help us. What
                  we ask of you, as you will see, is very little; what we oﬀer, on the
## other hand, is a great deal.

               Pestana, who knew the young men, tried to dissuade them. They were
             wasting their time, he warned, for he was unalterably opposed to such
             methods. Later he learned that they had made the same oﬀer to the
             organization through one of its committees and that it had been accepted.
             These young Anarchists, Pestana goes on to say, did not decide which of the
             employers and their factory directors were to be assassinated. The decision
             was made by the men who accepted their services. The atentados were
             entirely impersonal and were performed without expectation of ﬁnancial
             reward or desire for personal vengeance. At that time, according to Pestana,
130 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             two or three Anarchist action groups were operating in Barcelona. “Let us
             state that those who took advantage of this and paid the young men for their
             work” he adds, “were some elements, very few, among the leaders of the
             textile unions. When this was done, the ﬁrst step had been taken.”
               If this was the “ﬁrst step,” however, it was not a major one. Sastre y Sama’s
             study of atentados performed against Barcelona employers shows that they
             were not greater in number between 1916 and 1919 than they had been in
             1914.[29] It was not until late 1919 that the number of Anarchist atentados
             began to rise signiﬁcantly, paralleled by increasing assassinations of CNT
             militants and oﬀicials. The year was a particularly bitter one for the labor
             federation. It was the year of the February-March general strike, Maura’s
             campaign of persecution, and the long lockout from November until January
             of the following year. Except for a brief truce initiated by the Sanchez
             ministry, the government had been especially provocative: constitutional
             guarantees in Catalonia were suspended between late January and midMarch, and again in late March, by which time some 40,000 workers had seen
             the inside of jails. The sindicatos had been attacked repeatedly, their records
             seized and the centros obreros closed down. Finally, to cap these
             provocations, one of the most outstanding CNT oﬀicials was cut down by the
             bullets of assassins. On the night of July 19, two men in police uniforms drove
             up to the home of Pablo Sabater, the president of the textile union, and shot
             him to death. Perhaps more than any other event up to that point, the murder
             of a reveled union militant increased pistolerismo in the Catalan seaport to
             uncontrollable proportions.
               The disease was endemic in Barcelona. Even in the prewar years agents
             provocateurs, either hired or encouraged by the police and civil governors,
             planted bombs in Barcelona to provide an excuse for crackdowns on the union
             movement. A network of informers extended through the city, parasitizing the
             labor movement like lice. In unruly periods, of course, they had their work cut
             out for them; in lean periods, these elements learned to create their own
             “incidents” and generate a demand for their services. One of the most
             notorious examples in its day was the Rull family—Juan Rull, his brothers, and
             his mother—who for years had set oﬀ bombs in Barcelona and collected fees
             from the police for spurious information on the “perpetrators” of these
             “Anarchist outrages.” As an informer, Juan Rull had access to the ears of three
             civil governors; indeed, there is compelling evidence that he was in the pay of
             high clerical politicians like Eusebio Guell. Rull’s arrest in July 1907 produced
             a scandal that lingered beyond his execution in August, a year later. On that
             day, a bomb went oﬀ on a main boulevard of Barcelona. Nearby, a note was
             found declaring that Rull was innocent and that the bombings would continue
             despite his death—which, to many, meant that it was not one rtlftn or his
             family but an entire syndrome that lay at the root of Barcelona ‘saten tados.
               The outbreak of the First World War found neutral Spain—and particularly
             Barcelona—infested by adventurers, criminals, and mercenaries. At ﬁrst living
             on opportunities for espionage, these elements soon began to thrive on the
             frayed nerves of the Catalan bourgeoisie and on the Barcelona police
             department’s growing demand for hired assassins. Perhaps the most
             sensational example of these sinister connections was revealed in the pages of
             Solidaridad Obrera on June 8, 1918, when Pestana published evidence that a
131 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             district police chief, Manuel Bravo Portillo, was operating a German
             espionage ring in the port area. Although Pestana’s charges were to cost
             Bravo his job, the captain general, Milans del Bosch, recruited his services in
             the early street war with the CNT.
               During his years in the police department, Bravo had served in the volatile
             Atarazanas quarter of the city, where the brutality of his methods had made
             him a particular object of detestation among the Barcelona workers. With the
             outbreak of the February-March general strike the ex-police oﬀicer and his
             cronies, in close association with a self-styled “Baron Koenig,” were given a
             monthly stipend of about $6,000 to perform special services for the
             employers. Their jobs included atentados against CNT oﬀicials and union
             activists. There seems to be little doubt that men from Bravo’s gang murdered
             Sabater. Bravo, in turn, did not survive the summer. On September 15, at
             noon, he was shot down fn the Calle de Santa Tecla. Two days afterward, one
             of his most detested agents, Eduardo Ferrer, a former leader in the
             metallurgical union, was killed. News of Bravo’s assassination produced a
             carnival atmosphere in Barcelona. Buenacasa tells us that “thousands of
             workers celebrated the event with banquets, singing, and speeches on the
             subject.”
               The gang, however, did not disappear. It was taken over by the “Baron,” a
             foreign adventurer who lacked even the residual social and national loyalties
             Bravo had possessed. “Koenig” (his real name may have been Coleman) was
             simply out for what he could get. He extorted “protection” money from the
             individual employers; those who refused to pay became victims of “Anarchist
             outrages,” whether they had particularly outraged the Anarchists or not. The
             situation began to get out of hand when the “Baron” became involved in
             disputes within the Employers’ Federation itself. Accordingly, in the late
             spring of 1920, he was quietly expelled from Spain and his gang dissolved.
               The work of the Bravo-Koenig gang had already been taken up on a broader
             scale before the “Baron” disappeared. In December 1919, the Carlist Ramon
             Sales founded the sindicato libre (free union) at the Ateneo, Legitimista in
             Barcelona. Patronized by the church and employers, the new body—whatever
             the sincerity of many of its founders and followers, who may have been “pureand-simple” trade unionists—was used to divide the labor movement.
             Recruiting its membership from the more religious, more conservative, or
             simply more opportunistic strata of the working class, it made very little
             headway against the CNT. But it provided a new reservoir oipistoleros and an
             ideological covering for professional gunmen in the union’s cadres.
             Superﬁcially, the battle in Barcelona now took on the appearance of an interunion rivalry waged with revolvers in hand.
               To worsen a rapidly deteriorating situation, in November 1920 the captain
             general of Catalonia, Severino Martinez Anido, was appointed civil governor,
             replacing Carlos Bas. This appointment, as Brenan notes,
                 was an act of deﬁance to all moderate and humane opinion in the
                 country. His disagreement with Bas was due to the fact that he had
                 supported extra-legal means for dealing with terrorism: he is said to
                 have shown Bas a list of 675 syndicalists whom, he declared, ought
                 to be shot outright. Unamuno describes him as follows: “The man is
132 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
                 a pure brute—he can’t even talk, he can only roar and bray, though
## his roars and brays always mean something.”

               The Anarchists, in turn, attempted to regroup their own forces. There can
             be little doubt that increasingly violent elements began to inﬂuence the
             direction of the CNT, although professional gunmen were rarely to be found in
             an organization whose resources were slim and whose members were bitterly
             persecuted.[30] The remarks of Buenacasa on this state of aﬀairs convey the
             disgust that the more staid Anarchists felt over their inability to arrest the
             trend toward atentados. Buenacasa complains that few of the atentados were
             revolutionary acts. “The unions,” he concludes, “were unable to shake oﬀ
             these pistoleros who were acting on their own and who in a few cases were
             able to seize the leadership of important committees of the organization.”
               Yet by this time, the Anarchists may very well have had no choice: with
             Martinez Anido at the helm, any failure to resist might have been more
             demoralizing than the rampant gunplay. To all appearances the new civil
             governor and the Employers’ Federation were waging a war of extermination
             against the CNT. A distinguished conservative politician, Burgos y Mazo,
             leaves no doubt that the blame for the crisis in Barcelona belonged to the
             ruling classes. “It must be said in all clarity,” he emphasizes, “without fear,
             and in due tribute to truth: the employer class and other leading elements in
             Barcelona were the principle culprits of this horrible social state today.”
               An incredible situation now began to unfold in Barcelona: the atentados of
             the employers’ pistoleros were matched, almost victim for victim, by the
             atentados of the Anarchists. Nothing quite like this macabre bookkeeping had
             occurred before. Following an attempt on Segui’s life on January 4, 1920, the
             Anarchists responded with atentados against the president of the Employers’
             Federation, one of its directors, and two police agents. Atentados now began
             to occur almost regularly, alternating between the two sides like the
             movement of a pendulum. By the autumn of 1920, there was one nearly every
             day. One of the most senseless atrocities occurred on the night of September
             12, when a bomb exploded in a working-class dance hall on the Paralelo,
             killing three and wounding twenty. A month later, the head of a metallurgical
             ﬁrm, E. Tarrida, was assassinated. This was followed two weeks later by the
             death of Jaime Pujal, president of the Association of Electrical Employers.
               The arrest of sixty-four CNT oﬀicials on November 20 led to a general
             protest strike. On November 23, Martinez Anido responded by outlawing the
             labor federation and reestablishing censorship. Three days later, the president
             of the sindicato libre of Reus was killed. His death was followed the very next
             day by the assassination of Jose Canela, an important member of the Regional
             Committee of the CNT. The authorities and pistoleros did not spare even the
             attorneys of the labor federation: the lawyer Luis Companys was arrested and
             shortly afterward his colleague, the popular Republican deputy Francisco
             Layret, was murdered.
               The pistol war claimed victims not only from the Employers’ Federation, the
             unions, and the police, but from the highest summits of the government. In
             1920, the civil governor of Catalonia, the Conde de Salvatierra, who had
             presided over the lockout of late 1919 and early 1920, fell before the guns of
             Anarchist pistoleros. On March 8, 1921, the Conservative premier, Eduardo
133 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Dato, was killed by three Catalan Anarchists in reprisal for restoring the Ley
             de fugas (Law of Flight), a disgusting practice in which the police killed
             arrested syndicalists, claiming they were shot while “trying to escape.” For its
             part, the CNT paid a corresponding price with the death of Evelio Baal, the
             general secretary of the National Committee, killed at dawn on June 15,
             minutes after having been released by the police. His companion, Antonio
             Feliu, another National Committee member, managed to escape this attempt,
             but was shot down two weeks later.
                Between 1918 and 1923, this systematic slaughter claimed about nine
             hundred lives in Barcelona alone and about 1,500 throughout Spain. A
             premier, two former civil governors, an Archbishop, nearly 300 employers,
             factory directors, foremen, and police, and many workers and their leaders in
             the sindicato libre, fell before the bullets and bombs of Anarchist action
             groups. The CNT, in turn, lost many outstanding members of its national,
             regional, and local committees. In the end, the labor organization paid a
             heavier price than its opponents. “Assassinations in the public streets,” writes
             Buenacasa, “followed the authoritarian persecution of the state; the very best
             of our cadre was threatened with this dilemma: die, kill, ﬂee or fall in prison.
             The violent ones defended and killed; the stoic died and also the brave ... the
             cowards or prudent ﬂed or hid; the most active wound up in prison.”
                A failure of nerve was already evident in the late summerof 1920, when the
             CNT leadership began one of those curious ﬂirtations with the bureacracy of
             the UGT from which the Anarchosyndicalist union invariably emerged with
             bitter misgivings. Pressured to the point of near-panic by the employer
             oﬀensive in Barcelona, the moderates of’ the National Committee and Catalan
             Regional Committee decided to solicit the UGT for a common defense pact.
                In itself, such a pact would have been a meaningless achievement for the
             CNT unless it opened the way to a joint general strike. The UGT had no
             resources in Catalonia and was faced with very little prospect of repression in
             its own strongholds, despite the increasingly reactionary policies of the Dato
             ministry in Madrid. Indeed the Socialists had everything to gain by a pact
             with the CNT: the Russian Revolution had deeply divided their party. A large
             percentage of the Socialist membership had veered to the left, committing the
             party to adherence to the Communist International. The reformists in the
             party and the UGT needed all the revolutionary camouﬂage they could
             acquire, and nothing seemed better, at this point, than the prestige of a pact
             with the militant Anarchosyndicalist union.
                Having received a favorable nod from the Madrid Socialists, Segui, Boal,
             and Quemades hastened to the Spanish capital and conferred with Largo
             Caballero, Cordero, Fernandez, de los Toyos, and Martinez Gil. On September
             3, 1920, these moderates signed a pact which advanced a demand for the
             restoration of constitutional guarantees. The defensivness of the wording is
             astonishing: “We, the declared enemies of bourgeois society constitute
             ourselves as the defenders of its laws.” From this coterie, the Spanish
             bourgeoisie had little to fear, and it is testimony to the stupidity of the ruling
             classes that they made little eﬀort to coopt the ready and waiting reformist
             leaders in both labor organizations. Rather, the Conservative government of
             Eduardo Dato hardened its attitude and prepared to do battle, if any was
             really necessary.

               The pact produced an angry uproar in the CNT Regional Committees
             outside of Catalonia, all the more because the National Committee and the
             Catalan leadership had consulted with no one in undertaking it. Under
             pressure from the regions, a plenum was held in October, where the
             agreement was roundly attacked. It was decided to withhold public criticism
             of the pact owing to a strike of the Rio Tinto miners, where CNT-UGT
             collaboration was desperately needed.
               But the strike was to gain absolutely nothing from the pact. The conﬂict in
             the Rio Tinto, a rich copper district in Andalusia, was one of the most bitter,
             and certainly one of the most poignant disputes in the history of the Spanish
             labor movement. The mines were owned by British interests. They had been
             acquired for a preposterously low sum decades earlier, when the national
             wealth of Spain had been placed on the open market for foreign exploitation.
             The strike, which began in June 1920, was led by the CNT. Although strong
             UGT unions existed in the area, the Anarchosyndicalists and Socialists
             regarded each other with deep suspicion. But this inﬁghting was
             overshadowed by the desperate lengths to which the miners had gone to win
             their struggle; at the time of the pact, the majority of them had sold all their
             personal possessions and gone to live in the towns rather than yield to the
             employers. There was talk among the strikers of seizing the mines and the
             oﬀices of the mine owners. The dramatic features of this struggle aroused the
             working class throughout Spain. Andalusia was on the brink of a general
             strike in sympathy with the miners, a move that would have gained wide
             support in the north had the two labpr organizations been prepared for
             militant action.
               But this movement came to nothing. A delegation of CNT and UGT leaders
             went to the Rio Tinto to examine the problem at ﬁrst hand. On their return,
             the UGT leaders could suggest little more than an assessment of one peseta
             per week on the membership of the two organizations in support of the
             miners. An earlier CNT proposal for a joint general strike, to be initiated by
             UGT miners and railway workers, had been rejected by the Madrid Socialists.
             The problem was resolved for the moderates in both unions when the miners,
             after striking for four months, returned to work in defeat.
               By now the pact was in shreds. It was to be eliminated completely when a
             general strike broke out in Barcelona over the arrests of the CNT leaders and
             the assassination of Layret. Once again the CNT called upon the UGT for
             support. Not only was aid refused but it was denied with an arrogance that
             clearly indicated the Socialists had lost all interest in future collaboration
             with the CNT. The responsibility for making this evident was left to Largo
             Caballero, who, when he asked why the UGT workers in the Basque province
             of Vizcaya had not been called out to aid the Catalans, answered: “Because
             we are not obliged to do so.” As Buenacasa tells the story, the
             Anarchosyndicalists of Bilbao, the great Basque industrial city, on leaving
             Largo Caballero, “told him energetically: ‘In spite of this there will be a strike
             in Vizcaya.’ But Largo Caballero, top representative of the UGT, sent
             dispatches to Bilbao telling his’ followers that if the anarchists and
             syndicalists try to paralyze the work in the factories, mines, etc., they should
             be beaten with cudgels.”
               The strike in Catalonia collapsed and, with it, any prospect of collaboration

             between the two unions for years to come.
                The CNT at this time was plagued not only by bitter harassment at the
             hands of the authorities but also by the divisive activities of the Communists,
             who were determined either to control the labor organization or to split it. In
             Catalonia, Andalusia, and other regions, sharp inﬁghting between
             Communists and Anarchists dissipated much of the union’s energies. The
             Communists were defeated not merely by the weight of Anarchist inﬂuence in
             the CNT, but by a general revival of the labor movement, which temporarily
             lifted the heavy atmosphere of defeat and isolation that nourished internecine
             ﬁghting. In April 1922, constitutional guarantees were restored for the ﬁrst
             time in nearly a year and a half. A walkout of the teamsters in Barcelona
             turned into a general strike of nearly all the transport workers of Catalonia.
             The CNT, reemerging from a harassed clandestinity, managed to hold a
             successful national conference on June 11 in Saragossa. The forty-two
             delegates who attended the conference broke all ties with the Communist
             International. Dominated largely by the moderates in the CNT, the conference
             expressed its support of Segui’s participation in the mixed commission and
             passed a resolution favoring salaries for union oﬀicials. To still further
             exacerbate the diﬀerences between the Anarchist and Syndicalist tendencies
             within the confederation, the conference approved a vaguely phrased
             “political” resolution, largely conciliatory in tone towards the Socialists and
             liberals, that implied the possibility of CNT electoral blocks with parties that
             favored the restoration and extension of civil liberties. As it turned out, this
             was to be the last major national gathering of the union in Spain until the
             declaration of the Second Republic. Already Primo de Rivera stood in the
             wings, and events were moving the scenery into place for a dictatorship that
             would last more than six years.
                As if to symbolize the end of the postwar era, on March 10, 1923, Salvador
             Segui and a companion, Francisco Comas, were shot down in Barcelona’s
             Calle de la Cadena. The assassination occurred during the busiest part of the
             day, when the street was ﬁlled with people. Segui’s death, at the age of thirtythree, removed the most important and inﬂuential spokesman for “restraint”
             in the CNT. The syndicalists in the great labor organization, producing no
             worthy successor to Segui, were for some time relegated to a secondary role.
             But with the disarray produced in Anarchist groups by the dictatorship, they
             returned to the foreground.
                Although Segui ranks high in the pantheon of Anarchosyndicalist martyrs,
             his contribution to the CNT is diﬀicult to evaluate. He was born of workingclass parents in industrial Lleida on December 23, 1890. The family moved to
             Barcelona while he was still a child, and here, in the streets of the proletarian
             quarters, he formed the earthy competence and aggressive temperament that
             were to rriake him one of the CNT’s most capable organizers. This
             “instinctivo” pf the streets, whose employment in a sugar reﬁnery earned him
             the life-long nickname of “Noi del Sucre” (“Sugar-boy”), was also an admirer
             of Nietzschean individualism, of the superhombre to whom “all is permitted.”
             At an early age, Segui was sent oﬀ to work as a house painter and was drawn
             into the labor movement. He took an active part in the “Tragic Week” and
             became a refugee from the repression that followed. His life thereafter
             centered almost entirely around the movement—a sequence of meetings,
136 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             propaganda tours, negotiations, conferences, and hard committee work in
             preparing strikes.
               Although Segui was familiar with Anarchist and Socialist writings, he
             remained above all a practical organizer to whom comunismo libertario (he
             regarded himself as an Anarchosyndicalist) remained a distant ideal.
             Revolution, in his eyes, seemed primarily a matter of organization. A
             moderate who consistently favored collaboration, with the UGT, he became a
             target of bitter criticism by Anarchist militants, who detested his policies
             while admiring his administrative talents. In turn, he regarded them as
             “doctrinaires” whose lack of “realism” endangered the development of a
             mass, united labor movement. Accordingly, Segui always came to the fore
             whenever balm was needed to quiet the restive ranks of the CNT. He was one
             of the architects of the Pact of Saragossa; a proponent of the Mixed
             Commission (in which he participated with great earnestness); the ideal
             negotiator in agreements with employers and with UGT bureaucrats.
               It was Segui who, almost single-handedly, persuaded the Barcelona workers
             to return to their jobs during the general strike of 1919, when the
             “Canadiense” was facing bankruptcy and the manufacturers were in full
             retreat. As it turned out, he was wrong in much of the advice he oﬀered.
             Although words like “compromise,” “restraint,” and “moderation” evoke a
             certain reverence in many quarters, they never truly belonged to the
             vocabulary of the Spanish bourgeoisie. For his attempt to promote
             compromise and restrain violence, St’0ui was humiliated by the intransigence
             of the Catalan manufacturers—and probably murdered by their pistoleros.
               Ironically, the men who were to avenge Segui’s assassination were the very
             human types he fought so vigorously in the CNT. On May 17, 1923, Anarchist
             pistoleros from Barcelona assassinated Fernando Gonzalez Regueral, the
             former governor of Vizcaya. Three weeks later, on June 11, they killed
             Cardinal Juan Soldevila y Romero, the Archbishop of Saragossa. Both men
             were notorious reactionaries who bitterly opposed the unions. They were
             killed by members of the “Solidarios,” a group of young Anarchists whose
             practices and outlook were antithetical in almost every respect to those of the
             man they avenged.
               We must pause here to look closely at this Anarchist action group, for in
             many ways it typiﬁes the grupo de aﬁnidad that was later to exercise so much
             inﬂuence in the FAI. Many such small Anarchist groups had been in existence
             as far back as the 1890s. The “Solidarios,” and others like “El Crisol,” which
             acquired a certain fame, were formed late in 1920 or early in 1921, when the
             Syndicalist Youth was established for the purpose of dealing with the
             pistoleros of the sindicato libre. Ricardo Sanz, who belonged to the
             “Solidarios,” tells us that they were young people, the majority under twentyﬁve years of age, who had been drawn to Barcelona from diﬀerent regions of
             Spain. These youths, “spontaneous in principle, felt themselves ever more tied
             morally to the group,” writes Sanz,
                 and there were many of them, those who might be called direct
                 collaborators, who felt themselves by right, not only in fact as
## components of the group.

                 All the components of the group were workers and, therefore, lived
137 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
                  on their daily wages. The group had no other income in any sense,
## but it also had no other expenditures; this was covered by
                  arrangements according to the capabilities of each one of its
                  members. Thine and mine hardly existed among the members of this
                  group—in any case, not when it was a matter of activities related to
                  the collective plan. Individually, each member of the group was free
                  to do what he felt convenient, it being well understood that the
                  activity was not in contradiction with the purity of the ideas.[31]
                The “Solidarios” included a famous threesome—Buenaventura Durruti, his
             close friend Francisco Ascaso, and Juan Garcia Oliver— whose collaboration
             as “Los Tres Mosqueteros” was to acquire almost legendary proportions. In
             time, the group came to be known as much by Durruti’s name as by the one it
             originally adopted. According to Sanz, however, neither Durruti, Ascaso, nor
             Garcia Oliver were regarded as leaders. The “Solidarios” were a “group of
             individuals,” he emphasizes, among whom “no one was more or less important
             than any other.”
                Accordingly, the “Solidarios” resembled a community rather than a
             cdhventional political organization. To fully understand the close personal
             relationships within this typical grupo de aﬁnidad, we must try to compare it
             with the type of organization favored by the Socialists and Communists. A
             Marxian party consisted of a hierarchical cadre—a bureaucracy composed of
             paid oﬀicials—forming a distinct, clearly deﬁned chain of command. The
             Communists, and to a lesser extent the Socialists, demanded obedience ﬀom
             those below. Authority was vested in a supreme executive body which made
             all decisions of policy and administration in the interims between party
             congresses.
                The party’s complex cadre was ﬂeshed out by a well-disciplined
             membership, each individual marching in step with the others in accordance
             with the decisions of the party congresses and leading committees. The
             preferred type of relationship within this political army verged on the
             impersonal. Although it would have been impossible for individuals in any
             group exposed to some degree of persecution not to feel a kinship for each
             other, Marxists tended to stress the value of morally and emotionally neutral
             ties within their organizations. Today’s comrade might well be tomorrow’s
             political foe or factional opponent. “Scientiﬁc socialism” demanded a certain
             detachment toward people and ideas, a severe rationalism that could prevail
             over passions, impulses, and personal intimacy. One owed one’s primary
             loyalties to the party, that is to say, to its apparatus, not to those who shared
             one’s struggles, risks, and responsibilities.
                The Anarchists were genuinely horriﬁed by this arrangement. They
             regarded it as passionless, soulless, even morally indecent. The revolution for
             them was, above all, a great moral transformation which was expected to
             liberate individuals, to restore their freedom and spontaneity of development.
             Individuals had to be remade, not merely as producers of goods but as new
             totalities, free to take full command of their destiny and daily life. Any lesser
             goal was not worth ﬁghting for. Accordingly, the Anarchists regarded the
             Marxist party as another statist form, a hierarchy that, if it succeeded in
             “seizing power,” would preserve the power of one human being over another,
138 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             the authority of the leader over the led. The Marxist party, in their eyes, was a
             mirror image of the very society it professed to oppose, an invasion of the
             camp of the revolution by bourgeois values, methods, and structures.
                The Marxists argued that their organizational forms gave them greater
             eﬀiciency and eﬀectiveness, a claim the Anarchists emphatically denied. To
             the contrary, they insisted that the most eﬀicient and eﬀective organization
             was ultimately based on voluntarism, not on coercion or formal obedience. A
             movement that sought to promote a liberatory revolution had to develop
             liberatory and revolutionary forms. This meant, as we already have noted,
             that it had to mirror the free society it was trying to achieve, not the
             repressive one it was trying to overthrow. If a movement sought to achieve a
             world united by solidarity and mutual aid, it had to be guided by these
             precepts; if it sought a decentralized, stateless, nonauthoritarian society, it
             had to be structured in accordance with these goals. With voluntaristic aims
             in mind, the Anarchists tried to build an organic movement in which
             individuals were drawn to each other by a sense of “aﬀinity,” by like interests
             and proclivities, not held together by bureaucratic tendons and ideological
             abstractions. And just as individual revolutionaries were drawn together into
             groups freely, by “aﬀinity,” so too the individual groups federated by voluntary
             agreement, never impairing the exercise of initiative and independence of
             will.
                It will be recalled that the Anarchists continually stressed the importance of
             education and the need to live by Anarchist precepts—the need, indeed, to
             create a countersociety that could provide the space for people to begin to
             remake themselves. Accordingly, they placed a great deal of emphasis on
             leisure and moral excellence. The Socialists were despised because their
             demands focused primarily on wage increases and material improvements.
             Far more important, in the Anarchists eyes, was the need to shorten working
             hours so that, as Anselmo Lorenzo argued, people “would have the liberty in
             which to think, to study ... to satisfy their moral instincts.” This type of
             language—words like “liberty” and “moral instincts”—was alien to the
             Socialist and Communist parties. In Saragossa, the Anarchists developed a
             proletarian following that was unique in the history of revolutionary
             movements. These Aragonese workers began to emphasize moral, political,
             humanistic struggles over economic ones. As E.H. Carr has observed, their
             strikes “were characterized by their scorn for economic demands and the
             toughness of their revolutionary solidarity: strikes for comrades in prison
             were more popular than strikes for better conditions.
                The “Solidarios” were to stand out among other grupos de aﬁnidad by virtue
             of the scope and boldness of their escapades. In other respects, however, they
             were typical of the Anarchist action groups operating in Spain at the time.
             There can be little doubt that they— and others like them—terriﬁed many men
             in the government who were guilty of major crimes against the labor
             movement. On this score, the case of Martinez Anido is revealing. After ruling
             Barcelona for two years in a manner that had completely shocked public
             opinion throughout Spain, this brutal soldier was ﬁnally dismissed in 1922.
             One of the immediate causes of his departure was characteristic of his
             administration as a whole: it had been found that while Angel Pestana was
             recovering from wounds inﬂicted by the civil governor’s pistgleros, another
139 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             group of Anido’s gunmen was stationed outside the hospital with orders to
             shoot the Anarchist as soon as he emerged. The story was given wide
             publicity. By now, a more moderate Conservative government, again headed
             by Sanchez de Toca, had come into oﬀice, intent on achieving political
             reforms. With Martinez Anido’s dismissal there now began a remarkable
             pursuit in which the “Solidarios” tried to track down this man in order, as
             Sanz puts it, to “settle accounts.”
               Anido simply went underground. In May 1923, the “Solidarios,” armed with
             submachine guns and bombs, tracked him to San Sebastian, but he had ﬂed to
             La Coruna, where they pursued him again. Martinez Anido then disappeared
             completely. Although a general in the army and ex-governor of Catalonia, this
             worthy was forced to remain underground until the pistolero threat had been
             largely removed by repression.
               While the hunt was going on, the “Solidarios” succeeded in locating Ramon
             Laguia, one of the chief pistoleros of the sindicato libre, whom they severely
             wounded in a cafe in Manresa. It was around this period that they also
             assassinated the ex-governor of Vizcaya and the Archbishop-Cardinal of
             Saragossa. The atentados against these dignitaries were followed by several
             daring robberies, the most famous of which occurred on September 1, 1923,
             when a group of “Solidarios” held up the Bank of Gijon, making oﬀ with over
             600,000 pesetas. The raid produced a sensation throughout Spain and ranks
             as one of the largest “expropriations” of its day.
               In the meantime, the Anarchist action groups were preparing an
             insurrection against the newly installed Primo de Rivera dictatorship. Arms
             were desperately needed. There now began a series of fantastic escapades in
             which tons of weapons were manufactured or shunted around under the very
             eyes of the police with a courage and bravado that would have seemed
             possible only in Spain of that time—and perhaps only among the Spanish
             Anarchists. The “Solidarios” bought an iron foundry in the Pueblo Nuevo
             district of Barcelona and put it to work manufacturing grenades and bombs.
             Some six thousand of these weapons were cached away in the Pueblo Seco
             district before they were discovered by the police—who must have been
             astonished by the group’s audacity. In addition, the group deposited caches of
             riﬂes and pistols in almost every neighborhood of Barcelona. A regular arms
             traﬀic was organized in which weapons bought in Belgium and France were
             transported clandestinely into Spain through the frontier town of Puigcerda
             or shipped in by sea.[32]
               In October 1923, as the day of the uprising approached, the group managed
             to buy 1,000 riﬂes and 200,000 cartridges from the ﬁrm of Garate y Anitua in
             the town of Eibar. The insurrection never came oﬀ, at least not in October,
             and the weapons remained in the ﬁrm’s warehouse. Later, the “Solidarios”
             shunted them to a warehouse in Barcelona, where they lay for months while
             Anarchists in the city negotiated with Catalan nationalists over how to use
             this deadly largesse. When the two groups fell out, the weapons were sent
             back to Eibar where the manufacturer accepted them as “returned
             merchandise.” It is testimony to the astonishing eﬀectiveness of the Anarchist
             action group that the purchase, movement, and storage of 1,000 riﬂes and
             200,000 cartridges during a period of military dictatorship was never
             discovered by the police.

                The “Solidarios,” in fact, had by this time developed into a far-ﬂung
             libertarian enterprise. A partial list shows that there were at least thirty
             members, many of whom were prepared to leave Barcelona at a moment’s
             notice for an “action” elsewhere in Spain. Besides traﬀicking in thousands of
             weapons, operating a grenade foundry! and staging carefully planned
             “actions.” they were a source of considerable funds for various libertarian
             projects. Their “expropriations” sustained Ferrer-type schools. Anarchist
             printing presses, and a large publishing enterprise in Paris which produced
             the Anarchist Enciclopedia, as well as many books, pamphlets and periodicals.
             The group included men like Durruti, whose prestige by now was enormous,
             but if we are to believe Sanz, it had no leaders and no hierarchy.
                Durruti earned his prestige; it was entirely the result of his personal
             courage and obvious ability. There was nothing in his background that made
             him distinctive: like everyone else in the group, he was a worker, perhaps
             with a-slightly better than average education. Born in the city of Leon in July
             1896, of working-class parents, Durruti became an apprentice in a machine
             shop at the age of fourteen. Four years later he began work as a motor
             mechanic in a railway shop, where he joined the UGT and became active in
             the labor movement. His father had been a Socialist and Durruti seemed at
             ﬁrst to be following the same political path. But he was a combative young
             man, attracted by the militancy of the CNT, and at the time of the August
             1917 general strike he shifted his allegiance to the Anarchosyndicalist union.
             With the repression and black-listing of union militants that followed the
             defeat, Durruti left Leon to seek work further north on the Atlantic coast in
             Gijon. There he was befriended by Buenacasa and instructed in Anarchist
             ideas by the older, more experienced revolutionary.
                By this time Durruti had reached twenty-one, the age of obligatory military
             service. He left Spain for Paris, wliere he met the Anarchist luminaries of the
             French capital and became increasingly involved in the libertarian movement.
             The upsurge of revolutionary activity below the Pyrenees brought him back to
             Spain after a three-year stay in France. He settled in San Sebastian,
             reestablished his contact with Buenacasa, and joined the “Justicieros,” a
             newly established Anarchist group. Looking for a more combative arena in
             which to work, Durruti then decided to move on to Barcelona. On his way to
             the Catalan seaport he stopped at Saragossa, where he picked up Francisco
             Ascaso, the man who was to be his alter ego in the years to come.
                With Durruti’s arrival in Barcelona in January 1922, the “Solidarios” began
             to take form as an action group. A prime suspect, Durruti was obliged to use
             an alias and to operate in the twilight zone of the underground. The sheer
             nerve of the man is shown by the fact that, while in Madrid at an Anarchist
             conference, he paid a visit to the imprisoned assassins of Dato, an act which
             led to arrest and months of detention. The police were eventually obliged to
             release him for lack of adequate evidence although he was involved in almost
             all the plans—and, when he was not being detained, all the actions—of the
             group he helped to form. By December 1923 Durruti’s position had become so
             precarious that it was necessary for him to leave Spain and take refuge in
             France.
                In fact, the “Solidarios” as a group was faced with dissolution. The
             atentados, bank robberies, and arms traﬀic had claimed a heavy toll of its
141 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             most militant and active members. Ascaso was in prison for the assassination
             of Soledevila, although he soon made a daring escape, returning by rail to
             Barcelona disguised as a train Conductor and then making his way to Durruti
             in Paris. Eusebio Brau had been killed in the aftermath of the Gijon robbery
             and Rafael Torres Escartin was jailed and also accused of participating in the
             atentado against the Cardinal. In February 1924, the secret police (according
             to Sanz) had murdered Gregorio Suberbiela and Manuel Campos, two
             members of the “Solidarios.” Garcia Oliver and Figueras were imprisoned;
             Sanz and Alfonso, although still in Barcelona, were in and out of jail. The high
             point of the atentados and “expropriations” had passed and a new period was
             emerging, deﬁned increasingly by the military dictatorship of Primo de
             Rivera.
               What had the Anarchist pistoleros achieved? Were the atentados simply
             futile gestures, blind provocations that played into the hands of the
             authorities, who wanted nothing more than excuses to crack down on the
             CNT? This is the prevailing opinion among contemporary historians, while
             even most Spanish Anarchists today deal with the subject defensively and
             touch upon Durruti’s illegal activities with the utmost reticence. Yet this
             approach, like so much that is written about Spain, must be regarded as an
             oversimpliﬁcation. However one chooses to assess the political consequences
             of the assassinations of Canovas in 1897 and of Canalejas in 1912, the fact
             remains that these atentados removed two of the shrewdest premiers in the
             modern history of Spain. They occurred in critical times—the period leading
             into the Spanish-American War and the exhaustion of Tumismo before the
             First World War—when decisive statecraft was needed to deal with a
             disintegrating political situation. The deaths of Canovas and Canalejas
             produced a serious vacuum in the leadership of the Spanish state. Most of the
             premiers who followed them were utterly incapable of dealing with the crisis
             and antagonisms that developed in Spanish society.
               When the Catalan manufacturers turned to pistolerismo after the First
             World War, there could be no other answer than the counter-pistolerismo of
             the Anarchists. This macabre interplay becomes evident from an examination
             of Segui’s attempt to promote a moderate trade-union approach within the
             CNT. Segui’s approach clearly prevailed for a time: the union cut short the
             general strike of 1919; it joined the Mixed Commission, participating in it
             with the utmost seriousness; it followed a policy of collaborating with the
             UGT, even subordinating itself to Socialist policy in the August general strike.
             The employers, on the other hand, merely used the truce in the general strike
             of 1919 to mobilize their forces and launch a ﬁerce counteroﬀensive against
             the union; they made a mockery of the Mixed Commission; and the Socialists
             turned their backs on the Anarchosyndicalists as soon as they were called
             upon to act resolutely.
               For all its shortcomings, pistolerismo and a militant Anarchist policy in the
             CNT emerged as a result of defeats suﬀered by the moderate trade-union
             wing. A policy based on acquiescence would have demoralized the labor
             organization completely. The Anarchist pistoleros showed the more militant
             workers in Barcelona that in a period when the employers seemed to have a
             completely free hand, a force on their behalf was still alive, eﬀectively
             answering blow for blow.
142 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
               Finally, the Anarchist militants were not interested in “social peace” or in a
             restful period of trade-union growth. They regarded bourgeois society as
             incurably diseased. In their view, the opportunism of Largo Caballero and the
             reforms of Sanchez de Toca were simply half-hearted eﬀorts to preserve a
             fundamentally sick society. Better to reveal the disease, to use the scalpel in
             removing the spreading infection, than to conceal the sores of the social
             system. The terrorism of the Spanish Anarchists was designed not only to
             keep alive the spirit of revolt and to provoke the Spanish bourgeoisie, but to
             undermine the stability of the social system. Thus emerged a policy of
             “destabilizing” capitalism which, as the 1930s were to show, catapulted Spain
             into social revolution. As we shall see, the Anarchists actually succeeded in
             getting the revolution they wanted. Without them, it is very doubtful if there
             would have been one in 1936. If their revolution failed, it was not for want of
             any eﬀort to produce one.
             Chapter Nine: From Dictatorship to Republic
             The Primo de Rivera Dictatorship
               On September 13, 1923, General Miguel Primo de Rivera, the ^captain
             general of Catalonia (a post to which he had been appointed during the
             previous year), proclaimed himself military dictator of Spain, bringing to an
             end the parliamentary oligarchy Sagasta had labored to create in the 1870s.
               The dictatorship was the culmination of a period of growing disenchantment
             with the army and with the role of the monarchy in the couritry’s political
             aﬀairs. The army had proven itself grossly incompetent. Two years earlier, in
             June 1921, a large column in Spanish Morocco, advancing under the
             command of General Silvestre from Melilla to Alhucemas, was ambushed at
             Annual and virtually destroyed by a smaller force of Riﬀ tribesmen. Ten
             thousand were killed, four thousand captured, and all the column’s equipment
             lost to the Riﬀs. In the following two weeks the Riﬀs took the Spanish-fortiﬁed
             posts at Monte Arrut, reaching the outskirts of Medilla before they were
             stopped. Silvestre’s advance, at ﬁrst widely touted as a bold stroke against
             the Riﬀs, turned into a nightmarish route that threatened the Spanish
             presence in North Africa.
               The entire country knew that the king was deeply implicated in these
             disasters. Silvestre, who perished in the Riﬀ ambush, had been a protege of
             Alfonso. The king encouraged the advance in the hope that bold military
             successes in Morocco would strengthen his position against the Cortes. A
             damning dispatch from the monarch to Silvestre advised the ill-fated
             commander to “do as I tell you and pay no attention to the Minister of War,
             who is an imbecile.” Despite the lapse of two years between the Annual
             disaster and Primo’s pronundamiento, the out-cry over the aﬀair continued
             unabated. Fed by rumors of corruption in the army, the public had become so
             uneasy that Sanchez de Toca, the Conservative premier, was replaced by a
             Liberal, Garcia Prieto, ending the reactionary politcal pattern that had been
             foisted on Spain since 1919. A new government of “liberal concentration”
             threatened to initiate sweeping reforms, including the democratization of the
143 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             army and monarchy. While the Cortes was on summer vacation, a
             parliamentary commission of inquiry into the Moroccan defeats was sifting
             the details of army corruption, low troop morale, and the complicity of the
             king in the Annual defeat. Everyone recognized that when the Cortes
             reconvened in the autumn, the commission’s conclusions would essentially
             place the king and army on trial before public opinion.
                Primo’s dictatorship brought this crisis to an end and deﬂected public
             attention from the corruption of the army and the ambitions of the monarchy
             to the “irresponsibility” of parlimentary government. A state of martial law
             was declared, suspending the Cortes and invoking censorship of the press.
             Political parties that continued to criticize the dictatorship were suppressed.
             By oﬀeﬁng the promise of “social peace” to a public weary of social instability,
             the dictator started his rule with a certain amount of political capital. To a
             Spain overfed with parlimentary crisis and corrupt politicians, Primo’s simple
             patriotism and amateurism became attractive qualities. A pleasure-loving
             Andalusian rake, Primo functioned by “intuition”; his speeches, gestures, and
             public behavior were marked by an embarrassing frankness which often
             mixed maudlin eﬀusiveness with provincial canniness. “I have no experience
             in government,” he declared, not without honesty. “Our methods are as simple
             as they are ingenuous.” And he proved this by working at ﬁts and starts at the
             most irregular hours, lecturing the Spaniards endlessly on a motley
             assortment of personal matters, and correcting social abuses suﬀered by
             “little people” when they came under his purview. This paternalistic style was
             displayed at the very outset of his regime when, in a grand gesture, he
             redeemed the pawn shop receipts of the Madrid poor with surpluses from his
             ﬁrst budget.
                To organize mass support for the dictatorship, Primo established a loose,
             rambling organization, the Patriotic Union (UP), which attacked individualism,
             democracy, and intellectualism, stressing obedience to social institutions and
             a pragmatic political philosophy. In the mid-1920s this program seemed like
             nothing less than fascism. Primo, in fact, expressed an admiration for
             Mussolini and adopted the external trappings and verbal style of the Italian
             dictator. His bluﬀ soldierly traits and his regime’s denial of democratic
             process alienated Liberal opinion. Driven into exile more by disgust than by
             physical violence, Liberail and Republican dissidents slowly collected on the
             French side of the frontier and occupied themselves, with plots against the
             dictatorship. But Primo de Rivera was not a fascist and his UP was not a
             fascist movement. The dictatorship existed by suﬀerance of the monarchy and
             the army, which supported it as a last ditch alternative to the democratization
             of both institutions. The destiny of the monarchy was now tied to that of the
             dictatorship, for Alfonso would never be forgiven by Liberal opinion for
             validating Primo’s pronunciamiento by making the general into a premier.
             Ultimately, virtually all sections of the ruling class came to despise the new
             regime. Having assented to its establishment only in desperation, the more
             sophisticated reactionaries and monarchists were repelled by Primo’s-naivete,
             exasperated by his eccentricities, and humiliated by his crudeness.
                More signiﬁcant evidence of the regime’s nature is provided by its social
             policy—a policy that ﬁxes it more in the Bonapartist than the fascist tradition.
             Primo had no objection to an organized labor movement, provided it posed no
144 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             political challenges to his regime. His despotic benevolence allowed room for
             material concessions to the i#orking class, including government-sponsored
             medical services, modest wage increases, cheap housing, and a bureaucratic
             apparatus for labor arbitration. These policies found willing collaboration
             from the Spanish Socialist Party and the UGT. Following the logic of its
             reformist and opportunist traditions, Spanish Socialism, almost alone among
             the older political movements, worked*with the dictatorship. The UGT leaders
             entered the comites paritarios—the parity committees—in which labor,
             government, and employer representatives decided wage disputes. As
             salaried bureaucrats of the union, they found no diﬀiculty in becoming
             salaried bureaucrats of the state. Largo Caballero, muting even his
             democratic scruples, acquiesced to the regime and became a councillor of
             state. The Socialist Party (which Primo genuinely admired) preserved it
             bureaucratic apparatus or, as Carr observes, its “modern organization with
             typewriters, secretaries, burial insurance, and the Madrid cooperative... The
             UGT even enjoyed a modest increase in membership, from 208,170 in
             December 1922 to 228,501 in December 1929, shortly before the fall of the
             dictatorship.
               The Anarchists and the CNT were suppressed. Primo may have entertained
             some hope of splitting moderates from militants in the CNT; at any rate he
             waited for nearly a half year before suppressing the syndicalist labor union.
             Although moderate syndicalists such as Angel Pestana tried in various ways to
             accommodate themselves to the new state of aﬀairs, the union’s implacable
             hostility to the dictatorship had been ﬁxed at the very outset of Primo’s
             regime. On September 14, a day after Primo’s pronunciamiento, the CNT
             declared a general strike. In the absence of Socialist support and suﬀicient
             time for adequate preparation, the strike was easily suppressed by the
             military. Remarkably, despite this gesture, the union was still permitted to
             function openly.[33] On December 30, 1923, the Catalan Regional
             Confederation held a plenum at Granollers which attracted hundreds of
             workers; this was followed on May 4, 1924, by another plenum at Sabadell.
             On both occasions the u^nion reaﬀirmed its commitment to Anarchist
             principles. But time, now, was running out. Three days after the Sabadell
             plenum. Anarchist terrorists assassinated an onerous Barcelona police oﬀicial,
             one Rogelio Perez Cicario (“el ejecutor de la justicia”), whereupon’ the
             government immediately cracked down on the syndicalist labor union,
             rounding up all the CNT committee memberis and members of Anarchist
             groups it could ﬁnd. Driven underground, the CNT was to disappear from the
             public arena for the remainder of the decade.
               Yet the middle and late 1920s were not a period of total quiescence. Many
             cenetistas simply drifted into the sindicatos libres (which Primo perpetuated
             during the dictatorship), where they formed underground antidictatorial
             syndicalist nuclei. Despite the arrests of May 7, which netted many leading
             cenetistas, a National Committee of the CNT managed for a time to carry on a
             clandestine existence in Saragossa, while a Catalan Regional Committee
             survived in Mataro. Anarchist action groups, turning to more spectacular
             actions, attempted several heroic, if foolhardy, armed assaults on the
             dictatorship. These actions, almost foredoomed to failure, were largely
             symbolic. On November 6, 1924, smalt groups of militants attacked the
145 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Atarazanas barracks in Barcelona, apparantly assured that the fortress gates
             would be opened by supporters within. At the same time, a small armed band
             of Anarchist exiles in France, led by Durruti, crossed the frontier and invaded
             Vera de Bidasoa, clashing with the Civil Guard. Both attempts miscarried
             completely. In Barcelona, two captured Anarchists, Juan Montijo Aranz and
             Jose Llacer Bertran, were executed by order of a summary court martial. The
             Vera de Bidasoa episode claimed the lives of three: Juan Santillan and Enrique
             Gil, who were executed, and another condemned participant, Pablo Martin,
             who leaped to his death from the prison gallery.
                Perhaps the most renowned of the Anarchist conspiracies during the
             dictatorship was an audacious plot hatched by Durruti, Ascaso, and Grigorio
             Jover to kidnap the king’during a state visit to Paris in the summer of 1924.
             Arrested by the French police, the three “Solidarios” made no attempt to deny
             their plot; yes, they declared emphatically, they planned to hold Alfonso in
             return for the dissolution of the dictatorship. Durruti and Ascaso, who had
             been in Latin America before arriving in France, were also charged with
             holding up the Banca San Martin in Argentina. The Argentine government
             demanded that they be extradited, while the Spanish government placed its
             own bid for their extradition, citing the Gijon holdup and additionally singling
             out Ascaso for his role in the assassination of Cardinal Soldevila. The case
             became a cause celebre. A wave of protests from French intellectuals and
             workers ﬁnally succeeded in quashing the extradition proceedings. Freed a
             year later, the Anarchists were expelled from the country, later to be expelled
             from Germany at the request of the Social Democratic minister of interior of
             Prussia. Their attempts to ﬁnd refuge in Russia became untenable when the
             Soviet government imposed ideological conditions upon them which, as
             Anarchists, they could not accept. Thereafter, the exiles returned to France
             under aliases, were rearrested and held in prison for six months, and
             eventually made their way back to Germany under false identities.
                It should not be supposed that Anarchist activities during this period were
             limited only to desperate acts by a few bold militants. In May 1925, Primo
             lifted the state of martial law, and social life in Spain began to ease
             considerably. During the period that followed, Anarchist and syndicalist
             periodicals began to appear in a number of cities, particularly in the north.
             The most notable of these, ¡Despertad!, was published in Vigo and edited by
             the Galician Jose Villaverde. The paper, serving as a major link for cenetistas
             in the north, enjoyed a considerable reputation for its vigorous writing and
             high theoretical level. In addition, the CNT published Action Social Obrera in
             Girona, El Productor in Blanes, Redencion in Alcoy, and Horizontes in Elda.
             Even La Revista Blanca, which had enjoyed such a distinguished reputation in
             the previous century, was revived. In Valencia, where Anarchism was known
             for its artistic interests, Estudios devoted itself, in Jose Peirats’ words, to
             “themes on physical and human regeneration.” The individualist Anarchists,
             in collaboration with vegetarians, naturalists, hedonists, and anarcho-mystics,
             published Iniciales. In a delightful passage, Peirats tells us that these
                 extreme tendencies ﬂourished in the anarchism of those times—
                 stormy for some and times of hibernation for the majority. Secret
                 meetings in the mountains were disguised as the excursions of

                 ingenuous nudists, devotees of pure air, and sunbathers. All of this
                 forms a picturesque contrast if one bears in mind that a sincere
                 return to nature was perfectly compatible with conspiratorial
## planning, the chemistry of explosives, pistol practice, the
                 interchange or periodicals and underground leaﬂets, and campaigns
## against tobacco and alcohol.

                These preoccupations aside, the closing period of Primo’s regime was
             marked by mounting conﬂicts within the CNT. By throwing the union back
             upon itself, the dictatorship compelled moderates and militants to face the
             diﬀerences that had long divided them— diﬀerences that had often been
             obscured in the past by strikes and mass actions. Exile and life in the
             underground brought these diﬀerences increasingly to the fore. Theoretically,
             virtually every tendency in the CNT professed to accept Anarchist principles
             of one sort or another. Segui, despite his obvious reformist proclivities, had
             consistently declared his commitment to libertarian ideals; so, too, did
             Pestana, the major spokesman for the moderate tendency after Segui’s death.
             The moderates, however, regarded the realization of these ideals as a problem
             of the distant future. To Pestana and his supporters, Spain was not ready for
             an Anarchist revolution. Rarely invoking Marxist arguments, which would
             have stressed Spain’s economic backwardness, the moderates shrewdly threw
             basic libertarian principles in the teeth of their militant opponents. Not only
             did the CNT lack the support of a majority of the Spanish people, they argued,
             but it lacked the support of the majority of the Spanish working class.
             Anarchosyndicalists were a minority within a minority. Even within the CNT
             membership, a large number of workers and peasants shared only a nominal
             allegiance to libertarian ideals. They were members of the CNT because the
             union was strong in their localities and work places. If these people, and
             Spaniards generally, were not educated in Anarchist principles, warned the
             moderates, the revolution would simply degenerate into an abhorrent
             dictatorship of ideologues. Later, in a manifesto that was to split the CNT into
             two syndicalist movements, the moderates declared that the revolution must
             not rely exclusively on the “audacity of minorities, more or less brave; we
             want to see a mass movement of the people unfold, of the working class
             traveling toward deﬁnitive liberation.” As Jose Villaverde declared: “A
             libertarian communist economy can be established today. But in the political
             and moral sphere the Confederation will have to establish a dictatorship that
             is in contrast with its fundamental principles because the working class is not
             in the CNT.”
                This argument would have been incontrovertible had it remained a strategy
             for revolutionary education. But the moderates used it as a springboard for
             opportunistic politics. As early as 1924, the moderate-dominated National
             Committee of the CNT had ﬂirted with a Catalan separatist conspiracy by
             Colonel Francisco Macia, founder of the Liberal Estat Catala. Two years later,
             in June 1926, it had become involved in an abortive conspiracy known as the
             “Night of St. John,” a plot which may have been conceived by the monarchy
             itself in order to rescue its waning reputation by unseating Primo and
             reestablishing a constitutional government. Once revealed by the
             dictatorship, the plot found such reactionary generals as Wevler and Aguilera,
147 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             demagogues like Lerroux, and venal sycophants like Barriobera in the same
             conspiratorial bed with Anarchists like Amalio Quilez.
               The years 1928 and 1929 mark the period of Primo’s decline and removal
             from oﬀice. Although the dictatorship, sharing in the international economic
             boom of the 1920s, had materially improved living standards and proﬁts, it
             had antagonized virtually all sectors of Spanish society. Proposed structural
             reforms, such as the Municipal Statute of March 1924, which promised to
             give extensive autonomy to the municipalities, were stillborn, leaving the
             restive towns in the hands of government appointees. The plan of Calvo
             Sotelo, Primo’s ﬁnance minister, to introduce an eﬀective income tax
             antagonized the ﬁnancially irresponsible. The dictatorship’s rural policy was
             conﬁned largely to road-building, irrigation, and electriﬁcation projects,
             leaving the vital issue of land reform untouched; and despite the collaboration
             of the Socialists with the government, the Spanish working class did not have
             to be told that its legal organizations were the supine tools of the regime. But
             Primo made his greatest miscalculation when he alienated the most important
             pillar of his regime—the army—by challenging the seniority prerogatives of
             the artillery corps. Even Alfonso became a victim of this error. By failing to
             back the protesting oﬀicers, the king turned the artillery commanders into a
             corps of Republicans.
               Having antagonized leading ﬁnanciers as well as peasants, oﬀicers as well
             as workers, local town oﬀicials, as well as Madrid constitutionalists, Primo
             proceeded to lose whatever political support he might have gathered from the
             conservative middle classes and intellectuals. A respectable opposition within
             the towns and universities began to emerge, openly raising the cry for
             constitutional legality. Primo’s attempt to create a constitution, based on a
             sharp separation between elective and corporative powers, merely widened
             this opposition to include the Monarchists, for the constitution barred the
             king from appointing and dismissing ministries. In the spring of 1928,
             widespread student protests presented the dictatorship with its ﬁrst overt
             opposition since 1924. Under the relaxation of censorship introduced by the
             regime, the Liberal Madrid journal El Sol, commenting on the constitution,
             bluntly “advised” Primo “to abandon his post.” Not to be denied a claim to the
             “exalted defenders ... of Parliament and of public liberties,” Sanchez Guerra,
             the seventy-year-old leader of the Conservative Party, crossed the frontier into
             Spain and oﬀered his person as an umbrella of respectability for a
             prearranged pronunciatnienio by General Castro Girona, the captain general
             of Valencia. But the general reneged on the old man and arrested him. The
             plot ended in a ﬁasco; only the artillery oﬀicers at Ciudad Real revolted.
               Despite the failure of the “Valencia Conspiracy,” as this narrow-based
             abortion by old Conservative politicians was called, the dictatorship was on its
             last legs. On January 26, Primo, agonized by growing internal opposition and
             ﬁscal diﬀiculties, .circulated a query to the captain generals, asking if the
             army supported him. If it did not, averred the dictator, he would resign
             immediately. Not only were the replies less than enthusiastic, but it was
             evident to Primo that the king was determined to remove him from oﬀice. On
             January 28, 1929, two days after his query, Primo de Rivera resigned and
             departed for the ﬂeshpots of Paris, where he died a few months later. His
             place was taken by General Damaso Berenguer, a highly respected but ailing
148 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             oﬀicer who could hardly be regarded as a permanent ﬁxture in Spanish
             politics. Berenguer was entrusted with the impossible task of restoring a
             constitutional government without jeopardizing the future of the monarchy.
               The CNT did not remain aloof from the antidictatorial conspiracies that
             marked the closing period of Primo’s regime. In the course of Organizing the
             “Valencia Conspiracy,” Sanchez Guerra had approached a CNT contact
             committee in Paris, soliciting the union’s cooperation. The moderates were
             determined not to be found lagging in the antidictatorial movement, despite a
             decision by a previous plenum forbidding the CNT’s National Committee from
             negotiating with political parties. On July 28, 1928, the National Committee
             convoked a clandestine plenum in Barcelona, including delegates fron all the
             regions except for the volatile Levant, with the purpose o. authorizing
             negotiations with antidictatorial politicians and military leaders. Having
             pocketed the plenum’s authority, the National Committee joined in the
             “Valencia Conspiracy.” If we are to believe Comin Colomer, a police oﬀicial
             turned historian, whose rather unreliable historiography draws lavishly on
             police ﬁles, several syndicates supported the conspiracy with strikes. By and
             large, however, the CNT’s role seems to have been as stillborn as the
             conspiracy itself.
               Actually, the CNT contributed very little to Primo’s downfall. Its attempts to
             formulate a consistent policy in the struggle against the dictatorship are
             interesting primarily as evidence of a bitter tug-of-war between militant
             Anarchist revolutionaries and cautious syndicalist moderates. Cushioning this
             conﬂict was a centrist tendency, perhaps best represented by Manuel
             Buenacasa, which tried guardedly to achieve a compromise between the two
             wings. By controlling the National Committee, the moderates had only to
             work through the CNT’s structure to achieve a sense of unity. The union’s
             apparatus held them together. By contrast, the Anarchists were dispersed in
             small groups. The National Federation of Anarchist Groups (FNGA), founded
             in the stormy postwar years, was virtually defunct. On the initiative of Catalan
             Anarchist groups and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of the Spanish
             Language, a Marseilles-based organization of exiles, serious attempts were
             made to revive a national movement. On July 24 and 25, 1927, a clandestine
             conference of Spanish and Portuguese Anarchists was held at Valencia. To
             guard the delegates from Primo’s watchful police agents, the dates for the
             conference were selected to coincide with a ﬁesta that brought thousands of
             visitors into the Mediterranean city. Peirats gives us an amusing picture of the
             delegates disporting themselves at the seashore as vacationers:
                 A group of well-bronzed bathers, stretching out on the golden beach
                 by the surface of the Latin sea under the benevolent and warm
                 caress of the sun—men, women, young, old, and children, some of
                 them gathered in arms, others occupied with diversions and games,
                 the classic “paella” bubbling and boiling ... —this gathering formed
                 the birth of one of the revolutionary organizations which very soon
                 was to express its romantic dreams, its virility and its heroism: the
## FAI.

               The FAI, or Federacion Anarquista Iberica (Iberian Anarchist Federation),
             occupies a unique and fascinating place in the history of classical workers’
149 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             and peasants’ movements. Organized primarily to assure the CNT’s
             commitment to Anarchist principles, the FAI acquired ts. reputation as one of
             the most dreaded and admired organizations of %volutionaries to emerge in
             Spain. The term “Iberian” had been chosen to express the organization’s
             peninsular scope; the FAI originally intended to include Portuguese as well as
             Spanish Anarchists. (In reality, it remained Spanish, acquiring its own
             distinctive forms and ambience. The new organization based itself on the
             traditional nuclear groups so ardently favored by Spanish Anarchists since the
             days of the First International. The “aﬀinity group” (grupo de aﬁnidad), a
             term oﬀicially adopted by the FAI, accurately denotes the early Spanish
             Anarchist concept that true revolutionary groups must be kept small in order
             to foster a sense of deep intimacy between members. An aﬀinity group rarely
             numbered more than a dozen people. Each member was drawn to others not
             only by common social principles but also by common personal proclivities, or
             “aﬀinities.” The group, in eﬀect, was an extended family—with the added
             feature that the Spanish Anarchists placed an immensely high premium on
             personal initiative and independence of spirit. Owing to this intimacy, a faista
             aﬀinity group was not easily penetrated by police agents. The FAI continued
             to be a, secret organization, highly selective in its choice of members, up to
             the Civil War, although it easily could have acquired legal status after the
             founding of the republic.
               Like the CNT, the FAI was structured along confederal lines: the aﬀinity
             groups in a locality were linked together in a Local Federation and the Local
             Federations in District and Regional Federations. A Local Federation was
             administered by an ongoing secretariat, usually of three persons, and a
             committee composed of one mandated delegate from each aﬀinity group. This
             body comprised a sort of local executive committee. To allow for a full
             expression of rank-and-ﬁle views, the Local Federation was obliged to
             convene assemblies of all the faistas in its area. The District and Regional
             Federations, in turn were simply the Local Federation writ large, replicating
             the structure of the lower body. All the Local Districts and Regional
             Federations were linked together by a Peninsular Committee whose tasks, at
             least theoretically, were administrative. The Peninsular Committee was
             responsible for handling correspondence, for dealing with practical
             organizational details, and (in the words of Ildefonso Gonzalez, an FAI
             secretary) for “executing any general agreements of the organization.”
               Gonzalez frankly admits that the FAI “exhibited a tendency toward
             centralism.” That a Peninsular Committee with aggressive members walked a
             very thin line between a Bolshevik-type Central Committee and a mere
             administrative body is not hard to believe. And the FAI contained very
             aggressive, indeed charismatic leaders, such as Garcia Oliver, the Ascaso
             brothers; and Durruti. The major policy declarations of the FAI were more
             commonly presented in the name of the Peninsular Committee than of faista
             plenums. This accustomed readers of FAI documents to regard the Peninsular
             Committee as an oracular body. Shielded by secrecy, the Peninsular
             Committee might well have enjoyed a wider latitude in the formulation of
             policy than would have been consistent with its expressed libertarian
             principles.
               Yet it must also be emphasized that the aﬀinity groups were far more
150 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             independent than any comparable bodies in the Socialist Party, much less the
             Communist. We have only to read Ramon Sender’s Seven Red Sundays, a
             novel based on a detailed knowledge of the Madrid FAI organization, to gain a
             feeling for -the high degree of initiative that marked the typical faista’s
             behavior. In later years, all the non-Anarchist organizations of the Spanish left
             were to declaim against Anarchist “incontrolados” or “uncontrollables” who
             persistently acted on their own in terrorist acts, defying governmental and
             even FAI policies. The very atmosphere of the organization spawned such
             people. We shall also see that the FAI was not an internally repressive
             organization, even after it began to decay as a libertarian movement. Almost
             as a matter of second nature, dissidents were permitted a considerable
             amount of freedom in voicing and publishing material against the leadership
             and established policies.
               Every member of the FAI was expected to join a CNT syndicate. That the
             FAI tried to bypass the CNT membership, as Comin Colomer asserts, and take
             over the union indirectly by implanting nuclei of Anarchists in every Local and
             Regional Committee of the CNT, is not clear from the available facts. It was no
             secret, to be sure, that the Spanish Anarchists hoped to guide CNT policy.
             Even centrists such as Buenacasa, who became one of the earliest secretaries
             of the Peninsular Committee, may have joined the FAI mainly to dislodge the
             CNT’s moderate leadership. If so, his motives were not exceptional; quite a
             few centrists, who like Buenacasa abhorred violent tactics, seem to have
             occupied key positions in the FAI at various times, probably with the same
             goals in mind. But this much is evident: by far the greater number of faistas
             were young, highly volatile men and women whose real preoccupation was
             not with the CNT apparatus but rather with direct, often violent action
             against the established social order. These “young eagles of the FAI” and their
             more “technical” aﬀinity groups were responsible for the recurrent
             insurrections, the “forced appropriations” of banks and jewelry stores and the
             terrorist actions that marked faista activity in the stormy Republican period
             before the Civil War.
               Owing to the FAI’s passion for secrecy, we know very little about its
             membership ﬁgures. Judging by data published by Diego Abad de Santillan, a
             leading faista, the ﬁgure on the eve of the Civil War may have been close to
             39,000. In any case, so carefully did the organization guard its clandestinity
             that it made no attempt to reveal its existence publicly until 1929, more than
             two years after it had been founded. In December of that year, the Peninsular
             Committee issued its ﬁrst public statement as an organization—a manifesto
             that sharply denounced the moderate tendency in the CNT.
               The events leading up to the FAI’s manifesto reveal the sharp diﬀerences
             that were rending the CNT. The fact that the FAl was created in the summer
             of 1927 is probably not accidental; it was around this that Pestana, addressing
             members of the Barcelona textile syndicate, suggested that the dictatorship’s
             comites paritarios were compatible with the CNT’s principles. Pestana was
             prudent enough not to call for the entry of CNT delegates into the comites,
             but his views raised a furor among militant and centrist Anarchists. Yet these
             views were mild compared with Pestana’s frontal demands two years later. In
             a series of articles titled “Situemonos,” published in ¡Despertad!, Pestana
             called for entirely new principles for the CNT and, in a particularly cutting
151 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             play on words, described the organization as “moderate” (contenido), not as
             “abstinent” (continente). This word play could be taken as a snide attack on
             Anarchist puritanism as well as purism. Peiro, replying on behalf of the
             centrists, acknowledged that while “confederal congresses could modify all
             the principles of the CNT,” they could not challenge the organization’s
             “reason for being: antiparliamentarism and direct action.” Peiro’s views had
             the support of other leading centrists, notably Buenacasa and Eusebio Carbo,
             both of whom enjoyed immense prestige among all syndicalist tendencies.
             Evidently, a great deal of counterpressure from left and centrist Anarchists
             began to build up against the moderates, for in the autumn of 1929 the
             moderate-controlled National Committee suddenly submitted its resignation
             in ¡Despertad! and intoned the “organic demise” (Peirats) of the CNT.
                It is within this context of growing conﬂict that we must examine the FAI’s
             ﬁrst public statement. The manifesto reads more like an ultimatum than an
             argument. In a brief, almost ponderously legalistic document, the secretariat
             of the Peninsular Committee declares that to believe the workers’ movement
             can be ideologically neutral is an error. Although material gains and improved
             working conditions are worthwhile goals, the workers’ movement must seek
             the “absolute cauterization of all the prevalent wounds and the complete
             disappearance of economic and political privileges.” To this end, the CNT
             must establish a “connection” with the organism that adheres to these
             revolutionary tactics and postulates—namely, the FAI. “If the CNT, on the
             contrary, does not accept the propositions made by the FAI’s secretariat,” the
             statement concludes, “it very possibly risks a very pernicious deviation from
             the cause of integral demands and the destruction of the moral and
             revolutionary values which alone distinguishes it....”
                It is plain that Pestana and the moderates had at least one strategic goal in
             mind—the legalization of the CNT. And they sought this goal even if it meant
             major concessions to the dictatorship. By oﬀering to resign, the National
             Committee may well have been trying, in dramatic fashion, to force the issue.
             In any event, the entire question of legality soon became academic. The
             replacement of Primo by Berenguer in January 1930 completely altered the de
             facto status of the CNT and many syndicates began to function openly even
             before they acquired oﬀicial legality.
                The conﬂict between the moderates and Anarchist militants, however, did
             not disappear. On the contrary, it now settled down to basic diﬀerences in
             revolutionary strategy—diﬀerences that were to reach truly schismatic
             proportions in the early years of the republic. In the course of a broad
             statement on CNT goals, the moderate-controlled National Committee had
             managed to note its “concern over national problems” and more speciﬁcally
             its willingness “to intervene using its own methods with their ideology and
             history in the process of constitutional revion....” With this formulation as an
             anchor, the National Committee proceeded to declare, in eﬀect, that it
             welcomed a republic as the most congenial framework in which to work for
             libertarian goals. The statement thus visualized a Spanish revolution as
             divided into two stages: the ﬁrst (and more immediate one), a bourgeois
             democracy; the second (and more visionary one), a libertarian communist
             society. If one removes the National Committee’s usual obeisances to broad
             Anarchosyndicalist ideals, its perspective could hardly be distinguished from
152 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             that of the much-despised UGT. Needless to say, the National Committee’s
             “scandalous” statement (as Peirats calls it) produced another uproar among
             Anarchist militants and further polarize’d the’CNT.
               Convoluted as these details may seem, they are vitally important to an
             understanding of the CNT’s later development. The moderates were not
             merely willing to collaborate with bourgeois groups in order to establish a
             republic; they were also willing to follow a prudent and accommodating
             strategy within a republican framework. The Anarchist militants, on the other
             hand, were advocating a policy of unrelenting opposition to the state, be it
             dictatorial, monarchical, or republican. Much of the CNT’s history in the years
             to follow was to turn around conﬂicts and compromises between these
             positions.
               Even under the Berenguer regime, events were to show that the two
             policies were not mutually exclusive. Moderates were to take seemingly
             intransigent stands when it suited their purposes and the FAI to make
             concessions of its own when they furthered its shortterm ends. It is
             interesting to note that in the sub rosa negotiations that led to the CNT’s
             legalization, Pestana, representing the union, assumed an unrelenting
             Anarchosyndicalist position even to the point of dismissing the comites
             paritarios as a “monstrosity.” Whether this ﬁrmness was the result of newly
             acquired convictions under changed political conditions or merely a shrewd
             accommodation to rank-and-ﬁle militancy is diﬀicult to judge. Angel Pestana
             was not a demagogue; indeed, it is only fair to say that he was a man of great
             integrity and exceptional courage. General Mola, who represented the
             government in the negotiations, was obviously impressed by the dignity of this
             intensely moral labor, leader—tall, lean, dressed in rough clothing, with an
             “inquisitive” demeanor. Although Pestana may have been willing to enter the
             comitas paritarios three years earlier, when harsh conditions seemed to
             warrant this approach, Mola notes that he expressed genuine outrage over
             the fact that the labor delegates to the comites received salaries and were
             thus separated from their fellow wage-earners.
               By the same token, the FAI did not always behave as a pure ﬂame of
             Anarchist consistency; on the contrary, it was ready to bend its
             antiparliamentary principles almost to the breaking point when crucial
             situations arose. Thus, in the municipal elections of 1931, faista delegates
             joined their moderate opponents in supporting a Republican-Socialist
             coalition that packed the king oﬀ to exile. And although the FAI did not
             participate in the electoral coalitions of 1936, it “released” Anarchist workers
             from their no-voting scruples and contributed decisively to bringing the
             Popular Front to power.
               The most serious inconsistencies of the FAI were to become painfully
             evident later—and in a more crucial context in the development of the
             Spanish labor movement. For the present, Primo’s departure had opened a
             period of rebuilding for the scattered forces of Anarchosyndicalism. On April
             30, 1930, the CNT was granted a form of “conditional” legality by the
             governor of Barcelona, followed by legalization in other provinces.[34]
             Although many syndicates were still illegal elsewhere in the country and
             thousands of cenetistas ﬁlled the jails of the Berenguer regime, Spanish
             Anarchosyndicalism began to pick up the threads that had been broken by the
153 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             dictatorship in 1924. In little more than a year, the CNT membership
             numbered close to a half million. This ﬁgure, to be sure, is much lower than
             the CNT’s peak membership of 700,000 in 1919, but it is quite substantial if
             one bears in mind that the organization was virtually nonexistent during the
             seven years of Primo’s rule. In a series of conferences, plenums, and
             organizing drives, the CNT recouped the greater part of its losses and
             suceeded rapidly in restoring most of its contacts with other areas of the
             country. Solidaridad Obrera in Barcelona began to appear as a daily shortly
             after it was legalized on August 30 and, following the custom of the
             predictatorial years, sister publications with the same name began to spring
             up in other cities of Spain.
               But the CNT of 1930 was no longer the same organization Primo had
             suppressed in 1924, nor was the FAI the same as the FNGA. The bloody
             pistolero period of 1919–23, the acrimonious years of introversion which
             brought latent diﬀerences to the surface, and the harsh experiences of
             repression by the dictatorship had altered greatly the atmosphere in the CNT
             and in Anarchist groups. The moderate, almost ecumenical outlook that had
             prevailed in the old CNT and even in the FNGA, had been invaded by an
             increasingly intractable spirit. The pistolero conﬂicts had produced a new
             kind of Anarchist—young, grim, prone to violence, and impatient with
             temporizing measures and compromises. These young Anarchists, typiﬁed by
             Durruti, Garcia Oliver, Ascaso, and Sanz, were accustomed to bold escapades.
             They were ilegales in the full sense of the term. Even the “pure-and-simple”
             unionists were shaken in their moderate views particularly after 1929, when
             the world economic crisis began to nourish a new spirit of militancy in the
             working class. Slowly, the bulk of rank-and-ﬁle members in the CNT came to
             favor the FAI over the moderates, the militants over the temporizers, the highspirited young Anarchists over the older, more prudent, union-oriented
             leadership of an earlier generation.
               In 1930 and 1931, however, the moderates still controlled the CNT and
             centrists like Buenacasa apparently continued to hold the young faistas in
             rein. The National Committee and the editorial staiﬀ of Solidaridad Obrera
             were in the hands of moderates and centrists. Nor was this control likely to be
             shaken without changes in the outlook of the Catalan cenetistas. Following
             the tradition of the old International, the CNT gave the responsibility of
             selecting the entire National Committee to the region which congresses had
             assigned as the national center of the union. Until the 1930s, the repeated
             choice of Catalonia and speciﬁcally Barcelona as the CNT’s national oﬀice
             almost guaranteed moderate control over the National Committee and
             Solidaridad Obrera.
               The weight of Catalonian inﬂuence reveals still another change that had
             occurred in the fortunes of Spanish Anarchosyndicalism— the eclipse of
             Andalusia as a decisive area of the movement. Contrary to the usual accounts
             of Spanish Anarchism, the CNT was largely composed of workers rather than
             peasants and its focus was primarily on the culturally advanced north rather
             than the backward south. The myth that Spanish Anarchism remained little
             more than an inchoate, village-based movement with peripheral working-class
             support has been refuted tellingly by Malefakis’s recent study of peasant
             unrest in Spain. In 1873, when Spanish Anarchism exercised a considerable
154 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             inﬂuence in the countryside, Andalusia (both urban and rural) provided nearly
             two thirds of the old International’s membership. By 1936, this proportion had
             declined to about a ﬁfth. As Malefakis observes:
                  The predominance of Andalusia in the Anarchist federations of’the
                  1870s and 1880s had disappeared after the turn of the century and
                  was but a distant memory. The two ancient centers of Spanish
                  anarchism Catalonia and Andalusia were no longer in any sense
## equal. Urban anarchosyndicalism had far outdistanced rural;
                  Catalonia far overshadowed Andalusia. This was especially true
                  because Catalonia was now ﬂanked by a new Anarchosyndicalist
                  stronghold in Saragossa. The ties between these two regions were
                  so much more intimate than those maintained by either with any
                  other part of Spain that one may safely speak of a new geographical
                  bloc within the CNT. The FAI leaders— Durruti, the Ascasos, and
                  Garcia Oliver—were all from Barcelona and Saragossa. The major
                  insurrections of the CNT-FAI originated and found most of their
                  response within these two regions. And it was this bloc, with some
                  assistance from the neighboring Levante, that was to carry on the
                  Civil War for the Anarchosyndicalists after Andalusia had fallen to
## the Nationalists.

               Attempts were made to revive the peasant movement, but they were halfhearted. The old Anarchosyndicalist FNAE (Federation National de
             Agricultores de Espania) had been swallowed up by the repressive
             dictatorship; its newspaper, La Voz del Campesino, was revived in 1932 in
             Jerez de la Frontera, only to disappear later the same year. In 1931, at the
             CNT Extraordinary Congress of Madrid, a proposal was adopted to call a
             peasant congress and create a rural federation. The congress never came oﬀ.
             The CNT, to be sure, still had considerable strength in the cities of the south—
             especially in Cadiz, Malaga, Cordoba, and Seville—and in a number of
             Andalusian villages. But ties between the cities and villages were extremely
             weak. “Little eﬀective cooperation,” observes Malefakis, “existed between the
             Anarchosyndicalist unions of the major Andalusian cities and their rural
             counterparts.”
               The authentic peasant base of the CNT, now lay in Aragon. The conversion
             of Saragossa during the early 1920s to a brand of Anarchism more “black”
             and resolute than that of Barcelona provided a springboard for a highly
             eﬀective libertarian agitation in lower Aragon, particularly among the
             impoverished laborers and debt-ridden peasantry of the dry steppe region.
             Aside from the Union de Rabassaires in the vine-growing region, the Catalan
             countryside too had been infected by Anarchist agitation emanating from
             Barcelona. The CNT still preserved its strength in the mountain villages of the
             Levant and the Galician countryside around Coruna. Most of these rural areas
             were quiescent during the dictatorship. Not until the proclamation of the
             republic, with its promise of land reform and its new political possibilities, did
             the Spanish countryside spring to life again as a social force.
               With Primo’s departure, Spain began to settle its accounts with the
             monarchy. Alfonso, tainted by his role in establishing the dictatorship, tried
             desperately to retain the throne as a quasiconstitutional monarch. But the
155 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             monarchy—both in the, person of Alfonso and as an institution—had
             discredited itself completely. Berenguer’s delays in assembling the Cortes and
             Alfonso’s obvious maneuvers to retain his royal prerogatives eroded the
             conﬁdence even of conservative politicians. “I am not a Republican,” declared
             the old conservative wheelhorse Sanchez Guerra, “but I recognize that Spain
             has a right to be a Republic.” Conspiracies against the dictatorship were now
             replaced by conspiracies, against the monarchy, and they included not only
             Republicans and Socialists, but Liberal caciques like Alcala Zamora and army
             oﬀicers such as Queipo de Llano and Ramon Franco, the brother of the future
             caudillo. The gnawing conﬂicts over Catalan autonomy, which divided
             Republican ranks between Catalans and Spaniards, were resolved in August
             1930, when both wings signed the famous Pact of San Sebastian. Catalonia
             was promised far-reaching autonomy in her internal aﬀairs. The Pact was
             signed by a widely disparate group of politicians including Alcala Zamora,
             Manuel Azaña (a Republican litterateur whose roots lay in the fashionable
             Ateneo, a Liberal Madrid literary and political club), and the inevitable
             Alejandro Lerroux. The San Sebastian crowd, from which Republican Spain
             was to recruit several of its presidents and prime ministers, was pledged to
             “revolutionary action” against the monarchy—an excursion into militant
             rhetoric that the Pact’s signers were to modify considerably with mea culpas
             and appeals to nonviolence.
                Two uncertainties confronted the National Revolutionary Committee which
             had emerged from the Pact: the role of the army and the workers in the
             overthrow of the king.-The army, to be sure, would not shoot down
             Republicans, but would it join actively in a Republican rising? The only
             reliable mass following the Republicans could rely on were the workers but
             the Committee balked at giving them arms. Hateful as the monarchy was to
             the Ateneo Liberals, the specter of an armed working class terriﬁed them. To
             keep the CNT from participating in the San Sebastian cabal without oﬀending
             its sensibilities, the Republicans tactfully invited neither of the two labor
             organizations to the signing of the Pact.
                How, then, could the CNT’s aid be deployed against the monarchy without
             risking an authentic social revolution? Taking the Anarchosyndicalist bit in its
             teeth, the National Revolutionary Committee dispatched Miguel Maura and
             Angel Galarza to Barcelona to enlist the CNT’s participation in a “peaceful”
             general strike against the monarchy. The strike, to be ignited by the UGT’s
             railway workers, was to climax in a general rising of the military. There is no
             evidence that the CNT had any second thoughts about this plan. According to
             the moderate cenetista, Juan Peiro, the CNT at a national plenum of its
             regional delegates “agreed to establish an exchange of information among the
             political elements with the object of forming a revolutionary committee.”
             Stated more bluntly, the CNT gave its assent to the plan. The plenum’s
             delegates, to assure their independence, decided to prepare a manifesto that
             aﬀirmed the CNT’s commitment to apolitical principles and its adherence to
             libertarian forms of organization.
                The general strike turned out to be a shabby failure, snarled by changes in
             dates, poor communications, and a gross miscalculation of the army’s
             attitude. The uprising was’ scheduled for December 15. According to the
             Republican version, it was unexpectedly pushed back to December 12 by a
156 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             premature revolt of the Jaca garrison in Aragon. The rebellious troops were
             quickly subdued and their two commanders, Captains Fermin Galan and
             Garcia Hernandez, executed by ﬁring squads. Alcala Zamora, Miguel Maura,
             and their Socialist collaborators, Largo Caballero and Fernando de los Rios,
             were arrested without diﬀiculty in Madrid. The CNT issued a call for a
             general strike and attempted armed attacks on strategic installations, but all
             its eﬀorts came to grief.
                Peirats, taking issue with the Republican version of the Jaca rebellion, gives
             us an entirely diﬀerent account. Apparently this rebellion had indeed been
             planned for the 12th, but the National Revolutionary Committee had decided
             upon a delay. Casares Quiroga was sent oﬀ as an emissary to forestall the
             rising, but “on arriving in Jaca at night,” notes Peirats, “he had preferred to
             sleep instead of complying instantly with his urgent mission.” If Peirats’s
             version is true, Galan and Garcia Hernandez were the needless victims of
             Repubilcan slovenliness. Since everyone in Spain knew that the declaration of
             a republic was merely a matter of time (everyone, that is, except the
             monarchy), the arrested Madrid conspirators were treated leniently— indeed
             with deference, as the future leaders of the state. They spent only a few
             months in prison and received provisional liberties. “One could hope for no
             more from that so-called Revolutionary Committee,” concludes Peirats acidly,
             “which had its social seat in the Madrid Ateneo and which later, when it was
             put in prison, was equipped with telephone service and silk pajamas.”
                The CNT can hardly be reproached for its role in these events. Left to its
             own devices, the union had functioned more creditably than all of its
             Republican and Socialist “allies.” CNT strikes, both before and after the
             “rising” of December 12, were almost uniformly impressive and the union’s
             eﬀorts to reknit its forces generally met with success. The ﬁrst plenum of the
             Catalan Regional Federation, held on May 17, 1930, initiated a drive to
             publish Solidaridad Obrera as a daily. This was followed by a public plenary
             meeting on July 6. Shortly after the second Catalan regional plenum, on
             October 5 and 6, the National Committee suggested that a National
             Conference of Syndicates be convened two weeks later, but the conference
             was suspended owing to the heated political situation in Spain. Taking
             advantage of a general strike in Madrid that had broken out in reaction to
             police brutality, the CNT decided to present a show of force of its own. The
             union’s purpose, explains Peirats,
                  was to show that a general strike was possible in Barcelona even
## though the transport syndicate had been closed down by the
                  governor. The governor, Despujols, was obliged to admit the obvious

               The Republican ﬁasco of December 12, 1930, had not resolved the problems
             of the CNT’s relationship to bourgeois political movements. In theory, at least,

             the CNT adhered to antistatist principles. Rejecting political methods for
             social change, it advocated direct action by the oppressed against any system
             of political authority. The more intransigent Anarchists in the union carried
             these principles one step further and argued that every state was bad, be it
             monarchial, dictatorial, or republican, and could not be supported. But were
             these diﬀerent state forms equally bad? Were no distinctions to be drawn
             between them in terms of Anarchist tactics? The CNT could hardly ignore the
             fact that signiﬁcant diﬀerences existed between a dictatorship and a republic,
             indeed, between a monarchy and a republic. Primo’s regime had virtually
             smashed any form of overt syndicalist activity in Spain, whereas a republic
             would clearly open new opportunities for syndicalist growth. Indeed, however
             much the Spanish Anarchists had denied the importance of distinctions in
             state forms, in practice they had reacted to these diﬀerences from the very
             inception of their movement. They had joined with radical Federalists in the
             early 1870s to create a cantonal republic. During the general strike of 1917,
             the CNT had proclaimed a minimum program which declared for a republic,
             the separation of church and state, divorce laws, and the right of unions to
             veto legislation passed by the Cortes. In March 1930, Peiro and three of his
             centrist comrades had added their names to a Republican manifesto that
             raised even milder demands than the CNT’s earlier minimum program.
             Writing in Accion Social Obrera, Peiro, despite much breast-beating about the
             inviolability of his conscience, frankly admitted that his gesture stood in
             “contradiction” with his libertarian principles.
               The FAI, although it had been led by its centrist members into shadowy
             violations of Anarchist principles, decried these contradictions vigorously.
             Faistas like Buenacasa had muted the voices of the young militants but had
             not silenced them. The failure of the Republican “rising” in December merely
             reinforced the intransigent position of the “young eagles of the FAI” toward
             the Republicans; indeed, even the centrists had begun to waver, some turning
             to a hard, noncollaborative stand and others to a moderate one.
               How would the CNT deal with the republic once it emerged? This annoying
             question came increasingly to the fore as the monarchy began to totter. In
             February 1931, Berenguer, faced by massive public hostility, resigned his
             oﬀice. The king, forced to make meaningful concessions, had ﬁnally decided
             to remove the government-appointed municipalities that existed under Primo
             and to allow unfettered municipal elections. A nonpolitical government,
             headed by Admifal Aznar, took over Berenguer’s vacant place. Even the king
             recognized that the destiny of the monarchy now depended upon the outcome
             of the municipal elections. On April 12, 1931, Spain went to the polls. By
             evening, the earliest returns left no doubt that the Republican-Socialist
             coalition had won a stunning victory. Two days later, Alfonso departed hastily
             for Marseilles while the avenues of Spain’s major cities were swollen with
             jubilant crowds waving Republican ﬂags.
             The Azaña Coalition
              The Second Republic began its career in an atmosphere of public elation.
             Spain, swept up as by a national festival, ﬂocked into the streets, hailed the

             new regime, and decorated itself in the Republican ^tricolor. Self-discipline
             became the maxim of the day. To protect the queen mother and her children
             from unruly crowds, Socialists from the Casa del Pueblo of Madrid provided
             them with a guard of young workers in red armbands. A hastily improvised
             citizens’ police force guarded the doors of banks to prevent looting. Every
             eﬀort was made to avoid dishonoring the new regime with acts of vandalism
             and destruction. In the words of Ramos Oliveira, “Both Spaniards and
             foreigners commented on the magnanimity and discipline of the people who,
             on recognizing liberty and power, made no use of their conquest to destroy or
             humiliate their erstwhile oppressors.”
                Yet within a year of this generous outburst of popular goodwill, the republic
             was to be torn by bitter political conﬂicts and bloody strike waves—and two
             years later it was to fall into the hands of rabid political’ opponents. The
             steady decline in the republic’s prestige was virtually inevitable. The Second
             Republic, precisely because of its goodwill, had brought to power the most
             disparate group of politicians and labor leaders ever to adorn a Spanish
             cabinet. The new prime minister, Alcala Zamora, presided over a government
             that included Miguel Maura, an ex-Monarchist and ardent Catholic; Casares
             Quiroga, a wealthy Galician Liberal who, with Manuel Azaña, later formed the
             Left Republicans; Martinez Barrio and Alejandro Lerroux, both luminaries of
             the venal Radical Party; and three Socialists: Largo Caballero, Fernando de
             los Rios, and Indalecio Prieto, the latter a spokesman for the party’s right
             wing. For the most part, the new cabinet consisted of the men of San
             Sebastian. And once Alfonso had been removed, nearly all of them—singly or
             in pairs—were poised to desert each other with alacrity.
                Alcala Zamora and Maura had entered the cabinet to make sure that the
             republic did not become too republican, i.e., that it left the landed estates, the
             church, and the army largely intact. Azaña and Casares Quiroga, as
             spokesman for the lower middle classes and intellectuals, recognized the need
             for reforms; but how much reform was possible in the face of an antirepublican oligarchy, a covertly reactionary army, an overtly reactionary
             church, and a revolutionary working class remained an imponderable.
             Martinez Barrio and Lerroux made a career of vacillation between the antirepublican oligarchy and the Ateneo Liberals. Later, they parted ways when
             Martinez broke from Lerroux and drifted toward the Liberals. The Socialists,
             committed to a bourgeois republic, provided Azaña and Casares Quiroga with
             a “responsible” left wing. Deployed by the Republicans to keep the proletariat
             in rein, they remained the beggars of Liberalism, pressing for reforms that
             invariably ended in shabby compromises.
                The primary tasks of the new government were sternly Jacobin: to
             expropriate the great landed magnates, adopt eﬀective measures against the
             deepening economic crisis, curb the army’s role in political life, and weaken
             the church’s hold on Spanish society. Had such a program been resolutely
             carried out in the opening months of the republic, when popular enthusiasm
             was still running high, the Liberals might have raised Spain to the level of a
             European bourgeois nation. But the government delayed, fearful of alienating
             the very classes it was obliged to oppose, while a Constituent Cortes occupied
             itself with writing a constitution. Although humane and brightly liberal in
             spirit, the constitution became a mechanism for placing legal formalities
159 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             before social activism. In the end, nobody took this document very seriously.
             The constitution, however, served to reveal the patchwork nature of the new
             cabinet. When the Cortes adopted Article 26—a constitutional provision aimed
             at the enormous power of the Spanish church—Alcala Zamora and Maura
             resigned, the former to be reincorporated into the republic as its president.
             Azaña, whose well-reasoned defense of Article 26 placed him in the limelight,
             became the prime minister and the spokesman for Republican virtue. These
             opening months, however, were not entirely wasted. Largely on the initiative
             of Largo Caballero, the new minister of labor, the government rapidly passed
             a series of laws that protected small tenants from arbitrary expulsion from
             their land and extended the eight-hour working day to the agrarian
             proletariat. Priority was granted to rural workers’ societies in subleasing
             large tracts of land. To prevent migrant workers from claiming the jobs of
             locals, the Cortes, in a Socialist-sponsored Law of Municipal Boundaries,
             established rural frontiers around some 9,000 municipalities. No outsider
             could be hired by a landowner within these municipalities until the local labor
             force had found employment. Another law denied landowners the right to
             withdraw from cultivation land that had hitherto been farmed according to
             the “uses and customs” of the region; otherwise, the uncultivated land could
             be taken over for cultivation by local workers’ organizations.
                None of these measures was particularly radical. Although Malefakis
             describes the laws as “a revolution without precedent in Spanish rural life,”
             the reasons he adduces for this conclusion are essentially juridical. The laws
             shifted “the balance of legal rights” from the landowners to the rural masses.
             But they provided no solution to the endemic unemployment that paralyzed
             the Spanish countryside and they left the key problem of land ownership
             unsolved. The republic’s famous Agrarian Statute of September 1932,
             ostensibly designed to initiate a sweeping land redistribution program, hardly
             rates serious attention. Lacking adequate funds, hedged by legal stipulations,
             and burdened by administrative procrastination, the statute hobbled along
             without changing the status of the rural poor and lawless. By late 1934, two
             years after the statute’s passage, little more than 12,000 families had
             received land. The countryside, its hopes deﬂated by bitter disappointment,
             became more surly and ﬁnally more rebellious than it had been in the stormy
             years after the war.
                Niggardly in its treatment of rural reform, the government swelled with
             generosity in its dealings with the army. In 1931 the Spanish army could claim
             the unique distinction of containing more majors and captains than sergeants;
             its 16 skeletal divisions, which normally required 80 general oﬀicers, were
             serviced by nearly 800. The republic’s law on military reform was modest. The
             measure reduced the 16 existing divisions to 8, limited compulsory military
             service to one year, and abolished the rank of captain general, a position that
             had given the army jurisdiction over the civil government in periods of social
             unrest. To mollify the oﬀicer corps, the government oﬀered full pay to oﬀicers
             who elected to retire, based on the highest rank they would have achieved in
             the normal course of military service. The army reacted to this decree “with
             mixed emotions,” observes Gabriel Jackson. “Almost everyone acknowledged
             that the Army was top heavy with brass, but many a proud career oﬀicer felt
             that Azaña simply wished to destroy the oﬀicer corps by buying it oﬀ.” As if to
160 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             feed this suspicion, the government closed down the general military academy
             at Saragossa, an act which many oﬀicers viewed as a “blow to the esprit de
             corps of the Army, since this was the only institution in which oﬀicers of
             diﬀerent branches of service trained together.”
               In the long run, the government’s reforms left the country profoundly
             dissatisﬁed. The republic had awakened suspicion among the conservative
             classes without diminishing their power; it had also aroused hope among the
             oppressed without satisfying their needs. The republic, in fact, had hardly
             been in power more than a month before it suﬀered its ﬁrst serious blow.
             Early in May 1931, Cardinal Segura, the primate of Spain, issued a pastoral
             letter sharply denouncing the “anarchy” and “grave commotion” that the new
             regime had introduced. Provocatively, the letter thanked the king for having
             preserved the piety and cherished traditions of Spain. As luck would have it,
             three days later scuﬄes broke out between Monarchists and anti-Monarchists
             in Madrid; a crowd, angered by anti-Monarchist rumors, gathered before the
             Ministry of Interior and in the morning hours six convents in the capital were
             set aﬂame. The convent burnings spread from Madrid to Malaga, Seville,
             Alicante, and other cities. The cabinet, fearful of staining the new regime with
             “Republican blood,” delayed taking action for two days before calling out the
             army. Although the burnings were rapidly quelled, the damage had already
             been done; reaction found its issue in the status of the church, and the
             republic had tarnished its virtue with violence.
               The middle classes were duly shocked by these events. Thereafter, rightwing hotheads were to make repeated assaults on the regime, riding on a
             growing wave of popular disillusionment. By 1932, monarchist and
             reactionary conspiracies against the republic had graduated to the level of a
             military coup. On August 10, General Sanjurjo, the erstwhile commander of
             the Civil Guard, declared against the “illegitimate Cortes” in a poorly planned,
             indecisive rising in Seville. Sanjurjo was easily defeated and the Azaña regime
             emerged from the event with considerable prestige. But its victory was
             shortlived. This government of middle-class Liberals and Socialists had little
             more than a year of life before it was brought down—and ironically, its fall
             came not from an assault by the right but rather by the left.
               Perhaps the most telling blow came from the Anarchists. The CNT had
             actually welcomed the republic. In April 1931 many syndicalist workers joined
             with Socialist workers in voting for the Republican bloc. “The vote of the
             working class was divided,” notes Madariaga.
                 The workers aﬀiliated to the UGT (Socialists) voted for their men;
## but the Anarcho-Syndicalists, whose numbers were about as
                 numerous, voted for the middle-class liberals. There were two
                 reasons for this: the ﬁrst was the unbridgeable enmity which
                 separates socialists and syndicalists, due to their rival bid for the
                 leadership of the working classes; the second was that as the
## Anarcho-Syndicalists had always preached contempt for the
                 suﬀrage, they had no political machinery of their own; so that, when
                 it came to voting, which they did this time to help oust the
                 Monarchy, they preferred to vote for the middle-class Republicans
                 whose liberal views were more in harmony with the anti-Marxist
161 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
                 ideas of the Spanish Syndicalists than with the orthodox and
                 dogmatic tenets of the Socialists.[35]
                The day after the republic was proclaimed, Solidaridad Obrera ventured a
             view that was hardly a clarion call to battle against the new state: “We have
             no enthusiasm for a bourgeois republic but we shall not give our consent to a
             new Dictatorship....” The newspaper went on to remind its readers that many
             CNT members still languished in jail and demanded their immediate release.
             To give muscle to this demand, the Catalan Regional Confederation called a
             one-day general strike, whereupon the Generalitat (the Catalan provincial
             government) shrewdly declared the day a national holiday.
                Having made these token gestures, the union settled down to a period of
             watchful waiting. Apart from sporadic violence in which CNT militants settled
             long-standing accounts with chiefs of the hated libres, Barcelona was
             comparatively peaceful.[36] The city was still in a festive mood. Catalonia,
             ignoring the old and discredited Lliga, had calf its vote overwhelmingly for
             the Esquerra (Catalan Left), a new middle-class party headed by the aging
             Colonel Maria and a clever young lawyer, Luis Companys. Companys, it will
             be recalled, had defended cenetistas in the political trials of the 1920s; he
             knew the union’s moderate leaders personally and was regarded by some of
             them as a “friend.” Pledged to Catalan autonomy, the Esquerra was linked
             closely, by both personal ties and common outlook, to the Azaña Republicans.
             Buoyed by the certainty that autonomy was now within its reach, the public
             was in no mood to challenge the new republic.
                The CNT was wary of the new regime in Madrid. Indeed, it is highly
             doubtful that any prolonged truce could have existed between the respectable
             Liberals who headed the republican government and the Anarchist ilegales
             who were coming to the fore in the CNT. As it turned out, the Azaña coalition
             did very little to allay the CNT’s suspicions; the Anarchists, stoking the
             disappointment of the working class into anger, raised demands for a
             complete break with the republic. Events were soon to unfold that justiﬁed
             the mutual suspicions and hatreds of both sides, escalating government
             repression and Anarchist assaults into a condition of virtual civil war.
                The Socialist Party, it must be added here, played a critical role in
             exacerbating this conﬂict. That the UGT and CNT were bitter rivals has
             already been emphasized by Madariaga and other writers; for decades the
             two labor organizations had contested each other for every jurisdiction where
             they overlapped. Rarely did they cooperate, and the few pacts they signed for
             common action usually degenerated into a welter of mutual recriminations.
             With the establishment of the republic, Socialist attitudes toward the CNT
             became unconscionably venomous. “There is a great deal of confusion in the
             minds of many comrades,” warned a Socialist leader in 1932. “They consider
             Anarchist Syndicalism as an ideal which runs parallel with our own, when it is
             its absolute antithesis, and that the Anarchists and Syndicalists are comrades
             when they are our greatest enemies.”
                This statement should not be dismissed as mere rhetoric. It bluntly
             expresses what many Socialist leaders practiced daily in their relations with
             the rival union. UGT bureaucrats often provided scabs to break up CNT
             strikes (and replace the striking syndicates by their own unions)—only to
162 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             accuse the Anarchosyndicalists of pistolerismo when they defended
             themselves.[37] Ruthless in the exercise of his powers, Largo Caballero used
             the immense apparatus of the Ministry of Labor to undermine CNT inﬂuence
             wherever he could. It would be diﬀicult, in fact, to clearly understand the
             labor legislation of the early republic without bearing in mind this aim of the
             Socialists. As if to conﬁrm the harshest anti-republican verdict of the
             Anarchists, the new government passed a law to establish a system of “mixed
             juries” for dealing with labor disputes. The law made it illegal to strike
             without ﬁrst bringing grievances before a “jury” composed equally of labor
             and employer representatives, with a government representative to break
             voting deadlocks. Although the jury’s decision was not mandatory, there can
             be little doubt that it strongly inﬂuenced the outcome of many labor disputes
             by its moral authority. It need hardly be emphasized that the mixed jury
             system made it possible for Largo Caballero to give UGT representatives easy
             majorities by appointing Socialists as government representatives. Other
             legislation speciﬁed the conditions labor-management contracts had to fulﬁll
             in order to be valid and established a mandatory eight-day “cooling-oﬀ”
             period before workers could go on strike.
               To the CNT this corpus of labor legislation was nothing less than a dagger
             aimed at its most treasured Anarchosyndicalist principles. As Brenan
             observes,
                  Apart from the fact that these laws ran contrary to the AnarchoSyndicalist principles of negotiating directly with the employers and
                  interfered with the practice of lightning strikes, it was clear that
                  they represented an immense increase in the power of the State in
                  industrial matters. A whole army of Government oﬀicials, mostly
                  Socialists, made their appearance to enforce the new laws and saw
                  to it that, whenever possible, they should be used to extend the
                  inﬂuence of the UGT at the expense of the CNT. This had of course
                  been the intention of those who drew them up. In fact the UGT was
                  rapidly becoming an organ of the state itself and using its new
                  powers to reduce its rival. The Anarcho-Syndicalists could have no
                  illusions as to what would happen to them if a purely Socialist
## government should come into power.

               That the UGT reaped enormous advantages from Socialist collaboration
             with the government (past as well as present) can be demonstrated with
             statistical precision. The Socialist labor federation, thanks to its “cooperative”
             attitude toward the dictatorship, had retained its apparatus intact throughout
             the 1920s, even increasing its membership slightly. In December 1929, shortly
             before Primo’s fall, it could claim 1,511 local sections with about 230,000
             members. With the establishment of the republic, the UGT enjoyed a
             phenomenal growth. By December 1931, eight months after the republic was
             proclaimed, the union could boast of 4,041 local sections and nearly 960,000
             members, a tripling of membership in only two years. In July 1932, these
             ﬁgures had soared to almost 5,107 and 1,050,000 respectively.
               Most of this expansion occurred in the countryside. In the hectic period
             directly following the war, the UGT, shaken by the Russian Revolution and
             Anarchist insurrections in Andalusia, began to discard some of its Marxian

             shibboleths and direct/its energies toward winning the rural poor. Led by Luis
             Martinez Gil, a follower of Julian Besteiro, Socialists tried to use Primo’s
             comites paritarios to extend the UGT’s rather limited roots in southern Spain.
             In April 1930, the UGT established a separate rural federation, the FNTT or
             Federation National de Trabajadores de la Tierra (National Federation of
             Land Workers). It began with a membership of only 27,000, but by June 1933
             this ﬁgure had soared to 451,000, accounting for 40 percent of the UGT’s
             total membership.
               The CNT watched this increase with alarm. To the Anarchosyndicalists, the
             growth of Socialist-controlled unions meant nothing less than the
             bureaucratic corruption of the Spanish masses. They earnestly believed that a
             UGT worker or peasant was virtually lost to the revolution. What was even
             more appalling, the UGT, aided by the Ministry of Labor and the mixed juries,
             began to make serious inroads into traditionally Anarchist areas. Not only
             were Estremadura and La Mancha Socialist strongholds, but sizeable FNTT
             unions now existed in Malaga, Seville, and Valencia.
               Ironically, both labor organizations failed to anticipate the radicalizing
             impact this massive inﬂux of rural poor would have on Spanish Socialism. The
             countryside was in the midst of revolutionary ferment. The new Republican
             agrarian laws had opened the sluice gates of rural discontent without
             satisfying the peasant’s hunger for land. Thousands of tenants ﬂocked to the
             courts and to their unions to demand the settlement of grievances under the
             new laws; strikes and demonstrations swept the countryside, locking the new
             FNTT in bitter struggles with the civil authorities. The pressure of the
             impetuous Spanish peasantry and rural proletariat on the UGT bureaucracy
             began to produce major ﬁssures in the once-solid ediﬁce of Socialist
             reformism. Although the FNTT’s militancy fell far short of the CNT’s, it is
             signiﬁcant that Martinez Gil and Besteiro were strongly opposed to the entry
             of Socialists into the Republican government. The Socialist left wing, so
             hopelessly isolated after the Russian Revolution, began to increase its
             inﬂuence in party ranks. Within a few years, it would become the most
             important tendency in the Socialist Party.
               Although the UGT remained the CNT’s main rival, the small Spanish
             Communist Party began to take up its own cudgels and enter the battle
             between the two unions. Until the early Republican period, the Communist
             Party was little more than an interloper in the Spanish labor movement. From
             a sizeable organization at its founding, the party in 1931 had dwindled to little
             more than a thousand rftembers. Primo had all but ignored its existence. The
             dictatorship did not even bother to suppress the party’s newspaper, Mundo
             Obrero. The split between the Communist syndicalists like Nin and Maurin
             and the traditional Leninists had left the party in the hands of docile
             mediocrities whose principal qualiﬁcation for leadership seems to have been
             their subservience to the Stalinist Comintern. During this period, virtually all
             Catalan Communists, following the tendency represented by Maurin, had
             formed the BOC, the Bloc Obrer i Camperol (Worker-Peasant Bloc), a
             revolutionary organization which stressed the need for cooperation between
             working-class and left middle-class groups. Others, mainly intellectuals,
             collected around Nin and established the Izquierda Cominunista or Left
             Communists, an avowedly Trotskyist organization, also rooted primarily in
164 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Catalonia. Together, the BOC and Izquierda Cominunista virtually supplanted
             the Communist Party in Catalonia and for many years may have outnumbered
             it in Spain as a whole. In 1936, the two organizations merged to form the
             POUM—the Partido Obrero de Uniﬁcation Marxista (Workers’ Party of Marxist
             Uniﬁcation)—a sizeable organization which became the principal target of
             Stalinist abuse and repression during the Civil War years.
                Generally, the Communist Party exercised very little inﬂuence on the
             Spanish working class. Apart from some nuclei in Asturias and Madrid, the
             party could boast of only one major achievement: in 1927 it had managed to
             win control over a considerable number of underground CNT syndicates’in
             Seville—principally in the dock area— which it began to use as a base for
             duels with rival Anarchosyndicalist and Socialist unions. During the early
             1930s, the Andalusian capital became the arena for a three-way conﬂict
             between the CNT, the UGT, and the Stalinist-manipulated “Committee of
             Reconstruction,”[38] so named because of a conference on Syndicalist
             Reconstruction which the party had convened in the spring of 1930.
             According to Gabriel Jackson, who made a recent on-site study of the conﬂict:

## Most of the urban workers belonged to CNT unions. The
## communists were strongest among the port workers. The UGT
                 Federation of Land Workers had been growing in the villages, and
## the UGT was challenging the communists for control of the
                 stevedores. Each of these groups, plus the employer organization,
                 the Economic Federation of Andalusia, hired pistoleros on occasion.
                 There were perhaps a dozen clashes leading to death or serious
                 injury during the course of the year 1933.... The pistoleros were
                 hired at a rate of ten pesetas per day, at a time when the average
## daily wage in unionized factories was about twelve. Each
                 organization reduced the individual risk to its strong-arm men by
                 maintaining hideouts, supplying false papers, and forming prisoner
                 welfare committees to aid those unfortunate enough to see the
                 inside of a jail. The occasional violence was localized in the port
                 area, and if cases came to court, they usually led to acquittal, since
## none of the witnesses could remember anything.

               Such struggles were to be waged with increasing frequency as Spain began
             to slip into civil war. The Anarchists were not the only source of social
             violence; employers, Socialists, and Communists hired pistoleros against each
             other when the need arose—only to unite in accusing the Anarchists of their
             own crimes. Of course with the FAI at its disposal, the CNT had very little
             need for professional gunmen. That faistas were prepared to use weapons
             more readily than the Socialists and Communists at this time is quite true; but
             they were not cynical paid killers who threatened to corrupt the organizations
             for which they worked. Reactionary newspapers, like the monarchist ABC,
             picked up the most triﬂing altercations in Seville and magniﬁed them
             enormously in order to terrify the middle-classes. “If a CNT worker punched a
             communist in a waterfront bar,” notes Jackson, “the Seville edition Of ABC
             reported an outbreak of lawlessness. If one of the syndicates called a general
             strike, and a few prudent shopkeepers pulled down their shutters in case
             anyone might throw a rock, ABC had the city paralyzed. Actually, life was
165 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             normal outside the port area, and the harbor districts of all the world’s
             seaports were the scenes of union rivalry and sporadic violence in the 1930s.”
                But the period of greatest violence still lay ahead; in 1931 the CNT was
             largely occupied with internal organizational problems and with deﬁning its
             strategy toward the republic. An Extraordinary National Congress was
             planned for mid-June in which these problems were to be thrashed out. This
             was to be the ﬁrst national congress of the CNT since 1919. As it turned out,
             it was to be the last one the Confederation would hold until the eve of the
             Civil War.[39] When the 418 delegates to the congress convened at the Madrid
             Conservatory on June 11, the CNT could claim a membership of over a half
             million, organized into 511 syndicates. If this seems like an inﬂated ﬁgure, as
             some writers have suggested, it should be added that many syndicates,
             particularly in the south, were too poor to send delegates. According to the
             congress’s statistics, the key Catalan Regional Confederation had no more
             than 240,000 aﬀiliates, most of whom worked in Barcelona, a membership
             decline in Catalonia of nearly 40 percent since 1919.
                The agenda for the congress had been prepared by the National Committee
             and approved by a plenum of regional delegates. Thus, it was possible for a
             number of the syndicates to debate the agenda in advance and adopt
             positions on the issues to be discussed. All this was normative CNT
             procedure, although in the past, owing to repression and the need for haste,
             the Confederation had not always adhered to it. At the congress, discussion
             centered around four issues: the National Committee’s policies during the
             dictatorship, the all-important question of the present situation in Spain, the
             need for changes in the CNT’s organizational structure, and, permeating all
             the issues discussed, the conﬂicts between the FAI and the moderates. This
             congress was a crucial one for the CNT, for it paved the way for the defeat of
             the moderates by the more radical tendencies inside the Confederation.
             Indeed, the growth of the FAI’s inﬂuence on the syndicates was to aﬀect the
             future not only of the CNT but also of the Second Republic.
                The 14-man National Committee, composed entirely of Catalans, fell under
             attack from the outset of the congress and its members responded with vigor.
             The give-and-take between individual members of the National Committee
             and the delegates was a temporary departure from the practice followed by
             previous CNT congresses. Ordinarily, the National Committee was expected to
             stand apart from debates between delegates in order to give the latter the
             widest latitude in discussion. The National Committee’s views were usually
             voiced in its reports. To cenetistas, every labor leader (even an unpaid one
             who professed to hold Anarchist views) was a potential bureaucrat who
             required continual watching. As an argument for removing Pestana from the
             editorship of Solidaridad Obrera, Buenacasa, for example, noted that the
             moderate spokesman had not engaged in his profession as a watchmaker for
             more than ﬁve years—a clear sign that he had become too entrenched in the
             CNT apparatus. It might also be recalled that Pestana, in his talk with Mola,
             voiced his outrage that the labor delegates to the comites paritarios were paid
             oﬀicials.
                The rules of the congress caused great consternation among delegates.
             Radicals complained that the rules were visibly biased against the FAI; the
             more moderate delegates, in turn, were outraged that oﬀicial representatives
166 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             of the FAI (an “outside organization”) had been admitted to the congress at
             all. Finally, when a FAI spokesman rose to express his organization’s view on
             an issue, mayhem broke loose. The FAI could have expressed its views
             through sympathetic delegates (Garcia Oliver, for example, was an authorized
             delegate from Reus), but its right to participate in the congress in an oﬀicial
             capacity was a matter of prestige. Although most of the delegates would not
             have denied the FAI a voice in the congress, its spokesman withdrew his
             request to speak, leaving the onus of suppression on the National Committee
             and the moderates.
                This sparring formed the backdrop to serious discussions on the past and
             future policies of the Confederation. Perhaps the most breathtaking session
             occurred when Juan Peiro rose to give an account of the National Committee’s
             links with the antidictatorial conspiracies of the late 1920s. Very few of the
             details had been known before, and many delegates, hearing of past
             negotiations with Liberals who were now among their most bitter enemies,
             were obviously shocked. Peiro’s report, moreover, was not a mea culpa. He
             had supported the negotiations then and he supported Pestana’s attempts to
             accommodate the CNT to the republic now. A number of speakers rose to
             denounce the National Committee and the delegates passed a resolution that
             rejected all responsibility for its past actions.
                The congress decided that the next region to select the National Committee
             should be Madrid, thereby breaking Catalonia’s longtime grip on the national
             organization. The wind, clearly, was blowing against the moderates.
                The centrist tendency in the congress, which probably included most of the
             delegates, was moving toward the left. But this should not be taken to mean
             that the FAI had gained control of the congress. True, the FAI was making
             inroads into the Catalan Regional Confederation, to which it owed its
             invitation to attend the congress. In Barcelona the FAI had planted ﬁrm roots
             in the construction syndicate and probably in the barbers’ syndicate as well.
             And when the moderates presented a minimum program for the CNT not
             unlike the reformist demands earlier congress had adopted, the Badalona
             chemical syndicate and the Barcelona light and power, chemical, and
             automobile syndicates joined the construction and barbers’ delegates in
             protest. But the minimum program was accepted by the congress
             nonetheless. Moreover, despite vigorous FAI opposition, the congress adopted
             the moderates’ reorganization plan. Essentially, the plan restored the national
             industrial craft federations which had existed in the old International. The
             committee report which proposed the plan agreed that the greater
             concentration of capital required a concomitant structural concentration of
             the CNT in the form of national federations. While the report, prepared
             primarily by Juan Peiro, did not urge any diminution in the role and authority
             of the local geographic federations, it distinctly superimposed a quasicentralistic industrial structure on the CNT. Ensuing events were to largely
             nullify the decision to establish the national industrial craft federations—
             indeed, they were not fully established until the civil war was well underway—
             but the heated debate which followed the presentation of the plan should not
             be underestimated.
                The signiﬁcance of this reorganization plan, and of the debate which
             followed its presentation, can hardly be underestimated. The plan was
167 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             classical syndicalist doctrine and the FAI, in objecting to it, Unknowingly
             recapitulated the historic battle that had divided Anarchists from syndicalists
             at the turn of the century. Garcia Oliver, speaking for the FAI, warned that the
             plan would result in the centralization of the CNT and denounced it as a
             corrupting “German invention” that reeked of beer. (The double meaning of
             Garcia Oliver’s metaphor should be noted. The FAI leader was alluding not
             only to the “Marxist” thrust of the proposal but also to the support it had
             received by German syndicalists in the IWMA.) Another delegate rose to warn
             the congress that the plan would lead to a salaried CNT oﬀicialdom. A
             generation earlier, the Italian Anarchist Errico Malatesta had voiced similar
             objections in more sophisticated and elegant terms. The objections had lost
             none of their validity over the passing years.
               Although the plan was not really applied until the Civil War it almost
             certainly reinforced the tendency toward centralization and bureaucratization
             that had existed in the CNT by identifying comunismo libertario with a
             potentially centralized economy. Depending upon how decisions ﬂowed
             between the center and base of the economy, a fragile barrier separated the
             economic structure advocated in the plan from the nationalized, bureaucratic
             economic order advocated by the Socialists. Without complete control of the
             decisionmaking process by assemblies of the factory workers, the two
             “visions” would be virtually indistinguishable. Tragically, the Confederation
             did not occupy itself with this crucial problem. On the contrary, the
             moderates’ argument that the CNT had to adapt itself to the centralist
             economy created by modern capitalism seemed highly plausible. It was to be
             echoed ﬁve years alter by Diego de Santillan, a very inﬂuential faista
             theoretician whose writings in economic reconstruction provided the CNT
             with a rationale for accepting a centralized, highly bureaucratic economy
             during the Civil War.
               Why, after voting for the moderates’ reorganization plan and minimum
             program, did the congress select Madrid as the next center of the CNT? This
             patent defeat for the moderates would be diﬀicult to explain merely in terms
             of factional voting patterns. Revolutionary fervor was welling up in the CNT
             ranks. The rapid collapse of the dictatorship and monarchy, the deepening
             economic crisis, and the restlessness of the Spanish people after a longer
             period of torpor combined to create the belief among the Anarchosyndicalists
             that a libertarian revolution was drawing near. Apparently, many delegates to
             the congress saw no contradiction between preparing for a revolution and
             voting for a minimum program that proclaimed the need for democratic
             rights, secular schools, and the right to strike. The reorganization plan of the
             moderates must have seemed all the more valuable as a concrete, practical,
             and eminently constructive alternative to capitalism which
             Anarchosyndicalists could advance in the event of a revolution.
               The FAI spoke to this vision without supporting the moderates’ plans and
             programs. It favored immediate revolution. The moderates, while oﬀering a
             concrete alternative to capitalism, denied that Spain was faced with
             revolution as an imminent prospect. Villaverde, a centrist turned moderate,
             pointedly warned the delegates: “The Confederation is in no condition to
             revolt in the historic moment in which we are living.” Like all the moderates
             he reminded the congress that Anarchosyndicalism had inﬂuence only over a
168 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             small minority of the working class. The delegates, however, seem to have
             used the moderates’ proposals to give reality to the FAI’s revolutionary
             perspective. Although the FAI’s speciﬁc proposals were defeated by the
             congress, its revolutionary spirit almost certainly infected the majority of the
             delegates.
               The government did not have to wait long to feel the impact of this growing
             revolutionary elan. A few weeks after the delegates dispersed, the CNT threw
             down the gauntlet. On July 4, thousands of CNT telephone workers walked oﬀ
             their jobs, confronting the government with what Peirats calls “un ‘test’” of
             the republic’s intentions. The strike achieved its greatest successes in
             Barcelona and Seville, where telephone service was cut oﬀ completely, but it
             also aﬀected Madrid, Valencia, and other key communications center in the
             country. Although the leaders of the telephone syndicate tried to conduct the
             strike peacefully, serious ﬁghting broke out when armed workers, probably
             spearheaded by faistas, tried to attack the telephone buildings. The strike
             quickly “degenerated into guerrilla actions” (to use Peirats’s words) between
             commando squads of CNT saboteurs and government forces. Before it tapered
             oﬀ, some 2,000 strikers had been arrested.
               This was no ordinary strike. Peirats correctly describes it as a ”‘huelga de la
             Canadiense’ en miniatura.” To clearly understand its implications, the strike
             must be placed in the context of the period. The Compania Telefonica
             National de Espana was not merely a strategic communications network but a
             huge monopoly owned by American capital. Under the dictatorship a
             subsidiary of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, the
             Compania Telefonica, had been granted a twenty-year monopoly over all
             telephonic communications in Spain. After this period, the installations owned
             by the company could revert to the government, provided that the ITTC was
             compensated for all the capital it had expended plus 15 percent interest. This
             staggering compensation had to be paid in gold. To most Spaniards, the
             Compania Telefonica was a monstrous symbol of foreign imperialism. As
             recently as 1930 the right-wing Socialist Indaledo Prieto had publicly
             denounced the contract between the company and the government, calling it
             systematic robbery and promising that the future republic would cancel its
             terms. Now Prieto was the republic’s minister of ﬁnance and Socialists
             dominated the Ministry of Labor. If the CNT was seeking to embarrass the
             republic, particularly the Socialists, it had chosen its target well.
               That the government would spare no eﬀort to resist the strike was a
             certainty. Spain had just gone to the polls to elect the Constituent Cortes, and
             Azaña was eager to show that the republic was a mature, orderly democracy.
             Prieto, who was “bending every eﬀort to assure Spain’s [foreign] creditors,
             stem the export of wealth, and arrest the downward trend of the peseta”
             (Gabriel Jackson), was more than disposed to forget his militant pledges of a
             year earlier. Thus the strike was an acute embarrassment to the government.
             The UGT, meanwhile, had its own bone to pick with the CNT. The telephone
             syndicate, which the CNT had established in 1918, was a constant challenge
             to the Socialists’ grip of the Madrid labor movement. Like the construction
             workers’ syndicate, it was a CNT enclave in a solidly UGT center. Accordingly,
             the government and the Sodalist Party found no diﬀiculty in forming a
             common front to break the strike and weaken CNT inﬂuence.

               The Ministry of Labor declared the strike illegal and the Ministry of the
             Interior called out the Civil Guard to intimidate the strikers, many of whom
             were women telephone operators. Shedding all pretense of labor solidarity,
             the UGT provided the Compania Telefonica with scabs while El Socialista, the
             Socialist Party organ, accused the CNT of being run by pistoleros. Those
             tactics were successful in Madrid, where the defeated strikers were obliged to
             enroll in the UGT in order to retain their jobs. So far as the Socialists were
             concerned, the CNT’s appeals for solidarity had fallen on deaf ears, although
             elsewhere workers responded with funds and sympathetic, if ineﬀective,
             strikes.
               In Seville, however, the strike began to take on very serious dimensions.
             Late in June, even before the telephone workers walked out, the government
             had gotten wind of an insurrectionary plot by Anarchists and disaﬀected air
             force personnel. According to the government’s account, the purpose of the
             insurrection was to prevent the forthcoming elections for the Constituent
             Cortes. This incredible conspiracy apparently included the future caudillo’s
             volatile brother, Major Ramon Franco, who had moved steadily to the left
             since his Republican days. General Sanjurjo and “loyal aviators” were
             dispatched to Seville to abort the conspiracy. Franco was arrested and the
             local commander of the aerodrome relieved of his duties. In nearby villages
             the government claimed to have found arms that Anarchists had distributed
             among the peasants.
               Scarcely had this conspiracy faded from public attention when, on July 20, a
             general strike broke out in Seville and serious ﬁghting erupted in the streets.
             This strike, which also had Communist support, stemmed from the walkout of
             the telephone workers. It is hard to judge whether the CNT, the FAI, or the
             Communists (who were following an ultrarevolutionary line in 1931) hoped to
             turn the strike into an insurrection. There are very few accounts of the Seville
             strike to be found in Anarchist sources. Again, the government professed to
             ﬁnd “evidence” that arms had been distributed to the peasants and, indeed,
             pitched battles took place in the countryside around the city between the Civil
             Guard and the agricultural workers. Maura, as minister of interior, decided to
             crush the “insurrection” ruthlessly. Martial law was declared and the CNT’s
             headquarters was reduced to shambles by artillery ﬁre. After nine days,
             during which heavily armed police detachments patrolled the streets, the
             Seville general strike came to an end. The struggle in the Andalusian capital
             left 40 dead and some 200 wounded.
               These events polarized the CNT as never before. To the moderates, the
             violent tactics of the previous weeks had produced a needless cleavage
             between the CNT and the republic—a political system which in their view had
             opened new possibihtes for Anarchosyndicalist propaganda and the
             Confederation’s growth. To the FAI, and perhaps the majority of CNT
             militants, the government’s ruthlessness in dealing with the telephone
             strikers and the Seville workers was proof that the republic was no better
             than the monarchy and the dictatorship. The FAI called for all-out social war
             against the government.
               The moderates’ eﬀorts to win the CNT away from the FAI inﬂuence became
             increasingly desperate. The tensions within the organization ﬁnally came to a
             head when in August 1931, thirty moderates signed a vigorous statement
170 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             denouncing the conspiratorial, ultrarevolutionary policies of the FAI. Although
             the FAI was not mentioned by name, “El Maniﬁesto de los ‘Treinta’”
             (“Manifesto of the ‘Thirty’”), as the document came to be known, denounced
             the Anarchist organization’s “simplistic” concept of revolution, warning that it
             would lead to “a Republican fascism.” The republic, said the Treintistas, still
             enjoyed considerable moral authority as well as armed power, and until that
             moral authority was destroyed by the government’s own corrupt and
             repressive practices, any attempted revolution if it succeeded, would lead to a
             dictatorship by ideologues. “Yes, we are revolutionaries, but not cultivators of
             the myth of revolution,” declaimed the statement.
                 We want capitalism and the State, be it red, white or black, to
                 disappear; but we do not want it to be replaced by another.... We
                 want a revolution that is born of the profound sentiment of the
                 people, not a revolution that is oﬀered to us.... The Confederation is
## a revolutionary organization and not an organization which
                 propagates abuse and riots, which propagates the cult of violence
                 for the sake of violence, revolution for the sake of revolution....
               The statement did not alter the course of the CNT. On the contrary, it
             produced widespread anger which the FAI skillfully used to isolate the
             moderate wing. The statement, in fact, was the most crucial factor in the
             downfall of Pestana, Peiro, and their followers. For years the moderates had
             obscured their skepticism toward demands for immediate revolution in vague
             generalities on their adherence to Anarchist ideals, thereby leaving the CNT
             membership unclear about the diﬀerences between the moderate wing of the
             union and the FAI. The Manifesto dispelled this obscurity completely. The
             Treintistas, it was clear, were opposed to the revolutionary tactics promoted
             by the FAI, indeed, to any CNT policy that favorably acknowledged such
             tactics. The camaraderie of common membership in the Confederation had
             been totally subordinated to visible policy diﬀerences—one moderate the
             other extremist. Mere membership in the CNT could no longer blanket such
             profound disparities in program and approach and, as Buenacasa was to point
             out by the 1930’s, it was the FAI’s adherence to a policy of immediate
             revolution that accounted for its popularity among most Anarchosyndicalist
             workers.
               An outright physical split within the CNT was now merely a matter of time.
             By September 1931 the FAI, riding on a1 rank-and-ﬁle wave of revolutionary
             enthusiasm, had gained control of Barcelona’s key syndicates; a month later,
             in October, faistas and hard-line Anarchosyndicalists unseated the moderate
             editorial board of Solidaridad Obrera and assumed control of the newspaper.
             The two wings began to trade vituperative insults—the moderates decrying
             “la dictatura de la FAI,” and the faistas sneering at the moderates as
             “traidores” and “renegados.” The following year, Pestana was to be expelled
             by his own syndicate for attacking a CNT uprising in the Llobregat valley. He
             was to be accompanied by his Treintista comrades and by several syndicates
             —a miners’ syndicate in Asturias, virtually all the syndicates of Tarassa and
             Sabadell, and about half of the syndicates in Valencia. Led by moderates,
             these syndicates were to group together to form a separate federation of their
             own—Los Sindicatos de Oposicion (Opposition Syndicates)—whose
171 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             membership probably rarely exceeded 60,000. Finally, in April 1932, Pestana,
             parting even from his moderate comrades, was to found his own Syndicalist
             Party, which actually sent two deputies to the Cortes in the elections of 1936.
             [40]
                Most writers on the Spanish labor movement seem to concur in the view
             that, with the departure of the moderates, the CNT was to fall under the
             complete domination of the FAI. Cesar M. Lorenzo, in a highly informative
             work on Spanish Anarchism, speaks of the FAI as the “masters” of the CNT.
             But is this appraisal really correct? The FAI, as we have already seen, was
             more loosely jointed as an organization than many of its admirers and critics
             seem to recognize. It had no bureaucratic apparatus, no membership cards or
             dues, and no headquarters with paid oﬀicials, secretaries, and clerks.
             According to Brenan, most of its uprisings at this time were hatched.in the
             Cafe Tranquilidad on Barcelona’s main working-class thoroughfare, although
             it seems more likely that faistas preferred to use their apartments for serious
             conspiracies. This informality is signiﬁcant as a reﬂections of the faistas’ state
             of mind. However much they behaved as an elite in the CNT, they genuinely
             dreaded bureaucracy. They jealously guarded the independence of their
             aﬀinity groups from the authority of higher organizational bodies—a state of
             mind hardly conducive to the development of tightly knit, vanguard
             organization.
                The FAI, moreover, was not a politically homogeneous organization which
             followed a ﬁxed “line” like the Communists and many Socialists. It had no
             oﬀicial program by which all faistas could mechanically guide their actions.
             Its views were usually expressed in statements by the Peninsular Committee.
             These “communiques” were highly respected by most faistas, but at least in
             the early 1930s, they made very limited demands upon the independence of
             the aﬀinity groups. Despite their hortatory accolades to Anarchist ideals and
             principles, they were usually calls to action. The FAI was not oriented toward
             theory; in fact, it produced few theoreticians of any ability. Overwhelmingly
             working class in composition and youthful in age, the organization had its fair
             share of the shortcomings as well as the admirable qualities of the proletariat
             everywhere. It placed action above ideas, courage above circumspection,
             impulse above reason and experience. Gaston Leval has described the FAI as
             the “passion of the CNT,” and Peirats, in earthier terms, as its “testicles,” but
             no one, to the knowledge of this writer, has called it the “brain” of the
             Confederation. And in the early 1930s, as Spain drifted toward civil war, what
             the FAI needed desperately was theoretical insight and understanding into its
             situation.
                Finally, in the FAI there was no consensus about how to proceed in a
             revolutionary situation. On this critical issue it contained sharply divided
             tendencies whose basic disagreements were never fully resolved. Addressing
             herself to the major tendencies within Spanish Anarchosyndicalism, Federica
             Montseney, one of the FAI’s luminaries during the Republican period and a
             scion of the Urales, a famous Anarchist family, notes three currents: “Those
             known as Treintistas, who formed the right-wing, the anarchists who formed
             the left-wing, and a third current, the ‘anarcho-Bolsheviks,’ embodied by the
             group of Garcia Oliver and the playful partisans of ‘one for all,’ who made
             glancing contact with the theories of the Russian revolutionaries.” His
172 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             statement; in fact, is rather restrained. The “partisans of ‘one for all’ “ were
             the Solidarios of the 1920s who had renamed themselves Nosotros (literally,
             “we”) in the 1930s and included not only Garcia Oliver but Durruti, the
             Ascaso brothers, and Ricardo Sanz. If we are to accept Peirats’s account of
             their views, their “contact” with Bolshevism was more than “glancing.” “It
             was Garcia Oliver who declared himself for the taking of power (prise de
             pouvoir) in a public lecture which he gave to the woodworkers’ syndicate of
             Barcelona in January or. February, 1936. He had also made this aﬀirmation
             beforehand at the very restrained meeting of notables in the editorial board of
             Solidaridad Obrera.”[41]
               This trend, to be sure, did not go unchallenged. Some of the most
             theoretically gifted and highly respected ﬁgures of the FAI sharply opposed
             Garcia Oliver’s approach. The “A” aﬀinity group, which included such
             prominent faistas as Jacinte Toryho, Alberdo Iglesias, and Ricardo Mestre,
             called for the expulsion of the Nosotros group. The Nervo group, led by Pedro
             Herrara and the Anarchist theorist Abad de Santillan, shared this hostility. It
             was joined by the “Z” group, a particularly signiﬁcant aﬀinity group because
             of its considerable inﬂuence over the libertarian youth movement of
             Catalonia.
               Yet if Garcia Oliver’s theory of “seizing power” was not acceptable to the
             FAI as a whole, there seems little doubt that the putschism implicit in this
             approach prevailed in practice from the early 1930’s onward. It is not unfair
             to say that from January 1932 to the beginning of 1933, various FAI groups
             and eventually the FAI as a whole launched a “cycle of insurrections” that,
             more than any other single factor, brought down the Azaña coalition.
               The ﬁrst of these insurrections began on January 18, 1932, in the Catalan
             mining comarcal of the Alto Llobregat. In Figols, Manresa, Berga, Salient, and
             other towns, miners and other workers seized town halls, raised the blackand-red ﬂags of the CNT, and declared comunismo libertario. After ﬁve days,
             the revolt had been all but crushed, with surprisingly little bloodshed.
             According to Peirats, Azaña, in a rare spasm of determinaton, gave the
             commanding general “ﬁfteen minutes to eliminate them [the cenetista
             workers] after the troops arrived.” Fortunately for the workers, the
             government forces in the Alto Llobregat were commanded by one Humberto
             Gil Cabrera, who did not share Azaña’s bloodthirsty aversion for the CNT. In
             this region, at least, the army’s repression was not notable for its sev^ﬁty. In
             Barcelona, however, the authorities used a sympathy strike as an excuse to
             round up hundreds of militants. The repression carried out by the Republican
             government extended well beyond Catalonia to include the Levant, Aragon,
             and Andalusia. Thousands of workers were thrown into jails and prison ships
             in the coastal cities. A month later, over a hundred militants, including Durruli
             and Francisco Ascaso, were deported to Spanish West Africa and the Canary
             Islands. Durruti was not to be released until the following autumn.
               The deportations were followed by an explosion of protest strikes, some of
             which lasted well into the spring and escalated the severity of the
             government’s repression. In Tarassa, the workers staged a small-scale replay
             of the Alto Llobregat uprisings, seizing the town hall and raising the CNT’s
             black-and-red ﬂags. The town was swept by street ﬁghting and inevitably by
             severe repression. The January uprising in the Alto Llobregat was not quite
173 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             the monumentally revolutionary action it seems to be in the descriptive
             rhetoric of Federica Montseney. Although highly localized and poorly planned,
             it was partly a calculated eﬀort by the FAI to enhance its revolutionary
             reputation among Spanish workers generally and cenetista workers in
             particular. Peirats leaves us with very little doubt on this score—and not only
             in the case of the Alto Llobregat insurrections but also in those’ which were to
             follow. “The extremists [one should read faistas here— M.B.] who expelled the
             moderates felt an obligation to be revolutionary,” Peirats observes.
                 In the debates preceding the expulsions, a polarization took place:
                 the revolution was considered to be either near or distant. The
                 pessimism of some led to a kind of optimism in others, just as the
## cowardice of one who ﬂees increases the bravery of one who
                 pursues. To prove the validity of their Accusations of impotence,
                 defeatism or treason on the part of the moderates, the extremists
                 had to prove their own virility. In the big meetings, where up to
                 100,000 people gathered, libertarian communism was declared to
                 be within everyone’s grasp. Not to believe in the imminence of
## libertarian communism was grounds for suspicion.

               In the harsh light of the January events, Pestana’s failure to support the
             FAI’s tactics, indeed his unequivocal opposition to them, was characterized as
             nothing less than treachery. It was in the aftermath of these events that he
             was replaced by the faista Manuel Rivas as secretary of the National
             Committee and ﬁnally expelled from his’ own union. At the Catalan regional
             plenum of Sabadell in April 1932, the walkout of tmViﬁsta-inﬂuenced
             syndicates initiated an outright split that extended from Catalonia, through
             the Levant, to Andalusia and Asturias. As we have already seen, the treintisla
             - inﬂuenced syndicates thereupon formed their own confederation, Los
             Sindicatos de Oposicion, with centers in Sabadell, Valencia, and Asturias.
             Despite their opposition to the FAI, the Sindicatos de Oposicion did not follow
             Pestana’s trajectory into “syndicalist” politics. In the years ahead they
             functioned primarily as an oppositional tendency on the periphery of the CNT.
               Far from cooling the FAI’s insurrectionary fever, the split that began at
             Sabadell seemed to heighten it by removing the restraining hands of the
             moderates. In January 1933, almost a year to the day after the Alto Llobregat
             events, the FAI dragged the CNT into another insurrectionary adventure. This
             insurrection was to be initiated by a railway strike of the CNT’s Federation
             National de la Industria Ferroviaria (FNIF). But the FNIF, riddled with
             uncertainty and organizationally uncoordinated, kept delaying its decision on
             a strike date. The FAI, eager to initiate an insurrection, became increasingly
             impatient. As for the CNT’s leadership, it simply drifted along with events.
             Virtually all insurrectionary initiatives were left to the FAI-controlled
             Committees of Defense, a euphemism for the elaborate committee structure
             composed of Cadres of Defense at local, comarcal, and national levels which
             Anarchist action groups had created under the umbrella of the CNT and FAI
             to conduct miltary operations. Indeed, so closely wedded had the CNT and
             FAI become after the split within the Confederation that Manuel Rivas, the
             secretary of the CNT’s National Committee, was also secretary of the faistacontrolled National Committee of Defense.

                Throughout, the police were completely informed about the FAI’s plans and
             prepared meticulously to counter them. The insurrection began on January 8
             with assaults by Anarchist action groups and Cadres of Defense on
             Barcelona’s military barracks. The Anarchists had expected support from
             segments of the army rank and ﬁle, but the attacks had been anticipated by
             the authorities and they were repelled with’bloodshed and arrests. Serious
             ﬁghting occurred in working-class barrios and outlying areas of Barcelona,
             but the struggle was doomed to defeat. Uprisings occurred in Tarassa,
             Sardanola, Ripollet, Lleida, in several pueblos in Valencia province, and in
             Andalusia. They too were crushed without diﬀiculty. In Catalonia, virtually
             every leading/aisﬄ, including Garcia Oliver and most members of the FAI’s
             Peninsular Committee, were arrested. The event was a total calamity. With a
             certain measure of justice, the CNT denied any part in the insurrection,
             implicitly blaming the FAI for the disaster. Even the old Anarchist Buenacasa
             bluntly dissociated Anarchism itself from the FAI’s tactics by angrily
             declaring: “El faismo and not anarchism provoked the happenings of last
             January 8 in Barcelona....” In any case, whether or not one regards the FAI’-s
             insurrectionary fever as creditable, the organization made no attempt to deny
             its responsibility for the January events.
                Despite the defeat, the FAI’s insurrectionary mood had slowly percolated
             into some of the most remote pueblos of Andalusia where a millenarian
             ambience, dating back to a bygone age in the history of Spanish Anarchism,
             still existed among a number of the peasants. Here, another uprising
             inadvertently had a profound impact on the destiny of the Azaña coalition. In
             Casas Viejas, a small, impoverished pueblo not far from Jerez de la Frontera,
             there still existed an Anarchist “dynasty” headed by a venerable old man in
             his sixties nicknamed Seisdedos, or “Six Fingers,” who had heard of the
             uprisings elsewhere in Spain. Inspired by these events, Seisdedos decided
             that the time had ﬁnally arrived to proclaim comutiismo libertario. The old
             man, his friends, and his relatives—in all a party of little more than thirty—
             proceeded to arm themselves with cudgels and shotguns and take over the
             village. Accounts vary from this point onward. According to Brenan, Seisdedos
             and his party naively marched to the Civil Guard barracks to proclaim the
             glad tidings. The Guardia, more alarmed than elated by this party of armed
             peasants, proceeded to exchange shots with Seisdedos, who accordingly
             besieged them. Eventually, Seisdedos and his group were turned from
             besiegers into besieged when troops and even airplanes attacked the pueblo,
             brutally exterminating most of them.
                Peirats presents a diﬀerent account. After Seisdedos and his party had
             proclaimed comunismo libertario (presumably to the village at large) all “was
             peace and order until the police arrived.”
                 They came into the village shooting. Several were left dead in the
                 streets. Then they went into the houses and began to line up
                 prisoners. In the process they came to a hut with a roof of straw and
                 dry branches. They break in. A shot is heard, and a soldier spins.
                 Another shot and another soldier falls. Another is wounded as he
                 attempts to sneak in through the yard. The rest retreat. Who is
                 inside? Old ‘Sixﬁngers,’ a sixty year old with a tribe of children and

                  grandchildren. The old man will not give up. The others cannot
                  leave without getting hurt. The guards take their positions and
                  receive reinforcements. They use their machine guns and hand
                  grenades. Sixﬁngers does not give in. He saves his shots and uses
                  them well. Two more guards fall. The struggle lasts all night. Two of
                  the children escape, covered in their retreat by someone who dies
                  riddled with bullets. Dawn is coming and they want to end it once
                  and for all. The hand grenades bounce back, or their impact is
                  cushioned by the thatched roof. The bullets are blocked by the
                  stones. Somebody has an idea. They gather rags, handfuls of cotton,
                  and make balls with them, which they dip in gasoline. Red ﬂashes
                  break the darkness like meteors. The roof crackles and turns into a
                  torch. Soon ﬂames envelop the hut. The machine guns smell blood.
                  Someone comes out, a burning girl. The machine guns leap and
                  leave little ﬁres burning on the ground that smell of burnt ﬂesh. The
                  hut, like an enormous pyre, soon collapses. A sinister cry, a mixture
## of pain, anger, and sarcasm, echos through the night. And
## afterwards the quiet silence of the coals. It was over.

                The Casas Viejas aﬀair stirred the country to its depths.[42] The image of
             heavily armed Civil Guards and contingents of the newly formed Assault
             Guards—the latter ostensibly paragons of Republican legality—wantonly
             murdering simple, impoverished peasants in a grossly unequal struggle
             aroused indignation in almost every sector of Spanish society. Initially the
             government had tried to palm oﬀ the event as a mere episode in its chronic
             war against the lawless Anarchists, but word had spread that no quarter was
             given to prisoners captured by the Guards. Some fourteen such prisoners had
             been shot in cold blood by a platoon of Assault Guards under the command of
             a Captain Rojas. The right gleefully joined the left in condemning the Casas
             Viejas event and the government, its back to the wall, was obliged to
             investigate the aﬀair. Captain Rojas was tried and his statements implicated
             the director general of security in a series-of unsavory orders that were
             directly traceable to Azaña. The orders “from above,” a subject that was
             treated rather evasively, called upon Rojas to take no wounded and no
             prisoners. The Guards were ordered to “shoot for the belly.”
                Although the Casas Viejas aﬀair did not in itself bring down the Azaña
             coalition, it crystallized all the frustrations, resentments, and barbarities that
             ﬁnally caused the government to resign nine months later. The Liberal
             republic which had begun so brightly and enthusiastically a few years earlier,
             had satisﬁed nobody precisely because it followed the path of least resistance
             —a path which, as Brenan astutely observes, proved to be the path of greatest
             resistance. The government’s dilemma was obvious almost from the start of
             its career: it depended on the middle classes and working classes to maintain
             the facade of Republican virtue, but it could gain the support of one class only
             at the expense of the other. In time, the republic lost the support of both
             classes simply by trying to steer a course between them.
                Lacking satisfaction in the Azaña coalition, the Spanish middle classes
             moved increasingly to the right in the hope that Ariarchist violence and labor
             disorders generally would be deﬁnitely repressed. Translated into crass

             economic terms, this meant that the Spanish bourgeoisie and petty
             bourgeoisie, victimized by the world depression of the 1930s, saw its only
             hope for economic respite in a disciplined, well-mannered, and obedient
             proletariat whose economic needs would not be too demanding, or impose too
             grave a strain upﬀn proﬁt. Azaña tried to demonstrate to the bourgeoisie that
             working-class collaboration could be achieved by means of political, religious,
             and triﬂing economic reforms. Ultimately, despite Socialist support, his “New
             Deal” for Spain failed miserably and the middle classes veered rightward
             toward parties that promised a stern government that could safeguard
             property and provide safety to the propertied classes.
               It may well have been that Azaña himself entertained precisely such a stern
             perspective in the closing months of his stewardship. As Gabriel Jackson
             points out, “he conﬁded to his diary that deputies of three diﬀerent parties
             were proposing a dictatorship as the only solution to continued anarchist
             risings, and that friends as well as enemies of the Republic were saying that
             things could not go on this way indeﬁnitely.” One might even suspect that the
             Socialist bureaucrats on whom Azaña relied as perhaps the ﬁrmest pillar of
             the liberal republic would learn to adapt themselves to such a dictatorship,
             for they had proved themselves remarkably supple under Primo de Rivera.
             But the same economic and political forces that were pushing the Spanish
             middle classes to the right were also pushing the Socialist rank and ﬁle to the
             left. This single fact was crucial. Pressured by Anarchist militancy, by the
             newly recruited rural masses, and by the underlying instability of the
             economy, even such tried reformists as Largo Caballero began to veer to the
             left, if only to retain their inﬂuence over their own parties. To this growing
             radical constituency, the Azaña coalition was a pathetic anachronism, a ruin
             from a more romantic era when social” harmony seemed to be a greater
             desideratum than class war.
               Finally, the most conspicuous weakness of the Azaña coalition was its
             inability to resolve Spain’s historic agrarian problem. Obsessed with legality
             and prudence, the reparto had been slowed to a snail’s pace. Casas Viejas
             summed up what every Republican knew with aching intensity: the peninsula
             was on the brink of a peasant war. What must have struck home almost as
             poignantly as the barbarities of the Guards was the desperation of the
             peasants. No less sensational than newspaper photographs of strewn bodies
             was the evidence of the misery that had driven these peasants to sacriﬁce
             their lives in so uneven and hopeless a struggle. At Casas Viejas, the Azaña
             coalition had shown that it could neither produce order without barbarity nor
             accept barbarity as a means of producing order. Extravagant in repressing
             rebellious villages, it foundered before a country that was swelling with
             revolution.
               The Spanish Anarchists for their part not only dramatically exposed the
             Azaña coalition’s vulnerabilities at Casas Viejas; they continued their pressure
             against the republic through more conventional methods. Although the CNT
             had been declared an illegal organization after the events of January 1932,
             the Confederation regained suﬀicient strength in the spring of 1933 to launch
             on the most massive strike waves in its history. A plenum of regional
             Confederations at Madrid in late January and early February resolved to
             launch a general strike on behalf of amnesty for prisoners and freedom for

             closed-down and outlawed syndicates and periodicals, and against compulsory
             arbitration of labor disputes. It can hardly be emphasized too strongly that to
             a considerable extent, what has so facilely been described as FAI and CNT
             “adventurism” was a struggle for survival against the republic’s favored
             treatment of the Socialists.
               The UGT, openly abetted by Socialist ministers, civil servants, and their
             arbitration juries, had made serious inroads into traditional
             Anarchosyndicalist areas. The CNT had no choice but to reveal the Socialists,
             not only the Treintistas, as reformists, a “task which was largely spearheaded’
             by the much-maligned FAI. The popularity the FAI enjoyed among the more
             militant cenetistas in the early 1930s was not merely the product of social and
             economic instability in Spain, but stemmed in no small measure from the
             FAI’s willingness to do many of the risky and thankless tasks which the staid
             CNT leaders were reluctant to undertake on behalf of their own syndicates.
             Mistaken as it surely was in so many of its tactics, the FAI was often more illserved by CNT leaders (and by recent historians of Spanish Anarchism) than
             was the CNT by/ai’sta. “adventurism.”
               CNT strikes now swept through Catalonia. In mid-April the potash miners
             walked out in Cardcjna, followed a fe’w days later by the building workers in
             Barcelona. Shortly afterward, the dock workers went on strike. Before the
             spring was out, the city and eventually the country had been rocked by a
             general strike of nearly all CNT syndicates. Together with these strikes, the
             CNT launched a massive campaign to release imprisoned CNT-FAI militants
             whose numbers had now soared to about 9,000. The campaign was marked by
             immense demonstrations and rallies. In September, this movement reached its
             peak with a monster rally of 60,000 cenetistas in Barcelona’s huge bull ring.
             The word “amnesty” appeared everywhere—on posters, as headlines in CNTFAI periodicals, and on banners in the hands of demonstrators, although no
             amnesty was declared up to the last days of the Azaña coalition. Although
             there was little doubt that the right would win the forthcoming elections,
             Azaña was vindictive enough to turn these immense numbers of
             Anarchosyndicalist prisoners over to his reactionary opponents.
               Ultimately, far more telling in its eﬀect than the strikes was the “No Votad”
             campaign that the Confederation launched as the November elections drew
             near. From its printing presses, centros obreros, and syndicate oﬀices, the
             CNT, eagerly assisted by the FAI, initiated an anti-electoral campaign
             unprecedented in the history of both organizations. On November 5, at an
             immense anti-electoral rally of 75,000 workers in the Barcelona bull ring,
             Durruti shouted: “Workers, you who voted yesterday without considering the
             consequences: if they told you that the Republic was going to jail 9,000
             working men, would you have voted?” The question, by this time, was almost
             rhetorical; the crowd roared back a vigorous “No!”
               This meeting was merely the culmination of months of smaller rallies in
             almost every city, town, and pueblo within the reach of the CNT; it
             represented the high point of a poster and press campaign whose essential
             message, besides “amnesty,” was “No Votad.” The Socialists, who had turned
             against Azaña by now and decided to launch their own independent electoral
             campaign, were bluntly rebuﬀed in their eﬀorts to gain Anarchosyndicalist
             votes. Warnings that a rightist victory would be followed by a fascist regime
178 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             evoked a fairly characteristic (and, to this day, alluringly simplistic) reply:
             fascism would at least compel the proletariat to rise in revolution, whereas a
             reformist victory would simply lead to a piecemeal but ultimately more
             debilitating repression. A victory by the right was, in fact, now guaranteed not
             only by Azaña’s unpopularity but by the stormy anti-electoral campaign of the
             Anarchosyndicalists. At a FAI plenum held in Madrid during the last days of
             October, the delegates pressed the need to prepare for an uprising after the
             elections. The Peninsular Committee warned that “If the [anti-electoral]
             campaign yields practical results, the FAI must throw itself into the struggle
             that would follow a rightist victory.” Accordingly, the delegates at the plenum
             resolved that “the upsurge of all our eﬀectives into Social Revolution must be
             our answer to any possible reactionary outbreak.” Around the same time, a
             CNT plenum of Regional Confederations, also held in Madrid, adopted a
             similar resolution: “That if the fascist tendencies win in the elections, and for
             this or some other reason, the people become impassioned, the CNT has the
             responsibility of pushing on this popular desire in order to forge its goal of
             libertarian communism.”
             Chapter Ten: The Road to Revolution
             El Bienio Negro
                The parliamentary elections of November 19, 1933, brought an
             overwhelming victory to the right and ushered in what the Spanish labor
             movement was to call el bienio negro—the two black years. Yet despite this
             harsh characterization, the period generally fell far short of the fearful
             prognoses advanced by the labor movement. Newly organized fascist groups
             such as the JONS and the Falange, the latter led by Jose Antonio Primo de
             Rivera, the dictator’s charismatic son, had supported the right. They supplied
             it with a suﬀicient amount of street thuggery to arouse fears that Spain was
             following the same path that had just brought the Nazis to power in Germany.
             But the Falange, even after it had absorbed the fascistic JONS, (Juntas de
             Ofensiva National Sindicalista), barely numbered 3,000 members. Despite the
             adulation the young Primo de Rivera aroused amOTg reactionary university
             students and aristocratic youth, his inﬂuence on larger sections of the
             Spanish population was negligible.
                The real victors of November consisted largely of indecisive coalitions of the
             center as well as the right, notably Alejandro Lerroux’s opportunistic Radicals
             and Jose Maria Gil Robles’s CEDA (Confederation Espatiola de Derechos
             Autonomos, or Confederation of Autonomous Right Parties), a coalition of
             Catholic and Monarchist groups that mouthed the reactionary platitudes of
             “Religion,” “Family,” “Fatherland,” “Work,” “Order,” and “Property” against
             secularism, labor “disorders,” and “anarchy.” The CEDA, with 110 seats,
             became the largest single party in the Cortes, followed by the Radicals with
             100 seats. Gil Robles’s coalition acquired its support primarily from
             industrialists, landowners, Carlist peasants, clerics, and devout Catholics, no
             small number of whom were newly enfranchised women who voted according
             to the dictates of their local priests. The Radical Party mustered most of its
179 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             votes from anti-Socialist urban middle classes. The greatest parliamentary
             problem facing the CEDA and the Radicals was the need, ﬁrst, to allay the
             fears of troubled Liberals who, while drifting to the right, were deeply
             mistrustful of Gil Robles’s reactionary and military connections, and second,
             perhaps more seriously, to reconcile the devoutly Catholic CEDA with the
             traditionally anticlerical Radicals.
               The new regime began by trying to keep Gil Robles in the background and
             thrusting Lerroux forward as prime minister. Lerroux, a pure adventurer,,
             occupied himself by replacing one demagogic personality with another. The
             anticleric of yesteryear became a1 guardian of the church. In fairly rapid
             order the Lerroux ministry restored most of the clerical salaries which the
             Constituent Cortes guided by Azaña had abolished, also returning substantial
             church properties which that Cortes had conﬁscated. Church schools were
             reopened and any objectionable anticlerical legislation which was not directly
             repealed was simply ignored.
               Having made its peace with the church, the new ministry began an
             unconscionable assault upon the meager social legislation enacted by the
             Constituent Cortes. Agrarian reform, limited as it was, came to a dead halt.
             Pro-industry chairmen replaced Largo Caballero’s prolabor (more precisely,
             pro-Socialist) appointees. Agricultural wage increases achieved under the
             Azaña coalition were rolled back 40–50 percent and, as if to warn the
             peasants and workers of the futility of resistance, the number of Civil Guards
             was increased by a thousand. The cabinet even tried to restore the death
             penalty, but its eﬀorts were frustrated by the Cortes.
               Despite the harshness of the Lerroux program, it failed miserably. Like the
             Azaña coalition, the new ministry satisﬁed no one on the right and served only
             to increase the militancy of the left. Lerroux became snarled in sharp disputes
             over attempts to grant amnesty to the Sanjurjo military conspirators who had
             risen earlier in Seville. He was replaced by another Radical, Ricardo Samper,
             who, in turn, found himself beleaguered by the problems of Basque and
             Catalan nationalism, by contraband arms that were ﬂowing into the country
             and reaching the left as well as the right (even the old Socialist right-winger,
             Indajecio Prieto, was involved in smuggling arms into Asturias), by gunplay
             between Falangists, Socialists, and Anarchists, and ﬁnally by the CEDA’s
             threat to deny the Radical ministry its vote of conﬁdence if it was denied posts
             in the cabinet.
               Whether or not right and center parties on their own could have won the
             November elections, this much is certain: the Anarchosyndicalist antielectoral campaign had contributed decisively to the magnitude of their
             victory. The abstentionist propaganda of the CNT and FAI had been conducted
             under the slogan: “Frente a las urnas, la revolution social”—“Before ballot
             boxes, social revolution.” Having advanced revolution as the alternative to
             parliamentary reform, the Anarchosyndicalists now had to deliver the goods.
             But could they do so? The January insurrections of 1932 and 1933.had taken
             their toll in thousands of imprisoned militants, depleted resources, and
             lowered morale. At a plenum of regional confederations held in October, most
             of the delegates probably opposed an uprising, “but not openly,” as A.M.
             Lehning reported. Only a few delegations, most notably the Aragonese,
             pressed for an uprising. The other delegations merely promised to give what
180 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             aid they could. This lagging of enthusiasm was portentous. Failure was being
             built into the insurrection well in advance of its occurrence and, given the
             lack of any tactical sense of timing and resources, rhetoric was being oﬀered
             as a substitute for even the most remote possibility of success. It is
             noteworthy that Garcia Oliver, who had been so instrumental in fomenting
             earlier faista uprisings, broke openly with Durruti for the ﬁrst time by
             attacking an insurrection as absurd.
                The uprising was timed for December 8, 1933, the opening day of the new
             Cortes. In Barcelona, it began with a spectacular prison break in which many
             militants who had been imprisoned for participating in the Tarassa events
             tunnelled their way to freedom. The government, alert to the
             Anarchosyndicalist plans, headed oﬀ strikes by declaring a state of
             emergency, arresting leading cenetistas and faistas, imposing press
             censorship, and closing down the syndicates. Similar steps were taken in
             Madrid and other possible insurrectionary centers. In Valencia, where the
             Opposition Syndicates exercised considerable inﬂuence, the strike orders of
             the CNT’s National Committee were largely ignored.
                Only Aragon rose on any signiﬁcant scale, particularly Saragossa, where
             faista notables such as Durruti, Isaac Puente, and Cipriano Mera had gone to
             organize the insurrection. Again, the government acted decisively to forestall
             an uprising; on the night of the eighth, nearly a hundred militants (including
             Durruti, Puente, and Mera) were arrested. Deprived of their ablest people, the
             workers nevertheless reared barricades, attacked public buildings, and
             engaged in heavy street ﬁghting. But the uprising was disorganized and
             quickly subdued. Following the pattern of previous insurrections, many
             villages declared libertarian communism and perhaps the heaviest ﬁghting
             took place between the vineyard workers in Rioja and the authorities. Within
             four days, the entire insurrectionary movement was crushed. Perhaps the
             most noteworthy break in the faista pattern of ill-prepared rising, sporadic
             conﬂicts, shortlived localized victories, and swift triumphs by the army
             occurred in Villanueva de Serena, where a group of soldiers under a Sergeant
             Sopena joined the insurrection. For the rest, Anarchosyndicalist militants
             were arrested in the thousands, their presses stopped, and their syndicates
             closed down.
                According to Brenan, “What was remarkable about this rising was that for
             the ﬁrst time in Spain clear instructions were issued for a social revolution.
             Mills and factories were taken over by the workers, and factory committees
             set up. Other committees for food, transport and so on were organized on the
             lines set down by Kropotkin. The rising was regarded as a rehearsal for the
             coming revolution, if not as the actual beginning of it.” Perhaps—but I have
             found nothing exceptional about the December uprising as compared with its
             predecessors. Wherever possible, earlier insurrections had carried out
             industrial and agrarian takeovers and established committees for workers’
             and peasants’ control, libertarian systems of logistics and distribution—in
             short, a miniature society “organized on the lines set.down by Kropotkin.”
             Indeed, what is perhaps most striking about the December uprising is the
             extent to which it was localized in Aragon, the palpable lack of enthusiasm for
             it, and the opposition it encountered from ﬂagging militants like Garcia Oliver.
                In any case, with the December uprising, the Anarchist-led “cycle of
181 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             insurrections” had come to its end. Azaña himself virtually admitted that
             these insurrections contributed to his downfall. The electoral abstentionist
             campaign had also contributed to the victory of the Radicals and the CEDA.
             For better or worse, Anarchosyndicalism had proven itself the force most like
             to exacerbate polarization, labor unrest, and social disequilibrium in Spain. To
             condemn the Anarchists for producing “anarchy” is simply silly; for the more
             idealistic Anarchists not to foment unrest, revolutionary upheavals, and
             ultimately social revolution would have been completely out of character. One
             can snicker at their tactics, naivete, and recklessness but more than any other
             single force in Spain they had shattered the facade of liberalism and paved
             the way for an historic confrontation between the great contending social
             classes in the peninsula.
                As for the December revolt, far from being “a rehearsal for the coming
             revolution,” it was the most destructive exercise in futility ever, undertaken by
             the CNT and FAI. Indeed, it signiﬁcantly eroded the ﬁghting power of the two
             organizations. Perhaps the example set by the uprising succeeded in fostering
             the militancy of the growing left factions in the Socialist Party, but apart from
             strike actions and terrorism, it completely exhausted the movement.
             Henceforth, the Spanish Anarchists were to occupy themselves primarily with
             recovering their forces and uniting their ranks. The initiative for revolutionary
             action in Spain was to pass to the Socialist left, particularly to the Asturian
             miners and the newly converted peasants of the south. The great October
             Insurrection in the mining districts of Asturias was drawing near—and with it,
             the real “rehearsal for the coming revolution....” But in this “rehearsal,” the
             institutions of neither the UGT nor the CNT played a signiﬁcant role as such;
             rather, the workers were the principal sources of revolutionary initiative. In
             this respect these workers behaved as Anarchists even when they were
             avowedly committed to Socialism.
                The CNT and FAI, to be sure, were still intact, despite the arrests, losses,
             and disorganization they had suﬀered over the previous two years. Even
             Saragossa, which had suﬀered the heaviest casualties in the December
             uprising, had not lost its celebrated fervor and militancy. In April the
             Aragonese city was paralyzed by one of the most extraordinary general strikes
             to occur in the stormy history of the Spanish labor movement—a strike lasting
             nearly ﬁve weeks whose spirit of self-sacriﬁce, solidarity, and tenacity reached
             heroic proportions. The strike was occasioned by acts of police brutality
             which followed the explosion of a bomb in front of the police headquarters.
             The two-day protest strike which followed the mistreatment of arrested
             workers was extended into a 36-day general strike when several bus and tram
             drivers who refused to return to work were deprived of their licenses. Before
             the week was out, industry, transportation, and nearly all services in
             Saragossa were at a complete standstill.
                Typically, the civil governor compounded the crisis by declaring the strike
             illegal and calling out the troops. The workers, more determined than ever,
             doggedly continued to stay put despite enormous material sacriﬁces. The
             entire CNT, particularly the Catalan Regional Confederation, now rallied
             behind its Saragossa comrades. To lighten the burden of the Saragossa
             workers, the Barcelona proletariat under Durruti organized a spectacular
             caravan to bring the children of the strikers to Catalonia. Fleets of taxis were
182 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             mobilized to convey 13,000 children to the thousands of cenetista families
             which had pledged to care for them. Here, as Brenan observes, the cenetistas
             revealed where their real strength lay: “not in their armed revolts, but in their
             powers of syndical resistance.... When one remembers that’ the CNT had no
             strike funds, one can appreciate the courage and endurance required in these
             contests. If the Anarcho-Syndicalists could not bring oﬀ their revolution, they
             at all events knew how to keep a revolutionary situation alive.”
               By now a new issue began to come to the fore. The Socialists, pressured by
             the example of Anarchist intransigence, by hundreds of thousands of newly
             recruited, often feverishly militant rural workers, disillusioned by their
             alliance with the Liberals, and fearful of what seemed like a drift toward
             fascism in the government, began to raise the cry for an Alianza Obrera—(or a
             “united front” of all the labor organizations in Spain. This Alianza, so
             characteristic of policies that began to prevail among leftist political groups in
             Europe and America during the mid-1930s, particularly after a bitterly
             conﬂicted German left had capitulated to Hitler, was to be advanced by Largo
             Caballero. The slogan, in fact, had been raised as early as October 1933,
             when Pestana, on behalf of the Treintistas, spelled out the need for an
             “entente,” a “coalition” of the UGT and CNT to stop fascism in Spain. Peiro, in
             elucidating this position, emphasized that the Alianza Obrera was not to be
             conceived as an electoral pact, indeed, that it implied direct action in
             opposition to fascism and on behalf of a “Federalist Social Republic.” A pact
             between factions of the Catalan left had, in fact, come into existence shortly
             after the December uprising of the Anarchists, but it did not include the CNT
             or the FAI who were wary of the new “allies.” Experience had nurtured a deep
             mistrust among the Anarchists toward the UGT, the Opposition Syndicates,
             the Socialist Party aﬀiliates of Barcelona, Maurin’s Worker-Peasant Bloc,
             Nin’s Left Communists, and the union of the vineyard workers in Catalonia,
             the Rabassaires, who were under the control Luis Companys’s liberal
             nationalist party, the Esquerra. To the degree that these disparate, generally
             authoritarian groups formed an alliance, the Anarchists could regard it only
             as a mischievous one which had to be shunned.
               Not unexpectedly, the Alianza received considerable support from the
             moderate CNT in Asturias. Largo Caballero’s drift to the left after the
             elections of 1933 had made a pact with the UGT more seductive than ever.
             Although the CNT as a whole retained its hostility toward the alliance, at a
             June plenum of regional confederations its opposition was modiﬁed to allow
             for agreements with the UGT on a local level. This qualiﬁcation simply ratiﬁed
             an independent alliance which the Asturian CNT had made four months
             earlier with the local UGT, thereby setting the stage for the forthcoming
             October uprising of the Asturian miners. Oﬀicially, however, and to a large
             degree in practice, the CNT preserved its aloofness toward the Alianza. In
             early autumn, the CNT, apart from its Asturian confederation, responded to a
             spate of Alianza -inspired strikes with qualiﬁed support at best or with total
             indiﬀerence. The Alianza Obrera had much less magnetism than has been
             imputed to it in many discussions of the Spanish labor movement. Even
             Maurin of the Worker-Peasant Bloc failed to “recall the enthusiasm attributed
             to him in Brenan’s account,“observes Gabriel Jackson in a note based on an
             interview with Maurin. “He spoke of the Alianza as having been crippled from
183 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             the start by antipathy between Caballero and the Catalans, nor does El
             Socialista [the organ of the Spanish Socialist Party’—M.B.] for the spring and
             summer of 1934 give the impression that the new movement was very
             important.”
               The status of the Alianza Obrera, however, was to change signiﬁcantly in
             October 1934. As autumn approached, a heightened sense of militancy,
             paralleling the trajectory of the Spanish labor movement, began to sweep
             over the right. Internal pressures on Gil Robles to stake out the CEDA’s
             ministerial claims on the Ricardo Semper government, which had resisted the
             entry of the CEDA into the cabinet, mounted steadily. With the convening of
             the Cortes on October 1, the CEDA, demanding seats in the cabinet,
             dramatically toppled the Radical government. Despite his profound hostility to
             Gil Robles, President Alcala Zamora had no choice but to accede to the
             CEDA’s demands. Shortly after the cabinet crisis, the president called upon
             Lerroux to form a second cabinet, this time one in which the CEDA would be
             granted three ministries.
               Today, looking back after more than forty years, it is diﬀicult to convey the
             impact this concession had on the Spanish left. The CEDA, a Catholic party
             supported largely by funds from rabidly reactionary Monarchist contributors,
             seemed to be the exact Spanish cour^erpart of the Austrian Catholics who
             had raised Dollfuss to power in the early 1930s. Only shortly before the CEDA
             had received seats in the cabinet, Dollfuss had proclaimed himself virtual
             dictator of Austria and his ascent to power had been marked by the harsh
             suppression of a Socialist uprising in Vienna after a week of severe street
             ﬁghting. Artillery had been callously turned on the Karl Marx houses, a
             cooperative complex of workers’ dwellings in the Austrian capital. Among the
             Socialists the cry quickly went up, “Better Vienna than Berlin,” an
             unmistakable allusion to the fact that the hopeless but courageous resistance
             of the Austrian proletariat to fascism was better than the supine acquiescence
             of the German left to Hitler.
               The crisis triggered by the CEDA’s entry into the cabinet was not limited to
             the Socialists. It also had its echo among the Catalan autonomists. Despite the
             large Lliga delegation in the Cortes, representing the victory of the
             conservative Catalan industrialists in the 1933 elections, the Catalan
             Generalitat which governed the province on a local level was controlled by
             Luis Companys’s Esquerra (the Catalan Left), an autonomist middle-class
             movement whose views, under Companys’s inﬂuence, were more closely
             wedded to Azaña’s Republicans than to the separatist tendencies within
             Catalan nationalism. The Esquerra had come to power in the local elections
             that followed the 1933 ﬁasco, after many Catalan cenetistas had second
             thoughts about the impact of their anti-electoral campaign and had voted, at
             least locally, for Liberal groups. Under Companys, the Esquerra had begun to
             abandon the unequivocally separatist policies of its founder, Colonel Macia
             (who died in December 1933) and was in the process of orienting itself toward
             autonomy within the Spanish republic. Companys, a shrewd politician, had
             acquired a certain status as a crypto-radical. At considerable personal risk, he
             had used his legal talents to defend many cenetista militants in the trials of
             the 1920s. Perhaps more than any republican politician in Spain, he retained
             important connections and undeservedly high credibility with the CNT
184 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             leadership long after liberals of his breed were to be completely discredited
             with the Spanish working class.
                In Catalonia, Companys was also a major rival of the CNT. He competed
             with the Anarchosyndicalists by organizing tenant farmers of the vineyards
             into the Union de Rabassaires, an Esquerra-controlled trade union. The
             Esquerra, to retain its inﬂuence in the rural areas of the province, had
             promoted and passed a ley ‘de cultivos in the Generalitat empowering
             vineyard tenants whose leases were expiring to acquire title to land they had
             cultivated for ﬁfteen years or more. Completely regional in character, this law
             was conﬁned exclusively to Catalonia; it had been passed by a provincial
             authority whose political interests were limited to local concerns. Yet in June
             1933, even this circumscribed piece of legislation was so antithetical to
             Madrid’s conservative agrarian policies that it was overturned by the Tribunal
             of Constitutional Guarantees, the Spanish equivalent of the American
             Supreme Court. By voting against the ley de cultivos the court upheld not only
             the landlords against the tenants, but the power of Madrid to curb regionalist
             legislation. Even the conservative, strongly Catholic Basque deputies to the
             Cortes protested, all the more because they had been repaid for their support
             of Lerroux and the CEDA with frustrating indiﬀerence toward a proposed
             Basque autonomy statute.
                The Basques now threw their support to the Catalan Left on the Rabassaires
             law. Their action was a portent of the future Popular Front alignment of 1936,
             which was to unite Basque conservatives, the Catalan Left, the Azaña
             Republicans, the Socialists, and the Communists in an ill-ﬁtting electoral bloc
             against reaction and the threat of fascism. The CEDA’s ministerial demands
             had divided even the Radicals. Samper, the out-going Radical prime minister,
             warned darkly on October 1: “Confronted by a period of oppression and
             shame, no way out remains except for a revolutionary outbreak. If Gil Robles’
             forces of the Right do not evince any understanding [of the emerging
             situation], the road to legality will be removed.”
                This verbal saber-rattling should not be taken too seriously. As events were
             to show, for most Radicals, indeed even for Companys, it was mere rhetoric.
             Companys, urged by his followers to pursue an insurrectionary course after
             the ley de cultivos had been overturned by the courts, was more the victim of
             a crisis within the Esquerra than within the Cortes. Sections of the Esquerra,
             itself a bloc of disparate elements, had been moving toward their own version
             of militancy. The escamots (or squads), a quasi-fascistic, paramilitary youth
             group of the Esquerra, exerted mounting pressure on Companys and his
             moderates to seize power and declare an independent Catalan republic. Led
             by Jose Dencas, a councilor of public order who detested the CNT and FAI, the
             escamots had begun to occupy portions of Barcelona in open deﬁance of the
             vacillating Companys. Together with other separatists, they demanded a
             clear-cut separation of Catalonia from Madrid.
                Companys, in the meantime, was secretly making frantic telephone calls to
             the president of the republic in Madrid (who did not respond to them
             personally), warning Alcala Zamora’s secretary that he could not contain the
             Rabassaires on the left and the escamots on the right. Huge crowds collected
             before the building that housed the Generalitat, demanding decisive action;
             indeed, Barcelona was placarded with demands for an independent Catalonia.

             The situation had degenerated to opera bouﬀe. Companys, his back to the
             wall, went through the public motions of declaring a “Catalan State within the
             Federal Spanish Republic” (a far cry from the outright independence the
             crowds were clamoring for) and quickly barricaded himself inside the
             Generalitat building, awaiting rescue by the central government’s troops. A
             “surrender” with “dignity” was arranged at dawn and Companys was provided
             with the safety of a prison cell on charges of “rebellion.” Dencas, whether
             because he scented failure, as Jackson observes, or because he had been a
             CEDA agent provocateur, as Brenan argues, took to his heels across the
             frontier and ﬁnally found political asylum in Mussolini’s Italy.
               It is important to stress these events because they exercised a profound
             inﬂuence on Anarchist policy during the October Insurrection of the Asturian
             miners. As a scenario of things to come, they provide a remarkable image of
             how the Liberals, whether in Madrid or Catalonia, were to respond to the
             more serious military rebellion of July 1936. Irresolution, paralyzing panic,
             and above all, a greater fear of the working classes than of any threat posed
             by reaction, had been the ingrained traits of Liberal behavior. As for the
             Catalan autonomists and separatists, they had hoped to achieve their goals by
             riding on the crest of a general strike initiated by the Socialists. This strike,
             called oﬀicially in the name of the Alianza Obrera, formed the UGT’s strategic
             response to the second Lerroux ministry with its three CEDA members.
               In Catalonia, no such strike could possibly hope to succeed without CNT
             support. The CNT, which had been left to its own devices in the December
             uprising against the ﬁrst Lerroux cabinet, was in no mood to respond to
             Socialist appeals of an ill-deﬁned programmatic character. In Anarchist eyes
             the Alianza had fallen far short of a serious revolutionary force. Toward the
             Esquerra the CNT had good reasons to nourish the strongest feelings of
             antipathy: the night before the outbreak of the Alianza strike, the
             Generalitat’s police had arrested scores of Anarchist militants, including
             Durruti, and closed down Solidaridad Obrera. Attempts by cenetistas to
             reopen syndicate headquarters that had been closed since the December
             rising encountered armed resistance from the escamots, who ﬁred directly on
             the workers. Dencas’ took to the radio and denounced faistas as “anarchist
             provocateurs in the pay of reaction,” calling upon his escamots and the police
             to take ﬁrm measures against them. The Generalitat, more fearful of the
             workers than the CEDA ministers, had even alienated the Alianza Obrera.
             Although Companys was quite willing to declare a “Catalan State” in
             complicity with the Alianza by inviting it in to his “new” government, the
             Esguerra-controlled Generalitat ﬂatly refused to arm the workers. Bitterness
             and disillusionment infected the Catalan labor movement. The CNT, which
             participated half-heartedly in the Alianza strike, ordered its members back to
             work, dissociating itself from the entire adventure. With the surrender of the
             Generalitat, the autonomist movement collapsed throughout Catalonia.
               Elsewhere, the general strike called by the Alianza Obrera had mixed
             consequences, indeed, in some areas highly dramatic and historic ones.
             Suprisingly, in Socialist Madrid, the strike almost assumed the comic opera
             forms it had acquired in Barcelona. Although the Socialists had presumably
             been planning the strike in the Spanish capital since the summer, almost
             every aspect of the plan went awry. The police were well-informed about the
186 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Socialists’ intentions and arrested the Socialist-contolled Revolutionary
             Government before it could be installed. The arrests netted Largo Caballero,
             who was in charge of the strike and the rising. A curious listlessness seemed
             to aﬄict the Madrid leadership. The writing of the Alianza’s program had
             been left to the right-wing Socialist Indalecio Prieto, who listed a series of
             demands hardly diﬀering from those that would have been prepared by
             Liberal Republicans. Coordination between the striking groups in the Alianza
             proved to be incredibly shabby and amateurish. A massive strike in Madrid,
             which was supported by the entire left, foundered for want of arms and a
             revolutionary sense of direction.
                As usual, the Socialists emerged as unreliable allies of the Anarchists. A
             revolutionary committee, established by the CNT and FAI to coordinate their
             own operations, was denied direly needed weapons by the UGT. The arms, as
             it turned out, had been conveniently intercepted by government troops. But
             even if they had been available, it is almost certain that the Socialists wouldnot have shared them with the Anarchists. Indeed, relationships between the
             two major sectors of the labor movement had already been poisoned by the
             failure of the Socialist Youth and the UGT to keep the CNT adequately
             informed of their plans or to confer with Anarchosyndicalist delegates.
             Despite heavy ﬁghting in Madrid, the CNT and FAI were obliged to function
             largely on their own. When, at length, a UGT delegate informed the
             revolutionary committee that Largo Caballero was not interested in common
             action with the CNT, the committee disbanded. Later, Abad de Santillan was
             to observe with ample justiﬁcation that Socialist attempts to blame the failure
             of the October Insurrection on Anarchist abstention was a shabby falsehood:
                 Can there be talk of abstention of the CNT and censure of it by
                 those who go on strike without warning our organization about it,
                 who refuse to meet with the delegates of the National Committee [of
                 the CNT], who consent to let the Lerroux-Gil Robles Government
                 take possession of the army deposits and let them go unused before
## handing them over to the Confederation and the FAI?

               Alvarez del Vayo, one of Largo Caballero’s most trusted colleagues, gives us
             a remarkably candid insight into Socialist policy during the opening days of
             the uprising. Nearly all the adverse circumstances that ensnarled the
             insurrection “could have been partly oﬀset if there had not been too much
             delay about the order to start,” he observes.

## The twenty-four hours during which the government was being
                 formed [by Lerroux and Alcala Zamora] were decisive. To the very
                 last, Caballero, to say nothing of Prieto, nursed the hope that
                 President Alcala Zamora would not take into the cabinet known
                 enemies of the Republic. When the news came that the coalition
                 government had been completed, Caballero was with Prieto and a
                 couple of other leaders of the movement. Caballero’s comment
                 revealed his stubborn desire to trust Alcala Zamora: “Until I see it in
                 the Oﬀicial Gazette, I won’t believe it.” Caballero’s closest
                 associates, including myself, earnestly insisted that the rising should
                 begin that same night, October 4. In the end Caballero gave in, but
187 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
                  by then it was too late. It had to be postponed until the next night.
                  During those twenty-four hours martial law was declared, and this
                  meant the collapse by its own weight of the plan for military
                  cooperation. Under martial law all oﬀicers, pro and anti-republican,
                  were conﬁned to barracks. Thus, when the rising ﬁnally got under
                  way, its chances were much diminished. We found ourselves lacking
                  the military support on which we had counted; the Socialist militias
                  were in the street but were unable by themselves to carry out the
## crucial missions assigned to them.

               What is absent in Alvarez del Vayo’s account is that, military support or not,
             the considerable Anarchist forces in the capital were coldly rebuﬀed.
               Almost unknown to Madrid, indeed to the rest of Spain, a major rising was
             launched,in the mining districts ‘of Asturias—one which was to add a
             haunting sense of tragedy and grandeur to the October events.[43] The
             miners, irrespective of their political aﬀiliation, took the call for a general
             strike very seriously. As S.J. Brademas observes, the Asturian miners of all
             unions regarded the Alianza Obrera as “more than pious revolutionary
             jargon.” On the night of October 4, to the sound of sirens in the valley towns
             along the Aller and Nalon rivers, the miners began their strike with attacks on
             Civil Guard and Assault Guard barracks. The great majority of the Asturian
             miners belonged to the UGT, although the CNT enjoyed a considerable
             inﬂuence of its own. In recent years, the Communists had assumed control of
             several union locals and presumably it was in the Communist-controlled town
             of Mieres that the most dramatic initiatives were reported.[44] There, some
             200 militants besieged the police barracks and town hall with about 30 riﬂes,
             ﬁring the same riﬂes from diﬀerent positions to create an exaggerated
             impression of their stength. Following the surrender of the Civil and Assault
             Guards, they proceeded to occupy towns along the route to Oviedo, the
             provincial capital of Asturias, until on October 6 they attacked the city itself.
             In fact at this time a miners’ column of 8,000, a force well beyond the
             numbers the Communists could have mobilized, began to occupy all of Oviedo
             with the exception of the Pelago and Santa Clara barracks, where sizeable
             government troops continued to hold out. For the ﬁrst time, the famous
             Asturian dinamiteros appeared in force: the recklessly bold miners who were
             to compensate for their lack of guns and artillery with sticks of dynamite. The
             Asturians had learned to do more than mine coal; they were also skilled
             blasters who were to gain an awesome reputation in October 1934 and later
             in the Civil War for their skill with explosives and their unsurpassable
             courage.
               Within a matter of days, the miners had occupied most of the Aller and
             Nalon valley towns, nearly all of Oviedo, and the industrial city of La
             Felguera. Attempts were also being made to seize the strategic seaports of
             Gijon and Aviles, and it was here that the insurrection came up against its
             gravest political obstacles. The workers of Aviles and Gijon were largely under
             Anarchist inﬂuence. They too had joined the uprising under the local Alianza
             slogan of “Union, Hermanos Proletarias” (“Unity, Proletarian Brothers”), the
             famous “UHP” which was to be initialed on walls, vehicles, factories, and
             troop trains throughout the Civil War. So far as the Aviles and Gijon
188 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Anarchists were concerned, however, their Socialist and Communist
             “brothers” were to honor the slogan only in the breach. When Anarchist
             delegates from the seaports arrived in Oviedo on October 7, pleading for arms
             to resist the imminent landings of government troops, their requests were
             totally ignored by Socialists and Communists who, as Jackson notes, “clearly
             mistrusted them....” The Oviedo Committee was to pay a bitter price for its
             refusal. The next day, when Anarchist resistance, hampered by the pitiful
             supply of weapons, failed to prevent the government from landing its troops,
             the way into Asturias lay open. The two seaports became the principal
             military bases for launching the savage repression of the Asturian
             insurrection that occupied so much of October and claimed thousands of lives.
               The Asturian insurrection lasted some two weeks, roughly from October 5 to
             October 18. During this brief period, the miners had behaved with exemplary
             dignity and moral rectitude. “For the best of the militant elements,” observes
             Jackson, “the revolutionary regime was to be a demonstration of proletarian
             morality. Bourgeois received the same food rations as did workers. In the
             hospital, doctors were instructed to treat equally the government wounded
             and the revolutionary wounded. Non-political middle-class and professional
             people were to be protected, even at the risk of life, by the revolutionary
             militia.” Anarchists, far from running “amuck” (as so often predicted by their
             opponents on the left as well as the right), were perhaps even more
             exemplary in their behavior than the dour Communists and many Socialists,
             whose authoritarian tendencies fostered a repressive atmosphere in the areas
             under their control. Peirats, in fact, regarded the Asturian Anarchists as
             excessively naive owing to the feelings of reconciliation and good-naturedness
             that marked their behavior toward erstwhile social enemies. In any case,
             when military repression by the government replaced proletarian dignity,
             “many a surviving soldier and priest testiﬁed to the eﬀorts of the
             [revolutionary] committee leaders to prevent the assassination of priests and
             prisoners, intervention which had saved dozen of lives.”
               Notwithstanding the propaganda of the period—a propaganda inspired as
             much by the Communists as by the government—the Asturian insurrection
             made no attempt to establish soviets, much less a “soviet republic.”
             Structurally, the insurrection was managed by hundreds of small
             revolutionary committees whose delegates were drawn from unions, parties,
             the FAI, and even anti-Stalinist Communist groups. Rarely, if at all, were there
             large councils (or “soviets”) composed of delegates from factories. Indeed, the
             notion of councils, on the Russian models of 1905 and 1917, was alien to the
             Spanish labor movement. The Socialists generally functioned through tightly
             knit committees, commonly highly centralized and with strong bureaucratic
             proclivities. In Asturias, the UGT tried to perpetuate this form wherever
             possible, at most admitting Communists and moderate cenetistas into their
             “revolutionary committees.” But the mountainous terrain of Asturias made
             such committees diﬀicult to coordinate, so that each one became an isolated
             miniature central committee of its own, often retaining its traditional
             authoritarian character. The Anarchists, on the other hand, favored looser
             structures, often quasi-councils composed of factory workers and assemblies
             composed of peasants. The ambience of these fairly decentralized structures,
             their improvisatory character and libertarian spirit, fostered an almost festive
189 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             atmosphere in Anarchist-held areas.
               This diﬀerence is vividly conveyed by Avelino Gonzalez Mellada, who
             compares Anarchist-controlled La Felguera with Marxist-controlled Sama.
             Both towns, he observes, were of equal size and were separated from each
             other only by the Nalon river. They were linked to each other by two bridges.
             The October Insurrection,
                 triumphed immediately in the metallurgical and in the mining
                 town.... Sama was organized along military lines. Dictatorship of the
                 proletariat, red army, Central Committee, discipline, authority.... La
                 Felguera opted for comunismo libertario: the people in arms, liberty
                 to come and go, respect for the technicians of the Duro-Felguera
                 metallurgical plant, public deliberations of all issues, abolition of
                 money, the rational distribution of food and clothing. Enthusiasm
                 and gaiety in La Felguera; the sullenness of the barracks in Sama.
                 The bridges [of Sama] were held by a corp of guards complete with
                 oﬀicers and all. No one could enter or leave Sama without a safeconduct pass, or walk through the streets without passwords. All of
                 this was ridiculously useless, because the government troops were
                 far away and the Sama bourgeoisie was disarmed and neutralized....
                 The workers of Sama who did not adhere to the Marxist religion
                 preferred to go to La Felguera, where at least they could breathe.
                 Side by side there were two concepts of socialism: the authoritarian
                 and the libertarian; on each bank of the Nalon, two populations of
                 brothers began a new life; with a dictatorship in Sam a; with liberty
## in La Felgeura....

                In contrast to the severely delimited Marxist committee in Sama, La
             Felguera workers met in popular assembly, where they socialized the
             industrial city’s economy. The population was divided into wards, each of
             which elected delegates to supply and distribution committees. The
             committees determined the consumption needs of the wards, managed
             transport facilities, and assumed responsibility for the medical and sanitary
             needs of the city. The La Felguera commune, so rarely mentioned in most
             accounts of the Spanish labor movement, proved to be so successful, indeed
             so admirable, that surrounding communities invited the La Felguera
             Anarchists to advise them on reorganizing their own social order. Rarely were
             comparable institutions created by the Socialists and, where they did emerge,
             it was on the insistence of the rank-and-ﬁle workers. At Mieres, by contrast,
             the Communists established a crassly authoritarian comite de guerra, which
             even preempted the rights of the town’s revolutionary committee. So
             preoccupied were the Socialists and Communists with asserting their
             sectarian control over Asturian towns that Marxist militias which should have
             been ﬁghting in desperately beleaguered Oviedo were kept at home for
             strictly political purposes.
                Every one of these situations was to reappear in the Civil War two years
             later, and on a larger, more terrifying scale. Anarchist militias were to be
             denied arms and support in desperate military situations while the choicest
             weapons were to be reserved for Communist and Republican police
             detachments behind the front lines. These detachments were to serve more as
190 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             forces to subvert social revolution than to ferret out Franco supporters. The
             CNT and FAI were to experience the full gamut of treachery at the hands of
             every group in the Popular Front—from the Caballero “left” Socialists to the
             openly counterrevolutionary Communists. Almost alone, the Anarchists were
             to create viable revolutionary institutions structured around workers’ control
             of industry and peasants’ control of the land. That these institutions were to
             be duplicated by Socialist workers and peasants was to be due in no small
             measure to Anarchist example rather than Socialist precept. To the degree
             that the Asturian miners and industrial workers in various communities
             established direct control over the local economy and structured their
             committees along libertarian lines, these achievements were due to Anarchist
             precedents and long years of propaganda and education.
               The Asturian insurrection revealed not only the deep-seated divisions that
             permeated the left but the capacity for savage repression that was to mark
             the right in later years. Lerroux, distrustful of Spanish troops on the
             peninsula, dispatched the Foreign Legion (Tercio) and mercenary Moorish
             troops (Regulates) to Aviles and Gijon, mercilessly unleashing them on the
             Asturian insurrectionists. The job of commanding the campaign was assigned
             to a General Francisco Franco, who had earned a reputation for molding the
             Tercio into the most eﬀective ﬁghting force in the Spanish army. This use of
             the Regulates and Tercio was without precedent in the history of Spain. The
             irony of using the Foreign Legion and the Moslem Regulares on the sacred
             Christian soil of Asturias is conveyed with telling eﬀect by Brenan:
                 In 1931, just before the fall of the monarchy, a regiment of the Terdo
                 had been brought over from Africa on the King’s express wish to put
                 down the expected republican rising. They had broken out and
                 committed their usual depredations and Major [Ramon] Franco, the
                 famous cross-Atlantic ﬂyer, had protested over the barbarity of their
                 being used on Spanish soil. Now it was Major Franco’s brother,
                 General Francisco Franco, who had ordered their despatch and
                 employment.... But if the despatch of the Foreign Legion to ﬁght the
                 miners shocked public opinion, what is one to say of that of the
                 Moors? For eight hundred years the Crusade against the Moors had
                 been the central theme of Spanish history: they still continued to be
                 the hereditary enemy—the only enemy, in fact, against which the
                 Spanish armies had ever fought. Their savagery in war was well
## known—only a dozen years before these same tribesmen had
## surrounded a Spanish army and massacred every man of them
                 except the oﬀicers, whom they held for ransom. Yet they were now
                 being brought to ﬁght in Asturias, that one sacred corner of Spain
                 where the Crescent had never ﬂown. By this single act the Spanish
                 Right had shown that neither tradition nor religion—the two things
                 for which they professed to stand—rhad any meaning for them. In
                 the terror produced in them by the rebellion of 40,000 miners, they
                 showed that they were re^dy to sacriﬁce all their principles.
               The repression of the miners was marked by wanton carnage in battle; later,
             by the torturing and horrible mutilation of captured miners, many of whom
             were shot in batches without trial or owing to the slightest whim and

             provocation. Estimates of these executions numbered in the thousands. After
             the executions came the torture squads, which by every disinterested account
             matched the savagery of the Nazi torturers in Germany’s concentration
             camps. In all, apart from the thousands of dead, 30–40,000 prisoners ﬁlled
             Spanish jails. Despite attempts by the right to depict the Asturian miners as
             killers of priests, nuns, and members of the possessing classes, the very
             extravagance of the charges, coupled with acknowledgements by the alleged
             victims that the miners had behaved with remarkable moral probity, proved to
             be self-defeating. One investigating group after another revealed that most of
             the government’s charges were false; that it was the Tercio, Regulates, and
             police which engaged in unspeakable acts of barbarity. As the facts slowly
             ﬁltered out, the country was overwhelmed with shock and revulsion: the right
             was to pay dearly for its savagery.
               The crises which had been shaking Spain for years came to a head when the
             right overreached itself by seeking not only to undermine the left and the
             Republicans, but also to subvert its centrist allies. Vengeful to the point of
             blindness, Gil Robles had sought to convict several leading Asturian Socialists
             —one of them a moderate who had opposed the rising. Although Alcala
             Zamora and Lerroux had accepted with equanimity the executions of proven
             Asturian militants, they balked at the victimization of innocent or harmless
             Socialists who scarcely deserved the death penalty even by rightist standards.
             Their sentences were commuted, whereupon the CEDA at the end of March
             withdrew from the government, provoking another ministerial crisis. But no
             government could be formed without the CEDA. Gil Robles, feeling, power
             within his grasp, pressed his advantage unrelentingly. A new cabinet was
             formed in which most of the seats were occupied either by the CEDA or by
             CEDA-controlled ministers of the Agrarian Party, the organization of Spain’s
             major landowners. But it was not stability under the aegis of a center-right
             coalition that Gil Robles was seeking. Exuberant over the inﬂux of
             reactionaries into the CEDA, Gil Robles had overtly begun to fulﬁll the
             bleakest predictions of the left. It .required no politcal astuteness.to see that
             he envisaged himself as Spain’s Dollfuss. Abandoning virtually all prospects of
             economic and social reform, Gil Robles began to direct his energies toward
             constitutional changes that would have ultimately replaced Spanish
             republican institutions by quasi-fascistic corporative forms. At the same time,
             as minister of war, he began to reorganize the army, removing oﬀicers whom
             he suspected of leftist or Republican sympathies. Despite the odium that
             surrounded the Tercio, he appointed Franco as Chief of Staﬀ of the Spanish
             army.
               The center-right coalition, limping through 1935, began to lose its support
             among the inchoate middle-classes of Spain. It had rejected land reform,
             restored Jesuit properties, and starved lay education. Its tax policies brazenly
             favored the wealthy over other classes in the country. It had shaken what little
             popular conﬁdence the army enjoyed as a protector of the republic by
             advancing fascistic-minded oﬀicers to key positions at almost every echelon.
             Finally, the CEDA completely abandoned its alliance with the Radicals when
             Lerroux and his associates became involved in several shady scandals around
             gambling licenses and army supply contracts. By December, Lerroux was
             forced to step down; indeed, the entire Radical Party had become a useless
192 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             and discredited anarchronism. “The only party in Republican Spain to have no
             political ideals,” observes Brenan, “all [the Radicals] wanted was that the
             country should jog along quietly. “But Spain was polarizing sharply. Neither
             the left nor right appeared willing to give quarter, least of all to an archaic
             party whose leaders seemed to be lining their own pockets. Ironically, what
             ﬁnally ﬁnished Lerroux’s ministerial career were not the scandals that
             gathered around him but his eﬀorts to tax the landowners by raising
             inheritance taxes from 1 to 3.5 percent. Consistent with its intransigent
             reactionism, the CEDA withdrew from the cabinet over this issue, ﬁnally
             terminating the two-years of center-right rule.
                Clearly, Gil Robles was convinced that, with the Radicals discredited, the
             time had arrived for the CEDA to take full control of the government. The way,
             it appeared, was now open for an authoritarian regime. But the rightist leader
             had totally misjudged the integrity of the president. Alcala Zamora’s
             ministerial aim was to restore the power of the center, not to deliver Spain
             into the hands of a quasi-fascist right. Despite his own conservative outlook,
             he was a defender of parliamentary government. On December 14, to the
             utter astonishment of the right, Alcala, Zamora turned the government over to
             a caretaker prime minister, Manuel Portela Yalladares, formerly Lerroux’s
             minister of interior and an opponent of Gil Robles’s attempts to transfer the
             Civil Guards to the Ministry of War. Within three weeks, Portela lifted the
             press censorship which had existed since the Asturian uprising and had
             virtually stiﬂed any discussion in Spain for over a year. At the same time, he
             dissolved the Cortes and announced national elections for February 16, 1936.
             El brenio negro, the two black years of reactionary rule, repression, and the
             drift toward a corporative state, had come to an end.
             From February to July
               We may ignore any account of Gil Robles’s fury at this course of events. His
             plan to use republican institutions to undo the republic had reached an
             historic impasse. Throughout 1935, the left and the Republicans had also
             undergone their own series of crises. In trying to involve Azaña in the
             Esquerra debacle of October, the right had totally alienated the Republicans
             and driven them toward the left. Azaña, who had gone to Barcelona solely to
             prevent the Esquerra from rising against Madrid, had been placed in the dock
             by the right and accused of engineering the entire October revolt. The
             charges were too preposterous to be taken seriously and served only to
             discredit the right. Indeed, to the Spanish Republicans of almost every variety,
             the vindictivness of the CEDA meant that all its verbal commitments to a
             stable Republican order were meaningless. Uniting around Azaña, the
             Liberals formed a new coalition, the Izquierda Republicana or “Left
             Republicans,” using a political nomenclature that would have been diﬀicult to
             conceive three years earlier. The conditions were fully ripe for a coalition
             between the Liberals and the leftist parties—a coalition that would shortly
             take the historic form of the “Popular Front.”
               The Socialists too had responded to the CEDA’s vindictiveness by veering
             further to the left. Right-wing Socialists like Besteiro, who had opposed the

             October rising, or Prieto, who had ﬂed to France after its failure, had lost
             virtually all prestige with the party except for its hardened bureaucracy.
             Caballero, at least, had remained behind. By merely sitting in prison (where
             he read Marx for the ﬁrst time), he had become the idol of the Socialist Youth
             and the party’s growing left wing. No matter that he had shrewdly ensconced
             himself in his apartment after the start of the October events to guard himself
             against legal accusations; the “Spanish Lenin,” as he was soon to be called,
             became intoxicated by a messianic sense of his historic mission. If Spain was
             to move toward revolution, he had been chosen by history to lead it—or, as
             events were to show, to subvert it. For the present, as Jackson notes, he found
             himself in prison “in the company of ardgnt young intellectuals who regretted
             their own bourgeois background and who idolized him doubly, as an authentic
             proletarian, and as the spiritual successor ‘el abuelo’—the equally proletarian,
             equally austere, equally honorable Pablo Iglesias.” Soon to be released from
             prison, he became the indubitable leader of the Socialist left and another
             architect of the “Popular Front” coalition that was to take power in February
             1936.
               The Anarchists, despite their comparative inactivity during the October
             events, had suﬀered no less heavily than the Socialists. Unjustly accused of
             abstentionism by Socialists and Communists alike, the CNT had lost a
             measure of its revolutionary prestige while its most able militants had been
             packed oﬀ to prison by the thousands. In proportion to their strength in
             Asturias, perhaps as many Anarchosyndicalists had perished in the uprising
             as Socialists, yet they received little credit for their sacriﬁces. What was even
             more galling, the treachery they had suﬀered at the hands of the Socialists
             and Communists had gone virtually unnoticed. The coming elections in
             Febmary oﬀered them no consolation. The Socialists had shown that they
             were no more capable of honorable or comradely behavior in 1934 than they
             had been in 1932, when Caballero had tried to smash the CNT syndicates.
             Could the Anarchists expect any better from Azaña’s Liberals who, in 1932,
             had favored the UGT over the CNT, censored the libertarian press, and
             imprisoned them by the thousands? With this grim record, the CNT had no
             cause to be elated over a Liberal or Socialist victory in the forthcoming
             elections. But it had more reason to be alarnied over a rightist one. Caught in
             the old dilemma of “lesser evils,” the CNT began to seek a regroupment of its
             own, perhaps a new entente of all libertarian forces, however disparate their
             tactical and strategic viewpoints. The days of the faista insurrections were
             now over for good. The dire prospects opened by a rightist victory in the
             February elections made it diﬀicult to fall back on traditional methods of
             Anarchosyndicalist action; such a victory would almost certainly lead to a
             Dollfuss-type of reaction, followed by the brutal suppression of the left. It is
             not surprising, then, that despite its militant rhetoric between December and
             February, the CNT began to turn to its own version of realpolitik.
               The CNT’s ﬁrst steps toward a libertarian regroupment were taken by
             establishing cordial relations with the Sindkatos de Oposicion, the oncedetested Treintistas led by Pestana, Peiro Lopez, and the so-called ‘ simple
             syndicalists” who favored pragmatic trade unionism. This was no mere
             organizational maneuver to infuse the Con federation with additional forces; it
             was a signiﬁcant poltical act which led toward collaboration ﬁrst with the
194 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             UGT, eventually with the Socialists, and ﬁnally with the Popular Front. The
             basis for unity between the CNT and the Opposition Syndicates had been
             cleared in grea part when Pestana, striking out on his own, broke with the
             people of his own faction and moved toward direct political activity, forming
             his own Syndicalist Party. The new party soon joined the Popular Front and
             acquired two seats in the Cortes after the February elections. Despite Catalan
             opposition, the movement for uniting the CNT with the Opposition Syndicates
             grew steadily. As early as May 1935, a national plenum of Regional
             Confederations had invited the Opposition Syndicates to participate in the
             next national congress of the CNT, albeit with a voice and not a vote.
                Despite many vacillations on both sides in the ensuing months, contacts
             between Anarchists and syndicalists became increasingly cordial. Both
             libertarian tendencies had suﬀered heavily from the bienio negro repression
             and each had tended to support the other at the level of practical activity in
             periods of acute crisis. The problem of confederal unity came to a head in
             March 1936, when the National Committee of the CNT invited former
             Treintistas to attend the forthcoming congress of the Confederation at
             Saragossa on May 1st. It was here that the Opposition Syndicates were
             oﬀicially readmitted to the CNT. Fusion meetings held in all localities where
             duplicate syndicates existed integrated the two organizations completely.
             Some 70,000 oppositionists rejoined the parent organization. The uniﬁcation
             had brought Peiro, Lopez, and other syndicalist right winger back to positions
             of confederal power, a situation that was to reinforce the growing orientation
             of the CNT’s leadership toward political action. Despite its militant rhetoric
             after the February elections, the organization was to become more syndicalist
             than Anarchist, while towing the Anarchist tendencies behind it. As many
             Anarchist leaders were later to complain, it was not the FAI that changed the
             CNT but rather the CNT that began to change the FAI.
                But most of these changes still lay in the future. Between December 1935
             and February 1936, Anarchosyndicalist policies seemed to move at curious
             cross-purposes to each other. The CNT, although bitterly hostile to the
             “political” Socialist Party, seemed rather naively to be highly receptive to
             common action with the UGT, as though the leadership of the UGT were not
             staﬀed by Socialists. Having initiated the concept of an Alianza Obrera, the
             Socialists and the UGT, in turn, seemed receptive only to local alliances and
             resisted attempts to raise the Alianza to the dimensions of a national
             movement. The “UHP” slogan had yet to extend itself beyond Asturias. By
             December, in fact, the Socialist Party had moved toward an electoral bloc with
             Azaña’s Republicans, largely ignoring the CNT’s eﬀorts to foster trade-union
             collaboration on a more radical basis.
                In mid-January 1936, a pact to form a Popular Front was ﬁnally established
             by the Socialist Party, the UGT, the Left Republicans and their allies of-the
             Republican Union, the Socialist Youth, Pestana’s Syndicalist Party, the
             Communist Party, and suprisingly, the newly formed POUM (composed largely
             of Nin’s Left Communists, formerly a Trotskyist organization, and Mamin’s
             Worker-Peasant Bloc). The pact was limited almost exclusively to practical
             collaboration in the coming elections. Its program was strictly middle-class—
             designed, in Portela’s words, not to frighten its moderate constituency. It
             threatened no nationalization of property, no workers’ control of industry, not
195 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             even unemployment compensation. To the left, it merely oﬀered the promise
             of amnesty for its thousands of jailed workers and a liberal parliamentary
             shield against authoritarian reaction. Although the Popular Front pact
             reinforced demands within the CNT to press the UGT for an alliance based on
             a revolutionary program, presumably in order to rescue the Spanish working
             class from reformism, these demands, whether sincere or not, were
             essentially meaningless. The “Spanish Lenin,” Largo Caballero, had
             committed the UGT to political collaboration with the Republicans; the CNT
             promptly denounced this as class collaboration. Any unity between the two
             major labor organizations in Spain was thus almost indeﬁnitely precluded.
               Which is not to say that the CNT was entirely hostile to the Popular Front.
             As the elections drew near, the CNT began to reveal a disconcerting loosening
             of its former antipolitical stance. On January 25, 1936, at a conference of the
             Catalan Regional Committee, angry delegates bluntly charged the Regional
             Committee with a temporizing attitude toward the forthcoming elections. The
             CNT, in contrast to its vigorous abstentionist campaign of 1933, refused to
             urge its members to stay home. While reiterating its traditional opposition to
             electoral policies, the organization maintained a discreet silence in the face of
             demands to boycott the polls. Indeed, the prominent Anarchist dynast Urales
             had already admitted quite bluntly “I would consider it a great error on the
             part of the anarchists if, as a consequence of their action during the electoral
             period, the rightists triumphed over the leftists.”
               This statement by perhaps the most venerated Anarchist of his day, the
             founder of a distinguished family that included the best-known woman faista,
             Federica Montseney, unquestionably aﬀected the strategy of the CNT and FAI
             for the February elections. A peninsular plenum of the FAI, held in Barcelona
             on January 30 and February 1, ratiﬁed the electoral position of the Catalan
             regional conference. “Para salvar las apariencias” (to save appearances), the
             FAI reaﬀirmed its “complete abstention from all direct and indirect
             collaboration with the policy of the State,” but this almost legalistic verbiage
             was far removed in spirit and emphasis from an active policy of abstention.
               Brademas gives a devastating description of the CNT-FAI policy toward the
             elections.

## During these last days of January and the ﬁrst two weeks of
                  February 1933 the CNT boomed to the surface all over Spain with
                  meetings protesting against fascism, against the death penalty
                  (restored in October 1934) and ... in favor of the revolutionary union
                  of the UGT and the CNT and—of course—amnesty for the prisoners.
                  But there were no anti-electoral campaigns. The words “Don’t vote!”
                  and “Abstention!” were not to be found in pre-election manifestos.
                  “Durruti,” said Santillan, “was not given to subtleties and he, as did
                  some others, began openly to advise attendance at the polls.”
               The CNT’s and FAI’s attitude toward the Popular Front was no mere issue of
             episodic abstention or participation in a speciﬁc electoral campaign (as some
             Anarchists were to claim), nor was the Popular Front an indigenous product of
             Spanish political conditions. The strategy, formulated by the Communist
             International after the signing of the Franco-Soviet nonaggression pact of
             1934, was a barely disguised diplomatic response to the threat Hitler seemed

             to pose to Stalinist Russia. From a policy of mindless insurrectionary rhetoric,
             in which the entire Social Democratic movement had been designated as
             “social fascists—indeed, as greater enemies than the fascists themselves—the
             Communist parties of the world veered over to a policy of outright class
             collaboration. So completely was the cry of “social revolution” subordinated
             to one of defending bourgeois democracy at all costs against “fascism,” that
             even mild conservative opponents provided an excuse for Communist parties
             to foster blocs with the most venal and discredited liberal parties of Europe.
             By 1936 the Spanish Socialist left with considerable justiﬁcation could mock
             the Communists with the cry: “To save Spain from Marxism, vote
             Communist!”
                The Popular Front, in eﬀect, was no tentative act of collaboration between
             the growing left and the declining center to obstruct the CEDA and its allies.
             It reﬂected a far-reaching shift in policy which Stalinist Russia imposed on the
             Communist parties of the worlds so that joint nonaggression or defense pacts
             against Nazi Germany might be signed with the western democracies. The
             policy had its origin in strictly Russian national interests and, perhaps more
             signiﬁcantly, in the identiﬁcation of these interests not with the world labor
             movement and cause of Socialism, but with the liberal bourgeoisie and the
             perpetuation of liberal capitalism. Stalinist Russia had dropped any pretense
             that the word “socialism” had any viable meaning in international policy or,
             for that matter, in the execution of internal policy. Even the memory of the
             October Revolution, for all its limitations, was to be drowned in the blood of
             the Old Bolsheviks, nearly all of whom were to be purged secretly or, in show
             trials, during the Popular Front years.
                The Communist parties, in turn, were to try to foist the Popular Front policy
             on the left in the most shamelessly deceptive and manipulative manner with
             the goal of strengthening their control over the international working class.
             As in the case of Russian diplomatic policy, to the extent that this control was
             achieved, the Communist parties were concerned not to advance social
             revolution but to prevent it. Indeed, the Popular Front was consciously
             designed to demonstrate to the full satisfaction of the liberal bourgeoisie that
             the Communist parties, like Stalinist Russia, could be counted upon to
             promote class collaboration, to neutralize any revolutionary tendencies within
             the labor movement, and if necessary, to assassinate revolutionary spokesmen
             and suppress revolutionary movements. Knowingly or not, the CNT and FAI
             were riding the back of a tiger. From a policy of “nonabstention” in February,
             they were to be led into a policy of participation in September, and ultimately,
             in the later years of the Civil War, into a policy of collaboration with their most
             dangerous opponents. These opponents were not simply the right-wing
             Socialists, who at least had some sense of responsibility to the Spanish
             working class, but the Communists, a small group whose growth and
             inﬂuence depended upon the impact of Stalinist Russia on Spanish events.
             Apart from the mythology of the Bolshevik Revolution, which seemed to
             validate the Spanish Communist Party as a “revolutionary” organization, the
             conditional military aid which Russia spoon-fed to Spain during the Civil War
             was to give the Communists immense control over the course of events.
                The elections of February 1936 brought the Popular Front parties to power
             by a margin of some 700,000 votes. Of 271 seats acquired by the coalition, a
197 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             number which constituted an absolute majority in the Cortes, the Republicans
             (including Martinez Barrio’s Republican Union as well as Azaña’s Izquierda)
             were given 117 seats, the Socialists 90, and the Communists 16.[45] The
             electoral victory of the Popular Front had been much narrower than the
             700,000 received out of the million votes cast. “In the ﬁrst round of voting,”
             observes Stanley G. Payne, referring to February 16,
                 the left [that is, the left-liberal colaition of the Popular Front—M.B.]
                 won altogether slightly more than 200 seats out of the total of 473
                 that made up the Cortes. The plurality was not due to an equivalent
                 lead in the popular vote, for in the total balloting for the ﬁrst round
                 the popular vote for left and right was approximately equal. Under
                 the complicated list-voting system, however, the decisive factor was
                 not proportionate cumulative vote, but the concentration of ballots
                 province by province. Popular Front votes were combined much
                 more eﬀectively for majority lists in the larger districts. The second
                 runoﬀ contests were held at the end of the month under leftist
                 supervision and considerable pressure from the leftist street mob. In
                 the runoﬀs the Popular Front increased its plurality further, though
                 constitutional legality of the administration of the vote was’ dubious.
                Payne neglects to tell us, that the same “complicated list voting system” had
             assured the right its own sweeping victory in 1933. What had favored the
             right three years earlier now favored the left. Nor does Payne give suﬀicient
             attention to the rightist “street mob,” notably the hired pistoleros of the
             Falange who created so much bloody disorder during the ﬁrst ﬁve months of
             the Popular Front regime, the reactionary students and senoritos who broke
             up meetings of the leftist groups, the rightist thugs who ﬁred point-blank into
             crowds of workers’ barrios from speeding motor vehicles, the police of
             Granada who kept workers and peasants from the polling places, the caciques
             who threatened punitive action against entire villages that failed to return
             rightist candidates, and the landlords’ agents who threatened to discharge
             agricultural workers and tenents who failed to vote the reactionary ticket.
             These qualiﬁcations aside, Payne’s factual conclusions are correct. What
             really emerges from the 700,000-vote plurality of the Popular Front was not
             so much the fact that the runoﬀs were conducted under “leftist supervision”
             or that the “leftist street mob” played any larger role in inﬂuencing the vote
             than the rightist thugs and senoritos, but that the Popular Front would not
             have come to power without Anarchosyndicalist electoral support.
                Far from concealing this major departure from Anarchist precept, the
             leadingfaista Abad de Santillan was to emphasize it. In February, he observes,
             “participation in the elections was advisable. We gave power to the leftists,
             convinced under the circumstances they were the lesser evil.” This could be
             construed as a reasonable and honest statement if action based on the “lesser
             evil” was seen for what it really was—a distinct departure from principle/
             openly admitted to be such, a bitter pill to be swallowed to deal with an acute
             illness. Given highly critical circumstances, the Bolsheviks had boycotted
             elections without becoming Anarchists and one could envision a situation
             where Anarchists would have voted in elections without becoming Bolsheviks.
             From hindsight, Vernon Richards’s observation that a conservative victory in
198 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             the February elections would have been far less of a setback for the Spanish
             labor movement than the slaughter that followed the generals’ rebellion is a
             tempting conclusion which would have preserved Anarchist purism. But Gil
             Robles seemed deﬁnitely intent on becoming Spain’s Dollfuss (his public
             speeches had acquired an unprecedentedly violent character) and the CEDA’s
             electoral posters had a distinctly fasdstic ﬂavor, appealing for the “Ministry of
             War and all the power,” “All power to the Leader,” and the like.
                In such ominous situations, who controls the state, with its arms and
             monopoly of violence, is not a matter of complete indiﬀerence. Boxed into an
             isolated land mass behind the Pyrenees and (as events were to show) lacking
             in signiﬁcant support from the international proletariat, the Spanish
             Anarchists in 1936 did not have the revolutionary advantages enjoyed by the
             Russian Bolsheviks in 1917, notably international opponents bitterly divided
             by a world war, scattered domestic opponents also in conﬂict with each other,
             vast spaces into which to retreat, active aid from the international proletariat,
             and perhaps above all, the support of the Russian army, which not only failed
             to oppose the takeover of the Bolsheviks but which provided them with an
             enormous armamentarium of weapons inherited from the Czarist war eﬀort
             and a reservoir of highly trained military manpower. If Gil Robles today seems
             like a mild ﬁgure beside Franco, much the same could have been said in
             comparing Dollfuss to Hitler. But all appearances aside, Dollfuss eﬀectively
             smashed the Austrian labor movement long before the German army crossed
             his frontiers. That history never tested Gil Robles’s capacity to do the same in
             Spain is due, ironically, to the fact that Liberals controlled the Spanish state
             throughout 1936, not the CEDA. This was no triﬂing factor in the sweeping
             libertarian revolution that occurred in July 1936, however much Anarchists
             prefer to deny the importance of who controls the state and under what
             circumstances they control it. It took considerable courage for a moderate
             Anarchosyndicalist such as Juan Peiro to write in September 1935: “I have
             said, and I repeat it here, that if an electoral class front should appear against
             the fascists who now govern us, I, for the ﬁrst time in my life, would vote....”
                But after this has been said, one must emphasize that it would have been
             preposterous to expect a “lesser evil” to behave with noble virtue. Having
             voted in a bourgeois election, it was necessary to acknowledge the limitations
             of the act and to recognize that political maneuvering on the part of
             libertarians could develop into a bad habit. In fact, the gravest obstacle to
             social revolution in Spain was not the generals alone but forces within the
             Popular Front itself, notably an increasingly powerful Communist Party which
             employed duplicity and ﬁnally open violence to suppress revolutionary
             tendencies. The best the CNT and FAI could have hoped for from the newly
             elected state would have been neutrality; to base one iota of their policy on
             active state support was not only absurd, but marked the initial steps toward
             the “politicization” of the Spanish Anarchist movement and its-eventual
             conversion into a political party. Yet so oblivious were many of the Anarchist
             leaders to this possibility that when the newly elected Generalitat,
             overwhelmingly Esquerra in character, failed to act decisively enough in
             resolving two CNT strikes in Barcelona, Durruti could peevishly complain:
             “We didn’t come here to celebrate the arrival of a group of men. We came to
             tell the Left ﬀiat we were the ones who decided your triumph and we are the
199 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             ones who are maintaining two conﬂicts [the strikes in question—M.B.] which
             must be solved immediately. It was our generosity that ^ decided the
             reconquest of February 16th.”
               The statement was remarkable as evidence of the trend it seemed to reveal.
             The Anarchists, even militants such as Durruti, were slowly becoming clients
             of the creature they most professed to oppose: the state power itself. Twq
             bitter years of repression and, by contrast, the obvious power they felt (and
             enjoyed) in tipping the Popular Front to the side of victory, served not to
             render their thinking more guarded, subtle, and ﬂexible, but rather more
             naive, crude, and complacently rigid. Having taken to the vote, they began to
             take to politics. This tendency, which the FAI had originally been created to
             block, was reinforced by the increasing bureaucratization of the CNT. As
             Richards notes,
                 there can be no doubt that whilst paying lip-service to the principle
                 of abstention in the February elections, the leadership of the CNT
                 was working behind the scenes, oﬀering the Left politicians the
                 potential vote of the Confederation represented in return perhaps
                 for guarantees that the political prisoners would be released in the
                 event of a Popular Front victory. These are far from being wild
                 speculations. What is certain is that within the CNT there have
                 always been strong personalities who, as is always the case with
                 those who would ride roughshod over basic principles, declared
                 themselves to be the practical men, the realists of the movement.
               The union with the Opposition Syndicates which later was to occur
             increased the number of these “strong personalities” in the leadership of the
             Anarchosyndicalist movement. The problem of how to deal with them had not
             been adequately worked out in the Spanish libertarian movement, any more
             than it has in movements for human freedom generally, a failure for which all
             have paid dearly.
               But February 1936 and the following spring did not seem like a time for
             deep reﬂection and critical self-analysis, but an occasion for exaltation, hope,
             and direct action. Within a week after Azaña formed the ﬁrst Popular Front
             cabinet, crowds of workers opened the jails and released their comrades; in
             the case of Burgos, the prisoners literally took over the jail themselves.
             General strikes were declared by the UGT and CNT demanding a broad and
             immediate amnesty, a demand which Azaña was obliged to satisfy if he hoped
             to preserve any penal system at all. In the ﬁve-month period that followed,
             Spain was to be convulsed by strikes, massive demonstrations, street battles
             between contending crowds, repeated shoot-outs between pistolero groups,
             land seizures, factional maneuvers within and between Popular Front parties,
             accusations of conspiracy, and ﬁnally, assassinations and near-rebellions that
             were to exceed the unrest that marked the Azaña coalition of the early 1930s.
             Polarizing almost savagely to the extremes of right and left, the peninsula had
             entered into a prerevolutionary crisis that could be resolved only by armed
             confrontation between the two sides.
               To unravel this complex skein of events, in which years of social unrest
             seemed to be compressed into a few months, would require a work of its own.
             Only the broadest trends and most signiﬁcant occurrences can be cited here.
200 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             The ﬁrst trend that requires consideration is the unabated strike wave that
             exploded across Spain shortly after the Popular Front victory. Although both
             the UGT and CNT launched so-called “lightning” strike actions throughout the
             spring, it is generally agreed that the CNT established the pace and remained
             almost continually in the forefront of the movement. Hardly a week passed
             without syndicates in one of the two unions calling out workers, at times in
             general strikes that paralyzed major cities. In late March, both UGT and CNT
             steel workers left their foundries; in mid-April the CNT initiated a general
             strike in Madrid that gained the support of the UGT workers, to be followed in
             early June by still another strike, this time of construction and elevator
             workers. Salvos of strikes swept the country, involving nearly every sector of
             the Spanish working class. According to data gathered by Gil Robles and
             accepted as fact by Peirats, there were about 113 strikes involving an entire
             branch of an industry, and nearly 230 partial strikes. The movement, mainly
             CNT-inspired, reached such acuity that Largo Caballero’s newly established
             left Socialist periodical, Claridad, joined El Socialista in counseling
             moderation and restraint. But the CNT, or at least its rank and ﬁle, continued
             the pressure right up to the military rebellion in July.
               In the countryside the popular movement was perhaps less sensational but
             no less signiﬁcant. The rural poor of western and southern Spain were now
             largely organized in the Socialist-controlled Federation of Land Workers
             (Federation Espanola de Trabajadores de la Tierra or FETT), but the
             Federation’s leadership had been so leftist politically from the very start of
             the FETT in 1931 and it was so oriented toward direct action as to be virtually
             indistinguishable from the CNT, which still retained its traditional strongholds
             in the south and east. After the victory of the Popular Front, both
             organizations began to encourage the outright occupancy of the land. In
             March, some 250,000 hectares were taken over by squatters, about 150,000
             in April, and more than 90,000 in May and June together. Despite this decline
             in ﬁgures, possibly reﬂecting both government measures to accelerate the
             passage of land reform legislation and the restraining hand of diehard
             Socialists in Madrid, the countryside was seething with peasant revolt.
             Thousands of peasant families had taken to roads and were looking for work;
             others, under Anarchist inﬂuence, seized the land and claimed it as their own
             irrespective of any pending or existing legislation. In most cases, when Civil
             Guards reoccupied expropriated land, the peasants left temporarily, only to
             return when the Guardia had departed. The landlords were in a panic.
             Recalling the uprisings and bam-bumings of earlier times, they and their
             families ﬂed to the safety of the cities, leaving entire plantations deserted.
             The peasant seizures were no longer the episodic ﬂare-ups of the past, rising
             and subsiding from village to village, nor could they be contained by sending
             a division or two into the countryside to pacify a string of isolated puﬄos.
             Spain was in the throes of a full-scale revolution in the countryside,
             comparable in every way to the great land revolts of Mexico and Russia.
               The Popular Front government ﬂailed out helplessly in all directions and
             failed miserably wherever it struck. To the largely CNT-inspired strike wave, it
             responded with severely repressive measures while it tried to placate the
             left’s anger over rightist terrorism by arresting the Falangist leadership,
             including Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera. Solidaridad Obrera was censored so
201 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             systematically and stringently that many Anarchosyndicalists could claim with
             some justice that their press had enjoyed more freedom under the bienio
             negro than the Popular Front. The government closed down syndicate
             headquarters and arrested Anarchist militants in sizeable numbers, even
             detaining the National Committee of the CNT in Saragossa. But the ineﬀicacy
             of these measures soon became obvious. Madrid had plainly lost control over
             events and the syndicates, in ﬂagrant disregard of oﬀicial authority, reopened
             their headquarters almost as rapidly as they had been closed. The struggle
             was passing from the Cortes and the bureaucratic oﬀices of the state into the
             streets where massive demonstrations, clashes between crowds, and
             shootings of political opponents seemed to reveal even more dramatically
             than the strikes and land seizures the breakdown of traditional authority.
               Everyone sensed the impending explosion. The Socialist Youth and the
             Falange had formed their own paramilitary forces and were training almost
             within sight of each other in Madrid. Falangist terrorism began to reach
             menacing proportions almost directly after the Popular Front victory, when a
             group of Falangist students tried to assassinate the Socialist deputy Jimenez
             de Asda.[46] The “leftist street mob” responded by partially burning two
             churches and the printing plant of La Nacion, a particularly reactionary
             periodical. Scarcely four days later, shots were ﬁred at Largo Caballero’s
             home. The period of assassinations by both sides now began in earnest.
             Within a week after the attack on Caballero’s home, the rightist deputy
             Alfredo Martinez was killed in Oviedo; in April, a bomb was found in the home
             of the Liberal deputy Ortega y Gasset, followed by further assassination
             attempts against Republican dvil governors, mayors from all parts of the
             political spectrum, journalists, and the murder of Judge Manuel Pedregal, who
             had sentenced a Falangist thug to a long prison term for killing a newsboy
             who sold leftist papers. Armed clashes broke out between Falangists and
             leftists, police and peasants; even CNT and UGT workers disputed union
             rivalries and strike issues gun in hand.
               The rivalries within the left were paralleled by rivalries within the right.
             Falangists were now attacking leaders and supporters of the CEDA for
             temporizing and behaving too moderately by fasdstic standards. Gil Robles
             may not have been wrong when he listed nearly 270 deaths and more than
             1,200 wounded as a result of street ﬁghting and assassinations in the months
             following the Popular Front victory. In most of these cases the initiative
             probably came from the right, but they invariably called forth violent
             reactions from the left. “Ideologically speaking,” observes Jackson, “heroic
             violence belonged more to the fasdst spirit than to the Left, but the Sodalist
             Youth, meditating the fate of the German Socialists.in 1933 and the Austrians
             in 1934, chose to ﬁght ﬁre with ﬁre.” Certainly the Anarchists were as
             sensitive to the fate of the German and Austrian labor movements as the
             Sodalists, although they seemed to engage in less violence during that spring
             than other groups on the left and right.
               In fact the Socialists were undergoing the most tumultuous changes in their
             history since the period following the Russian Revolution. Largo Caballero’s
             Conversion to revolution had produced—and revealed—a crisis within the
             party. With the victory of the Popular front, an unavoidable question emerged:
             should the Socialists form another coalition with the Republicans? Four years

             earlier this question would have raised no serious factional disputes within
             the party; indeed, Caballero had occupied the post of minister of labor with
             telling eﬀect upon the CNT. Now the reformist of yesteryear who had willingly
             collaborated with the Primo de Rivera dictatorship had become the “Spanish
             Lenin.” He had a highly inﬂuential paper of his own, Claridad; he was the
             adored Achilles of the Socialist Youth and spokesman for growing leftist
             tendencies within the Socialist Party and the UGT. As the “Spanish Lenin,” he
             opposed the entry of any Socialists into the Popular Front cabinet. Indalecio
             Prieto, on the other hand, had emerged as the spokeman for the party
             bureaucracy, which preached the verities of moderation, and for many
             Asturian miners who had paid dearly for the revolutionary adventures of
             1934. Prieto charted a distictly reformist path for the party and favored
             ministerial collaboration with the Republicans. Although nominally in control
             of the party, his inﬂuence with the rank and ﬁle seemed to be dwindling
             rapidly. The struggle between the Caballerists and Prietists reached acute
             form in mid-Spring when both sides did not hesitate to use physical violence
             against each other at party meetings.
                But Caballero’s inﬂuence was tentative at best and turned out to be largely
             illusory so far as the party’s diehards were concerned. At the party elections
             of June 30, Prieto’s supporters received a larger proportion of the votes than
             Caballero’s. The fact is that the stalwarts within the Socialist Party were
             really moderates after all; to the degree that Caballero continued to beat the
             drums of revolution, the membership gradually backed oﬀ. Perhaps even more
             signiﬁcantly, Caballero had lost his hard-core support when he permitted the
             Socialist Youth to combine organically with the Communist Youth in a single
             organization. Grossly ill-advised by his close friend Julio Alvarez del Vayo, who
             had just returned from a dazzling trip to Stalinist Russia, he had been led to
             believe that a fusion between the 200,000 young Socialists and some 50,000
             Communist Youth would permit the assimilation of the Communists by the
             Socialists, thereby strengthening his hand in the struggle with Prieto. A
             similar ploy was later planned for Catalonia, where the Socialists and
             Communists fused under Juan Comorera to found the Uniﬁed Socialist Party
             of Catalonia (PSUC). But this strategy backﬁred, producing the very reverse
             of what had been intended. By 1936 it required exceptional political myopia
             not to see that the Communists had become masters at swallowing up
             independent organizations under the cry of “unity.” For the Spanish
             Communist Party, as for Communist parties everywhere, “unity” had become
             the talisman for cannibalizing the entire left and making it over into a
             merchandisable instrument for Russian foreign policy in general and local
             Stalinist movements in particular. Accordingly, it was the Communists who
             acquired control over the Socialist Youth and the Catalan Socialists, depriving
             Caballero of his most important supporters. Neither the Caballerist policy of
             “revolution” nor the Prietist policy of collaboration won out. The Socialist
             Party merely stumbled through the spring of 1936, lacking a policy that would
             have uniﬁed either the forces for revolution or those for moderation.
                The trajectory of the CNT and the FAI seemed to follow a diametrically
             opposite course. While the Socialist Party was torn by divisions, the CNT was
             uniting with the Opposition Syndicates. Theoretically, the CNT favored unity
             with the UGT but on terms so revolutionary that they made collaboration on a
203 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             national scale virtually impossible. Caballero had counted heavily on gaining
             wide support not only from the left of his own party, but from the
             Anarchosydicalists as well. The latter, however, mistrusted him completely.
             His appeals for UGT-CNT unity failed to evoke a positive reaction within
             Anarchosyndicalist ranks, which had stored up gnawing recollections of
             treachery and betrayal at his hands. His appearance at the CNT’s national
             congress in May at Saragossa yielded no decisive results. The test of
             Caballero’s intentions came in June 1936, when 40,000 construction workers
             and 30,000 electricians and elevator repairmen, both groups drawn from the
             CNT and UGT, went out on strike in Madrid. The strike unnerved the
             Socialists completely. Even many Caballerists proved reluctant to match their
             revolutionary rhetoric with revolutionary action. The Socialists wanted to
             conclude the strike as quickly as possible, hopefully by arbitration and
             conventional negotiating methods. The CNT, on the other hand, openly
             pressured the workers for a revolutionary type of conﬂict. When their funds
             ran out cenetista strikers were encouraged to live according to the principles
             of comunismo libertario: they simply took their meals at restaurants and
             collected their groceries without paying for them. Embarrassed by such
             tactics, the UGT leaders vacillated over the question of a continuation of the
             strike. Finally, they withdrew. The CNT, however, carried it forward, and
             clashes between returning ugetistas and striking cenetistas resulted in
             several deaths.
                Caballero was totally discredited. His policy of UGT-CNT collaboration had
             been reduced to a shambles. The militancy of the CNT had not only frightened
             oﬀ many of his left-wing supporters but had corroborated the worst suspicions
             of the Anarchosyndicalists about the sincerity of his new revolutionary stance.
             No less signiﬁcantly, the strike itself, with its revolutionary connotations,
             thoroughly alarmed the middle class throughout Spain. If the strike was in
             any way a harbinger of the “Spanish Lenin’s” policies and his declamations in
             favor of a proletarian dictatorship, the middle class plainly wanted no part of
             them.
                Perhaps the alarm was greatest within the Popular Front government itself.
             If Prieto’s policy was to strengthen the Republicans with a Socialist coalition,
             Caballero’s was to weaken that coalition by abstaining from any ministerial
             support. The Caballerists, in eﬀect, were waiting for Azaña to discredit
             himself, after which the Socialist left would take over the government
             completely. The description of Caballero as the “Spanish Lenin” carried the
             unmistakable implication that Azaña was the “Spanish Kerensky.” This was a
             position Azaña would have never permitted himself to occupy. By 1936, both
             men had to come to detest each other, but personal considerations aside,
             Azaña was in an excellent position to block the left Socialist strategy.
             Although his popularity was waning rapidly among every sector of the
             Spanish population, in May he had changed the robes of prime minister of a
             Popular Front cabinet for that of president of the republic, thereby freeing
             himself from the vicissitudes of an uneasy ministerial alliance and
             parliamentary votes of conﬁdence. He was now in a position to select the
             appropriate prime minister for the coalition and he had chosen as his
             substitute one of his closest friends and collaborators, Casares Quiroga, a
             consumptive who, in Brenan’s words, “reacted to the danger of the situation
204 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             by an optimism that would have been considered insane if it were not a
             symptom of his disease.” Azaña himself had grown listless, almost indiﬀerent;
             his dream of a stable republic seemed to be turning into a nightmare whose
             course he could no longer control and whose destiny imbued him with the
             darkest pessimism. But if he was certain of anything, it was that Caballero
             would not play “Lenin” to his “Kerensky.” Thus on the eve of the most fateful
             military pronunciamiento in Spanish history, Republican policy, however much
             it vacillated, was consistent in at least one respect: the Socialist Party,
             especially its Caballerist faction, would not be permitted to acquire power.
             Stated in broader social terms, the Popular Front cabinet was committed
             above all else to preventing the working class from taking over Spain. The
             very class that had contributed most materially to the Popular Front victory
             was viewed by the leaders of that government as its most formidable and
             dangerous enemy.
               While Spain drifted toward civil war, the Anarchosyndicalists were occupied
             with cementing their own ranks at the famous national congress of the CNT in
             May 1936 at Saragossa. On the ﬁrst day of the month, nearly 650 delegates,
             representing 982 syndicates with a membership of 550,000, convened at the
             Iris Park. This congress, lasting ten days, was to become known as one of the
             most memorable meetings in the history of the CNT. It not only brought the
             Opposition Syndicates back to their parent organization but opened the most
             important discussion on the nature of a libertarian communist society to ever
             occupy a major working-class organization.
               Virtually all the speakers at the congress seemed to feel that Spain was
             entering into a revolutionary situation. Their seemingly utopian discussions of
             how the future society that followed that revolution would be organized thus
             had practical, indeed, immediate signiﬁcance. Amidst the welter of petty
             squabbles over delegate credentials, personalities, and the fate of the
             Opposition Syndicates, the congress found time to discuss problems as farranging as sexual rights and communal organization. Perhaps the most
             fascinating of the Saragossa congress’s resolutions dealt with “The
             Confederal Conception of Libertarian Communism.” Although this resolution
             received far less conventional newspaper coverage (the bourgeois press liked
             to titillate its readers with reports of discussions of “free love”), it became one
             of the most important statements of libertarian principles by the CNT.
               The resolution was careful to deny that it sought “to predict the structure of
             the future society ... since there is often a great chasm between theory and
             practice.” Nor was the revolution which ushered in that future society to be
             regarded as a sudden act of violence, for much depended upon revolutionary
             action as “a psychological phenomenon in opposition to the state of things
             that oppresses the aspirations and needs of the individual.” Violence was not
             the totality of the revolution but merely the ﬁrst step which abolishes “private
             property, the State, the principle of authority, and consequently, the class
             division of men into exploiters and exploited, oppressors and oppressed.” Its
             emphasis on revolution as a psychological phenomenon and its abhorrence of
             authority marks the resolution as a strictly Anarchist document. Indeed, such
             an orientation would have seemed out of place amid the “scientiﬁc,”
             “objective,” depersonalized rhetoric of a Marxist document.
               The resolution went on to describe the structural details of communal
205 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             organizations and their federation. Economic planning had’its base in “the
             producer, the individual as the cell, as the cornerstone of all social, economic
             and moral creation,” who functions through the work place, the syndicate,
             and the geographic commune. No contradiction need exist between the
             individual and free communal entities. “In accordance with the fundamental
             principles of libertarian communism, as we have stated above, all men will
             hasten to fulﬁll the voluntary duty—which will be converted into a true right
             when men work freely—of giving his assistance to the collective, according to
             his strength and capabilities, and the commune will accept the obligation of
             satisfying his needs.” The famous Communist slogan, “From each according
             to his ability, to each according to his need,” was to guide the commune in its
             allocation of resources and its claims on human labor.
               The resolution did not try to argue “that the early days of the revolution”
             would be easy ones. “Any constructive period calls for sacriﬁce and individual
             problems and of not creating diﬀiculties for the work of social reconstruction
             which we will all be realizing in agreement.” But the National Confederation
             of Communes which the new society would establish would allow for many
             variegated forms. “Naturists and nudists” (naturistas-desnudistas) or
             opponents of industrial technology, as well as traditional Anarchosyndicalists,
             would be free to create their own communal organizations. Amusing as this
             might have seemed to bourgeois journalists more than forty years ago, today,
             when our puritanical distance from the natural world may well lie at the root
             of the modern ecological crisis, the liberatory spirit of these lines seems
             almost prophetic. In time, “the new society should assure each commune of
             all the agricultural and industrial elements necessary for its autonomy, in
             accordance with the biological principle which aﬀirms that the man, and in
             this case, the commune, is most free, who has least need of others.”
               The resolution exuded a liberty-loving generosity toward the capacity of
             people to manage society freely and directly. “All of these functions will have
             no bureaucratic or executive character. Apart from those who work as
             technicians or simply statisticians, the rest will simply be carrying out their
             job as producers, gathered together at the end of the working day to discuss
             questions of detail which do not call for reference to a general assembly.” No
             systems of hierarchy here; no representatives invested with the power to
             make policy decisions; no organization of the division of labor into a system of
             authority. Indeed, according to the resolution, even the social enemies of
             today would be won over eventually to the Anarchist ideals of love, liberty,
             and education. “Libertarian communism is incompatible with any punitive
             regime, which implies the disappearance of the present system of punitive
             justice and all its instruments, such as prisons.” For “man is not bad by
             nature, and that deliquency is the logical result of the state of social injustice
             in which we live.” Clearly, “when his needs are satisﬁed and he is given
             rational and humane education, [the causes of social injustice] will disappear.”
               The revolution would not try to destroy the family, which, at its best, had
             played a solidarizing role in society. Libertarian communism, however,
             “proclaims free love, with no more regulation than the the free will of the men
             and women concerned, guaranteeing the children with the security of the
             community.” This resolution was carried unanimously by the delegates of the
             congress. It was written, discussed, and adopted not in the “enlightened”
206 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             1960s and 1970s, but in the severely patriarchal Catholic Spain of 1936.
             Today, it is impossible for an urbane and modernistic generation to realize
             how far these Anarchosyndicalist workingmen and workingwomen were in
             advance of their time. The tragedy of the movement they represented is that
             their dream was to be drowned in blood and washed away into the most
             remote corridors of history. Other people, living in another age, would be
             obliged to rediscover it without any knowledge that it had articulated the
             dreams and hopes of innumerable workers and peasants.
               When the delegates ﬁnally dispersed—many to die a few months later in the
             Civil War—the vision of this society seemed to override many practical
             problems. If there was anything “utopian” about the Saragossa congress, it
             was not its resolution on a libertarian communist society but (as Vernon
             Richards points out) “the lack of any discussion of the problems that might
             face the organization during the revolutionary period.” More speciﬁcally,
                 what was to be the attitude of the organization on the morrow of the
                 defeat of the military putsch when it found itself suddenly at the
                 head of the revolutionary movement. Such a possibility could easily
                 be envisaged in Catalonia, if not in the provinces under the Central
                 Government. Perhaps for the rank and ﬁle the answer was a simple
                 one: the social revolution. But in the light of subsequent actions, for
                 the leadership of the CNT it was not as simple as all that. Yet these
                 problems and doubts were not faced at the Congress, and for these
## serious omissions of foresight, or perhaps of revolutionary
                 democracy in the organization, the revolutionary workers paid
## dearly in the months that followed.

               As early as March, scarcely more than a few weeks after the Popular Front
             had come to power, the generals and politicans who were to stage the military
             uprising of July 17 met secretly in Madrid to formulate their plans. The
             natural leader for the revolt seemed to be General Jose Sanjurjo, organizer of
             the aborted pronunciamiento of August 1932, who lived in Portugal but kept
             himself intimately informed of events across the frontier. A military
             conspiracy alone, however, hardly seemed tenable. Political support was
             needed. Sanjurjo was a Monarchist and so too were “an appreciable number
             of oﬀicers involved in the conspiracy. No one seemed more suitable to
             advance their cause among civilian Monarchists than Jose Calvo Sotelo, the
             former minister of ﬁnance in Primo de Rivera’s government, who enjoyed a
             reputation as a formidable orator and a shrewd politician. Calvo Sotelo had
             traveled widely through Europe, where he became enamored of corporative
             and fascist ideologies. In the Cortes he was the avowed spokeman of the
             Monarchists, perhaps of the entire militant right. By June, his speeches had
             virtually disrupted parliamentary debates: he avowed fascistic beliefs,
             attacked the “antimilitary” policies of the government, and freely delivered
             himself of insulting personal remarks to Republican oﬀicials. The left saw him
             as a continual provocation and viewed him as the very incarnation of fascism
             in Spain.
               More symbolic than real at these conspiratorial meetings was the ﬁgure of
             Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera. While in prison the son of the former dictator
             had become the hero of the extreme right. From the welter of Carlist,

             conservative, and clerical groups, the Falange was to eventually emerge as
             the political backbone of what was later to be called the “Nationalist” cause
             and Jose Antonio was to become its martyr after his execution during the Civil
             War. Behind the parties and generals stood the entrenched wealth and power
             of Spain’s great land magnates, industrialists, aristocrats, clergy, and sectors
             of the petty bourgeoisie.
               But the real responsibility for the revolt rested in the hands of the generals
             and their success required careful planning. Colonel Valentin Galarza
             represented Sanjurjo. He was joined by the presumably liberal General Mola,
             Colonel Yague of the Foreign Legion, the moderate Republican General
             Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, who had abandoned his slender loyalties to the
             government with the victory of the Popular Front, Generals Villegas and
             Fanjul, who had the misfortune of being stationed in Madrid, General Goded,
             and only later, by General Francisco Franco. The government was not
             unmindful of the potential for a military pronunciamiento. It had been quietly
             shifting reactionary oﬀicers to remote posts—Franco had been packed oﬀ to
             the Canary Islands, Goded to the Balearics. The minister of war, authorized to
             ignore rules of seniority in appointing commands, ﬁlled key vacancies with
             oﬀicers known to be sympathetic to the republic. Unluckily, Mola, who held
             the main threads of the conspiracy in his hands, had been assigned to the
             Pamplona military district in the heart of Navarre, where he could count on
             Carlist support.
               The rising was scheduled to occur between July 10 and 20, at which time
             Sanjurjo was to return to Spain by airplane and take over command of the
             rebel forces. Mola was to lead the garrisons of Pamplona and Burgos;
             Villegas, the Madrid garrison. Cabanellas was to seize Anarchist Saragossa;
             Goded, Barcelona; and Queipo de Llano, Seville.Trusted junior oﬀicers were
             to lead out their garrisons in other cities. Franco was to ﬂy to Spanish
             Morocco, where he would take command of the army of Africa. It was
             generally agreed that the leading military conspirators would form a
             Directory with the power to issue laws, later to be ratiﬁed by a Constituent
             Assembly elected irﬁder an implicitly restricted suﬀrage. The
             pronunciamiento seemed, as yet, to be inspired more by the precendent of
             Primo de Rivera than by Hitler’s, although it was slowly to acquire many
             fascistic features. The bloody Civil War, the Falange, and perhaps the
             vindictive personality of Franco, who was destined to replace Sanjurjo after
             the latter was accidently killed in the ﬂight to Spain, would give the
             movement the most vicious thrust of any modern civil war in western Europe.
               The uprising of the generals had been predicted by left-wing spokesmen
             months before it occurred. As early as February 14, the CNT had issued a
             prophetic manifesto warning that day by day, “the suspicion grows that rightwing elements are ready to provoke a military coup. Morocco appears to be
             the focal point of the conspiracy. The insurrection is subject to the outcome of
             the elections. The plan will be put into eﬀect if the Left wins. We do not
             support the Republic, but we will contribute all our eﬀorts to an all-out ﬁght
             against fascism in order to defeat the traditional oppressors of the
             proletariat.” This, of course, was mere guesswork. It tells us more about the
             course the CNT was to follow in the Civil War and its inability to formulate a
             policy to deal with the consequences of its electoral support of the Popular
208 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Front than it does about the actual behavior of the right on the eve of the
             elections. Republican oﬀicers with more substantial facts had informed the
             government in April that military conspiracies were underway. On May 1st,
             Prieto with uncanny prescience not only had warned of a military revolt but
             had singled out Franco as the most likely candidate for the dictator of Spain.
             The government was well aware of Fanjul’s operations in Madrid. Even
             conservative deputies whom Calvo Sotelo had tried to enlist in the conspiracy
             reported his eﬀorts to the cabinet.
                As the evidence increased, so did the government’s paralysis in the face of
             the impending crisis. Indeed, shortly before the rebellion, Azaña publicly
             assured journalists and political colleagues that the current unrest was
             temporary and would soon be followed by a more tranquil atmosphere. But
             tension continued to mount. On July 11, a group of Falangists brieﬂy seized
             the radio station of Valencia and broadcast the following message: “Radio
             Valencia. The Spanish Falange has taken possession of the transmitter by
             force of arms. Tomorrow the same thing will happen at all the radio stations
             in Spain.” This event followed by only a few hours a conﬁdential warning to
             Casares Quiroga that a military uprising was imminent, to which the prime
             minister ﬂippantly replied: “So you are assuring me that the oﬀicers are going
             to rise! Very well, gentlemen, let them rise. I, in contrast, am going to lie
             down.” The next day, on July 12, a Socialist lieutenant of the Assault Guards
             was shot to death by a group of Falangist gunmen. Within hours of the
             assassination, the victim’s angry comrades had decided upon a dramatic act
             of revenge. Arriving at Calvo Sotelo’s home in a police car, they “arrested” the
             right-wing parliamentary leader, drove oﬀ with him in their vehicle, and shot
             him, dumping his body in the Madrid cemetery. The generals had found their
             martyr. The day of the uprising was pushed forward to July 17 to take
             advantage of the sensation produced by the assassinations arid the
             commanders were placed in a state of readiness.
                In Madrid the leftist parties, headed by Caballero requested arms but the
             government coldly refused. Up to the very point of rebellion, when
             transmitters seized by the army in Morocco were broadcasting the news of
             the pronunciamiento, the government of Liberal Republicans was to speak out
             “again to conﬁrm the absolute tranquility of the whole Peninsula” and inform
             the workers’ organizations that they should “guarantee the normality of daily
             life, in order to set a high example of serenity and of conﬁdence in the means
             of the military strength of the government”—a “military strength” the Popular
             Front government no longer, enjoyed. While the government enjoined the
             workers’ parties to passivity and “serenity,” the National Committees of the
             Socialist and Communist parties in Madrid obligingly issued a joint
             declaration of their own opining that the “moment is a diﬀicult one but by no
             means desperate.” The declaration concluded with the stirring injunction:
             “The Government commands and the Popular Front obeys.” The workers of
             Madrid were assured that the “Government is certain that it has suﬀicient
             resources to overcome the criminal attempt.” In response to Calvo Sotelo’s
             assassination, the government in fact had closed down not only the
             Monarchist and Carlist headquarters in the capital (presumably to prevent
             disorders) but also the Anarchist centers. This attempt to neutralize the most
             militant elements in the labor movement all but assured that Madrid would
209 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             remain “serene.” A confused situation emerged in the capital: the CNT, “on
             war footing ever since the building strike,” observe Pierre Broue and Emile
             Temime in their perceptive account of the Spanish Revolution’ and Civil War,
             “decided to use force to reopen its oﬀices closed by the police and began to.
             requisition cars and search for arms. David Antona, secretary of its National
             Committee, was freed [from prison] on the morning of 19 July; he went to the
             Ministry of the Interior and threatened to send his men to attack the prisons
             and release the militants who were still imprisoned there.” The left Socialists
             unearthed and distributed the arms they had concealed since the October
             events of 1934. Workers’ patrols began to appear on the streets. Yet Madrid,
             on the whole, was strangely guarded in its actions. No assaults were made on
             the barracks; indeed, one rebel regiment made its way out of the capital,
             apparently without opposition, to join forces with Mola in the north. UGT
             construction workers, dutifully obeying the Ministry of Labor’s strike awards,
             returned to their jobs. The CNT cdntinued its strike, although by now both
             unions had given orders for a general strike. No decisive ﬁghting occurred on
             either side in Madrid until two days after the pronundamiento when
             loudspeakers in the streets broadcast the news that the Barcelona proletariat
             had been victorious in an open struggle with Goded’s troops.
               It was in Anarchosyndicalist Barcelona—and virtually in that city alone—
             that serious preparations and the most eﬀective eﬀorts were undertaken to
             cope with the military rebellion. Instead of issuing reassuring statements
             after the fashion of the Socialist and Communist parties in Madrid, the CNT
             and FAI placed the entire working class of the city on the alert. Cenetista
             workers ﬁlled their syndicate halls clamoring for arms. Although the CNT and
             FAI had formed a liason committee with the Generalitat to cope with the
             military uprising in a united manner, Companys responded to these demands
             by declaring that no weapons were available. But this was Barcelona, not
             Madrid, where “The Government commands and the Popular Front obeys.”
             With characteristic independence, a group of Anarchosyndicalist dock
             workers led by Juan Yague secretly boarded ships in the harbor, stripped them
             of weapons, and deposited the arms in a syndicate headquarters. The
             headquarters was soon surrounded by police and after delicate negotiations
             some of the weapons were returned to avoid a conﬂict with the police, many
             of whom were sympathetic to the workers’ cause and were later to aid them
             in ﬁghting the rebel troops. During the afternoon of the 18th, cenetistas
             raided sporting goods stores and whatever arms depots they could ﬁnd; they
             also seized dynamite from the dockyards. Sympathetic Assault Guards
             distributed arms from their barracks. From the building syndicate, which had
             now become a sort of “war” headquarters for the CNT, plans were drawn up
             for resistance. Private cars, splashed with the letters “CNT-FAI,” prowled the
             streets as a warning that the Anarchosyndicalists were prepared for battle in
             the event of any uprising. Workers, often acting largely on their own, began to
             arrest known Falangists and rightists, stopping all suspicious passersby near
             government buildings and barracks. CNT workers mounted a 24-hour guard
             on their headquarters while all over town their comrades, armed with
             makeshift weapons, lay in wait for any suspicious action by the troops.
               On July 18, the generals declared their pronundamiento and, in the morning
             hours of the next day, solidiers of the Barcelona garrison, perhaps the largest
210 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             in Spain, began to leave their quarters to occupy strategic centers of the city.
             Almost everywhere they encountered workers massed behind barricades,
             snipers from rooftops, and immense crowds walking toward them with their
             few weapons raised over their heads, pleading with the soldiers not to shoot
             their proletarian brother and sisters. Where these pleas were disregarded, the
             troops encountered furious resistance by armed workers or, to their utter
             amazement, were simply overwhelmed by crowds that surged forward in total
             disregard of the military’s superior ﬁre-power. The generals’ uprising had
             begun—but so too had the libertarian social revolution.
             Chapter Eleven: Concluding Remarks
               We must leave the details of that revolution—its astonishing achievements
             and its tragic subversion—to another volume. That Sanjurjo was to perish in a
             plane crash on his way to Spain, leaving Franco commander of the entire
             military uprising; that the war on the peninsula was to become inextricably
             tied to European power politics; that ijpain was to endure three tormenting
             years of internecine conﬂict—all of these events belong to the conventional
             histories of the Spanish Civil War. Without entering into a discussion at this
             time of the Anarchist collectives and the experiments in workers’ control of
             industry that developed in the latter half of 1936, we must try to assess the
             meaning of the events recounted in this volume. What was the place of the
             Spanish Anarchist movement in the larger history of proletarian socialism?
             What were its possibilities—and its limits? Are the organizational forms
             developed by the CNT and FAI relevant to radical movements in our own
             time? Today, long after the Spanish Anarchist movement was destroyed by
             Franco, these beguiling questions linger on. The movement still haunts us—
             not only as a noble dream or perhaps a tragic memory, but as a fascinating
             test of libertarian theory and practice.
               Although Spanish Anarchism was virtually unknown to radicals abroad
             during the “heroic years” of its development, it could be argued in all
             earnestness that it marked the most magniﬁcent ﬂowering and, in the curious
             dialectic of such processes, the deﬁnitive end, of the century-long history of
             proletarian Socialism.
               The emergence of the working’class, speciﬁcally of the Parisian proletariat,
             as a revolutionary force on the June barricades of 1848 had totally changed
             the landscape of earlier radical theory. Until that event, critical views of
             society had been shaped by the notion of a broad populist conﬂict between an
             entrenched minority of oppressors and a dominated mass of oppressed.
             Radicals generally conceived of these polarized segments of society in very illdeﬁned terms. Under the rubric of the “people” (le peuple), they fashioned a
             broad constituency in which highly variegated, later historically hostile, strata
             such as craftsmen, factory workers, peasants, professionals, petty merchants,
             and entrepreneurs of small industrial installations were cemented by a
             common oppression at the hands of monarchs, aristocrats, and the wealthiest
             sectors of commercial, ﬁnancial, and industrial classes. Accordingly, the
             “people” were united more by the social elements they opposed than by an
             authentic community of shared economic interests.

               In the opening years of the Great French Revolution of 1789, the “people”
             was actually a coalition rather than a class. As the revolution unfolded, this
             coalition began to disintegrate. Lofty utopian ideals based on liberty and
             equality could not suppress antagonisms that craftsmen felt for their
             erstwhile merchant allies or factory workers for their employers. Nor were
             these ideals suﬀicient to temper the narrow parochialism of the peasantry and
             the egotistical aspirations for advancement on the part of the professionals.
             “Nationhood,” “patriotism,” and the republican virtues that inhered in the
             concept of “citizenship” barely concealed the widening antagonisms and
             diverging interests that coexisted within the so-called “Third Estate,”—a term,
             it is worth noting, that was initially borrowed from feudalism in order to
             oppose feudalism.
               The June 1848 rising of the Parisian proletariat replaced the populist
             struggle with the class struggle, dispelling the traditional mystique of the
             “people,” the “nation,” and the “citizen.” It was now clear that the popular
             coalitions against pre-industrial elites embodied hostile classes. A “scientiﬁc”
             socialism, divested of any moral or ethical content, began to replace the
             ethically charged populist and utopian socialism that had been born in the
             late years of the Great French Revolution and its aftermath. “Surplus value”
             was an increment unique in form: the bourgeoisie acquired it not by the
             forcible appropriation of surplus labor and of the laborers themselves but by
             the seemingly fair exhange of labor power for wages on the open market.
             Workers were no longer slaves or serfs; they were juridically “free” and hence
             represented an historically unprecedented type of oppressed class. Lacking
             the industrial facilities which were owned by the bourgeoisie, they were free
             to work—or, of course, to starve. “Liberty” in becoming a political reality, had
             only been rendered even more of an economic ﬁction. By the mere possession
             of industrial facilities that were too large to belong to the tool kit of the
             traditional craftsmen, the bourgeoisie (itself a unique historical class) had
             emerged, and by the mere workings of the free market in labor power, this
             class was able to ensnare the proletariat in a skein of subservience,
             expropriation, and exploitation. Everyone in society was “free” and “equal”;
             indeed, this very “freedom” to own property without restriction and the
             “equality” of a fair exchange of labor power for wages concealed the
             enslavement of the workers to capital as an inevitable process.[47]
               The “free market” also made inevitable the radicalization of the proletariat.
             The ongoing competition between “free entrepreneurs,” each seeking to
             capture an increasing portion of the market, involved a ruthless process of
             price-cutting and capital accumulation, concomitantly leading to overall
             reductions in the wages of the working class. Eventually, the working class
             would become so impoverished that it would be driven to social revolution.
             Marx gave no credence to the notion that the proletariat would revolt under
             the impulse of high-minded ideals. “When socialist writers ascribe this
             revolutionary historic role to the proletariat,” he observes,
                 it is not ... because they consider the proletarians as gods. Rather
                 the contrary. Since the abstraction of all humanity, even of the
                 semblance of humanity, is practically complete in the full-grown
                 proletariat [my emphasis, here—M.B.] since all the conditions of life
212 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
                  of the proletariat sum up alf the conditions of life of society today in
## all their inhuman acuity; since man has lost himself in the
                  proletariat, yet at the same time has not only gained theoretical
## consciousness of that loss, but through urgent, no longer
                  disguisable, absolutely imperative need—that practical expression
                  of necessity—is driven directly to revolt against that inhumanity....
                  Not in vain does it go through the stern but steeling school of
                  labour. The question is not what this or that proletarian, or even the
                  whole of the proletariat at the moment considers as its aim. The
                  question is what the proletariat is, and what, consequent on that
                  being, it will be compelled to do.[48]
                Accordingly, socialism becomes “scientiﬁc” and develops as a science’ of
             “proletarian socialism” because of what the proletariat “will be compelled to
             do,*” not because it is composed of “gods.” Marx, moreover, imparted this
             revolutionary function to the “full-grown proletariat,” not to declasse peasants
             who had been removed from the land or to impoverished craftsmen, the social
             strata with which the capitalist class was to man the factories and mills of
             industrial society. Unless events patently forced Marx to acknowledge the
             radical traits and insurrectionary volatility of these declasse elements, he
             generally viewed such strata as the alte scheisse (the “old shit”), lingering
             over from the formative era of industrial capitalism. The hopes of “proletarian
             socialism” lay primarily in the “full-grown” proletariat of modern industry, “a
             class always increasing in numbers, and disciplined, united, organized by the
             very mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself.” Proletarian
             socialism, in eﬀect, was meant to demystify the notion of the “people” as a
             homogeneous revolutionary mass and to demonstrate that beliefs such as
             “liberty” and “equality” could not be divorced from the material conditions of
             social life.
                Yet within this very process of demystiﬁcation, Marxism generated a
             number of highly misleading myths which were to show the limits of
             proletarian socialism itself. The June barricades of 1848 had in fact been
             manned not by an industrial proletariat “disciplined, united, and organized by
             the process of capitalist production,” but by craftsmen, home-workers,
             nondescript laborers of every sort, porters, unemployed urban and rural poor,
             even tavern keepers, waiters, and prostitutes—in short, the ﬂotsam and
             jetsam of French society which the ruling classes had habitually designated as
             canaille. These very same elements, nearly a quarter of a century later, were
             to man the barricades of the Paris Commune. It was precisely the
             industrialization of France after the Commune—and with this process, the
             emergence of a “full-grown” hereditary proletariat “disciplined, united,
             organized by the process of capitalist production”—that ﬁnally was to silence
             the “crowing” of the French “Red Cock” that had summoned Europe to
             revolution during the nineteenth century. Indeed, much the same could be
             said of the Russian proletariat of 1917, so recently recruited from the
             countryside that it was anything but a “full-grown” working class.
                The great proletarian insurrections that seemed to lend such compelling
             support to the concept of proletarian socialism were fueled primarily by social
             strata that lived within neither industrial nor village society but in the tense,

             almost electrifying force-ﬁeld of both. Proletarian socialism became a
             revolutionary force for nearly a century not because a well-organized,
             consolidated, hereditary proletariat had emerged with the factory system but
             because of the very process of proletarianization. Dispossessed rural people
             and craftsmen were being removed from a disintegrating preindustrial way of
             life and plunged into standardized, dehumanizing, and mechanized urban and
             industrial surroundings. Neither the village and small shop as such nor the
             factory as such predisposed them to the boldest kind of social action; rather,
             they were moved by the disintegration of the former and the shock of the
             latter. Demoralized to the point of recklessness, declasse in spirit and often in
             fact, they became the adherents of the Paris Commune, the Petrograd soviets,
             and the Barcelona CNT.
                The very “half-grown” quality of the early proletariat, formerly peasants and
             craftsmen or perhaps a generation removed from such status, produced a
             volatility, intractability, and boldness that the industrial system and factory
             hierarchy was to attenuate in their descendants—the hereditary proletariat of
             the 1940s and 1950s, a class that knew no other world but the industrial one.
             For this class, no tension was to exist between town and country, the anomie
             of the city and the sense of shared responsibility of the small community, the
             standardized rythmns of the factory and the physiological rhythms of the land.
             The premises of the proletariat in this later era were formed around the
             validity of the factory as an arena of productive activity, the industrial
             hierarchy as a system of technical authority, and the union bureaucracy as a
             structure of class command. The era of proletarian socialism came to an end
             in a step-by-step process during which the “half-grown,” presumably
             “primitive,” proletariat became “full-grown,” “mature”—in short, fully
             proletarianized.
                The proletariat, in eﬀect, became psychologically and spiritually part of the
             very social system it had been destined, according to Marxian precept, to
             overthrow. Proletarian socialism, not surprisingly, became an institutionalized
             movement for the industrial mobilization of labor, largely economistic in its
             goals; it solidiﬁed into labor parties that articulated a pragmatic liberalism,
             thereby blunting even the Intellectual susceptibility of the working class to
             revolutionary ideals. Finally and most disastrously, it fused with capitalism’s
             inherent historic trend toward economic planning, centralized political and
             industrial control, hierarchical regulation, and economic nationalization. The
             socialist ideal of freedom, divested of its ethical content by “scientiﬁc
             socialism” and burdened with the pragmatic considerations of centralized
             planning and economic nationalization, became a mere ideological device for
             mobilizing popular support around state capitalism.
                If only because of the element of time, Spanish Anarchism did not share the
             historic fate of proletarian socialism. Indeed, it may very well have formed the
             last step in the development of revolutionary proletarian socialism before the
             latter’s destiny as a variant of state-capitalist ideology became evident. In any
             case, the libertarian revolution of July 1936 seemed to have gathered to itself
             many of the noble qualities that were only partially developed in earlier
             uprisings of the worker’s movement. In July 1936, the CNT and FAI were
             suﬀiciently independent as a workers’ movement, certainly by comparison
             with the Socialists and POUM, to make Barcelona the most revolutionary city
214 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             in Spain. No other large urban area was to achieve the social goals of
             revolutionary syndicalism as fully, to collectivize industry as resolutely, and to
             foster communal forms of land management as extensively as Barcelona and
             its environs. Orwell’s description of the city during this phase is still
             intoxicating: the squares and avenues bedecked with black-and-red ﬂags, the
             armed people, the slogans, the stirring revolutionary songs, the feverish
             enthusiasm of creating a new world, the gleaming hope, and the inspired
             heroism.
                Yet the limits of this development become painfully evident if one asks:
             could there have been an Anarchosyndicalist society even if the generals had
             been crushed in 1936? Apparently, very few serious Anarchist theoreticians
             seem to have believed this. A mixed economy, yes—although how long the
             revolutionary fervor of the more ascetic communistic collectives might have
             resisted the temptations and demands of a coexisting market economy is
             diﬀicult to predict. Whether a communist revolution could occur in an
             industrially undeveloped country—indeed, whether such a revolution might
             even succeed temporarily under materially demanding conditions of life—has
             never been a matter of dispute between Marx and the Anarchists.[49] Whether
             such a revolution could permanently establish a communist society, however,
             is quite another matter. In a work called After the Revolution, written shortly
             before the military rebellion and widely discussed within the Spanish
             Anarchist movement, the distinguished Anarchist theorist Abad de Santillan
             shows a keen realization of the importance of this problem:

## We are cognizant of the fact that the grade of economic
                  development and material conditions of life inﬂuence powerfully
                  human psychology. Faced with starvation, the individual becomes an
                  egoist; with abundance he may become generous , friendly and
                  socially disposed. All periods of privation and penury produce
                  brutality, moral regression and a ﬁerce struggle of all against all for
                  daily bread. Consequently, it is plain that economics inﬂuences
                  seriously the spiritual life of the individual and his social
                  relations.That is precisely why we are aiming to establish the best
                  possible economic conditions, which will act as a guarantee of equal
## and solid relationships among men. We will not stop being
                  anarchists, on an empty stomach, but we do not exactly like to have
## empty stomachs.

               The problem of material scarcity is not merely that “Man pitted against man
             is a wolf and he can never become a real brother to man, unless he has
             material security,” but perhaps more signiﬁcantly that with material security,
             indeed, with abundance, human beings can also discover what they do not
             need. I refer not only to material needs but also to spiritual ones—notably
             competition, money, and even contracts and social institutions that underwrite
             strict systems of reciprocity based on equivalences. No longer driven by
             material insecurity, no longer a creature of brute necessity, the individual can
             advance from the realm of “fairness,” equivalence, and justice to the much
             higher moral realm of freedom in which people work to the best of their
             abilities and receive according to their needs. Finally, in an abundant
             economy that can provide for personal needs with a minimum of toil, the
215 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             individual can acquire the free time for self-cultivation and full participation
             in the direct management of social life.
                Spanish Anarchism revealed how far proletarian socialism could press
             toward an ideal of freedom on moral premises alone. Given a favorable
             conjunction of events, a revolutionary workers’ and peasants’ movement had
             indeed been able to make a libertarian revolution, collectivize industry, and
             create historically unprecedented possibilities for the management of the
             factories and land by those who worked them. Indeed, the revolutionary act of
             crushing the military rebellion in key cities of Spain,” of taking direct control
             of the economy, even if under the mere compulsion of external events, had
             acted as a powerful spiritual impulse in its own right, appreciably altering the
             attitudes and views of less committed sectors of the oppressed. Thus
             proletarian socialism had pushed Spanish society beyond any materially
             delimiting barriers into a utopian experiment of astonishing proportions—into
             what Burnett Bolloten has aptly described as a “far-reaching social revolution
             ... more profound in. jorne respects than the Bolshevik revolution in its early
             stages....” Not only had workers established control over industry and
             peasants formed free collectives on the land, but in many instances even
             money had been abolished and the most radical communistic precepts had
             replaced bourgeois concepts of work, distribution, and administration.
                But what would happen when everyday life began to feel the pinch of
             economic want—of the material problems imposed not only by the Civil War
             but by Spain’s narrow technological base? “Communism will be the result of
             abundance,” Santillan had warned in the spring of 1936, “without which it
             will remain only an ideal.” Could the revolutionary ardor of the CNT and FAI
             surmount the obstacles of scarcity and material want in the basic necessities
             of life, obstacles that had limited the forward thrust of earlier revolutions?
             Could mutual aid and proletarian initiative survive the drift toward egotism
             and bureaucratization? The answers to these questions must be deferred to
             the next volume, together with an account of the impact of Stalinist
             counterrevolution, particularly in the Anarchist areas of Spain.
                But the paradox confronting the classical doctrine of proletarian socialism
             must be seen clearly, if the Spanish Revolution is to have any meaning for our
             times. Proletarian socialism, as doctrine and historic movement, is trapped by
             its very premises. For workers to become revolutionary as workers—as a class
             of dispossessed wage earners engaged in an irreconcilable struggle with a
             class of capitalist property-owners—presupposes the very material want
             which in no small measure prevents the proletariat from directly organizing
             and controlling society. Material want, a product not only of exploitation but
             also of an inadequate technological base, denies workers the material security
             and free time to transform the totality of society—economic, political, and
             spiritual conditions of life.
                The relatively aﬄuent decades that were to follow the Spanish Revolution—
             decades that were a product not only of economic rationalization and
             planning along state capitalist lines but also of extraordinary technological
             achievement—revealed that the proletariat could be absorbed into bourgeois
             society, that it could be turned into an adaptive rather than a revolutionary
             class. Organized and disciplined by the factory, it could in tact become an
             extension of the factory into society at large, a victim of the factory’s narrow

             economistic functions and its system of standardization and hierarchy. I am
             not contending here that any social revolution in our time can be achieved
             without the active support of the proletariat but rather that any such
             revolution can no longer be cast in terms of “proletarian hegemony,” of
             working-class leadership. A social revolution, at least in the advanced
             capitalist countries of the world, presupposes a wide-ranging discontent with
             every aspect of capitalist society: the anomie and atomization fostered by the
             bourgeois megalopolis, discontent with the quality of everyday life, an
             awareness of the meaninglessness of a life devoted to mindless toil, an acute
             consciousness of hierarchy and domination in all its forms. In the case of
             hierarchy and domination, a liberated society would be expected to feel the
             need to abolish not only class rule and economic exploitation, but the
             domination of women by men, of the young by the old, of one ethnic group by
             another. One can easily enumerate a host of such broader issues and these
             have increasingly supplanted, even within the working class itself, the
             traditional economic issues that emerged out of the struggle between wage
             labor and capital. The traditional issues of wages, hours, and working
             conditions remain, to be sure, and the traditional struggle continues, but they
             have lost their revolutionary thrust. History itself has turned them into
             routine problems of negotiation, to be dealt with through established
             mechanisms and institutions that function entirely within the system. The
             steady erosion of the trade-union movement and of labor parties from
             institutions with a larger social vision to a “loyal opposition” within the
             factory, oﬀice, and state is perhaps the most telling evidence of this
             degeneration.
                The larger problems of abolishing hierarchy and domination, of achieving a
             spiritually nourishing daily life, of replacing mindless toil by meaningful work,
             of attaining the free time for the selfmanagement of a truly solidarizing
             human community—all of these growing demands have emerged not from a
             perspective of mere survival in an economy of scarce means, but rather from
             the very opposite social constellation. They stem from a gnawing tension, the
             problem of new technological advances, between needless scarcity on the one
             hand and the promise of free time and the satisfaction of basic human wants
             on the other. This tension is felt by a much wider constituency than the
             industrial proletariat. It can be sensed in students, professionals, small
             proprietors, so-called “white-collar” workers, service and government
             employees, declasse elements, and even sections of the bourgeoisie as well as
             in the “full-grown” proletariat—in short, in sectors of society that were never
             accorded serious consideration as forces for revolution within the framework
             of proletarian socialism. This tension centers not only on economic problems
             but spiritual ones as well. It fosters a unique commitment not so much to
             “socialism,” with its highly centralized state institutions and hierarchically
             organized bureaucratic infrastructure, but to a vision of a nonhierarchical,
             libertarian society (often simplistically designated as “socialism”) in which
             people in free communities administer society on the basis of direct
             democracy and exercise full control over their daily lives.
                The genius of Spanish Anarchism stems from its ability to fuse the concerns
             of traditional proletarian socialism with broader more contemporary
             aspirations. In the very act of criticizing one remarkable achievement of the
217 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Spanish Anarchist movement, the aﬀinity group, Santillan inadvertently
             reveals its uniqueness. Moreover, he discloses the clash between tradition and
             dream that existed within Spanish Anarchism in the 1930s. “We believe there
             is a little confusion in some libertarian circles between social conviviality,
             group aﬀinity and the economic function,” he warns. “Visions of happy
             Arcadias or free communes were imagined by the poets of the past; for the
             future, conditions appear quite diﬀerent. In the factory we do not seek the
             aﬀinity of friendship but the aﬀinity of work. It is not an aﬀinity of character,
             except on the basis of professional capacity and quality of work, which is the
             basis of conviviality in the factory.” —
               These are stern words. They emerge from the vocabulary of scarcity, the
             work ethic, toil, and Iberian puritanical mores. They would have been viewed
             as gravely realistic injunctions by the leaders of the Spanish Socialist Party.
             They reﬂect the harsh realities of proletarian socialism in the 1930s, not the
             sensibilities of the “future.”
               But the fact that for Santillan to enjoin his comrades in the spring of 1936
             to reject “social conviviality” in the work process, to eliminate “group aﬀinity”
             in productive activity as an archaic vision of “happy Arcadias,” reveals the
             visionary form in which such groups were actually seen by many Spanish
             Anarchists. If we, today, increasingly see the need to turn work into a festive
             and “Arcadian” experience, if we address ourselves to a new sense of
             possibility that inheres in the work process, we would do well to recognize
             that it is only because of the technological opportunities created by our own
             time that we enjoy this privilege. Proletarian socialism in the 1930s had
             turned the factory not only into the locus of social change but into the reality
             principle of the socialist spirit. In a world of material scarcity and toil, this
             reality principle allowed for minimal “social conviviality.” Santillan errs
             primarily in one respect: he speaks not for the “future” but for the “present,”
             a “present” whose values were destined to undergo major transformation in
             the decades that lay ahead. A dedicated Anarchist of a distinct historical era,
             he reveals all its limitations even as he tries pragmatically to chart its future
             trajectory. Although he may have been correct for his time, it was a time that
             could scarcely yield a society of “happy Arcadias” in which the means of life
             would be freely available to all and work would be performed according to
             one’s desire and ability.
               How did it happen than, that the Spanish Anarchists in the 1930s formed
             such visions of “social conviviality,” “group aﬀinity,” and “happy Arcadias”?
             On this score at least, Santillan, even as he voices his objections, is true to the
             locale as well as to the time of his movement. The Spanish Anarchists who
             held these Arcadian visions were, in fact, poets of the past. They had formed
             their dreams from the “social conviviality” of their pueblos, from their preindustrial culture and spiritual heritage. To use our own terms, in their
             dreams the Spanish Anarchists perpetuated a sense of continuity with a
             “primitive communism” of the past, one which they doubtless idealized within
             the context of Spanish conditions. Yet this communism, despite its
             “primitiveness,” possessed more elements of the sophisticated communism of
             the future than the factory socialism of the workers’ movement. It should not
             be forgotten that the “happy Arcadias” and “free communes” which Spanish
             Anarchists had borrowed from visions of the past were often no less stern
218 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             than Santillan’s image of the factory. They too conceived their communal, free
             “Arcadias” in gravely puritanical terms. They believed in “free love” because
             they believed in the freedom to mate without political or religious sanction,
             but they shunned free sexuality and promiscuity. They envisioned conviviality
             at the work place, but they admired hard work and almost celebrated its
             purifying qualities. In their “Arcadian” society there could be “no rights
             without duties, no duties without rights.” Although all these traits add a
             spiritual, ethical, and convivial dimension to the proletarian socialism of the
             factory, it is a socialism that is built no less around scarcity, denial, and toil
             than is Santillan’s. Santillan merely tried to remind them of the contradiction
             that lurked in their vision, for there could be no real “Arcadias” unless the
             land ﬂowed with milk and honey. If the paradisiacal poetry to which Santillan
             refers has any possibility of reality today, the puritanical Spanish Anarchist
             “Arcadia” of yesteryear was no less a vision, a “mere ideal,” than Santillan’s
             sterner vision of a future libertarian society based on “the aﬀinity of work.”
                Yet the Spanish Anarchists left behind a tangible reality that has
             considerable relevance for social radicalism today.Their movement’s “heroic
             years,” 1868 to 1936, were marked by a fascinating process of
             experimentation in organizational forms, decision-making techniques,
             personal values, educational goals, and methods of struggle. From the days of
             the International and the Alliance of Social Democracy to those of the CNT
             and FAI, Spanish Anarchists of all varieties—collectivist, syndicalist, and
             communist—had evolved an astonishingly well-organized subculture within
             Spanish society that fostered enormous freedom of action by local syndicates
             and aﬀinity groups. If the Spanish political sphere had denied the individual
             peasant and worker full participation in the management of social aﬀairs, the
             Anarchist movement nourished their participation. Far more important than
             the episodic revolutionary uprisings, the individual atentados, or the daring
             escapades of small circles of comrades like the ‘Solidarios was the ability of
             the Spanish Anarchists to patiently knit together highly independent groups
             (united by “social conviviality” as well as by social views) into sizable,
             coherent organizations to coordinate them into eﬀective social forces when
             crises emerged, and to develop an informed mode of spontaneity that fused
             the most valuable traits of group discipline with personal initiative. Out of this
             process emerged an organic community and a sense of mutual aid unequaled
             by any workers’ movement of that era. Indeed, no less important as a subject
             of study than the workers’ committees and agrarian collectives that were to
             follow the July revolution was the movement that created the ground work for
             libertarian social structures—the Spanish Anarchist movement itself.
             Bibliographical Essay
             1. General Works

               Surprisingly few general histories of Spanish Anarchism exist in any
             language and those which are available, with a couple of exceptions, are too
             cursory to supply a very rewarding account of the movement. Juan Gomez
             Casa’s Historia del Anarcosindicalismo (Madrid, 1968) is simply an outline of
219 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             the major events in Spanish Anarchist history and does not live up to its
             grandiloquent title. Jean Becarud and Gilles Lapouge’s Anarchistes d Espagne
             (Paris, 1970) is even more abbreviated and oﬀers only a glimpse of its subject
             matter. Eduardo Comin Colomer’s two-volume Historia del Anarquismo
             Espanol 1836–1948 (Barcelona 1956) is a typical Francoist historia secreta,
             written from an internal knowledge of the police ﬁles. It contains a wealth of
             anecdotal material but it is often impossible to determine where the serious
             historian ends and the Francoist oﬀicial begins.
               Despite the minor errors that scholars have cited, Gerald Brenan’s The
             Spanish Labyrinth (London, 1943) still remains the ﬁnest and most moving
             account in English of the Spanish Anarchists to date. Brenan was never an
             Anarchist and less than half of his book deals with Anarchism as such yet like
             so many non-Spaniards in Spain, he came to admire the Anarchist movement
             with a warmth that occasionally verges on enthusiasm. Perhaps the weakest
             aspect of his book might be called its “Andalusian” standpoint: the author’s
             view of the movement was shaped by his experiences with rural rather than
             urban Anarchism and he tends to give too much weight to its quasi-religious
             agrarian “millenarianism.” Admittedly this emphasis adds a great deal of color
             to his account but it does not provide a satisfactory explanation of the CNT
             and FAI’s development in the industrial centers of Spain. Franz Borkenau’s
             The Spanish Cockpit (London, 1937), a very thoughtful book in its own right,
             also depicts Anarchi m as a quasi-religious movement one which, despite
             Borkenau’s Socialist convictions, earns his esteem. To counterbalance Brenan
             and Borkenau’s semi-mystical treatment of Spanish Anarchism, the reader
             might care to consult Diego Abad de Santillan’s recent series, Contribution a
             la Historia del Movimiento Obrero Espanol, the ﬁrst volume of which was
             published in Madrid in 1968. The reader should expect a textbook-like survey
             of the workers’ movement, however, which often lacks the color and drama
             that one would expect to ﬁnd after reading Brenan.
               Introductory surveys of the early history of Spanish Anarchism appear in
             many of the larger works cited below. They serve primarily to orient the
             reader toward the speciﬁc period under discussion and do not constitute
             substitutes for a history of the movement. The opening chapters of Cesar M.
             Lorenzo’s Les Anarchistes Espagnols et le Pouvoir (Paris, 1969), Jose Peirats’s
             Los Anarquistas en la Crisis Politica Espanola (Buenos Aires, 1964), and
             Manuel Buenacasa’s El Movimiento Obrero Espanol (Paris, 1966) are the best
             I have found of such summaries. As for surveys of Spanish Anarchism
             included in general histories of the international Anarchist movement or
             histories of Spain (at least those of recent vintage), some of them tend merely
             to repeat Brenan; others adopt a tone that is patronizing, if not bitterly
             caustic.

             2. Early History (Chapters I-I1I).

               The period prior to Fanelli’s arrival in Spain is admirably covered by
             Femanco Garrido Tortosa’s Historia de las Asociaciones Obreras en Europa
             (Madrid, 1870). This two-volume account is perhaps the most valuable
             available source on early Spanish working-ilass movements. Garrido was a
220 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             friend of Reclus and toured Spain with him; his observations are based not
             merely on research into these movements but also on participation in them. In
             English, a splendid survey of early labor agitation appears in Bruce Levine’s
             Economic and Social Mobilization: Spain, 1830–1923 (Ann Arbor,
             unpublished), a sizable paper that correlates the activities of workers’ and
             peasants’ movements with Spanish industrial development and agrarian
             reform.
               A great deal of material now exists on the period during which the First
             International was formed in Spain. Within a single year, two excellent studies
             have appeared: Joseph Termes’s Anarquismo y Sindicalismo en Espana: La
             Primera International (1864–1881) (Barcelona, 1972) and Clara E. Lida’s
             Anarquismo y Revolution en la Espana del XIX (Madrid, 1972). In the
             following year, Lida published an accompanying volume of texts and
             documents under the title, Antecedentes y Desarrolla del Movimiento Obrero
             Espanol (Madrid, 1973), which also throws considerable light on the period
             from 1835 to 1868.
               On the formation and development of Spanish Anarchism, the reader should
             consult Anselmo Lorenzo’s El Proletariado Militante (originally published in
             Barcelona, Vol. I, 1901; Vol. II, 1903); Juan Diaz del Moral’s Historia de las
             Agitaciones Campesinas Andaluzas (originally published in Madrid, 1929);
             Max Nettlau’s Miguel Bakunin, la International y la Alianza en Espana
             (originally published in Buenos Aires, 1925); and Casimiro Marti’s Origenes
             del Anarquismo en Barcelona (Barcelona, 1959). Lorenzo and Diaz del Moral’s
             works are the real classics on the development of early Spanish Anarchism
             and provide major sources of data for later, more scholarly studies. El
             Proletariado Militante is really a memoir by one Of the founders and
             outstanding propagandists of Spanish Anarchism. Diaz del Moral was not
             merely a historian but also an observer of some of the events he describes.
             Nettlau and Casimiro Marti have produced two brief but masterful pieces of
             research.
               Many other workers provided invaluable background material for an
             understanding of this period, notably Nettlau’s Documentos Ineditos sobre la
             International y la Alianza en Espana (Buenos Aires, 1930) and his highly
             informative articles in La Reuista Blanca (September 1, 1928 — May 1,1929),
             published under the title, “Impresiones historicas sobre el desarrollo del
             Socialismo en Espana,” a superb series that has yet to be compiled as a
             volume; Juan Jose Morato’s Historia de la Section Espanola de la
             International, 1868–1874 (Madrid, 1930); James Guillame’s excellent fourvolume L’Internationale, Documents et Souvenirs (Paris, 1905–1910), in my
             view one of the most outstanding of the many histories that are available on
             the First International; Maximiano Garcia Venero’s three-volume Historia de
             las Internationales en Espana (Madrid, 1956–1958) and the same author’s
             Historias de los Mooimientos Sindicalistas Espanoles (1840–1933) (Madrid,
             1961).
               Of the social histories of Spain, Brenan’s The Spanish Labyrinth is certainly
             one of the most outstanding. For a truly exhaustive history, the reader may
             care to consult the ﬁve-volume series Historia Social y Economica de Espana
             y America, edited by Jaime Vicens Vives (Barcelona, 1957–1959) and Vicens
             Vives’s An Economic History of Spain (Princeton, 1969). One of the best
221 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             sources for popular collectivism in Spain is Joaquin Costa’s Colectivismo
             Agrario en Espana (orginally published in Madrid, 1898). Raymond Carr’s
             Spain, 1808–1939 (Oxford, 1966) is an eminently readable and highly
             informative work on political events. Apart from Brenan’s account, I know of
             no book in English that is more deeply sympathetic to—or so ably conveys—
             the libertarian spirit of the Spanish people than Elena de La Souchere’s An
             Explanation of Spain (New York, 1964). Perhaps the most perceptive analysis
             of Spanish society is to be found in Karl Marx’s “Revolutionary Spain,” a
             series of articles published by the New York Daily Tribune between
             September 9 and December 4, 1854. These articles are compiled in Marx and
             Engels’s Revolution in Spain (New York, 1939), a book that is sadly marred
             not only by Stalinist editing but by Engels’s vulgar interpretation of early
             syndicalism in a propaganda diatribe, “The Bakuninists at Work.”
               Perhaps the best work I can recommend on Spanish Federalism is C. A.M.
             Hennessy’s The Federal Rebublic in Spain (Oxford, 1962). Hennessy has also
             compiled a very extensive bibliography on the subject. R. Coloma’s widely
             cited La Revolution Internacionalista Alcoyana de 1873 (Alicante, 1959), a
             work which seems to have acquired the reputation of an authoritative account
             on the Alcoy uprising, seems in my view to be patently biased against the
             Internationalists and their working-class supporters. Accordingly, my account
             has been based on a sifting of the limited literature and the available press
             accounts of the event. Fortunately, Clara Lida, in her Anarquismo y Revolution
             en la Espana del XIX, carefully examines material on the uprising (see pages
             216–22) and has produced a long-needed balanced account.
               Even more problematical is the ﬁgure of Mikhail Bakunin—both the man
             and his social views. At this writing, no worthwhile biography*af Bakunin
             exists in English. E.H. Carr, in his Michael Bakunin (London, 1937), has
             brought painstaking scholarship to the service of what are often scandalously
             trivial goals, including Bakunin’s impecuniosity and sex life. Carr’s account is
             steeped in malice toward his subject. Of the published material available to
             the reader, H.E. Kaminski’s Bakounine-La Vie d’un Revolutionnaire (Paris,
             1938) is the best biography to consult on Bakunin’s activities, but it still
             awaits translation into English. The quotations from Bakunin in the text were
             taken from Gregory Maximoﬀ’s very unsatisfactory mosaic of Bakunin’s
             writings, The Political Philosophy of Bakunin (Glencoe, 1953), a work that has
             been superseded over the past few years by more representative selections,
             notably in Bakunin on Anarchy, edited by Sam Dolgoﬀ (New York, 1972), and
             Michael Bakunin’s Selected Writings, edited by Arthur Lehning (London,
             1973). Dolgoﬀ’s book also contains a very extensive bibliography, including an
             account of the Steklov and Nettlau biographies of Bakunin, available only in
             special collections and archives.

             3. From the International to the CNT (Chapters IV and
             Vll).
               Virtually every account of peasant Anarchism in Spain owes a great debt to
             Diaz del Moral, who,also enjoys the distinction of fostering the “millenarian”
             orientation that characterizes so many English works on the subject. Joaquin
222 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Costa’s Oligarquia y Catiquismo como la Forma Actual de Gobiemo en Espana
             (orginally published in Madrid, 1902) provides indispensable material on the
             cacique system and Vicens Vives’s Historia Social y Economica ... is an
             invaluable source of data and insights on Spainish agrarian problems. In
             Politics, Economics and Men of Modem Spain (1808–1946) (London, 1946),
             the intertwining of agrarian with political interests is discussed with much
             verve by A. Ramos Oliveira, a writer who is not to be denied his strong
             political prejudices and his animosity toward the Anarchists.
               One of the most deﬁnitive studies of Spanish agricultural and rural unrest
             appears in Edward E. Malefakis’s Agrarian Reform and Peasant Revolution in
             Spain (New Haven, 1970). The book also has an excellent bibliography.
             Although Malefakis is not sympathetic to the Anarchists, he clearly delineates
             their options and dilemmas. His later chapters provide a valuable account of
             their duels with the Socialists during the 1930s. For an excellent account of
             the poverty endured by the braceros, see “Agrarian Problems in Spain” by
             E.H.G. Dobby, Geographical Review of the American Geographical Society
             April, 1936). To gain some sense of the atmosphere of pueblo life—its
             parochialism as well as its internal solidarity—the reader should consult
             Michael Kenny’s A Spanish Tapestry (New York, 1961) and J.S. Pitt-Rivers’s
             sensitive study of an Andalusian mountain village, The People of the Sierra
             (Chicago, 1961). E.J. Hobsbawm’s essay on Anarchist “millenarianism” in
             Primitive Rebels (Manchester, 1959) is riddled by Marxian prejudgments on
             the “archaic” nature of Anarchism. Apart from useful information about the
             Casas Viejas uprising, he adds very little to what Diaz del Moral observes with
             greater sympathy for his subject.
               Very little has been written about the trajectory of Spanish Anarchism from
             the decline of the International to the emergence of the Solidaridad Obrera
             federation after the turn of the century. To establish a reasonably detailed
             continuity of events, it was necessary to turn to biographies and newpaper
             accounts for inportant data. Nettlau’s “Impresiones historicas sobre el
             desarrollo del Socialismo en Espana” in La Revista Blanca (Numero 140,
             1929) is informative, as is Pedro Vallina’s biography of Salvochea, Cronica de
             un Revolucionario (Paris, 1958). The reader may also care to consult the
             opening chapters of Buenacasa’s El Movimiento Obrero Espanol and the
             larger histories of Spanish Anarchism. Clara E. Lida’s book of documents
             contains valuable statements, appeals, and reports up to the late 1880s. On
             Salvochea’s life, the reader should examine not only Vallina, but also Rudolph
             Rocker’s Fermin Salvochea in the Precursores de la Libertad series (No.
             1,1945) and the few pages of vignettes of Salvochea which Buenacasa
             includes in his El Movimiento Obrero Espanol.
               Recent research has reopened the Mano Negra period for reevaluation and
             fresh discussion. Iris Zavala’s discovery in the Archivo de Palacio in Madrid of
             a copy of a document purported to be the Mano Negra’s “regulations,” a
             document drawn up some ﬁve years before the Mano Negra trials of 1883,
             does not entirely dispel my doubts about the reality of the organization. A
             copy is not an original and, given the circumstances of the time, even an
             “original” document would warrant the most scrupulous authentication, in my
             opinion, before any question of police forgery could be removed. Clara E. Lida
             accepts this document as fact and discusses its social context in “Agrarian
223 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Anarchism in Andalusia,” International Review of Social History, XIV, 3 (1969).
             Her review of the period makes the article well worth reading, quite aside
             from the dispute that may arise about the authenticity of the document itself.
             On the trials, Ediciones “CNT” has republished El Proceso de “La Mano
             Negra” (Toulouse, 1958), an old collection of excerpts from statements of the
             accused and critical comments of the charges and proceedings. See also
             Glenn Waggoner’s^rticle, “The Black Hand Mystery,” in Modem European
             Social History, ed. Robert Becucha (London, 1972).
               Lida’s article contains many informative observations on the disputes
             between the traditional Anarcho-collectivists and the emerging Anarchocommunists. Brenan’s The Spanish Labyrinth and Max Nomad’s “The
             Anarchist Tradition” (The Revolutionary Internationals, ed. M.M.
             Drachkovitch [Stanford, 1966]) provide valuable accounts of this split. For a
             succinct statement of Anarcho-communist principles, the reader should go
             directly to Peter Kropotkin’s early essay “Anarchist Communism: Its Basis and
             Principles” (Revolutionary Pamphlets [New York, 1928]) and to his The
             Conquest of Bread (London, 1906). Fortunately, both volumes have recently
             been published in the United States and are no longer diﬀicult to acquire.
               My account of the terrorist movement at the turn of the century is drawn
             from so many sources, including contemporary newspaper accounts, that a
             single work is diﬀicult to cite. The already cited volumes by Brenan, Peirats,
             Buenacasa, and Abad de Santillan collectively provide a good overall picture
             of the incidents, the social context, and the motives of the terrorists. A
             dramatic, at times lurid, but not inaccurate account of Anarchist terrorism
             appears in Barbara W. Tuchman’s The Proud Tower (New York, 1966). F.
             Tarrida del Marmol’s Les Inquisiteurs d’Espagne (Paris, 1897), a work that
             aroused European public opinion against the barbarous methods of the
             Barcelona police, is still the best account of anti-Anarchist repressio’n during
             this period.
               The reawakening of the Spanish labor movement in the decade prior to the
             formation of the CNT is very well documented. Stanley G. Payne’s The
             Spanish Revolution (New York, 1970) contains an excellent bibliography of
             contemporary works on the subject, many of which go beyond the scope of
             this volume. Abad de Santillan’s history covers the period in some detail and
             Brenan’s chapter on the “Catalan Question, 1898–1909” provides a go’od
             political background. The ﬁnest account of the Barcelona labor movement
             during this decade is Joan Connelly Ullman’s The Tragic Week (Cambridge,
             1968), a superbly researched and immensely informative work. The
             conventional attitude toward the “Tragic Week” appears in Augusto Riera’s La
             Semana Tragica (Barcelona, 1909), complete with photographs and
             inventories of gutted churches, monasteries, and seminaries. Diaz del Moral
             provides a detailed account of the agrarian movement in Cordoba between
             1900 and 1909 and Malefakis devotes several highly informative pages to the
             reemergence of rural Anarchist agitation in Andalusia generally during the
             upsurge of 1903–1904.
               An ample literature exists on Francisco Ferrer’s career and death, including
             highly informative material in Joan Connelly Ullman’s book. Ferrer’s La
             Escuela Moderna has been translated into English by Joseph McCabe under
             the title, The Origin and Ideas of the Modem School (London, 1913), a work
224 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             that has apparently undergone many reprints although the translation does
             not have a publishing history. This small volume presents a comprehensive
             statement of Ferrer’s pedagogic ideals and still deserves reading. A. and C.
             Orts-Ramos’s Francisco Ferrer—Apostal de la Razon (Barcelona, 1932) is a
             highly informative personal and intellectual biography. The Spanish
             Anarchists published a fair amount of material on Ferrer of which Hem Day’s
             F. Ferrer—sa vie, son oeuvre (Brussels, n.d.) is still available. English
             accounts’ of Ferrer include Francisco Ferrer: His Life, Work, and Martyrdom,
             edited by Leonard D. Abbott for the Francisco Ferrer Association (New York,
             n.d.), and McCabe’s The Martyrdom of Ferrer (London, 1909), both of which
             appeared shortly after Ferrer’s execution and reﬂect the worldwide impact of
             the Spanish educator.
               To gain an insight into the cultural life fostered by Anarchist intellectuals
             during the closing decades of the last century, the reader must turn to
             periodicals such as La Revista Blanca (old series) and the earlier review, La
             Revista Social. Jose Peirats’s “Para una Monograﬁa de Escritores Anarquistas
             Espanoles” in Ruta (Vol. Ill, No. 7,1972) is a good survey of Spanish Anarchist
             writers, their works, and the periodicals to which they contributed. The
             topical range of these intellectuals can be judged by examining Ricardo
             Mella’s Ideario (Gijon, 1926) and Ensayos y Conferencias (Gijon, 1934), both
             of which constitute Volumes One and Two respectively of the Obras
             Completas de Ricardo Mella.
               The emergence of Anarchosyndicalism is ably discussed by Brenan in his
             chapter on the subject. The impact of Georges Sorel’s Reﬂexions sur la
             Violence (originally published in Paris, 1908, and easily available in English
             translation) has been greatly overrated, but the work should be read as a
             characteristic response of many radical French intellectuals to the new
             workers’ movement. Despite its brevity, Daniel Guerin’s Anarchism (New
             York, 1970) is, in my view, the most trustworthy and perceptive recent survey
             of Anarchist ideas and history. It contains a good account of the pedigree and
             history of Anarchosyndicalism. Guerin’s compilation of Anarchist documents,
             Ni Dieu, Ni Maitre (Paris, n.d.), reproduces early anticipations of syndicalist
             organization such as James Guillaume’s “Idees sur reorganisation Sociale”
             (1876) and the explicitly end-of-the-century syndicalism reﬂected by Fernand
             Pelloutier’s “L’Anarchisme et les Syndicate Ouvriers” and Emile Pouget’s “Le
             Syndicat.” Roger Hagnauer’s L’Actualite de la Charte d‘Amiens (Paris, 1959)
             contains a succinct account of the emergence of the French CGT and its shift
             toward a Marxist-controlled labor union. Errico Malatesta’s criticisms of
             syndicalism appear in the Corrtpte Rendu Analytique of the Congres
             Anarchiste Tenu a Amsterdam, Aout 24–31, 1907 (Paris, 1908). The most
             deﬁnitive biography of Malatesta and the ﬁnest selection of his writings in
             English has been prepared by Vernon Richards under the title, Malatesta: His
             Life and Ideas (London, 1965).

             4. From the Early CNT to the Second Republic
             (Chapters VIII-IX)
              The early history and structure of the CNT are discussed in detail in the
225 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             historical works of Brenan, Buenacasa, Abad de Santillan, and Garcia Venero.
             Jose Peirats’s What is the CNT? (London, 1972), the English translation of an
             article in Ruta, gives a description of the organization’s structure and goals as
             well as general background material. A brief but useful account of the events
             leading to the formation of the CNT appears in Peirats’s Los Anarquistas en la
             Crisis Politica Espanola. The greater part of this book deals with the
             confederation’s activities under the Primo dictatorship, the formation and role
             of the FAI, and the conﬂicts within Spanish Anarchosyndicalism during the
             Second Republic. Cesar M. Lorenzo also provides a survey of
             Anarchosyndicalist activities during this period, although the book deals
             mainly with the Civil War.
               The most informative English account of Anarchist activities between the
             World War I period and the Primo dictatorship is Gerald H. Meaker’s The
             Revolutionary Left in Spain, 1914–1923 (Stanford, 1974), a work that deals
             equally with the Socialists at this time and the Communist tendencies that
             emerged from the Russian Revolution. Meaker is not sympathetic to the
             Anarchists, but his study is meticulously researched and highly perceptive.
             Diaz del Moral and Malefakis’s accounts are indispensable to an
             understanding of the rural movement. For a detailed account of the “Bellas
             Artes” congress of the CNT, see the Congreso de Constitution de la
             Confederation National del Trabajo (CNT), Ediciones “CNT” (Toulouse, 1959)
             and for the 1918 Barcelona congress see the Memoria del Congreso celebrado
             en Barcelona los dias 28, 29 y 30 de Junio y 1 de Julio de 1918, Ediciones
             “CNT” (Toulouse, 1957).
               Detailed accounts of the strike movement during this period appear in
             Alberto Bacells’s El Sindicalismo en Barcelona (1916–1923) (Barcelona,
             1965)-, Jacinto Martin Maestre’s Huelga General de 1917 (Madrid, 1966),
             Garcia Venero’s Historia Movimientos Sindicalistas Espanoles (1840–1933),
             Angel Pestana’s Lo que Aprendi en la Vida (Madrid, 1933), and Francisco
             Largo Caballero’s Mis Reciierdos (Mexico, 1954). Most of the overall accounts
             of Spanish radicalism, such as Brenan’s and Abad de Santillan’s, contain
             valuable accounts of their own.
               Bacells also provides a comprehensive survey of the pistolerismo tendency
             that plagued the postwar years. Buenacasa’s account provides an example of
             the reaction of a distinguished Anarchist militant to the damage pistolerismo
             inﬂicted on the CNT. The reader who is interested in this phase of Spanish
             Anarchosyndicalism may care to consult Maria Farre Morego’s Los Atentados
             Sociales en Espana (Madrid, 1922) and Miguel Sastre y Sama’s La Esclavitud
             Modema (Barcelona, 1921). The foregoing works represent only a fraction of
             the very considerable contemporary literature on the period, most notably on
             the strikes and the pistoleros.
               Brenan, Raymond Carr, Buenacasa, Abad de Santillan, and Peirats’s
             historical works provide highly informative accounts of the period leading into
             and including the Primo dictatorship. A laudatory compilation of material on
             Salvador Segui by a variety of libertarian writers has been prepared by
             Ediciones “Solidaridad Obrera” under the title Salvador Segui: su vida, su
             obra (Paris, 1960). Meaker also discusses Segui’s policies in detail. An
             excellent account of the conﬂict between various tendencies within the CNT
             during this period appears in George Breitman’s Spanish Anarcho226 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM
The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Syndicalism, 1918–1931: Moderates vs. Extremists (University of Michigan,
             unpublished paper, 1969). Ricardo Sanz provides a personal account of the
             Solidarios and Nosotros aﬀinity groups in El Sindicalismo y La Politico
             (Toulouse, 1966), an account that is ﬁlled out by personal interviews with
             Anarchist grupi’s tas and militants in Abel Paz’s Durruti: Le Peuple en Armes
             (Paris, 1972). The Paz biography, perhaps the most informative account of
             Durruti’s life available, has been translated into English by Nancy MacDonald
             and is scheduled for publication by Black Rose Books in Montreal in 1977.
               Meaker’s book and Peirats’s Los Anarquistas . .. contain valuable accounts
             of the fortunes of Spanish Anarchism as the CNT slipped into illegality under
             the Primo dictatorship. Angel Pestana’s report oi his visit to Russia has been
             published in recent years as two pamphlets by Editorial ZYX under the titles,
             Informe de mi Estanda en la U.R.S.S. (Madrid, 1968) and Considerations y
             Juitios Acerca de la Tercera International (Madrid, 1968). Breitman chronicles
             the disputes that emerged in the CNT during the dictatorship and up to the
             expulsion of the Treintistas with a great deal of understanding and
             perception. One of the most detailed accounts of these conﬂicts appears in
             John Brademas’s Anarcosindicalismo y Revolution en Espana (1930–1937)
             (Barcelona, 1974), a modiﬁed version of Brademas’s highly informative
             doctoral dissertation, “Revolution and Social Revolution: A Contribution to the
             History of the Anarcho-Syndicalist Movement in Spain, 1930–1937” (Oxford
             University, unpublished, 1956). The record of the special CNT congress in
             1931, Memorias de Congreso Extraordinario de la C.N.T. celebrado en Madrid
             los Dias 11 al 16 de ]unio de 1931 (Barcelona, 1931), contains a remarkable
             account of the vicissitudes of the confederation during the closing years of the
             dictatorship.
               Peirats in Los Anarquistas ... has an amusing account of the founding
             meeting of the FAI in Valencia but the most detailed narrative appears in
             Brademas’s book as a lengthy memorandum written for the author by Miguel
             Jimenez, who presided at the conference. I also received colorful details of the
             preparation and course of this meeting from Gaston Leval and Jose Peirats,
             but limitations of space did not make it possible for me to include them in this
             volume. The best discussion I have encountered of the structure of the FAI
             appears in Ildefonso Gonzalez’s II Movimiento Libertario Spagnuolo (Naples,
             n.d.), selections of which were generously translated for my use from the
             Italian into English by Sam Dolgoﬀ. Unfortunately, this very important survey
             does not as yet appear in any other language.

             5. The Road to Revolution

               Brenan’s discussion of the period from 1931 to 1936 is still the ﬁnest
             general account of the Second Republic. Gabriel Jackson’s The Spanish
             Republic and the Civil War, 1931–1939 (Princeton, 1965) is very useful and
             provides many details that are not ordinarily available in general histories,
             although I share Noam Chomsky’s criticisms of the book in his The Cold War
             and the New Mandarins. Hugh Thomas’s The Spanish Civil War (New York,
             1961)—a book that, for some curious reason, has acquired the reputation of
             being a “deﬁnitive” history of the conﬂict—is pretentious, superﬁcial, and
227 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             factually unreliable. For a devastating critique of Thomas’s oeuvre, the reader
             should consult Vernon Richards’s “July 19, 1936: Republic or Revolution?” in
             Anarchy, No. 5 (Juty/1961), and Richards’s introductory remarks to Gaston
             Leval’s Collectives in the Spanish Revolution (London, 1975).
               The best account of Spanish Anarchism from 1931 to 1936 is Brademas’s
             already cited dissertation and its modiﬁed translation in book form into
             Spanish. The opening chapters (I to IX) of Peirats’s La C.N.T. en la Revolution
             Espanola, Vol. I (Buenos Aires, 1955), are indispensable for a knowledge of
             Anarchist activities during the period. The volume consists in large part, of
             documents that are important in clarifying the vicissitudes of Anarchist policy.
             The reader will also obtain a good survey of the events leading up to the Civil
             War and an excellent account of the opening days of the conﬂict from Pierre
             Broue and Emile Temime’s The Revolution and the Civil War in Spain
             (Cambridge, 1970), a translation from the French of one of the better general
             accounts of the Spanish Civil War. Certainly this volume should be read in
             preference to Thomas’s volume. Malefakis’s study of agrarian unrest in the
             early 1930s is immensely informative, although it is deﬁnitely unsympathetic
             to the Anarchists and, in its conclusion, to the Liberals. One encounters an
             even more marked rightist bias in Stanley Payne’s The Spanish Revolution
             (New York, 1970), but the book is so well-researched and so highly
             informative that it makes for good reading. Salvador de Madariaga’s Spain
             (New York, 1958) presents a liberal interpretation of the period and of the
             conﬂicts between the UGT and CNT.
               Buenacasa’s La C.N.T., los Treinta y la F.A.I. (Barcelona, 1933) presents the
             outlook of the FAI in the dispute with the CNT moderates by a leader who is
             by no means a spokesman for its most extreme wing. Pestana’s memoir, Lo
             que Aprendi ... should also be consulted to gain the views of one of the ablest
             CNT leaders. Peirats’s historical works provide good accounts of the ciclo de
             las insurrecdones and Manuel Villar’s El Anarquismo y la Insurrection de
             Asturias (Buenos Aires, 1936) presents the Anarchist version of the Asturian
             uprising. Although most of Gaston Leval’s Collectives in the Spanish
             Revolution deals with the Civil War period, Part One of the book provides a
             ﬁrst-rate libertarian analysis of the agrarian situation prior to the revolution.
               The record of the Saragossa congress of May 1936 has been republished by
             Ediciones “CNT” as part of its series Prolegomenos de la Revolution de ]ulio
             en Espana under the title, El Congreso Confederal de Zaragoza (n.p., 1955).
             The reader should also consult Isaac Puente’s El Comunismo Libertario
             (republished at Toulouse, 1947), a work which formed the basic theoretical
             document for the congress’s discussion of the future society. My choice of
             Diego Abad de Santillan’s El Organismo Eamomico de la Revolution
             (Barcelona, 1936), translated into English under the title, After the Revolution
             (New York, 1937), as the most useful of the two works was guided by the need
             for a more discursive treatment. Puente’s pamphlet, despite its inﬂuence, is
             scarcely more than a brief outline; Santillan’s book is a reﬂective theoretical
             work as well as an informative guide to social reconstruction.
               Accounts of opening days of the revolution are very numerous. I have
             already singled out Broue and Temime’s survey of the uprising in the major
             cities of Spain. One of the most detailed accounts of the day-by-day conﬂict in
             Madrid and Barcelona appears in Abel Paz’s Paradigma de una Revolution
228 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             (n.p., n.d.), published by Ediciones “ATT,” the concluding portion of which
             contains appeals in Solidaridad Obrera from July 19 to July 23, 1936. Portions
             of S. Canovas Cervantes’s Durruti y Ascaso: La C.N.T. y la Revolution de fulio,
             published by Ediciones “Paginas Libres” (Toulouse, n.d.), deal with the
             uprising ij^ Barcelona. An assessment of the events leading to the revolution
             and actual outbreak of the Civil War by one of the most inﬂuential Anarchist
             “statesmen” of the period will be found in Diego Abad de Santillan’s Por que
             Perdimos la Guerra (Buenos Aires, 1940), the opening chapters of which
             provide an account of the development of the Spanish Anarchist movement
             from the First to the Second Republic and the outbreak of the July uprising.
             For a sharp criticism by an English Anarchist of the FAI and CNT’s
             performance on the eve of the uprising as well as the Civil War, see Vernon
             Richard’s The Lessons of the Spanish Revolution (London, 1953).
             Note on Sources
               The greater part of this volume was completed in 1970 and I did not have
             the beneﬁt of any volumes cited above that were published after 1969.
             Accordingly, I could not use the later volumes of Abad de Santillan’s
             Contribution a la Historia de Movimiento Obrero Espanol, Josef Termes’s
             Anarquismo y Sindicalismo en Espana, Clara E. Lida’s Anarquismo y
             Revolution en la Espana del XIX and her accompanying volume of documents,
             Dolgoﬀ and Lehning’s compilations of Bakunin’s writings, Edward Malefakis’s
             Agrarian Reform and Peasant Revolution in Spain, Gerald Meaker’s The
             Revolutionary Left in Spain, Abel Paz’s Durruti: Le Peuple en Armes, and the
             Spanish version of John Brademas’s dissertation except insofar as they
             contained material that applied to the concluding chapter, “The Road to
             Revolution.”
               Wherever possible, however, these volumes were used to correct errors and,
             to a limited extent, expand accounts of events for which there was little
             available data.
               Nearly all the remaining works cited in this “Bibliographical Essay” entered
             into the preparation of this volume. The discussion on the early history of the
             International in Spain relies heavily on Anselmo Lorenzo’s memoirs, Nettlau’s
             accounts of the early Spanish Anarchists, Marti, Garcia Venero, and Diaz del
             Moral. Buenacasa, Joan Connelly Ullman, Peirats, Bacells, and the various
             biographies, memoirs, and documents mentioned in the bibliographical essay
             should be singled out as major sources of the later events described in this
             book. I consulted many conventional periodicals of the day, including
             contemporary newspapers in Spanish, English, and French, which cast light
             on fairly obscure periods in the history of the Spanish Anarchist movement. I
             also had the beneﬁt of individual issues of La Revista Blanca, Solidaridad
             Obrera, and Tierra y Libertad in American libraries and private collections.
              [1] For an explanation of the diﬀerent forms of Anarchism, see pages 17–31 below.
              [2] Engels, it is worth noting, clearly showed an understanding of the Anarchosyndicalist nature
             of the Spanish section in his article “Bakuninists at Work.” Surprisingly, this fact has yet to be
             adequately reﬂected in many current works on the Spanish Anarchist movement.
               [3] Perhaps the greatest single failing of Bakunin is his inconsistency in translating his avowed
             organizational precepts into practice. For a discussion of this problem, see pp. 46–50 below.

             we shall see, Spanish Anarchism tried to sift the more positive features of the pueblo from its
             reactionary social characteristics and rear its concept of the future on the mutualism of village
             life.
                [5] In later years, the Anarchists were to adopt the black ﬂag as a symbol of the workers’ misery
             and as an expression of their anger and bitterness. The presence of black ﬂags together with red
             ones became a feature of Anarchist demonstrations throughout Europe and the Americas. With
             the establishment of the CNT, a single ﬂag on which black and red were separated diagonally,
             was adopted and used mainly in Spain.
                [6] The ﬁrst and last of the words in this passage—compañeros and salud— have been
             translated here as “comrades” and “greetings.” They became the typical forms of address
             between Spanish Anarchists in personal encounters and at public meetings. compañero has a
             more endearing and familiar meaning than the formal word camarada, which was to be used by
             the Spanish Socialists and Communists. compañero connotes a “mate,” a “companion”—one who
             shares not only common ideas but also a personal relationship. Salud could be translated as “your
             health,” “your welfare.” It was adopted to replace the usual farewell address, adios (literally: “to
             god”), a reference to the deity that the Anarchists regarded as an invasion by superstition of
             ordinary discourse. In lateryears, a gathering of the Spanish Anarchists was to be called una
             asemblea de las tribus—“a gathering of the tribes”—a phrase that anticipates the sense of
             comntunity sought by the youth culture in our own time. The Spanish Anarchists tended to use
             more personal, sentimental, and cognatic expressions than those employed by their stolid
             Marxian opponents.
                [7] This point should be emphasized. Nearly everyone who comments on the moral emphasis of
             the Spanish Anarchists treats it as a form of quasireligious ascetism. Perhaps this was the case
             among the rural Anarchists, particularly those who lived in pueblos, but my own feeling (after
             discussing the issue with exiled Spanish Anarchists from the industrial cities) is that in the north
             at least, this moral emphasis was similar to the eﬀorts of black radicals in the United States to
             elevate their people from the inﬂuence of a degrading and enslaving culture.
                [8] Only after Pi was removed from power did he try to establish a working relationship with the
             Intransigents, but by this time it was too late. With the collapse of the federal republic and the
             restoration of the Bourbons, Pi was largely ignored by his erstwhile followers and essentially
             became a theorist and a Proudhonian ideologue.
                [9] It was Pi who ordered Velarde to march on Alcoy after the Internationalist uprising. On the
             other hand, the repression would have been very severe had he not been the president of the
             republic. In later years, when Anarchist terrorists were to turn public opinion against the
             libertarian movement, he courageously spoke up on its behalf. As Hennessy points out, Pi was
             admired by the Anarchists not only because of his moral probity. Pi died in 1901. Generalizing
             from his life, an obituary in the Anarchist journal La Reoista Blanca emphasized that “integrity in
             a corrupting society has a value which only those can appreciate who have wanted and succeeded
             in maintaining their public and private life untarnished.”—a characteristic conclusion for a
             movement that insisted on a complete unity between the two.
                [10] These libertarian ideas and ways of life, as we shall see, stood in ﬂat opposition to the
             capitalist relationships that were penetrating the countryside, especially after the communal
             lands were seized and put up for sale. The challenge of capitalism to the values of the pueblo
             constitutes perhaps the most important single source of agrarian unrest in Spain after the 1850s.
                [11] The Seville congress was also the scene of an open dispute between the Bakuninist
             “Anarchist Collectivists” and the followers of Kropotkin’s “Anarchist Communism.” The Anarchist
             Communist position was defended by Miguel Rubio of Seville, the collectivist by Jose Llunas of
             Barcelona.
                [12] The party was actually founded secretly in May 1879 under the name of Partido
             Democratico Socialista Obrero; in 1881 it was refounded, with nine hundred members, under the
             name of Partido Socialista Obrero the “Socialist Workers Party,” a name it has retained to the
             present day. I have followed the rather common custom of designating it simply as the “Socialist
             Party.” The supporters of the party early in the 1880s were almost entirely limited to the printers
             and typographers of Madrid. Pablo Iglesias was elected its secretary, a position he was to hold for
             decades. It grew very slowly, acquiring its ﬁrst weekly, El Socialista, ﬁve years later.
                [13] The usual ﬁgure given is four thousand (a ﬁgure that is often confused with the number
             who entered the city), but it is doubtful if anything near that number were around. Having
             decided not to participate in the march, many of them probably went back to their homes.
                [14] “El Madrileno” disappeared completely after the workers marched into Jerez and was not to
             be found again. Pedro Vallina, an outstanding Spanish Anarchist who was on good terms with
             some of the participants in the Jerez uprising, regarded the young man as a provocateur. He also
230 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             adds the name of Fernando Poulet, a Frenchman who appeared in Paris among the exiled
             Anarchists. Poulet, in Vallina’s opinion, was a spy in the pay of the Spanish embassy.
               [15] As mayor, Salvochea had abolished the consumos (the onerous excise taxes levied on
             foodstuﬀs) and, to recoup the lost revenues, placed the tax burden on the shopkeepers. This act
             thoroughly alienated the lower middle classes, with the result that he was defeated in his second
             bid for mayoralty and the attempt to bring Cadiz into the Cantonalist insurrectionary movement
             failed even before Pavia’s troops arrived at the city.
               [16] Years earlier, Ferrer had broken oﬀ with his wife, Teresa Sanmarti, a woman of fairly
             orthodox views. In a rage she had tried to kill him and he took up relations with Leopoldina
             Bonald, a young woman who shared his radical ideas. Later Bonald and Ferrer parted on
             amicable terms, and he went to live with Soledad Villafranca, a teacher in his school who held
             Anarchist views. The Spanish church and the reactionary politicians of the day exploited to the
             hilt Ferrer’s openness and freedom in his relations with women. In oﬀicial Spanish society, it was
             perfectly acceptable to frequent, brothels, support concubines, and carry on liaisons with the
             wives of other men—provided that all the public amenities of marriage were respected and love
             aﬀairs kept discreet.
               [17] Toward the end of his life, Engels was to succumb with astonishing naivete to the political
             and parlimentary opportunities facing the Marxian parties of the late nineteenth century. In 1891,
             shortly before,his death, the old barricade ﬁghter of the 1840s was to write: “One can conceive
             that the old society can grow peacefully into the new in countries where popular representation
             concentrates all power in itself, where one can do constitutionally what one will as soon as one
             has the majority of the people behind one; in democratic republics like France and America, and
             in monarchies like England... The German Social Democrats were to use observations of this kind
             with great eﬀect in order to block Socialist supporters of the general strike in the Second
             (Socialist) International.
               [18] Although Malatesta was to change his attitude toward syndicalism, he accepted the
             movement with many reservations and never ceased to emphasize that “trade unions are, by their
             very nature, reformist and never revolutionary.” To this warning he added that the “revolutionary
             spirit must be introduced, developed and maintained by the constant actions of revolutionaries
             who work from within their ranks as well as from outside, but it cannot be the normal, natural
             deﬁnition of the Trade Union’s function.”
               [19] Henceforth, I will use the word “Anarchist” to describe Anarchosyndicalists and Anarchist
             Communists unless the diﬀerence between the two schools of Anarchism are relevant to the
             discussion. This is necessary because the two schools were soon to interpenetrate and for a time
             become indistinguishable.
               [20] This story has been told in some detail because it is an example of those wild inaccuracies
             that appear in many accounts of the Spanish Anarchists and the Civil War. In his brief account of
             the “Tragic Week,” Gerald Brenan writes that “Monks were killed, tombs were desecrated and
             strange and macabre scenes took place, as when workmen danced in the street with disinterred
             mummies of nuns.” This lurid account may be excused by the fact that it was written nearly three
             decades ago in London, at a time when Brenan lacked adequate research material.
             Hugh Thomas, on the other hand, writing in 1961, has less justiﬁcation for repeating this account
             in his book on the Civil War. The story is not only repeated almost directly from Brenan but Mr.
             Thomas adds some sensational adjectives of his own. One now learns that “Drunken workers
             danced maniacally in the streets with the disinterred bodies of nuns.”
               [21] The reader should be alerted to the fact that the Spanish workers’ movement was very
             oﬀicious, abounding in high-sounding titles for oﬀicers and “commissions.” Even to this day, the
             meetings of exiles’ union and radical organizations are formal, at least among the older people.
             The Spanish workers, like all pariahs in a highly stratiﬁed society, took the prestige of their
             organizations and the conduct of their business very seriously. To underscore this, alas, they
             could think of nothing better than to copy the ruling classes.
               [22] Alberto Balcells gives a succinct description of how the new sindicaios were structured:
             “Each trade would form a section of the Sindicator and name a junta de Section of two or three
             members and a permanent commission of seven aﬀiliates, changeable every six months, which in
             addition to directing the section, named the representatives of the section to the Junta del
             Sindicato. All of the sections would be represented equally on the Junta del Sindicato. Only the
             president of the Sindicato would be elected by the.general assembly. The Sindicato would be
             represented in the Local Federation and these in the Regional Confederation.”
               [23] It was at this time that the National Committee of the CNT expelled the venerable
             Andalusian Anarchist Sanchez Rosa, who had been engaged in a bitter ﬁght with the Regional
             Committee of the Andalusian Confederation. The expulsion created such acrimonious feelings
             between Anarchists and syndicalists that it nearly split the entire labor organization. The
231 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
             Anarchists now excoriated the sindicatos unicos and syndicalism generally, demanding a return to
             the old trade sections and a more libertarian type of organization. Although a peace of sorts was
             established between the two wings, the wounds never fully healed and were to reopen in later
             years.
               [24] I do not believe this strike—which in retrospect has been regarded as a grave error—could
             have been prevented. That the workers were to lose their victory could only have been seen
             afterwards. Milans del Bosch plainly meant to provoke them and it is doubtful if the greatest
             prudence by the CNT could have avoided an eventual clash on terms unfavorable to the workers.
               [25] The extent to which coercion was used in establishing the Mixed Commission is diﬀicult to
             judge. At any rate, Amado oﬀered an amnesty to the syndicalists of the CNT in rehirn for their
             temporary renunciation of direct action and their participation in the commission.
               [26] Despite continual eﬀorts by CNT moderates to come to terms with the manufacturers, the
             goading of the union reached scandalous proportions. So eager were the employers to initiate
             their planned lockout that they began one prematurely, on November 3. Compelled to allow the
             workers to return, the employers thereupon refused to take back any union activists. This
             provocation ﬁnally forced the CNT to withdraw from the Commissions.
               [27] The Socialists were furious. Quite conveniently for the UGT, a newspaper strike broke out in
             the capital, threatening to blanket all press coverage of the CNT’s congress. The cenetistas,
             however, persuaded the publisher of Madrid’s popular Republican daily, Espana Nueva, to accede
             to the grievances of the typographers and the paper began to appear a few days before the
             opening of the congress. The agreement broke the unity of the publishers, who hastened to end
             the strike on terms favorable to the workers.
               [28] Their delegation included Gaston Leval, who represented the newly created Catalan
             Federation of Anarchist Groups. Apparently Leval had been “integrated” into the delegation as
             camouﬂage, but he later separated from it.
               [29] In the 1914 there were nine atentados against employers in the Barcelona area. In 1916
             there were only eight; the next year, ﬁve; then nine again and in 1919, eight.
               [30] The extent to which the CNT hired professional pistoleros has been greatly
             overemphasized. As a result of lengthy personal interviews with former Spanish Anarchists,
             particularly Gaston Leval, I am quite persuaded that the CNT’s resources at this time were
             woefully limited and that the great majority ofpistoleros were ordinary workmen whose activities
             were mainly defensive. The “hired” pistoleros, while not entirely a myth, have been given undue
             importance by most historians of the period and the “income” they acquired from their “actions”
             has been exaggerated to absurd proportions.
               [31] By “activity” that is not in “contradiction with the purity of the ideas,” Sanz simply means a
             moral integrity consistent with Anarchism, not blind obedience to a political “line.” This moral
             integrity, as has already been pointed out, was a matter of great importance to the Spanish
             Anarchists, who otherwise always accepted complete independence of behavior and ideas.
               [32] One of the most daring of the “Solidarios,” Antonio Martin, handled the transit of arms
             through Puigcerda. In 1937, Martin was shot down by gunmen of the Spanish Communist Party.
               [33] All the more remarkable, it should be added, because it was during this period that the
             Solidarios and other Anarchist action groups staged the series of spectacular bank holdups at
             Tarrasa, Manresa, at the “Fonda de Francia” opposite the civil government building in Barcelona,
             and, most notably, at the Banco de Espana in Gijon.
             It is also worth noting how Arthur Landis, the “chronicler of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade” (as
             one admirer designates him) treats this sequence of events. “In 1923” writes Landis, “the CNT,
             under Anarchist direction dissolved itself,” whereas the Socialist, “UGT did not do this; stayed
             alive, and helped lay the groundwork for the demise of the dictatorship and the overthrow of
             Alfonso XIII.” Such distortions are not uncommon from historians of virtually all political
             connections.
               [34] The word “conditional” is used here to denote the fact that the CNT’s statutes had to be
             approved by the provincial governor. The union’s legality was still somewhat precarious in 1930.
             It is remarkable testimony to the inﬂuence of the CNT over the Barcelona proletariat that the
             government, despite Pestana’s strong stand in his negotiations with Mola, was obliged to legalize
             the union.
               [35] Madariaga greatly exaggerates the ideological aﬀinity of the Anarchosyndicalists for the
             Liberals. As we shall see, the animosity between the Socialists and the Anarchosyndicalists was
             so intense during the closing years of the dictatorship that the CNT workers voted for the
             Liberals out of sheer spitefulness.
               [36] Throughout the latter part of 1931, almost endemic violence engulfed the Barcelona port
             area for example, where the UGT tried to undermine the traditional hold of the CNT on the dock
             workers.
232 of 234 10/11/25, 1:14 PM The Spanish Anarchists https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-...
               [37] The long lapse between national congresses of the CNT should not be seen as evidence that
             the union was lacking in democracy. On the contrary, between national congresses the
             formulation of policy and initiative in action fell back to Regional, District, and even Local
             Federations. The need for coordinating or establishing policy on a national scale was usually
             eﬀected through plenums of delegates from Regional Federations, but the regions and districts
             usually did what they wanted anyway, even plunging into near-insurrections without gaining
             consent from national bodies.
               [38] The program of the Syndicalist Party is worth noting. The party called for a Socialist society
             based on economic self-management and federalism, the collectivization of land into free rural
             communes, and the coordination of industrial and commercial activities by the unions. The
             Cortes, in Pestana’s vision, would be replaced by a “National Chamber of Labor” in which the
             unions and rural communes would be fully represented. Pestana, although advocating a highly
             ﬂexible strategy which included electoral politics as well as direct action, did not renounce his
             Anarchist beliefs. He regarded Anarchism as a moral philosophy which played a key role in
             educating and improving people until such time as they could establish a fully libertarian society.
               [39] In all fairness to other members of Nosotros I have found no evidence that Durruti or the
             Ascaso brothers supported Garcia Oliver’s authoritarian views. If they did, it would have been
             more out of personal loyalty (a very important factor within FAI aﬀinity groups) than a matter of
             considered political conviction or programatic agreement. “Los Tres Mosqueteros,” as Garcia
             Oliver, Durruti, and Francisco Ascaso were called, were by no means the same personalities.
             Brenan, in an excellent discussion of the matter, draws important distinctions between Durruti
             and Francisco Ascaso on the one hand and Garcia Oliver on the other, which I have conﬁrmed
             through personal contact with Spanish Anarchists who knew all of them:
             Durruti was a powerful man with brown eyes and an innocent expression and Ascaso a little dark
             man of insigniﬁcant appearance. Inseparable friends, they had together robbed banks,
             assassinated enemies of the cause and been in the forefront of innumerable strikes and acts of
             violence. Most of their lives had been spent in prison: as soon as they came out they returned to
             their humble work in the factory, for, naturally, none of the money they acquired by their forcible
             expropriations (on one occasion-they opened and emptied a safe in the Bank of Spain) was kept
             for themselves.... Garcia Oliver, on the other hand, belonged rather to the type of Irish
             revolutionary of 1919. Though a workman by origin and only partly educated, his political
             instincts were well developed. He was credited with a special ﬂair for the revolutionary feeling of
             the masses and for the right moment for action. He thus became the leading tactician of this
             period and the organizer of its various revolutionary strikes and insurrections. Only, being an
             Anarchist, he did not remain like a general in the background, but led his men with bomb and
             revolver in his hand himself.
             The simplicity of Durruti and Ascaso should be contrasted with the “political instincts” and “ﬂair”
             of Garcia Oliver. These diﬀerent traits guided Durruti and Garcia Oliver in two contrasting
             directions: Durruti became the head of a militia-column and was killed in Madrid; Garcia Oliver
             became—a minister of justice in the Popular Front government.
               [40] Brenan’s account, although scanty, seems to be accurate enough with respect to the
             opening phase of the event. Peirats’ account is more detailed on its closing phase. Among the
             more grotesque features of the story, mentioned by neither Brenan nor Peirats, is that the
             partially burnt corpses were left on display as warnings to the villagers. According to press
             accounts of the event, the Guards were reported to have rounded up innocent villagers at Casas
             Viejas and forced them into the pyre that consumed Seisdedos and his party.
               [41] (Missing footnote)
               [42] (Missing footnote)
               [43] To a great extent, the October events in Asturias are still little known to us. Gabriel Jackson
             quite rightly observes that, in addition to the political biases aroused by the events themselves,
             the Spanish press was censored until early 1936 and the electoral campaign of February in that
             year completely subserved the facts to party interest. “Since the Civil War, only the victors’
             version has been documented in Spain. Needless to say, the thousands of knowledgeable leftists
             who ﬂed Spain at the close of the Civil War did not carry documents in their baggage.” After
             sifting many accounts of the Asturian revolt, I have settled on three: Brademas’s brief but
             excellent summary, Jackson’s apparently on-site study (an account which suﬀers from an
             inadequate discussion of the Anarchosyndicalists’ role, particularly in Gijon and La Felguera), and
             Peirats’s splendid account. In my personal contact with Peirats I have been struck by his
             independence of mind and guileless candor—qualities which have greatly enhanced his credibility
             in my eyes—and I have drawn much of my material from his Los anarquistas en la crisis politica
             espanola.

             deprecate the role of the Mieres miners to emphasize that the Communists staked out a claim to
             nearly all the dramatic initiatives in the Asturian insurrection, although the union locals they
             actually controlled probably commanded little more than 3,000 members. Indeed, on the basis of
             my own researches and personal recollection of this period, I can say that the Communists in
             America as well as in Spain described the entire insurrection as Communist-led and depicted its
             goal as the establishment of a “soviet republic.” As the reader will see, none of these claims even
             remotely corresponded to the facts.
                [45] I say “given” because these seats did not reﬂect the popular vote received by the parties
             but the number of seats they were allocated by agreement between the Popular Front coalition. I
             share Brenan’s view that the Republicans and Communists were probably given more seats by
             the coalition than they would have acquired had each party run independently. I would also
             accept his view that the Communists may well have received four times as many seats as they
             would have gained on their own; in addition to the 16 mentioned above, they received ﬁve from
             Catalan Socialists, who were now virtually under Communist control due largely to Stalinist
             inﬁltration tactics and the manipulations of Juan Comorera, one of the most sinister politicians of
             the left. Comorera was to engineer the Stalinist counterrevolution in Catalonia during the Civil
             War and eventually ﬁnd a welcome home in Franco Spain.
                [46] It is interesting to note that Payne makes no mention of this assassination attempt when he
             accuses the Popular Front government of showing bias in suppressing the Falange shortly
             afterward. One would think from Payne’s account that the government was merely making
             “symbolic concessions” to the left, when in fact the Falange behaved with conscious provocation
             in its terrorist acts. Brenan not unfairly points out that in 1936 the Falange may have exceeded
             the much-maligned Anarchists in the number of atentados it attempted.
                [47] It need hardly be pointed out at any great length, that the workers’ “labor power” was
             marked by their capacity not only to meet their survival needs, but to produce “surplus labor”
             over and beyond what was needed for the maintenance and reproduction of the working class.
             Hence “labor power” was also a unique commodity: it could be deployed not only to sustain the
             worker and his or her family (hence wages were seen as a “fair exchange” in the labor market at
             this level alone), but also to provide the capitalist with an increment, i.e., “surplus value” or
             “proﬁt.” A “fair exchange,” however, presupposed that “labor power” would be conceived of as a
             commodity—a product, as it were, to be traded on the market like a tangible commodity— not as
             the onerous duty of a slave or serf on behalf of a coercive master. Marx regarded this concept of
             “labor power” as one of his most vital contributions to politcal economy, and, one may add, as a
             cornerstone of “scientiﬁc socialism.”
                [48] The last two lines of this passage were momentous. These lines and others like them in
             Marx’s writings were to provide the rationale for asserting the authority of Marxist parties and
             their armed detachments over and even against the proletariat. Claiming a deeper and more
             informed comprehension of a situation than “even the whole of the proletariat at the given
             moment,” Marxist parties went on to dissolve such revolutionary forms of proletarian
             organization as factory committees and ultimately to totally regiment the proletariat according to
             lines established by the party leadership.
                [49] Toward the end of his life, Marx in fact tended to accept the possibility that the European
             Socialist revolution would be initiated by industrially backward Russia rather than France or
             Germany. In his correspondence of 1881 with Vera Zasulitch, he entertains the possibility that a
             timely revolution in Russia would make it possible for the collectivistic peasant village or mir to
             bypass the capitalist development of the West and “gradually slough oﬀ its primitive
             characteristics and develop as the direct basis of collective production on a national scale.” For
             an interesting discussion of this correspondence, see Martin Buber’s Paths in Utopia (Boston:
             Beacon Press, pp. 90–94).
