## The history of union busting in the United States dates
## back to the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. The
                Industrial Revolution produced a rapid expansion in factories
## and manufacturing capabilities. As workers moved from farms
## to factories, mines and other hard labor, they faced harsh
## working conditions such as long hours, low pay and health
## risks. Children and women worked in factories and generally
                received lower pay than men. The government did little to limit
                these conditions. Labor movements in the industrialized world
                developed and lobbied for better rights and safer conditions.
## Shaped by wars, depressions, government policies, judicial
## rulings, and global competition, the early years of the

## battleground between unions and management were
## adversarial and often identified with aggressive hostility.
## Contemporary opposition to trade unions known as union
## busting started in the 1940s, and continues to present
## challenges to the labor movement. Union busting is a term
                used by labor organizations and trade unions to describe the
                activities that may be undertaken by employers, their proxies,
## workers and in certain instances states and governments
## usually triggered by events such as picketing, card check,
                worker organizing, and strike actions.[1] Labor legislation has
                changed the nature of union busting, as well as the organizing
## tactics that labor organizations commonly use.

                [3]
                Creative methods of union busting have been around for a long
                time. In 1907, Morris Friedman reported that a Pinkerton agent
                who had infiltrated the Western Federation of Miners managed
                to gain control of a strike relief fund, and attempted to exhaust
                that union's treasury by awarding lavish benefits to strikers.[4]
## However, many attacks against unions have used force of one
                sort or another, including police action, military force, or
## recruiting goon squads.

## Physical attacks against unions

                [edit]
                Unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) were
                devastated by the Palmer Raids, carried out as part of the First
## Red Scare. The Everett Massacre (also known as Bloody
                Sunday) was an armed confrontation between local authorities
## and IWW members which took place in Everett, Washington on
## Sunday, November 5, 1916. Later, communist-led unions were
## isolated or destroyed and their activists purged with the
                assistance of other union organizations during the Second Red
## Scare.

## Artist's depiction of the Haymarket Square riot

## In May 1886 the Knights of Labor were demonstrating in the
## Haymarket Square in Chicago, demanding an eight-hour day in
## all trades. When police arrived, an unknown person threw a
                bomb into the crowd, killing one person and injuring several
                others. "In a trial marked by prejudice and hysteria" a court
## sentenced seven anarchists, six of them German-speaking, to
                death - with no evidence linking them to the bomb.[5]

## Strikes also took place that same month (May 1886) in other
                cities, including in Milwaukee, where seven people died when
## Wisconsin Governor Jeremiah M. Rusk ordered state-militia
## troops to fire upon thousands of striking workers who had
                marched to the Milwaukee Iron Works Rolling Mill in Bay View,
## on Milwaukee's south side.

## In 1914 one of the most bitter labor conflicts in American
                history took place at a mining colony in Colorado called Ludlow.
## After workers went on strike in September 1913 with
## grievances ranging from requests for an eight-hour day to
## allegations of subjugation, Colorado governor Elias Ammons
## called in the National Guard in October 1913. That winter,
                Guardsmen made 172 arrests.[a][6]
                The strikers began to fight back, killing four mine guards and
                firing into a separate camp where strikebreakers lived. When
## the body of a strikebreaker was found nearby, the National
## Guard's General Chase ordered the tent colony destroyed in
                retaliation.[6]

## "On Monday morning, April 20, two dynamite bombs were
                exploded, in the hills above Ludlow ... a signal for operations to

## begin. At 9 am a machine gun began firing into the tents
                [where strikers were living], and then others joined."[6] One
                eyewitness reported: "The soldiers and mine guards tried to kill
                everybody; anything they saw move".[6] That night the
## National Guard rode down from the hills surrounding Ludlow
## and set fire to the tents. Twenty-six people, including two
                women and eleven children, were killed.[7]

## Union busting with police and military force

                [edit]

## For approximately 150 years, union organizing efforts and
## strikes have been periodically opposed by police, security
                forces, National Guard units, special police forces such as the
## Coal and Iron Police, and/or use of the United States Army.
                Significant incidents have included the Haymarket Riot and the
## Ludlow massacre. The Homestead struggle of 1892, the
                Pullman walkout of 1894, and the Colorado Labor Wars of 1903
                are examples of unions destroyed or significantly damaged by
                the deployment of military force. In all three examples, a strike
## became the triggering event.

             - Pinkertons and militia at Homestead, 1892 – One of the
## first union busting agencies was the Pinkerton National
                Detective Agency, which came to public attention as the result
## of a shooting war that broke out between strikers and three
## hundred Pinkerton agents during the Homestead Strike of
                1892. When the Pinkerton agents were withdrawn, state militia
## forces were deployed. The militia repulsed attacks on the
## Carnegie Steel plant, and prevented violence against

                strikebreakers crossing picket lines, causing a decisive defeat
## of the strike, and ended the power of the Amalgamated
                Association of Iron and Steel Workers at the Homestead plant.

             - Federal troops end the railroad blockades by the
## American Railway Union, 1894 – During the Pullman Strike,
## the American Railway Union (ARU), out of union solidarity,
                called out its members according to the principle of industrial
                unionism. Their actions in blocking the movement of railroad
                trains were illegal but successful, until twenty thousand federal
                troops were called out to ensure that trains carrying US mail
## could travel freely. Once the trains ran, the strike ended.

             - National Guard in the Colorado Labor Wars, 1903 – The
## Colorado National Guard, an employers' organization called
## the Citizens' Alliance, and the Mine Owners' Association
## teamed together to eject the Western Federation of Miners
## from mining camps throughout Colorado during the Colorado
## Labor Wars.

## Strikebreaking by governmental injunction

                [edit]

## In May 1895, in the case of In re Debs, the Supreme Court
                unanimously upheld the right of the federal government to use
## injunctions to end labor strikes.

## The case stemmed from an injunction against Eugene Debs,
## president of the American Railway Union, and other strike
## leaders during the Pullman Strike of 1894. President Grover
## Cleveland sided with the Pullman Company during the strike,
                and Cleveland's attorney general Richard Olney sought a court
6 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                order to end the strike from federal judge Peter S. Grosscup,
## whom he knew to hold anti-union sentiments. In July 1894,
## Grosscup issued an injunction, described as an "omnibus
                injunction" due to its wide scope, that forbade Debs and other
                union officials "from in any way or manner interfering with,
## hindering, obstructing or stopping" the railroads entering
## Chicago, as well as from communicating with their
                subordinates in the union. In July 1894, Debs and four other
## union leaders were arrested and charged with violating the
                injunction. In December 1894, US circuit court judge William A.
## Woods found Debs and the other union leaders to be in
                contempt of court for violating the injunction and sentenced
                them to prison terms ranging from three to six months.[8][9]

## The practice of strikebreaking by governmental injunction
## continued until the passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act in
                1932, which prohibited federal courts from issuing injunctions
                against nonviolent labor disputes, including strikes, picketing,
                and boycotts by labor unions.[10]

## Anatomy of a corporate union buster

                [edit]
                Corporations Auxiliary Company, a union buster during the first
## half of the 20th century, would tell employers,

                Our man will come to your factory and get acquainted... If he
## finds little disposition to organize, he will not encourage
## organization, but will engineer things so as to keep
## organization out. If, however, there seems a disposition to
                organize he will become the leading spirit and pick out just the
7 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                right men to join. Once the union is in the field its members can
## keep it from growing if they know how, and our man knows
                how. Meetings can be set far apart. A contract can at once be
## entered into with the employer, covering a long period, and
## made very easy in its terms. However, these tactics may not
## be good, and the union spirit may be so strong that a big
                organization cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns
                extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps
                the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the
## loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get
                somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be
                broken up.[11]

## In the period 1933 to 1936, Corporations Auxiliary Company
                had 499 corporate clients.[12]

## College students as strikebreakers in the Interborough
## Rapid Transit strike of 1905

                [edit]

## Following a walk out of subway workers, management of the
                trains Interborough Rapid Transit in New York City appealed to
## university students to volunteer as motormen, conductors,
                ticket sellers and ticket choppers. Stephen Norword discusses
## the phenomenon of students as strikebreakers in early 20th
                Century North America: "Throughout the period between 1901
## and 1923, college students represented a major, and often
                critically important source of strikebreakers in a wide range of
                industries and services. ... Collegians deliberately volunteered
                their services as strikebreakers and were the group least likely

                to be swayed by the pleas of strikers and their sympathizers
                that they were doing something wrong."[13]

## Jack Whitehead, the first "King of Strike Breakers"

                [edit]

## There were a significant number of strikes during the 1890s
## and very early 1900s. Strikebreaking by recruiting massive
                numbers of replacement workers became a significant activity.
                Jack Whitehead saw opportunity in labor struggles; while other
## workers were attempting to organize unions, he walked away
## from his union to organize an army of strikebreakers.
## Whitehead was the first to be called "King of the Strike
                Breakers"; by deploying his private workforce during strikes of
## steelworkers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Birmingham,
## Alabama, he became wealthy. By demonstrating how lucrative
                strikebreaking could be, Whitehead inspired a host of imitators.
                [14]

## James Farley inherits the strikebreaker title

                [edit]

## After Whitehead, men like James A. Farley and Pearl Bergoff
                turned union busting into a substantial industry. Farley began
## his strikebreaking career in 1895, and opened a detective
                agency in New York City in 1902. In addition to detective work,
## Farley accepted industrial assignments, specializing in
                breaking strikes of streetcar drivers.[15] Farley hired his men
## based in part upon courage and toughness, and in some

                strikes they openly carried firearms. They were paid more than
## the strikers had been. Farley was credited with a string of
## successful strikebreaking actions, employing hundreds, and
## sometimes thousands of strikebreakers. Farley was sometimes
                paid as much as three hundred thousand dollars for breaking a
## strike, and by 1914 he had taken in more than ten million
                dollars. Farley claimed that he had defeated thirty-five strikes
                in a row. But he suffered from tuberculosis, and as he faced
                death, he declared that he turned down the job of breaking a
                streetcar strike in Philadelphia because this time, "the strikers
                were in the right."[16]

## Bergoff Brothers Strike Service and Labor Adjusters

                [edit]
                Pearl Bergoff also began his strikebreaking career in New York
                City, working as a spotter on the Metropolitan Street Railway in
## Manhattan. His job was to watch conductors, making certain
                that they recorded all of the fares that they accepted. In 1905
                Bergoff started the Vigilant Detective Agency of New York City.
                Within two years his brothers joined the lucrative business, and
## the name was changed to the Bergoff Brothers Strike Service
## and Labor Adjusters. Bergoff's early strikebreaking actions
## were characterized by extreme violence. A 1907 strike of
## garbage cart drivers resulted in numerous confrontations
                between strikers and the strikebreakers, even when protected
                by police escorts. Strikers sometimes pelted the strikebreakers
## with rocks, bottles, and bricks launched from tenement
                rooftops.[17]

                Anti-union cartoon in monthly magazine The American Employer
## depicting the AFL as a fly on the wheel, 1913

## In 1909, the Pressed Steel Car Company at McKees Rocks,
## Pennsylvania fired forty men, and eight thousand employees
                walked out under the banner of the Industrial Workers of the
                World. Bergoff's agency hired strikebreaking toughs from the
## Bowery, and shipped vessels filled with unsuspecting
## immigrant workers directly into the strike zone. Other
                immigrant strikebreakers were delivered in boxcars, and were
                not fed during a two-day period. Later they worked, ate, and
## slept in a barn with two thousand other men. Their meals
                consisted of cabbage and bread.[18]

## There were violent confrontations between strikers and
## strikebreakers, but also between strikebreakers and guards
## when the terrified workers demanded the right to leave. An
## Austro-Hungarian immigrant who managed to escape told his
## government that workers were being held against their will,
                resulting in an international incident. In addition to kidnapping,

## strikebreakers complained of deception, broken promises
                about wages, and tainted food.[19]

## During federal hearings, Bergoff explained that "musclemen"
## under his employ would "get... any graft that goes on",
                suggesting that was to be expected "on every big job".[19]
## Other testimony indicated that Bergoff's "right-hand man",
                described as "huge in stature, weighing perhaps 240 pounds",
                surrounded himself with thirty-five guards who intimidated and
                fleeced the strikebreakers, locking them into a boxcar prison
                with no sanitation facilities when they defied orders.[20]
                At the end of August a gun battle erupted, leaving six dead, six
## dying, and fifty wounded. Public sympathy began to swing
## away from the company, and toward the strikers. Early in
## September the company acknowledged defeat and negotiated
## with the strikers. Twenty-two had died in the strike. But
                Bergoff's business was not hurt by the defeat; he boasted of
                having as many as ten thousand strikebreakers on his payroll.
                [20] He was getting paid as much as two million dollars per
                strikebreaking job.[21]

## Anti-union vigilantes during the First Red Scare

                [edit]
                Unlike the American Federation of Labor, the Industrial Workers
## of the World opposed the First World War. The American
                Protective League (APL) was a pro-war organization formed by
## wealthy Chicago businessmen. At the height of its power the
## APL had 250,000 members in 600 cities. In 1918, documents

12 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                from the APL showed that ten percent of its efforts (the largest
                of any category) were focused on disrupting the activities of
## the IWW. The APL burgled and vandalized IWW offices, and
## harassed IWW members. Such actions were illegal, yet were
                supported by the Wilson administration.[22]

## Spies, "missionaries", and saboteurs

                depicting the AFL as a cannon aimed at a government building, 1914

## Strikebreaking by hiring massive numbers of tough
## opportunists began to lose favor in the 1920s; there were
                fewer strikes, resulting in fewer opportunities.[20][23] By the
                1930s, agencies began to rely more upon the use of informants
## and labor spies.

## Spy agencies hired to bust unions developed a level of
## sophistication that could devastate targets. "Missionaries"
## were undercover operatives trained to use whispering
## campaigns or unfounded rumors to create dissension on the
                picket lines and in union halls. The strikers themselves were
                not the only targets. For example, female missionaries might
13 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                systematically visit the strikers' wives in the home, relating a
## sob story of how a strike had destroyed their own families.
## Missionary campaigns have been known to destroy not only
                strikes, but unions themselves.[24]

## In the 1930s, the Pinkerton Agency employed twelve hundred
## labor spies, and nearly one-third of them held high level
                positions in the targeted unions. The International Association
## of Machinists was damaged when Sam Brady, a veteran
                Pinkerton operative, held a high enough position in that union
                that he was able to precipitate a premature strike. All but five
                officers in a United Auto Workers local in Lansing, Michigan
## were driven out by Pinkerton agents. The five who remained
## were Pinkertons. At the Underwood Elliott-Fisher Company
## plant, the union local was so badly injured by undercover
## operatives that membership dropped from more than twenty
                five hundred to fewer than seventy-five.[25]

## General strikebreaking methods

                [edit]

## During the period from roughly 1910 to 1914, Robert Hoxie
                compiled a list of methods used by employers' associations to
                attack unions. The list was published in 1921, as part of the
## book Trade Unionism in the United States. These methods
                include counter organization, inducing union leaders to support
## management, supporting other pro-business enterprises,
## refusing to work with pro-union enterprises, obtaining
                information on unions among others.[26]

## Hoxie summarized the underlying theories, assumptions, and

14 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                attitudes of employers' associations of the period. According to
                Hoxie, these included the supposition that employers' interests
                are always identical to society's interests, such that unions
                should be condemned when they interfere; that the employers'
                interests are always harmonious with the workers' interests,
## and unions therefore try to mislead workers; that workers
                should be grateful to employers, and are therefore ungrateful
                and immoral when they join unions; that the business is solely
## the employer's to manage; that unions are operated by nonemployees, and they are therefore necessarily outsiders; that
## unions restrict the right of employees to work when, where,
                and how they wish; and that the law, the courts, and the police
## represent absolute and impartial rights and justice, and
## therefore unions are to be condemned when they violate the
                law or oppose the police.[27]

## Given the proliferation of employers' associations created
## primarily for the purpose of opposing unions, Hoxie poses
                counter-questions. For example, if every employer has a right
                to manage his own business without interference from outside
## workers, then why hasn't a group of workers at a particular
## company the right to manage their own affairs without
                interference from outside employers?[28]

## Strikebreaking and union busting, 1936–1947

                [edit]
                Shortly after the landslide victory of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the
                presidential election of 1936, the Supreme Court in April 1937
                handed down a decision in which it concurred with the findings

## of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that the Jones
## and Laughlin Steel Company had engaged in unfair labor
## practices, including firing workers "because of their union
                activity and for the purpose of discouraging membership in the
## union," and upheld the NLRB's order that the company offer
                reinstatement with backpay to ten of the fired union workers at
                the company's steelworks in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, and post
                notices that the company would not fire or discriminate against
                union members or those seeking to join the union.[29]
                Later in 1937, during the Little Steel strike, approximately
                8,000 striking steel workers were illegally fired from their jobs,
## more than 1,000 striking workers were arrested, and between
                16 and 18 strikers were killed over the course of the strike,
## including 10 workers who were killed in an incident on
## Memorial Day that came to be known as the Memorial Day
                massacre of 1937.[30]

## Employers in the United States have had the legal right to
## permanently replace economic strikers since the Supreme
                Court's 1937 decision in NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.
                [31]

## Meanwhile, employers began to demand more subtle and
                sophisticated union busting tactics, and so the field called
                "preventive labor relations" was born.[32] The new
## practitioners were armed with degrees in industrial
## psychology, management, and labor law. They would use
                these skills not only to manipulate the provisions of national
                labor law, but also the emotions of workers seeking to unionize.

## Nathan Shefferman (Labor Relations Associates),
## 1940s–1950s

                [edit]
                After passage of the Wagner Act in 1935, the first nationally
                known union busting agency was Labor Relations Associates of
## Chicago, Inc. (LRA) founded in 1939 by Nathan Shefferman,
                who later in 1961 wrote The Man in the Middle, a guide to union
                busting, and has been considered the 'founding father' of the
                modern union avoidance industry.[31] Shefferman had been a
## member of the original NLRB, and became director of
## employee relations at Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck and
## Company. Sears had been engaged in blocking unions from the
                AFL Retail Clerks union throughout the 1930s. Sears provided
                $10,000 seed money to launch LRA.[34] In 1957 during
                hearings conducted by the United States, Congress, and Select
## Committees on Improper Activities in the Labor and
                Management Field.[35] Nate Shefferman was questioned by
## Robert Kennedy and testimony revealed that Teamsters union
                "top brass" were regularly sent to meet with him. An article
                written by Victor Riesel for Inside Labor on May 28, 1957[36]
                reveals that Dave Beck, President of the Teamster's Union in
## that era, worked closely with Nate Shefferman on many deals
                not the least of which may have been his influence at Sears to
                discourage employees from joining the AFL Retail Clerks union
## which was trying to raid the Teamsters membership to join
                them instead. An indicator of the close relationship between
## the Teamster's President David Beck and Shefferman
                (excerpted from the article): "Beck dispatched Shefferman to
17 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                Jim Hoffa last year (1956) to offer Hoffa the union's presidency
                if Hoffa would first help re-elect Beck and then wait 6 months
                for Beck to resign on grounds of ill health". The article asks
                "Why did Beck and the multi-million dollar Shefferman work so
                closely—and on what?"[36]

## By the late 1940s, LRA had nearly 400 clients. Shefferman's
                operatives set up anti-union employee groups called "Vote No"
## committees, developed ruses to identify pro-union workers,
## and helped arrange sweetheart contracts with unions that
                would not challenge management.[37] Consultants from LRA
## "committed numerous illegal actions, including bribery,
                coercion of employees and racketeering."[31]
                Shefferman built "a daunting business on a foundation of false
## premises", of which "perhaps the most incredible—and most
## widely believed—is the myth that companies are at a
## disadvantage to unions organizationally, legally, and
                financially during a union-organizing drive." What businesses
## sought to accomplish through such propaganda was for
                Congress to amend the Wagner Act.[38]

## One of Shefferman's associates defined his technique simply
                by saying: "We operate the exact way a union does," he said.
## "But on management's side. We give out leaflets, talk to
                employees, and organize a propaganda campaign."[39]

## to it. (September 2020)

                In 1956, Nathan Shefferman defeated a unionizing effort of the
                Retail Clerks Union at seven Boston-area stores by employing
## tactics that Walter Tudor, the Sears vice-president for
## personnel, described as "inexcusable, unnecessary and
## disgraceful". At a Marion, Ohio, Whirlpool plant, an LRA
                operative created a card file system which tracked employees'
                feelings about unions. Many of those he regarded as pro-union
                were fired. A similar practice took place at the Morton Frozen
## Foods plant in Webster City, Iowa. An employee recruited by
                LRA operatives wrote down a list of employees thought to favor
## a union. Management fired those workers. The list-making
## employee received a substantial pay increase. When the
## United Packinghouse Workers of America union was defeated,
## Shefferman arranged a sweetheart contract with a union that
                Morton Frozen Foods controlled, with no participation from the
## workers. From 1949 through 1956, LRA earned nearly $2.5
                million providing such anti-union services.[40]

## In 1957, the United States Senate Select Committee on
## Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also known as
                the McClellan Committee) investigated unions for corruption,
                and employers and agencies for union busting activities. Labor
## Relations Associates was found to have committed violations
## of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, including
## manipulating union elections through bribery and coercion,
## threatening to revoke workers' benefits if they organized,
## installing union officers who were sympathetic to
## management, rewarding employees who worked against the

                union, and spying on and harassing workers.[41] The McClellan
## Committee believed that "the National Labor Relations Board
                [was] impotent to deal with Shefferman's type of activity."[42]

## In 1959, the state of North Carolina passed a law banning
                collective bargaining by all government workers.[43]

                There is little evidence that employers availed themselves of
                anti-union services during the 1960s or the early 1970s.[45]
                However, under a new reading of the Landrum-Griffin Act, the
## U.S. Department of Labor took action against consulting
                agencies related to filing of required reports in only three cases
                after 1966, and between 1968 and 1974 it filed no actions at
                all. By the late 1970s, consulting agencies had stopped filing
## reports.

                The 1970s and 1980s were an altogether more hostile political

                and economic climate for organized labor.[31] Meanwhile, a
                new multi-billion dollar union buster industry, using industrial
## psychologists, lawyers, and strike management experts,
## proved skilled at sidestepping requirements of both the
                National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and Landrum-Griffin in the
                war against labor unions.[46] In the 1970s the number of
## consultants, and the scope and sophistication of their
## activities, increased substantially. As the numbers of
## consultants increased, the numbers of unions suffering
## National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) setbacks also
                increased. Labor's percentage of election wins slipped from 57
## percent to 46 percent. The number of union decertification
                elections tripled, with a 73 percent loss rate for unions.[42]
                Labor relations consulting firms began providing seminars on
                union avoidance strategies in the 1970s.[47] Agencies moved
## from subverting unions to screening out union sympathizers
                during hiring, indoctrinating workforces, and propagandizing
                against unions.[48]

## In August 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers
## Organization (PATCO) went on strike seeking better pay and
## working conditions, among other issues. When the striking
## workers refused to obey a court order to return to work,
## President Ronald Reagan ordered the Federal Aviation
                Administration to fire all 11,345 strikers and hire strikebreakers
## to replace them. While approximately 500 PATCO members
## were rehired, the vast majority of striking workers were
                permanently banned from federal employment.[49] In October
## 1981, PATCO was decertified as a union by the Federal Labor

                Relations Authority.[50] According to Steve Early of The Boston
                Globe, "PATCO's destruction ushered in a decade of lost strikes
## and lockouts, triggered by management demands for pay and
                benefit givebacks that continue to this day in a wide range of
                industries."[51]

## By the mid-1980s, Congress had investigated, but failed to
## regulate, abuses by labor relations consulting firms.
                Meanwhile, while some anti-union employers continued to rely
## upon the tactics of persuasion and manipulation, other
## besieged firms launched blatantly aggressive anti-union
                campaigns. At the dawn of the 21st Century, methods of union
                busting have recalled similar tactics from the dawn of the 20th
                Century.[52] The political environment has included the NLRB
                and the Department of Labor failing to enforce the labor law
                against companies that repeatedly violate it.[53][54]
                Case Farms built its business by recruiting immigrant workers
## from Guatemala, who endure conditions few Americans would
## put up with. From 1960 to 2000 the percentage of workers in
                the United States belonging to a labor union fell from 30% to
                13%, almost all of that decline being in the private sector.[55]
                This is despite an increase in workers expressing an interest in
                belonging to unions since the early 1980s. (In 2005, more than
## half of unionized private-sector workers said they wanted a
                union in their workplace, up from around 30% in 1984.[56])

## 1970s "sidelined" the NLRA. Much more aggressive and
## effective business lobbying meant "few real limits on ...
                vigorous antiunion activities. ... Reported violations of the NLRA
## skyrocketed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Meanwhile,
                strike rates plummeted, and many of the strikes that did occur
## were acts of desperation rather than indicators of union
                muscle."[57]

## In neighboring Canada, where the structure of the economy
                and pro or anti-union sentiment among workers is very similar,
                unionization was steadier. From 1970 to 2003, union density in
## the US declined from 23.5 percent to 12.4 percent, while in
                Canada the loss was much smaller, going from 31.6 percent in
                1970 to 28.4 percent in 2003.[58] One difference is that
                Canadian law allows for card certification and first-contract
## arbitrations (both features of the proposed Employee Free
## Choice Act promoted by labor unions in the United States).
## Canadian law also bans permanent striker replacements, and
                imposes strong limits on employer propaganda."[59]

## According to David Bacon, "Modern unionbusting" employs
                company-dominated organizations in the workplace to forestall
                organizing drives.[60]

## Captive audience techniques

                [edit]

## Common legal tactics used by employers to prevent
## unionization include forcing employees to attend anti-union
## meetings, known as captive audience meetings, where pro-
## union workers are unable to present alternative views;
## covering the workplace with anti-union posters, banners, or
                videos; instructing managers to tell workers that they may lose
                their jobs if they vote to unionize; and having managers hold
                one-on-one meetings with workers to argue it would be bad for
                them to vote for a union.[61] Employers' messages frequently
## focus on themes such as the idea that unions will drive
## employers out of business, that unions only care about
                extracting dues payments from workers, and that unionization
                is unnecessary or futile.[61] Overall, US employers spend more
                than $400 million per year on union-avoidance consultants to
                help them prevent employees from forming unions.[62]
                As of July 2024, by state law, workers are allowed to voluntarily
## leave anti-union meetings without employer retaliation in
## Illinois, Washington State, Oregon, Minnesota, Maine,
                Connecticut, and New York.[63][64] "Captive audience bans"
## can be broad - applying in some states to any political or
## religious topic - and have been challenged in court on the
## grounds they violate the Free Speech Clause of the federal
                constitution or that they are pre-empted by federal law.[64]

## In November 2024, the NLRB ruled that captive audience
                meeting were illegal throughout the United States.[65][66]

## Anti-union corporate training materials

                [edit]

## A number of US corporations have also produced anti-union
## training materials that have been disseminated to managers
## or other employees.

## In 2018, Amazon distributed a 45-minute union-busting
## training video to managers at Whole Foods, which it had
## acquired in 2017, instructing managers to look for warning
## signs that might indicate "vulnerability to organizing,"
## including use of the term "living wage" and workers showing
                an “unusual interest in policies, benefits, employee lists, or
## other company information,” and to immediately escalate
                potential signs of organizing to general managers.[67]

## In January 2022, Target emailed store managers at the
## company new training documents, instructing managers to
                look for warning signs of union organizing within their stores,
## including conversations among workers regarding pay,
                benefits, job security, or other grievances, and to coordinate
                with human resources to prevent unionization.[68]

## Accusations and complaints by workers of unfair labor
## practices

                [edit]
                In the early 21st century, employees at a number of prominent
## US corporations have accused their employers of engaging in
                illegal union-busting activities.[69] A 2019 report from the
## Economic Policy Institute found that employers were charged

25 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                with illegally firing workers in 19.9% of union elections, and
                with illegally coercing, threatening, or retaliating against
                workers for supporting a union in 29.6% of union elections.[70]
## Overall, unfair labor practice charges were filed against
## employers in 41.5% of NLRB-supervised union elections that
                took place in 2016 and 2017, and in elections involving more
                than 60 voters 54.4% of employers were charged with at least
                one illegal act.[70]
                In July 2015, the International Association of Machinists and
## Aerospace Workers union filed a complaint with the NLRB
## against Amazon, alleging that the company engaged in unfair
## labor practices by surveilling, threatening, and “informing
## employees that it would be futile to vote for union
                representation” during a during a union drive in 2014 and 2015
                at an Amazon warehouse in Chester, Virginia.[71] In 2016,
## Amazon settled the complaint with the NLRB, denying any
                wrongdoing but agreeing to post a list at the warehouse of 22
## forms of union-busting behavior that the company promised
                not to engage in, including threatening workers with the loss of
## a job or other reprisals if they were union supporters,
## interrogating workers about the union, or engaging in
## surveillance of workers while they participated in union
                activities.[71] In May 2024, workers at an Amazon warehouse in
                St. Peters, Missouri filed an unfair labor practice charge against
## the company with the NLRB, accusing the company of using
## "intrusive algorithms" as part of a surveillance program to
                deter union organizing at the warehouse.[72] In June 2024, a
## group of 104 delivery drivers at Amazon's DIL7 facility in

## Skokie, Illinois, employed by contractor Four Star Express
## Delivery as part of Amazon's Delivery Service Partner
## subcontractor program, and organized with the Teamsters

                NLRB against both Amazon and Four Star Express as a single or
## joint employer, alleging that their employer terminated
## employees for organizing a union, surveilled workers
## attempting to organize, implemented a hiring freeze in
                response to unionization efforts, suppressed pro-union speech
## on employee message boards, altered terms of employment in
## response to union activity, and sought to permanently close
                the DIL7 facility in response to union organizing.[73]
                In 2019, the IWW Freelance Journalists Union filed a complaint
                with the NLRB against Barstool Sports, alleging that Barstool
## owner David Portnoy had violated federal labor law by
## threatening retaliation against Barstool employees if they
                attempted to unionize.[74][75] In January 2020, Barstool
                reached an informal settlement with the NLRB in which Portnoy
## agreed to delete a series of tweets he had posted in August
                2019 in which he threatened to fire "on the spot" any Barstool
                employee who contacted a reporter to talk about unionization
                as well as reposting a 2015 blog article in which he threatened
## to "smash their little union to smithereens" if Barstool
                employees attempted to unionize.[76] The settlement also
                required Barstool to notify employees of their right to unionize

                In September 2021, workers at Activision-Blizzard with the ABK
                Workers Alliance filed unfair labor practice charges with the
## NLRB, alleging that the company threatened workers, told
## workers they could not discuss wages, hours, or working
## conditions, and "maintained an overly broad social media
## policy" and enforced the policy against employees who
                "engaged in protected concerted activity."[77]

## In December 2021, an employee at a Target store in
                Indianapolis, Indiana named Andrew Stacy filed an unfair labor
                practice charge with the NLRB, alleging that a manager at the
                store confiscated union flyers that Stacy was distributing with a
## co-worker and then interrogated the co-worker about the
                flyers.[68]
                In January 2022, the NewsGuild filed a complaint with the NLRB
## accusing The New York Times Company of violating federal
                labor law by adding new paid days off to the company's holiday
                calendar exclusively for non-union workers,[78] and the New
## York Times Guild accused the company of making similar
## changes to the company's bereavement policy, making it
## applicable only to non-union workers, later the same month.
                [79][80] In July 2023, the NewsGuild filed a grievance against
                The New York Times, accusing it of engaging in union-busting
                by announcing its intention to eliminate its sports section and
## to instead use non-union workers at The Athletic, which The
                New York Times acquired in 2022, to cover sports.[81][82]
                In August 2022, Trader Joe's announced that it was closing a

## United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) alleged
                that Trader Joe’s closed the wine shop because workers at that
                location were planning to file for a union election, though the
                company denies that the store was closed due to unionization
                activity.[84]
                In December 2022, two Tesla workers filed complaints with the
## NLRB accusing the company of illegally firing them in
                retaliation for criticizing the company's CEO, Elon Musk, in
## violation of federal laws protecting speech about working
                conditions.[85] In February 2023, a group of workers at a Tesla
                factory in Buffalo, New York, dubbed Gigafactory 2, filed an
## injunction with the NLRB, accusing the automaker of firing
## more than 30 workers from the company's Autopilot unit "in
## retaliation for union activity and to discourage union
                activity."[86][87] The company, however, denied the
## allegations, and the complaint was dismissed by the NLRB in
                November 2023.[88]

## In June 2023, a worker at a Lowe's store in New Orleans,
## Louisiana named Felix Allen was fired after leading a union
                drive at the store, leading to unfair labor practice charges
## being filed with the NLRB, accusing the company of multiple
                violations of labor law in response to a union drive at the store,
## including surveillance, interrogation of employees, and
                retaliating against union organizers.[89]

                union organizing activities and that the company illegally stood
                up a company union in violation of the Railway Labor Act.[90]
                [91]
                In November 2023, workers at eight REI retail stores accused
## the company of dozens of violations of labor law, including
## retaliating against pro-union workers, altering working
                conditions without union consultation, and refusing to bargain
## in good faith with unions at stores that voted in favor of
                unionization.[92]

## In March 2024, workers at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance,
## Alabama filed charges against the company with the NLRB,
                accusing the company of illegally disciplining workers at the
                plant in retaliation for organizing with the United Auto Workers
                (UAW) labor union.[93] In May 2024, following the loss of a
                unionization vote at the plant, the UAW filed a formal complaint
## with the NLRB seeking a new election due to what it called
                "wanton lawlessness" on the part of Mercedes-Benz in the run
## up to the election, with the UAW accusing the company of
                holding anti-union captive audience meetings, targeting pro-
## union workers for drug tests, and illegally terminating UAW
                supporters.[94][95]
                In May 2024, the Progressive Workers Union (PWU) filed unfair
                labor practice charges with the NLRB against the Sierra Club,
                accusing the organization of planning retaliatory firings after a
                list of 30 workers that the organization planned to fire was
                circulated that included three members of the union's national

                unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB against Lionbridge
## Technologies, which is contracted to perform QA testing for
                Activision, alleging that the company fired "substantially all of
## the approximately 160 employees working at its Boise, ID,
                worksite" in retaliation for union-related activities, including
## "protected organizing activities and protected speech when
## raising issues regarding their working conditions," and
## accusing the company of having a "documented union-busting
                track record."[98][99]

## In June 2024, workers at Compass Coffee, a Washington, DC–
## based coffee roaster, filed an unfair labor practice charge
## against the company with the NLRB, accusing Compass Coffee
                of hiring 124 additional people, including Liz Brown, a lobbyist
                for Uber, and Cullen Gilchrist, the CEO and co-founder of Union
                Kitchen, and of manipulating schedules retroactively to make it
## appear as though the newly hired employees were eligible to
                vote in an upcoming union election.[100]
                In August 2024, the American Guild of Musical Artists (AGMA)
                filed unfair labor practice charges against Dallas Black Dance
                Theatre (DBDT) in Dallas, Texas, alleging practices including
                unilateral changes to employee benefits and a retaliatory firing
                on the part of the company, following a unanimous vote by the
                company's dancers to unionize in May 2024.[101] Shortly
                thereafter, DBDT fired all of its dancers, which the company
                claimed was in response to an unspecified video surfacing, but

## Formal charges and rulings by the NLRB

                [edit]
                Multiple accusations have led to formal charges and rulings by
                the NLRB against US corporations for engaging in illegal anti-
## union practices.

## In May 2012, an NLRB judge overturned the results of a
                unionization election at a Target store in Valley Stream, New
## York, and ordered a new vote, finding that Target managers
                had illegally barred employees from wearing union buttons and
## distributing fliers, threatened to discipline employees who
                discussed unionization, and threatened to close the store if the
                workers voted to unionize.[104]

## In April 2019, an NLRB judge found that Lowe’s Home Centers
                violated the National Labor Relations Act by forbidding workers
                from discussing their pay.[105]

## In May 2019, following a complaint filed by the United
## Steelworkers in November 2017, an NLRB judge found Kumho

## Tire had engaged in "pervasive" illegal conduct during a
## unionization campaign at the company's tire manufacturing
                plant in Macon, Georgia, with at least 12 managers including
                the company’s CEO issuing illegal threats to lay off employees
                or to close the plant if it unionized.[106][107]

## In December 2019, the office of NLRB general counsel Peter
                Robb filed a complaint against Chipotle, accusing the company
                of firing a worker in New York City in retaliation for trying to
## organize a union, as well as alleging that a manager
                threatened to fire workers if they engaged in protected union
## activities, implying they could face physical violence as a
                result.[108] In November 2022, the NLRB accused Chipotle of
                illegally closing a store in Augusta, Maine where workers were
                in the process of forming a union.[109]

## In March 2021, the NLRB ruled that Tesla violated labor law
                when it fired a union organizer, Richard Ortiz, and when the
## company's CEO, Elon Musk, posted a tweet that was viewed as
## threatening to labor organizers within the company, and it
                ordered Tesla to have Musk delete the anti-union tweet and to
                reinstate Ortiz and to compensate him for the loss of earnings.
                [110] In April 2022, the NLRB ruled that Tesla's dress code,
                which prohibited workers from wearing union logos or insignia,
                was unlawful,[111] although in November 2023 the United
                States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit overturned the
                NLRB's ruling.[112] In April 2023, the NLRB ruled that Tesla
                violated labor law by prohibiting workers at an Orlando, Florida
                service center from discussing pay or raising grievances about
                working conditions with upper management.[113] In May 2024,
33 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                an official with the NLRB filed a complaint claiming that Tesla's
## workplace rule barring workers from using workplace
                technology for the purposes of "unauthorized solicitating [sic]
## or promoting" or "creating channels and distribution lists"
                violated US labor law by illegally discouraging workers at an
                assembly plant in Buffalo, New York from union organizing.[114]
                [115]
                In November 2021, a regional director for the NLRB found that
## Amazon had violated labor laws at a warehouse in Bessemer,
## Alabama, including by interrogating, surveilling, and
                threatening pro-union workers, as well as by setting "overly
## broad" restrictions on workers' access to the warehouse,
                during a union drive at the warehouse by the Retail, Wholesale
                and Department Store Union.[116] In May 2022 the NLRB
                accused Amazon CEO Andy Jassy of violating federal labor law
## during media interviews in 2022 where he said workers are
                better off without a union,[117] and in May 2024 an NLRB judge
                ruled that Jassy's comments had indeed violated the law.[118]
## In December 2023, the NLRB found that Amazon had illegally
                interrogated warehouse workers in Staten Island, New York, as
                well prohibiting workers from handing out union literature and
                confiscating union literature from workers.[119] Overall, as of
## September 2023, 222 open or settled unfair labor practice
                charges had been filed against Amazon in 25 states.[120]

## In December 2021, an administrative judge with the NLRB
## found that Cemex Construction Materials had committed more
                than two dozen unfair labor practices, including threatening,
                surveilling, and interrogating workers, as well as hiring security

## guards to intimidate workers in the lead up to a 2019
                Teamsters union election.[121] In August 2023, the NLRB
                affirmed the judge's findings, and used the Cemex case to set
## a new policy requiring an employer that is found to have
                interfered with a union election to immediately recognize and
## bargain with the union, whereas previously a new election
## would be ordered, thereby partially reviving the Joy Silk
                doctrine.[121][122]

## In January 2022, the NLRB filed a complaint against The New
## York Times, alleging that the company illegally prevented
## workers designated as "intern managers" from showing
## support for a recently formed union of tech workers at the
                company.[123]

## As of February 2023, the NLRB had brought 75 complaints
## against Starbucks accusing it of more than 1,000 illegal
                actions.[69] In August 2022, the NRLB ordered Starbucks to
## reinstate seven employees who were allegedly fired for
                supporting a Starbucks union campaign at a store in Memphis,
                Tennessee.[124] The NLRB was granted an injunction to this
                effect by US District Judge Sheryl Lipman, which was upheld by
                the Sixth Circuit Court in 2023, though the injunction was later
## overturned by the Supreme Court in June 2024, in a decision
                that requires federal courts to apply a stricter standard to
                similar cases going forward.[125]

## In December 2022, the NLRB ruled that Apple illegally
## interrogated and made coercive statements to retail store
                workers in Atlanta, Georgia during a union drive.[126] In
35 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                November 2023, the NLRB filed a complaint against Apple over
                its practices at a retail store in Towson, Maryland, accusing the
## company of offering new benefits to non-unionized workers
## while denying the same benefits to unionized workers at the
## Towson store with the aim of "discouraging" other employees
                from unionizing.[127] In May 2024, the NLRB ruled that Apple
## illegally questioned workers about union matters and
                confiscated union flyers at its World Trade Center store in New
                York City in 2022, affirming the findings of an administrative
                judge in 2023.[128]
                In December 2023, the NLRB accused Trader Joe's of illegally
                firing a worker for supporting a union at a store in Hadley,
                Massachusetts.[129]
                In January 2024, the NLRB accused SpaceX of illegally firing a
                group of employees who wrote an open letter in June 2022 that
                was critical of the company's CEO Elon Musk.[130] The
                following day, SpaceX filed a lawsuit arguing that the structure
                of the NLRB is unconstitutional.[131] Notably, a number of other
                companies that have been accused of illegal anti-union activity
## by the NLRB, including Amazon, Starbucks, and Trader Joe's,
## have also brought lawsuits arguing that the NLRB is
                unconstitutional.[132] In response, NLRB general counsel
## Jennifer Abruzzo accused these companies of bringing their
## respective lawsuits against the NLRB in retaliation for the
## agency "trying to hold them accountable for repeatedly
                violating workers’ rights to organize and collectively bargain
                through representatives of their free choosing.”[133]

                In April 2024, a judge with the NLRB found that U.S. bourbon
## maker Woodford Reserve, owned by Brown-Forman,
                undermined unionization efforts at its distillery in Versailles,
                Kentucky by timing changes in merit pay and vacation policies,
                as well as handing out bottles of whiskey to workers, in order to
                influence the outcome of a unionization vote.[134]

## In June 2024, the NLRB found that Station Casinos had
## committed "extensive coercive and unlawful misconduct,"
## including discriminatory work assignments and threatening
                workers with being fired for supporting unionization, and that
## these actions "stemmed from a carefully crafted corporate
                strategy intentionally designed at every step to interfere with
                employees’ free choice" to unionize with the Culinary Workers
                Union or not.[135][136] As part of its ruling, the NLRB also issued
## a remedial bargaining order, requiring Station Casinos to
                immediately recognize and bargain with the union rather than
                hold a new election, marking the first time the NLRB had issued
## such an order following its decision in the Cemex case in
                August 2023.[135][136][137]

## Anti-union legislation

                [edit]
                In May 2023, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law a
                bill that imposed new requirements on public sector unions in
                Florida, including making it more difficult for unions to collect
## dues, which was labeled as a "paycheck protection" measure,
                as well as making it more difficult for unions to remain certified,
## with unions that cannot demonstrate a 60% membership rate

37 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                at their workplaces being automatically decertified by the state
                under the new law.[138]
                In May 2024, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signed into law a bill,
## known as Senate Bill 231, that bars companies in Alabama
## from receiving state-level economic incentives, including
## grants, loans, and tax credits, if companies voluntarily
                recognize a workers' union, rather than requiring workers to
                vote on whether to unionize.[139]
                In February 2025, Utah Governor Spencer Cox signed into law a
                bill, set to go into effect in July 2025, that prohibits collective
                bargaining by unions representing teachers, firefighters, police
                officers, transit workers, and other public-sector employees in
                Utah.[140] In response, a coalition of 19 labor groups in the
## state gathered more than 140,000 signatures to put a
                referendum on the 2026 state ballot to repeal the bill, known
                as HB267.[141]

## Union-busting by the Trump administration

                [edit]

## In March 2025, the US Department of Homeland Security
                (DHS) stated that it was terminating a collective bargaining
## agreement covering more than 47,000 employees at the
## Transportation Security Administration (TSA) represented by
## the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE),
                but which was not set to expire until 2031.[142] In response, the
## AFGE filed a lawsuit against the DHS, Secretary of Homeland
## Security Kristi Noem, the TSA, and TSA Chief of Staff Adam

                Stahl to enforce the agreement, alleging that the termination
                of the agreement was in relation for AFGE seeking to halt cuts
                to the federal workforce by the second Trump administration.
                [143]

## Later in March 2025, President Donald Trump signed an
                executive order seeking to prohibit collective bargaining by
                over 1 million federal workers.[144] Trump claimed that the Civil
## Service Reform Act of 1978 gave him the power to end
## collective bargaining with unions representing workers at
                federal agencies with missions related to national security,
                including the Department of State, the Department of Defense,
## the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of

                the Department of the Treasury, and other agencies.[145] This
## action, which affected 81.8 percent of all civilian federal
                workers in the United States, was labeled by labor historian Joe
                McCartin as "by far the largest single action of union busting in
                American history."[146]
                In April 2025, in response to a lawsuit brought by the National
## Treasury Employees Union, a federal judge issued a
                preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the executive
                order.[147] In August 2025, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
                lifted the injunction.[148] Shortly thereafter, the VA moved to

## History of labor legislation

                [edit]

## Railway Labor Act, 1926

                [edit]
                The Railway Labor Act[152][153] (RLA) of 1926 was the first
                major piece of labor legislation passed by Congress. The RLA
## was amended in 1936 to expand from railroads and cover the
                emerging airline industry. At UPS, the mechanics, dispatchers,
                and pilots are the labor groups that are covered by the RLA. It
## was enacted because Railroad management wanted to keep
## the trains moving by putting an end to "wildcat" strikes.
                Railroad workers wanted to make sure they had an opportunity
                to organize, be recognized as the exclusive bargaining agent in
## dealing with a company, negotiate new agreements and
                enforce existing ones. Under the RLA, agreements do not have
## expiration dates; instead they have amendable dates which
## are indicated within the agreement.

                The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA),[154] often referred to
## as the Wagner Act, was passed by Congress July 5, 1935. It
                established the right to organize unions. The Wagner Act was
## the most important labor law in American history and earned
                the nickname "labor's bill of rights". It forbade employers from
                engaging in five types of labor practices: interfering with or
                restraining employees exercising their right to organize and
## bargain collectively; attempting to dominate or influence a

40 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                labor union; refusing to bargain collectively and in "good faith"
## with unions representing their employees; and, finally,
## encouraging or discouraging union membership through any
## special conditions of employment or through discrimination
                against union or non-union members in hiring. Before the law,
                employers had liberty to spy upon, question, punish, blacklist,
## and fire union members. In the 1930s workers began to
                organize in large numbers. A great wave of work stoppages in
## 1933 and 1934 included citywide general strikes and factory
## occupations by workers. Hostile skirmishes erupted between
## workers bent on organizing unions, and the police and hired
## security squads backing the interests of factory owners who
## opposed unions. Some historians maintain that Congress
                enacted the NLRA primarily to help stave off even more serious
## —potentially revolutionary—labor unrest. Arriving at a time
                when organized labor had nearly lost faith in Roosevelt, the
## Wagner Act required employers to acknowledge labor unions
                that were favored by a majority of their work forces. The Act
                established the National Labor Relations Board, with oversight
                over union elections and unfair labor practices by employers.
                [155]

## Taft–Hartley Act, 1947

                [edit]
                The Taft–Hartley Act[156] was a major revision of the National
                Labor Relations Act of 1935 (the Wagner Act) and represented
                the first major revision of a New Deal act passed by a post-war
## Congress. In the mid-term elections of 1946, the Republican
                Party gained majorities in both houses for the first time since
41 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...

                1931. With the Truman administration initially taking no stand
## on the bill, it passed both houses with strong bipartisan
## support. In addition to overwhelming Republican support, a
## clear majority of House Democrats voted for the bill, while
                Democrats in the Senate split evenly, 21–21.[157]

## The Taft–Hartley Act was vehemently denounced by union
                officials, who dubbed it a "slave labor" bill. Truman vetoed the
                bill with a strong message to Congress, but despite Truman's
## all-out effort to stop the veto override, On June 23, 1947,
## Congress overrode his veto with considerable Democratic
                support, including 106 out of 177 Democrats in the House, and
                20 out of 42 Democrats in the Senate.[158] However, twenty-
## eight Democratic members of Congress declared it a "new
## guarantee of industrial slavery".

## Management always had the upper hand, of course; they had
                never lost it. But thanks to Taft–Hartley, the bosses could once
## again wage their war with near impunity.

                Taft–Hartley gave the National Labor Relations Board the power
## to act against unions engaged in unfair labor practices;
                previously, the board could only consider unfair practices by
## employers. It defined specific employer rights which
## broadened an employer's options during union organizing
                drives. It banned the closed shop, in which union membership
                is a precondition of employment at an organized workplace. It
## allowed state "right to work" laws which prohibit mandatory
## union dues.

                The act required union officials to swear that they were not
## communists. This provision was overturned by the Supreme

42 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                Court in 1965.[159]
                The act gave the president the power to petition the courts to
                end a strike if it constitutes a national emergency. Presidents
                have invoked the Taft–Hartley Act thirty-five times to halt work
                stoppages in labor disputes; almost all of the instances took
## place in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, under presidents
## Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson, after which the
                provision fell into disuse. The last two times the emergency
## provision was invoked were in 1978 by Jimmy Carter and 2002
## by George W. Bush.

## Landrum–Griffin Act, 1959

                [edit]

## The Landrum–Griffin Act of 1959 is also known as the Labor
                Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA)[160]
                defined financial reporting requirements for both unions and
## management organizations. Pursuant to LMRDA Section
## 203(b) employers are required to disclose the costs of any
## persuader activity as it regards consultants and potential
                bargaining unit employees.[161]
                Martin J. Levitt's interpretation is as follows:

## The law regulates labor unions' internal affairs and union
## officials' relationships with employers. But the law also
                required companies to report certain expenditures related to
## their anti-union activities. Fortunately for union busters,
## loopholes in the requirements allow management and their
## agents to ignore the provisions aimed at reforming their

43 of 67 9/7/25, 11:57 AM History of union busting in the United States - Wikipedia about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org...
                behavior.[162] The loopholes require consultants to file if they
## communicate with employees either for the purpose of
## persuading them not to join a union, or to gain knowledge
## about the employees or the union that may be passed on to
## the employer. However, most consultants accomplish these
## goals by indirect means, using supervisors and management
                as their first line of contact with employees. Even before the
## Act was passed, labor consultants had identified front-line
## supervisors as the most effective lobbyists for management.
                [163]
                Landrum–Griffin also seeks to prevent consultants from spying
                on employees or the union. Information is not to be compiled
                unless it is for the purpose of a specific legal proceeding.
                According to Martin Levitt, "It is easy for consultants to use this
                provision as a cover for "all kinds of information gathering".
                [163]

## According to Levitt, "because of Landrum–Griffin's vague
                language, attorneys are able to directly interfere in the union-
## organizing process without any reporting requirements.
                Therefore, "young lawyers run bold anti-union wars and dance
                all over Landrum–Griffin." The provisions of Landrum–Griffin
                allowing special rights for lawyers resulted in labor consultants
                working under the shield of labor attorneys, allowing them to
                easily evade the intent of the law."[164]
                Levitt stated:
                With the help of our trusted attorneys, our anti-union activities
                were carried out [under Landrum-Griffin] in backstage secrecy;

## meanwhile we gleefully showcased every detail of union
                finances that could be twisted into implications of impropriety
## or incompetence.
