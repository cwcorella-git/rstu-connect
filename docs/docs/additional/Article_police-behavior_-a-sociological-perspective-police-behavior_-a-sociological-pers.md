## Preface

Patrol officers are the most frequent type of police officer. In nearly all departments, they constitute roughly two-thirds of the sworn personnel.1 Patrol officers also “provide almost all emergency help; their patrolling is probably the most effective crime prevention measure; and they are the only police . . . most people will ever meet.”2 Consequently, the quality of contemporary policing as well as its future quality are largely in the hands of patrol officers. Until very recently not very much was known about the behavior of police patrol officers. Sociological research had been infrequent3 and of the investigations undertaken, most had been devoted almost exclusively to such specialized police divisions as detective and traffic bureaus.4 However, personnel in specialized divisions account for less than a quarter of sworn police officers.5 Fortunately, there has been a recent acceleration in research on police, and this research has taken on a broader orientation. 1 See Terry Eisenberg, Deborah Ann Kent, and Charles R.

For instance, sociologists Albert J. Reiss, Jr. and Donald Black placed a total of 36 observers with police patrol officers in Boston, Washington, D.C., and Chicago.6 Historian and sociologist Jonathan Rubinstein entered the Philadelphia Police Academy and subsequently spent nearly two years observing patrol officers.7 And sociologists Richard E. Sykes and John P. Clark placed eight observers with police patrol officers in a large midwestern city.8 As a consequence of these researches as well as others9 we now know a great deal more about the nature of police patrol behavior. We possess a much better understanding of the types of citizen-initiated problems that police patrol officers confront.10 We also have a much better understanding of the social interaction that occurs during police-citizen encounters.11 In 6 For a description and summary of this research project see Albert J. Reiss, Jr., The Police and the Public.

addition, our descriptions of the factors and variables that influence police decision making are significantly more accurate.12 We also have learned a great deal more about misconduct by patrol officers. It now is clear that in encounters where it is possible for police patrol officers to choose among a variety of dispositional alternatives, extra-legal criteria (such as demeanor and race) may dominate police exercise of discretion.13 Furthermore, we can see that corruption of patrol officers is present in nearly all police departments that have been studied, although the extent, of corruption is dependent upon the particular department one examines.14 Other studies suggest that unnecessary force by patrol officers is far from uncommon.15

## Purpose of the Book

The fundamental purpose of this book is to provide a sociological perspective on police behavior. It focuses on the results of recent research in the areas of police patrol behavior and misconduct organized from a sociological perspective. The book is intended to be used in several ways. First, the length of the book and its limited focus are intended to encourage adoption in a variety of sociology courses as a supplemental text. Courses such as criminology, social deviance, social problems, the sociology of law, and juvenile delinquency 12 See, for example, Carl Werthman and Irving Piliavin, “Gang Members and the Police,” in David J. Bordua (ed.), The Police: Six Sociological Essays. N ew York: John W iley and Sons, Inc., 1967, pp. 56-98. 13 For a review of this literature see Richard J. Lundman, “The Police Function and the Problem of External Control,” in Emilio C. Viano and Jeffrey H. Reiman (eds.). The Police in Society. Lexington, Mass.: D. C. Heath and Company, 1975, pp. 161-166. 14 See, for example, Julian Roebuck and Thomas Barker, “A Typology of Police Corruption,” Social Problems 21 (April 1974):423-438. 15 Albert J. Reiss, Jr., “Police Brutality—Answers to Key Questions,” Trans-Action (July-August, 1968): 12.

routinely include sections on the police. Instructors teaching these courses should find the book useful. The book also is directed at disciplines related to sociology. Specifically, it is intended for use in Criminal Justice Programs where there is a clear need for comprehensive treatments of police patrol behavior. While this book is not intended to provide its readers with practical guidance, it makes a useful contribution to criminal justice students by broadening their understanding of the law enforcement and criminal justice system. It does so by providing analyses of the societal and organizational forces that influence police patrol behavior, a perspective that should enhance appreciation of the complexities of contemporary policing. Another aspect of the book that lends itself to criminal justice sources is its focus on uniformed, motorized police work. Granting that some criminal justice majors may aspire to supervisory positions, it must still be recognized that future administrators in police departments are generally required to spend a fixed amount of time with the patrol division. This book anticipates the nature of that experience. Finally, this book is intended for use in academically oriented courses devoted solely to the police. Although these courses are not currently numerous, the continued scholarly and societal interest in the police should result in an increase. To assist students in this type of course, additional readings are listed in each chapter.
    Because of these different adoption possibilities, the articles
were selected to maximize student interest and readability. While most articles appeared in social science journals, I avoided those with social science jargon and those that contained intricate or unfamiliar statistical analyses. Additionally, the essays that introduce the two sections of the book as well as the chapter introductions were written with the student reader in mind.
    It also is necessary to acknowledge several debts. I worked
with John Clark and Richard Sykes for four years during the

course of their study of police patrol behavior. Both are stimulating colleagues and I continue to learn from them. I am now very much in debt to the office staff in the Sociology Department at Ohio State. They have endured a seemingly endless series of tasks with great patience and skill. I continue to be most grateful. Additionally, Peter K. Manning read through several earlier versions of the book and provided invaluable advice and counsel. Kenneth W. Eckhardt read and criticized the penultimate draft of the book. I have benefitted greatly because of their efforts. Any errors of fact or interpretation that remain, though, are my responsibility. Lastly, the book is dedicated to my parents who provided, among other things, confidence and to my family, Jean, Bobby, and Julie, for whom “gotta write” has become an all too frequent part of my leave-taking ceremonies. The book also is dedicated to Dr. Donald Summers of Beloit College. He “introduced” sociology to Jean Planty Lundman and me over a decade ago as he has to hundreds of students at Beloit, both before and since. He is a gifted scholar and teacher and we owe him a great deal. This is simply one way of expressing our gratitude.

## POLICE BEHAVIOR

## Overview

For many years police patrol officers did their work in relative obscurity. Although a minority of citizens had crime-related contacts with the police and more had contacts in the context of traffic law violations, most citizens knew and cared little about conduct and misconduct by patrol officers. Social scientists also knew and cared little about these matters.1 Beginning with the civil rights movement, however, news reports of one type of police misconduct—unnecessary police violence—thrust police officers into the public spotlight. Public concern and attention increased as police officers appeared on college campuses in connection with the antiwar movement. In these and other situations many people, including governmental officials, did not like what they saw. One consequence was a significant increase in funding for police-related research. Starting in about 1965,12 social scientists expanded their research about police behavior and many, through their studies, became familiar with the nature of conduct and misconduct by police patrol officers. This research has continued and much of it has occasioned revision of previous ideas about the origin and nature of these actions. In the area of police conduct, for instance, it was formerly assumed that police patrol officers were relatively autonomous, responding to their own personal needs or departmental guidelines.3 Based on recent research, however, it now appears nec1.

essary to suggest that police patrol behavior also reflects the actions and preferences of citizens.4 Similarly, it previously was argued that misconduct by patrol officers was the result of the presence of a few prejudiced or undisciplined officers.5 Recent research, though, suggests that it is necessary to devote some explanatory attention to external opportunities for misconduct as well as to police responses to those opportunities. It also has become evident that it is necessary to explore and to take into account characteristics of police organizations in attempting to develop fuller explanations of police misconduct.6 These changes in ideas about the origins and nature of conduct and misconduct by police patrol officers are the central concerns of this book. In the sections and chapters that follow, each of these types of police behavior is explored from a sociological perspective. We will begin by providing definitions for the key terms used throughout the book.
    Definition of Key Terms
Police patrol behavior refers to the problems, encounters, and decisions routinely characteristic of the patrol experience in large urban areas. During the course of a working shift, police patrol officers confront a wide variety of citizen-initiated problems. These problems involve reactive policing and may include citizen requests for police assistance with barking dogs, automobile accidents, groups of troublesome juveniles, husband-wife disputes, noisy parties, and drunken citizens. A minority of the problems police patrol officers deal with are proactive or police initiated. A car stopped for a traffic law violation illustrates a proactive problem.

## OVERVIEW / 5

Many of these problems produce an encounter, or period of face-to-face and generally polite (but constrained) interaction between patrol officers and citizens. In the case of a barking dog, for instance, police patrol officers may talk with a complainant and then with the owner of the barking dog. Of the problems that result in an encounter many require a decision intended to resolve the problem and terminate the encounter. Police patrol officers may warn the owners of barking dogs, tell husbands involved in disputes with their wives to leave, disperse troublesome juveniles, or arrest drunken citizens. Misconduct by police patrol officers includes abuse of discretion, corruption, and use of unnecessary force. Discretion exists when patrol officers are in a position to decide to terminate an encounter in more than one way. In the typical traffic law violation encounter, for example, a police patrol officer is in a position to terminate the encounter by issuing a traffic citation or by simply warning the offending motorist. Abuse of discretion exists when police patrol officers base their decisions on factors, such as race, that are contrary to the democratic norms surrounding contemporary policing, or on factors, such as the behavior or demeanor of the citizen, that are not part of the criminal law. Corruption exists when police patrol officers accept money, goods, or services for actions they are sworn to do anyway, or when police patrol officers accept money, goods, or services for ignoring or tolerating actions they are sworn to invoke legal processes against.7 Corruption may range from acceptance of free or discount meals in exchange for proactive policing to acceptance of money for ignoring gambling operations or the sale of narcotics. Unnecessary force occurs when police patrol officers utilize physical force in encounters v/here alternatives to physical force are available. Unnecessary police force may range from assaults on citizens who offer no physical resistance or threat to a patrol officer, as in assault of a passive handcuffed citizen,

to the use of a handgun against a citizen who is not presenting a clear and immediate danger to the officer or another citizen. Now that key terms have been defined, we will look at the perspective sociologists use to view events. This will provide a framework to view police behavior.
    A Sociological Perspective
As is true of all scientific disciplines, sociology is a lively arena of dispute, debate, and controversy. This intellectual ferment suggests a discipline that is conscious of the complexities of social phenomena and unwilling to give way to dogmatic interpretation. It also testifies to the existence of different theoretical perspectives and research strategies. Some sociological theorists, for example, believe that primary emphasis should be given to the structure of society and the ways in which structural elements such as social class influence human behavior. In explaining the criminal deviance police patrol officers are called upon to deal with, structuralist Robert K. Merton argues that persons located in the less advantaged segments of our society experience a “definite pressure . . . to engage in nonconforming rather than conforming conduct.”8 Other sociologists assert that it is more logical to view society as a set of collectivities involved in inevitable, but essentially beneficial, conflict. For these sociologists competition for scarce resources such as power, privilege, and wealth constitutes the fabric of society. They also assert that the consequences of this competition are positive in the sense of binding together individuals and groups. Conflict theorist Lewis Coser, for instance, argues that no group or society can be devoid of conflict since both “require disharmony as well as harmony, dissociation as well as association; and conflicts within them are by no means altogether disruptive forces.”9 From this

## OVERVIEW / 7

perspective criminal deviance is one result of conflict in contemporary society. Still other sociologists ignore the structure of society and its intergroup conflicts in favor of the study of face-to-face interaction. Edwin H. Sutherland believed that structural- and conflict-oriented explanations of crime are inadequate. Sutherland suggested that we instead examine patterns of association in small groups since “the principal part of the learning of criminal behavior occurs within intimate personal groups.”101 In the area of theory, then, there exists dispute and disagreement over which theoretical tradition or paradigm best explains human action generally and criminal deviance specifically. For the most part there are three theoretical perspectives: the structural functional, conflict, and interactionist. Clearly, the apparent absence of agreement confounds the task of developing a sociological perspective on police patrol behavior. However, perspective is not the only issue under debate within the discipline of sociology. Research strategies also are marked by controversy. Some sociologists assert that information provided by interview and questionnaire is adequate.11 Other sociologists suggest that sound theory can be built only by personal observation of social conduct.12 Still other sociologists contend that laboratory and field experiments are necessary ingredients of any overall research strategy.13 Therefore, in a very real sense, there also is no single research strategy acceptable to all sociologists. Despite the multiplicity of perspectives and methods within sociology, there are areas of overlap and agreement. Common

## 8 / OVERVIEW

to nearly all contemporary sociological theories of human action is a focus on extra-individualistic, or social, forces and events. The sociologist who adopts a structural orientation seeks to explain social behavior in terms of the interrelationships of social institutions. Conflict-oriented sociologists emphasize social competition among groups. Even sociologists who study face-to-face interaction devote primary explanatory attention to such extra-individualistic factors as social rules, norms, and expectations. Although none of these sociologists ignores the individual, all seek explanations of human action in terms of factors other than the unique characteristics of particular persons. In the area of research strategies there also exists a sociological common ground. Minimally the sociological interviewer, observer, and experimenter agree that the research goal should be an accumulation of data (and knowledge) as free of bias and distortion as possible. In addition, most researchers use techniques whose theory and implementation are generally known. Consequently, other sociologists who wish to use or critique them have public access. Common to nearly all contemporary research methods, then, is a concern with the development of reliable and valid knowledge about particular phenomena. These common theoretical and methodological concerns can be termed a “sociological imagination,” a perspective that can be applied in the study of a variety of phenomena—including police behavior.14 Sociologist C. W right Mills described the benefits of developing and applying a sociological imagination:

tations. Older decisions that once appeared sound now seem to them products of a mind unaccountably dense. Their capacity for astonishment is made lively again. T h ey acquire a new way of thinking, they experience a transvaluation of values: in a word, by their reflection and by their sensibility, they realize the cultural meaning of the social sciences.15
Sensitized by Mills’ promise of the benefits to be derived from application of a sociological imagination, the basic purpose of this book is to develop a sociological perspective on police patrol behavior.

## Police Behavior: A Sociological Perspective

Assuming Mills is correct, what can we expect to learn from applying a sociological perspective to police patrol behavior? Minimally we should expect to come away from our efforts with a revised and expanded understanding of police patrol behavior. This section will enable us to anticipate or preview the nature of that revision and expansion. In studying police behavior, often an initial tendency is to concentrate primarily on the individual patrol officer. This tendency develops since the patrol officer’s uniform, weapons, and powers of arrest yield an apearance of relative independence and autonomy. Arthur Niederhoffer, a former New York City police officer turned professor, observes:
The policeman is a “Rorschach” in uniform as he patrols his beat. H is occupational accounterments—shield, nightstick, gun, and summons book—clothe him in a mantle of symbolism that stimulates fantasy and projection. Children identify with him in the perennial game of “cops and robbers.” Teenagers in autos stiffen with compulsive rage or anxiety at the sight of the patrol car.16

## 10 / OVERVIEW

Our newly acquired sociological imagination encourages us to look beyond this appearance of autonomy and the individualistic emphasis that it produces. It encourages discovery of new ideas about the social forces and events that shape police behavior and misconduct. It also permits revision and expansion of existing explanations of these actions. The benefits are several. First, when we look beyond the apparent autonomy of the patrol officer we discover that police behavior also is determined by citizens. W e learn that most police-citizen encounters are initiated by citizens who telephone the police dispatch room. We also learn that a meaningful portion of police behavior occurs in response to the actions of the citizens present during an encounter. Furthermore, we discover that certain police decisions reflect the actions and preferences of citizens. One basic theme of this book is that police patrol behavior is determined by citizens as voell as by patrol officers. Second, by applying a sociological perspective we discover that misconduct by police patrol officers is a complex phenomenon involving the interaction or convergence of at least two elements: illegitimate opportunities and informal departmental operating rules that encourage or tolerate officers who take advantage of these opportunities. More specifically, we learn that community and departmental forces combine to account for organized misconduct by police patrol officers. This contrasts markedly with earlier explanations, which emphasized individual character traits as explanatory factors.17 A second basic theme of the book is that misconduct by patrol officers is a function of community and departmental characteristics.
     Plan of the Book
The plan of the book follows from these two basic themes. The first section of the book details the ways in which police

and citizens together shape police patrol behavior. In the three chapters in this section specific attention is given to the influence citizens have on the problems police patrol officers handle, the encounter, and the decision a police officer makes in an effort to resolve or terminate the encounter. The second section of the book examines the ways in which community and departmental characteristics relate to the emergence of misconduct by police patrol officers. In the three chapters contained in this section specific attention is given to abuse of discretion, corruption, and use of unnecessary force. Each section and chapter of the book begins with an introduction. The section introductions provide a basic sociological perspective on the issues to be addressed. The chapter introductions preview the readings that follow.

## Police
## Conduct

The basic theme of this first section is that citizens and patrol officials together shape police patrol behavior. This theme will be advanced in the context of examinations of the kinds of problems police patrol officers seek to resolve, the interaction or discussion that occurs during police-citizen encounters, and the dispositional decisions reached by patrol officers.

## Problems

Although it might appear that police patrol officers initiate the majority of encounters with citizens, the truth of the matter is that most patrol work is reactive rather than proactive. Police patrol officers are legally constrained from proactive observation of private places such as homes or apartments unless they have reason to believe that a felony has been or is about to be committed. They are consensually constrained from routine proactive observation of semi-public places such as bars or restaurants by the uneasiness their presence causes proprietors and customers.1As a consequence, proactive police patrol work is restricted to public places such as sidewalks and streets, and it is only infrequently productive of serious criminality. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, reports that a burglary occurs once every 10 seconds and a robbery once every 78 seconds.2 Yet it has been estimated that a police patrol

officer will witness, on the average, a burglary in progress once in every three months of patrol and a robbery in progress once every fourteen years.3 Contemporary police organizations are, therefore, highly dependent upon citizen reports of criminal incidents and other situations requiring police presence. Although the figures vary slightly depending upon the particular study one consults, it appears that approximately three-quarters of all police-citizen encounters are initiated by citizens who use the telephone to call the police. If police-initiated traffic stop encounters are excluded from the total of police-citizen contacts, the proportion of citizen-initiated encounters approaches 90 percent.4 This dependence upon citizen input has a profound influence on police organizations and police behavior. First, police reliance upon citizens’ reports of criminal incidents has given citizens partial control over official crime and arrest statistics. Recent research results indicate that only half of the criminal incidents detected by citizens are ever reported to the police.5 In addition, by their willingness or unwillingness to remain at the scene of an incident they have reported to police, complainants determine whether or not a report will be written and therefore whether an arrest can ever be made.6 Second, police dependence upon citizen reports of incidents requiring police presence has made the telephone and dispatch room the center of contemporary police organizations. In this room telephone consoles are constantly attended to and dispatchers are available to direct radio-equipped patrol cars to the scenes of incidents reported by citizens. Jonathan Rubin3.

## POLICE CONDUCT / 15

stein describes the operation of the telephone and dispatch center of the Philadelphia police department:
The dispatcher’s major responsibilities are to interpret incoming calls and to dispatch assignments to the cars on his network. W hen one of the phones at the console rings, the “phone man” makes out a card containing the address of the caller and the nature of the complaint. T he card is handed to the dispatcher, who sits before a lighted panel marked with the numbers of all the cars and wagons assigned to his division and a detailed map with district and sector boundaries clearly marked. H e punches the card on a time clock and assigns the “job” to a car. H e then files the card in a slot above the lighted panel reserved for that particular car and flips a switch turning off the light under the car’s number on the panel. W hen the officer reports back to the dispatcher that he has completed the assignment, the card is again time-punched and the light turned on.7
Police dependence upon citizen use of the telephone also has had a profound effect on the nature of police patrol work. In one sense the radio for the patrol officer is the equivalent of the factory worker’s assembly line. In high-crime areas especially the radio is a constant source of work for the patrol officer. And, the patrol officer’s superiors and peers require that radioed work assignments be accepted.8 There are several differences, however, between the work experiences of the police patrol officer and those of the factory worker. One is the diversity characteristic of contemporary police patrol work.9 Unlike the factory worker who endlessly repeats the same task, the police patrol officer experiences

8. T o be sure, patrol officers can and do ignore radio assignments. For
instance, a radio call can be ignored and then later be explained by a report of a traffic stop or residence check. However, patrol officers cannot do this regularly since administrators become irritated and colleagues become angry at the extra burden they must carry.

change in the nature of the tasks performed. Patrol officers may be called upon to write a report of a criminal incident, check someone’s well-being, investigate a suspicious person, and quiet a barking dog. Then, without warning, the emergency tone on the squad’s radio is heard and calls such as the following are put out: “man with a gun,” “shots fired,” “officer needs help,” or “silent alarm.” These “heavy” calls lend excitement and danger to police patrol work. They also provide the ultimate rationale for the existence of the patrol officer:
     T h e heavy ones are ultimately our only rationale for being. You
     could give most of what w e do around here to any idiot who
     could put up w ith the insanity that passes for civilized conduct.
     But you know that old John Q. Citizen isn’t going to put his ass
     on the line [for a heavy call]. . . .10
Police patrol work, then, is characterized by diversity and, occasionally, excitement and danger. Another difference between police work and factory work is the considerable autonomy of the patrol officer. To a great extent the work of the patrol officer is unsupervised and to a lesser extent it is unsupervisable. It is this autonomy that returns some degree of control to patrol officers and allows them to shape, with citizens, the problems or agenda of patrol work. Patrol officers can partially escape citizen control by becoming more proactive.11 Patrol officers have ultimate control over the ratio of reactive to proactive problems since they can choose to initiate a greater proportion of problems. Car and pedestrian checks represent an almost endless source of proactive work for patrol officers. Furthermore, patrol officers can and do “prioritize”12 the

calls they receive. Almost without exception, “heavy” calls receive first priority. For instance, two officers were helping a parent search for a lost child when their portable police radio informed them of an automobile chase. They immediately broke off the search, ran to their squad, and joined in the chase, leaving a bewildered parent standing alone. They returned shortly thereafter but the parent had already found the child.13 In another illustrative situation two officers found a young adult drinking beer in his car. He was quite drunk and the officers decided to arrest him. They handcuffed him and placed him in the back seat of the squad car. As the officers started the drive downtown, a “robbery in progress” call was put out. The officer who was driving immediately pulled to the curb while the officer in the back seat with the “prisoner,” took off the handcuffs, pushed the young man out the door, and “unarrested” him saying, “walk home, don’t drive.” They then responded with emergency speed and lights, but no siren,14 to the robbery call. Lastly, even though they are called to the scene of an incident by a citizen, police patrol officers determine the way in which they respond. For heavy calls emergency speed and lights are utilized and, if the officers are a considerable distance away or if getting there rather than apprehension is of prime importance (e.g., “officer needs help”), the siren also is used. For many other calls, however, police patrol officers respond in a deliberate manner with the hope that the problem and the citizen will be gone by the time they arrive. In the context of domestic or husband-wife disputes, for instance, it was my experience that “police responded without emergency speed, signal lights, and siren, often proceeding . . . in a deliberate manner with the hope that the domestic . . . would be settled

prior to their arrival.15 Other researchers have advanced essentially similar observations.16 What, then, can be said about the ways in which citizens and police patrol officers together shape the problems characteristic of patrol work? At least two summary points are in order. First, citizens largely, but not solely, determine the types of problems police patrol officers work with. The nature of police patrol work rests largely in the hands of citizens. Second, within the constraints imposed on their work by citizens, police patrol officers determine the priority of the problems they deal with and the ways in which they respond. The perceived importance and pace of patrol work rests largely in the hands of patrol officers.
     Encounters
As compared to the direct control citizens exert in determining the problems patrol officers deal with, citizen control over the actual flow, or trajectory, of interaction during an encounter is significantly less direct. In one sense police patrol officers rather than citizens control the encounter. Self-protection is the first priority of the patrol officer arriving at the scene of an encounter.17 The officer initially acts to ensure that none.of the citizens present have weapons on their persons or within their reach. Generally this is accomplished visually and by controlling the physical locations of the citizens present. If people or the premises are at all suspicious, however, an officer rarely hesitates to undertake a search of either, or both. Establishing respect for police authority is the second priority of the patrol officer involved in an encounter with citi15. Richard J.

zens.18 Police patrol officers enter encounters with the expectation that citizens will be polite and, to some extent, respectful in their interaction with them. This often takes the form of an “attitudes test” which, on the basis of the available evidence, appears to be a commonly encountered characteristic of large urban police organizations.19 Sociologist Rodney Stark describes the use of the “attitudes test” by Los Angeles patrol officers:
Virtually all studies of the Los Angeles Department report that the attitudes test is a common part of L.A. police argot. . . . The attitudes test . . . indicates that in police-citizen interactions the police impose certain standards o f deference and respect and failure to meet this test merits reprisals . . . use of violence, harrassment, or bringing of chicken shit citations and charges.20
Use of the attitudes test by patrol officers is thus another way in which they, rather than citizens, control police-citizen interactions. “Normalization”21 is the third priority of patrol officers. Normalization is the process whereby an officer establishes that a particular encounter is representative of the hundreds or thousands of similar encounters experienced in the past. Normalization is important to an officer for at least two reasons. First, it allows an officer to reliably predict citizen behavior during the course of an encounter. If an officer can establish that a particular husband-wife dispute is similar to other husband-wife disputes, the officer can expect both parties to be

agitated and generally equally responsible for the particular incident. The officer also can predict that the wife will claim to be the victim and ask or demand that the husband be seen as the violator.22 Additionally, normalization permits utilization of the decision-making guidelines or “recipes for action”23 used in normal encounters. If an encounter can be normalized, the officer can be relatively confident of the general nature of the interaction and ultimate resolution of the problem. For instance, if a husband-wife dispute can be normalized, the experienced patrol officer would try to separate the combatants, listen more patiently to the complaints of the wife, and suggest that they both forget the problem for now. If that suggestion is unworkable or unacceptable, the husband is then told to leave. Rarely is formal action such as arrest undertaken, except as a last resort, since the officer knows that in the typical husbandwife dispute both parties will object.24 Normalization, in short, makes routine police work possible. However, normalization can occur only if an officer “knows” a citizen. But in most encounters the particular citizens present are not personally known to the officer. As a consequence, citizens must provide patrol officers with the information that permits normalization. It is in this way that citizens residually shape the trajectory of police-citizen encounters. Police patrol officers generally arrive at the scene of an encounter with only a fragmentary description of the problem and an educated guess as to the types of persons who might be present. Indeed, all the responding patrol officer typically pos22. See Lundman, “Domestic Police-Citizen Encounters.”

sesses is the address of a vaguely described problem. Fortunately, some citizens present at the scene of an encounter feel compelled to talk, if for no other reason than to explain their presence. If they are reluctant or situationally tongue tied, though, patrol officers prevail upon them to amplify terse radio descriptions and to account for their possible relation to the incident. Rarely is extensive information collected, but the officer continues until able to place the problem by reference to calls typically received in that area. Citizens, therefore, provide patrol officers with the information fundamental to normalization of the encounter. Once identification of the problem has occurred, further normalization is dependent upon the actions and, especially, the attitudes of the citizens present. Given a typical problem, it is generally possible for an experienced officer to predict how the citizens present will look and act. Citizens who are publicly drunk, for example, are expected to be poorly dressed and somewhat belligerent. Traffic law violators are expected to be surprised and somewhat defensive, while felony victims are expected to be frightened. All citizens are expected to be reasonably polite and somewhat respectful of police authority. Citizens who meet these expectations permit complete normalization of an encounter, since confirmation of expectations makes routine policing possible. The only task that remains is informing naive or slow citizens of the inevitable. Once normalization has taken place, the vast majority of police interaction is polite. Moreover, only rarely do encounters involve displays of violence by patrol officers or unintentional losses of verbal control.25 When these relatively infrequent actions occur they generally are triggered by citizens who blocked normalization by flunking the “attitudes test.”26 We shall return to this issue in the second half of the book. What we find, in sum, is that police patrol officers enter encounters with these priorities: self-protection, establishing re25. See Lundman, “Domestic Police-Citizen Encounters.”

## 22 / POLICE CONDUCT

spect for police authority, and normalization. Patrol officers, therefore, have ultimate control over their encounters with citizens. However, much of what actually occurs during an encounter is determined by citizens. Patrol officers are dependent upon citizens for information and they are keenly sensitive to their attitudes. Citizen control over encounters is thus present, but it is indirect and occurs within constraints imposed by police.
     Decisions
Until recently it has been commonplace to observe that police patrol work is largely discretionary.27 By this it was meant that police officers possess extraordinary freedom in deciding how to dispose of or deal with a problem. Frequently associated with this observation were accusations that police officers abuse this discretion by treating black citizens differently than white citizens and lower-class citizens differently than middleclass citizens.28 Although these accusations are sometimes true (see Chapter 4), it is necessary to recognize that citizens possess and exercise discretion too. It also is necessary to recognize that police exercise of discretion is limited by a variety of factors other than citizen exercise of discretion. We begin by reviewing the steps leading up to police contact with a citizen. It will be recalled that police patrol work is largely reactive. Citizens determine whether or not a police officer will be in a position to exercise discretion by their willingness to call the police. As stated earlier, evidence indicates that citizens elect not to call the police half the time. Citizens further determine or constrain police exercise of discretion by their willingness to remain at the scene of an encounter until the police arrive. If a citizen calls the police but then leaves, fails to appear or

with Juveniles,” American Journal of Sociology 70 (September 1964): 206-214.

## POLICE CONDUCT / 23

reappear once the police arrive, or otherwise deliberately avoids contact with the police, there is little an officer can do. These “GOA’s” (gone on arrivals) represent further exercise of discretion by citizens. All we need to note, therefore, is that for every encounter in which it appears that it is possible for a police officer to exercise discretion, there is at least one other that was eliminated by citizen exercise of discretion. When citizens are present, police exercise of discretion is limited by the nature of the problem, police bureaucracy, and citizen preferences. In fact, if we take discretion to refer to an absolute choice between or among two or more mutually exclusive dispositional alternatives, then police patrol officers deal with more problems where only one outcome is possible than problems where several are possible. Service requests involving sick calls, lock-outs, and nonvehicular accidents represent situations where the nature of the problem limits police exercise of discretion. In these situations police patrol officers may alter the quality of the services rendered, but save for the most obnoxious of citizens, they have little choice but to render some degree of service. Alleged felony encounters with a suspect and credible witness or a suspect and sound evidence represent situations where police bureaucracy limits exercise of discretion. Most police organizations and officers are evaluated by reference to felony arrests. Consequently, only naive or very fortunate officers are in a position to routinely release felony suspects. It is probably more accurate to note that meaningful choices simply are not present in this type of encounter.29 In encounters revolving around alleged misdemeanors a legal arrest is possible only if the officer witnesses the incident, or if a citizen witnessing the offense calls the police and is willing to make a citizen’s arrest. Since citizens witness the majority of misdemeanors and because many are not willing to

## 24 / POLICE CONDUCT

inconvenience themselves by reporting a misdemeanor or by making a citizen’s arrest, it should be clear that citizens possess the balance of discretion in this circumstance. Consequently, it is important to recognize that it is only in a minority of encounters that patrol officers are actually free to choose between or among two or more mutually exclusive alternatives. Specifically, absolute discretion exists primarily in encounters involving technical violations of the law wherein suspects are present and other citizens generally are absent. These types of encounters include contacts with juveniles, public drunkenness offenders, and traffic law violators. The basic summary point is that patrol officers are generally constrained in their selection of dispositional alternatives. The factors that limit police discretion include citizen actions occurring in advance of and during an encounter, as well as the nature of the problem, police bureaucracy, and the law. Absolute discretion is present in only a minority of encounters.
     Summary and Conclusions
The essential argument advanced here and in the three chapters that follow is that police patrol behavior is shaped by citizens as well as patrol officers. The kinds of problems police officers are called upon to deal with, the nature of police behavior during encounters, and the dispositional decisions advanced by patrol officers are reflective of the actions and preferences of citizens as well as patrol officers. As is true of all generalizations, however, important exceptions exist. Police officers and their administrative superiors can increase the proactive share of patrol work by increasing traffic or pedestrian stops, working prostitution more aggressively, or more actively patrolling areas known to be frequented by chronic public drunkenness offenders. Similarly, patrol officers can elect to take complete control of their contacts with citizens, thereby placing citizens in even more of a secondary position. Finally, patrol officers can occasionally

choose to ignore bureaucratic pressures or citizen preferences. In these and other ways, police patrol behavior escapes citizen control. The final point, then, is that police patrol work is best understood as a joint product of the actions of patrol officers and citizens. Exceptions exist but, in general, mutual rather than independent action characterizes police patrol behavior. It is this understanding that receives detailed attention in the chapters that follow.
I / T h e Problems
## / PREVIEW OF T H E SELECTIONS

In analyzing the kinds of problems police patrol officers are routinely called upon to deal with three points are most important. First, citizens perceive that many situations require that authority or force of some type be utilized. That is why citizens call the police. Second, police officers are called upon to deal with a wide variety of problems. Third, most of these problems are identified by citizens who use the telephone to call the police. These three points occupy our attention in this first chapter. In the first selection, “The Police Charge,” Egon Bittner suggests that the police privilege to exercise non-negotiable coercive force is what prompts citizens to call the police about a variety of problems. During the course of a working shift police patrol officers may be called upon to deal with barking dogs; automobile accidents; groups of juveniles; husband-wife disputes; noisy parties, radios, and televisions; drunken citizens; and occasionally, criminal incidents. Bittner observes that what lends unity to each of these situations is that forceful actions are required of and undertaken by patrol officers: owners are warned; traffic re-routed; juveniles dispersed; husbands sent out of the house; parties, radios, and televisions quieted; and, infrequently, citizens arrested. Citizens call the police because of their perception that authority or force of some type is required. Selections 2 and 3, “Policing” by Joseph Livermore and “Police Patrol Work: A Comparative Prespective” by Richard J. Lundman, suggest the wide variety of problems patrol officers are called upon to deal with. These selections also estab-

## THE PROBLEMS / 27

lish the extent to which police are dependent upon citizen reports of incidents requiring police presence. Livermore, a law professor, spent three weeks riding in police patrol cars in Minneapolis. “Policing” describes the encounters he observed on two of those days. Notice should be taken of the diversity of the problems handled and the fact that nearly all patrol activities were initiated by citizens. Lundman’s “Police Patrol Work: A Comparative Perspective” describes police work in five different police departments. Although there was some variation dependent upon type of department, slightly over two-thirds of all the encounters were citizen initiated. If police-initiated traffic stops are excluded, nearly 90 percent of all encounters were citizen initiated. This establishes that most police-citizen encounters are initiated by citizens. Missing from these selections, however, is evidence that police patrol officers determine the priority of the problems they deal with and the ways in which they respond. It is important to remember, therefore, that while citizens largely determine the nature of patrol work, the perceived importance and pace of patrol work rests largely in the hands of patrol officers.

## Selection 1. “The Police Charge”

## EG O N B IT T N E R

We have argued earlier that the quest for peace by peaceful means is one of the culture traits of modern civilization. This aspiration is historically unique. For example, the Roman Empire was also committed to the objectives of reducing or eliminating warfare during one period of its existence, but the method chosen to achieve the Pax Romana was, in the language of the poet, debellare superbos, i.e., to subdue the haughty by force. Contrary to this, our commitment to abolish the traffic of violence requires us to pursue the ideal by pacific means. In support of this contention we pointed to the development of an elaborate system of international diplomacy whose main objective it is to avoid war, and to those changes in internal government that resulted in the virtual elimination of all forms of violence, especially in the administration of justice. That is, the overall tendency is not merely to withdraw the basis of legitimacy for all forms of provocative violence, but even from the exercise of provoked force required to meet illegitimate attacks. Naturally this is not possible to a full extent. At least, it has not been possible thus far. Since it is impossible to deprive responsive force entirely of legitimacy, its vestiges require special forms of authorization. Our society recognizes as legitimate three very different forms of responsive force. First, we are authorized to use force for the purpose of selfdefense. Though the laws governing self-defense are far from clear, it appears that an attacked person can counterattack

only after he has exhausted all other means of avoiding harm, including retreat, and that the counterattack may not exceed what is necessary to disable the assailant from carrying out his intent. These restrictions are actually enforceable because harm done in the course of self-defense does furnish grounds for criminal and tort proceedings. It becomes necessary, therefore, to show compliance with these restrictions to rebut the charges of excessive and unjustified force even in self-defense.1 The second form of authorization entrusts the power to proceed coercively to some specifically deputized persons against some specifically named persons. Among the agents who have such highly specific powers are mental hospital attendants and prison guards. Characteristically, such persons use force in carrying out court orders; but they may use force only against named persons who are remanded to their custody and only to the extent required to implement a judicial order of confinement. Of course, like everybody else, they may also act within the provisions governing self-defense. By insisting on the high degree of limited specificity of the powers of custodial staffs, we do not mean to deny that these restrictions are often violated with impunity. The likelihood of such transgressions is enhanced by the secluded character of prisons and mental institutions, but their existence does not impair the validity of our definition. The third way to legitimize the use of responsive force is to institute a police force. Contrary to the cases of self-defense and the limited authorization of custodial functionaries, the police authorization is essentially unrestricted. Because the expression ‘‘essentially” is often used to hedge a point, we will make fully explicit what we mean by it. There exist three formal limitations of the freedom of policemen to use force, which we must admit even though they have virtually no practical consequences. First, the police use of deadly force is limited in most jurisdictions. Though the powers of a policeman in this respect exceed those of citizens, they are limited

nevertheless. For example, in some jurisdictions policemen are empowered to shoot to kill fleeing felony suspects, but not fleeing misdemeanor suspects. It is scarcely necessary to argue that, given the uncertainties involved in defining a delict under conditions of hot pursuit, this could hardly be expected to be an effective limitation.2 Second, policemen may use force only in the performance of their duties and not to advance their own personal interest or the private interests of other persons. Though this is rather obvious, we mention it for the sake of completeness. Third, and this point too is brought up to meet possible objections, policemen may not use force maliciously or frivolously. These three restrictions, and nothing else, were meant by the use of the qualifier “essentially.” Aside from these restrictions there exist no guidelines, no specifiable range of objectives, no limitations of any kind that instruct the policeman what he may or must do. Nor do there exist any criteria that would allow the judgment whether some forceful intervention was necessary, desirable, or proper. And finally, it is exceedingly rare that police actions involving the use of force are actually reviewed and judged by anyone at all. In sum, the frequently heard talk about the lawful use of force by the police is practically meaningless and, because no one knows what is meant by it, so is the talk about the use of minimum force. Whatever vestigial significance attaches to the term “lawful” use of force is confined to the obvious and

2. “A t common law, the rule appears to have been that an officer was entitled to make a reasonable mistake as to whether the victim had committed a felony, but a private person was not so entitled. Thus strict
liability was created for the private arrester, and he could not justifiably kill, if the victim had not actually committed a felony. Several modern cases have imposed this standard of strict liability even upon the officer by conditioning justification of deadly force on the victim’s actually having committed a felony, and a number of states have enacted statutes which appear to adopt this strict liability. However, many jurisdictions, such as California, have homicide statutes which permit the police officer to use deadly force for the arrest of a person ‘charged’ with felony. It has been suggested that this requirement only indicates the necessity for reasonable belief by the officer that the victim has committed a felony.” Ibid., pp. 599-600.

## THE PROBLEMS / 31

unnecessary rule that police officers may not commit crimes of violence. Otherwise, however, the expectation that they may and will use force is left entirely undefined. In fact, the only instructions any policeman ever receives in this respect consist of sermonizing that he should be humane and circumspect, and that he must not desist from what he has undertaken merely because its accomplishment may call for coercive means. We might add, at this point, that the entire debate about the troublesome problem of police brutality will not move beyond its present impasse, and the desire to eliminate it will remain an impotent conceit, until this point is fully grasped and unequivocally admitted. In fact, our expectation that policemen will use force, coupled by our refusals to state clearly what we mean by it (aside from sanctimonious homilies), smacks of more than a bit of perversity. Of course, neither the police nor the public is entirely in the dark about the justifiable use of force by the officers. We had occasion to allude to the assumption that policemen may use force in making arrests. But the benefit deriving from this apparent core of relative clarity is outweighed by its potentially misleading implications. For the authorization of the police to use force is in no important sense related to their duty to apprehend criminals. Were this the case then it could be adequately considered as merely a special case of the same authorization that is entrusted to custodial personnel. It might perhaps be considered a bit more complicated, but essentially of the same nature. But the police authority to use force is radically different from that of a prison guard. Whereas the powers of the latter are incidental to his obligation to implement a legal command, the police role is far better understood by saying that their ability to arrest offenders is incidental to their authority to use force. Many puzzling aspects of police work fall into place when one ceases to look at it as principally concerned with law enforcement and crime control, and only incidentally and often incongruously concerned with an infinite variety of other matters. It makes much more sense to say that the police are nothing else than a mechanism for the distribution of situation-

ally justified force in society. The latter conception is preferable to the former on three grounds. First, it accords better with the actual expectations and demands made of the police (even though it probably conflicts with what most people would say, or expect to hear, in answer to the question about the proper police function); second, it gives a better accounting of the actual allocation of police manpower and other resources; and, third, it lends unity to all kinds of police activity. These three justifications will be discussed in some detail in the following. The American city dweller’s repertoire of methods for handling problems includes one known as “calling the cops.” The practice to which the idiom refers is enormously widespread. Though it is more frequent in some segments of society than in others, there are very few people who do not or would not resort to it under suitable circumstances. A few illustrations will furnish the background for an explanation of what “calling the cops” means.3 Two patrolmen were directed to report to an address located in a fashionable district of a large city. On the scene they were greeted by the lady of the house who complained that the maid had been stealing and receiving male visitors in her quarters. She wanted the maid’s belongings searched and the man removed. The patrolmen refused the first request, promising to forward the complaint to the bureau of detectives, but agreed to see what they could do about the man. After gaining entrance to the maid’s room they compelled a male visitor to leave, drove him several blocks away from the house, and released him with the warning never to return. In a tenement, patrolmen were met by a public health nurse who took them through an abysmally deteriorated apartment inhabited by four young children in the care of an elderly woman. The babysitter resisted the nurse’s earlier attempts to

remove the children. The patrolmen packed the children in the squad car and took them to Juvenile Hall, over the continuing protests of the elderly woman.
    While cruising through the streets a team of detectives recognized a man named in a teletype received from the sheriff
of an adjoining county. The suspect maintained that he was in the hospital at the time the offense alleged in the communication took place and asked the officers to verify his story over their car radio. When he continued to plead innocence he was handcuffed and taken to headquarters. Here the detectives learned that the teletype had been cancelled. Prior to his release the man was told that he could have saved himself grief had he gone along voluntarily.
    In a downtown residential hotel, patrolmen found two ambulance attendants trying to persuade a man, who according
to all accounts was desperately ill, to go to the hospital. After some talk, they helped the attendants in carrying the protesting patient to the ambulance and sent them off.
    In a middle-class neighborhood, patrolmen found a partly
disassembled car, tools, a loudly blaring radio, and five beerdrinking youths at the curb in front of a single-family home. The homeowner complained that this had been going on for several days and the men had refused to take their activities elsewhere. The patrolmen ordered the youths to pack up and leave. When one sassed them they threw him into the squad car, drove him to the precinct station, from where he was released after receiving a severe tongue lashing from the desk sergeant.
    In the apartment of a quarreling couple, patrolmen were
told by the wife, whose nose was bleeding, that the husband stole her purse containing money she earned. The patrolmen told the man they would “take him in,” whereupon he returned the purse and they left.

dispute, police intervention means above all making use of the capacity and authority to overpower resistance to an attempted solution in the native habitat of the problem. There can be no doubt that this feature of police work is uppermost in the minds of people who solicit police aid or direct the attention of the police to problems, that persons against whom the police proceed have this feature in mind and conduct themselves accordingly, and that every conceivable police intervention projects the message that force may be, and may have to be, used to achieve a desired objective. It does not matter whether the persons who seek police help are private citizens or other government officials, nor does it matter whether the problem at hand involves some aspect of law enforcement or is totally unconnected with it. It must be emphasized, however, that the conception of the centrality of the capacity to use force in the police role does not entail the conclusion that the ordinary occupational routines consist of the actual exercise of this capacity. It is very likely, though we lack information on this point, that the actual use of physical coercion and restraint is rare for all policemen and that many policemen are virtually never in the position of having to resort to it. W hat matters is that police procedure is defined by the feature that it may not be opposed in its course, and that force can be used if it is opposed. This is what the existence of the police makes available to society. Accordingly, the question, “W hat are policemen supposed to do?” is almost completely identical with the question, “What kinds of situations require remedies that are non-negotiably coercible?”4
4. By “non-negotiably coercible” we mean that when a deputized police
officer decides that force is necessary, then, within the boundaries of this situation, he is not accountable to anyone, nor is he required to brook the arguments or opposition of anyone who might object to it. W e set forth not as a legal but as a practical rule. The legal question whether citizens may oppose policemen is complicated. Apparently resisting police coercion in situations of emergency is not legitimate; see Hans Kelsen, General Theory of Law and State, N ew York: Russel & Russel, 1961, pp. 278-279, and H . A. L. Hart, The Concept of Law, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1961, pp. 20-21. Common law doctrine allows that citizens may op-

## THE PROBLEMS / 35

Our second justification for preferring the definition of the police role we proposed to the traditional law enforcement focus of the role requires us to review the actual police practices to see to what extent they can be subsumed under the conception we offered. To begin we can take note that law enforcement and crime control are obviously regarded as calling for remedies that are non-negotiably coercible. According to available estimates, approximately one-third of available manpower resources of the police are at any time committed to dealing with crimes and criminals. Though this may seem to be a relatively small share of the total resources of an agency ostensibly devoted to crime control, it is exceedingly unlikely that any other specific routine police activity, such as traffic regulation, crowd control, supervision of licensed establishments, settling of citizens’ disputes, emergency health aids, ceremonial functions, or any other, absorb anywhere near as large a share of the remaining two-thirds. But this is precisely what one would expect on the basis of our definition. Given the likelihood that offenders will seek to oppose apprehension and evade punishment, it is only natural that the initial dealings with them be assigned to an agency that is capable of overcoming these obstacles. That is, the proposed definition of the role of the police as a mechanism for the distribution of non-negotiably copose “unlawful arrest,” 6 Corpus Juris Secundum, Arrest # 1 3 , p. 613; against this, the Uniform Arrest Act, drafted by a committee of the Interstate Commission on Crime in 1939, provides in Section 5, “If a person has reasonable grounds to believe that he is being arrested by a peace officer, it is his duty to refrain from using force or any weapons in resisting arrest regardless of whether or not there is a legal basis for the arrest.” S. B. Warner, “Uniform Arrest A ct,” Vanderbilt Law Review, 28 (1942) 315-347. A t present, at least twelve states are governed by case law recognizing the validity of the Common Law doctrine, at least five have adopted the rule contained in the Uniform Arrest Act, and at least six have case law or statutes that give effect to the Uniform Arrest A ct rule. That the trend is away from the Common Law doctrine and in the direction of the Uniform Arrest A ct rule is argued in Max Hochanadel and H. W . Stege, “The Right to Resist an Unlawful Arrest: An Outdated Concept?” Tulsa Law Journal, 3 (1966) 40-46. I am grateful for the help I received from 35 of the 50 State Attorney General Offices from whom I sought information concerning this matter.

## 36 / POLICE CONDUCT

ercive remedies entails the priority of crime control by direct inference. Beyond that, however, the definition also encompasses other types of activities, albeit at lower level of priority. Because the idea that the police are basically a crimefighting agency has never been challenged in the past, no one has troubled to sort out the remaining priorities. Instead, the police have always been forced to justify activities that did not involve law enforcement in the direct sense by either linking them constructively to law enforcement or by defining them as nuisance demands for service. The dominance of this view, especially in the minds of policemen, has two pernicious consequences. First, it leads to a tendency to view all sorts of problems as if they involved culpable offenses and to an excessive reliance on quasi-legal methods for handling them. The widespread use of arrests without intent to prosecute exemplifies this state of affairs. These cases do not involve errors in judgment about the applicability of a penal norm but deliberate pretense resorted to because more appropriate methods of handling problems have not been developed. Second, the view that crime control is the only serious, important, and necessary part of police work has deleterious effects on the morale of those police officers in the uniformed patrol who spend most of their time with other matters. No one, especially he who takes a positive interest in his work, likes being obliged to do things day-in and day-out that are disparaged by his colleagues. Moreover, the low evaluation of these duties leads to neglecting the development of skill and knowledge that are required to discharge them properly and efficiently. It remains to be shown that the capacity to use coercive force lends thematic unity to all police activity in the same sense in which, let us say, the capacity to cure illness lends unity to everything that is ordinarily done in the field of medical practice. While everybody agrees that the police actually engage in an enormous variety of activities, only a part of which involves law enforcement, many argue that this state of affairs does not require explanation but change. Smith, for example, argued that the imposition of duties and demands that are not related to crime control dilutes the effectiveness of the

## THE PROBLEMS / 37

police and that the growing trend in this direction should be curtailed and even reversed.5 On the face of it this argument is not without merit, especially if one considers that very many of those activities that are unrelated to law enforcement involve dealing with problems that lie in the field of psychiatry, social welfare, human relations, education, and so on. Each of these fields has its own trained specialists who are respectively more competent than the police. It would seem preferable, therefore, to take all those matters that belong properly to other specialists out of the hands of the police and turn them over to those to whom they belong. Not only would this relieve some of the pressures that presently impinge on the police, but it would also result in better services.6 Unfortunately, this view overlooks a centrally important factor. While it is true that policemen often aid sick and troubled people because physicians and social workers are unable or unwilling to take their services where they are needed, this is not the only or even the main reason for police involvement. In fact, physicians and social workers themselves quite often “call the cops.” For not unlike the case of the administration of justice, on the periphery of the rationally ordered procedures of medical and social work practice lurk exigencies that call for the exercise of coercion. Since neither physicians nor social workers are authorized or equipped to use force to attain desirable objectives, the total disengagement of the police would mean allowing many a problem to move unhampered in the direction of disaster. But the non-law-enforcement activities of the police are by no means confined to matters that are wholly or even mainly within the purview of some other institutionalized remedial specialty. Many, perhaps most, consist of addressing situations in which people simply do not seem to be able to manage their own lives adequately. Nor is it to be taken for granted that these situations invariably call

for the use, or the threat of the use, of force. It is enough if there is need for immediate and unquestioned intervention that must not be allowed to be defeated by possible resistance. And where there is a possibility of great harm, the intervention would appear to be justified even if the risk is, in statistical terms, quite remote. Take, for instance, the presence of mentally ill persons in the community. Though it is well known that most live quiet and unobtrusive lives, they are perceived as occasionally constituting a serious hazard to themselves and others. Thus, it is not surprising that the police are always prepared to deal with these persons at the slightest indication of a possible emergency. Similarly, though very few family quarrels lead to serious consequences, the fact that most homicides occur among quarreling kin leads to the preparedness to intervene at the incipient stages of problems. In sum, the role of the police is to address all sorts of human problems when and insofar as their solutions do or may possibly require the use of force at the point of their occurrence. This lends homogeneity to such diverse procedures as catching a criminal, driving the mayor to the airport, evicting a drunken person from a bar, directing traffic, crowd control, taking care of lost children, administering medical first aid, and separating fighting relatives. There is no exaggeration in saying that there is topical unity in this very incomplete list of lines of police work. Perhaps it is true that the common practice of assigning policemen to chauffeur mayors is based on the desire to give the appearance of thrift in the urban fisc. But note, if one wanted to make as far as possible certain that nothing would ever impede His Honor’s freedom of movement, he would certainly put someone into the driver’s seat of the auto who has the authority and the capacity to overcome all unforeseeable human obstacles. Similarly, it is perhaps not too farfetched to assume that desk sergeants feed ice cream to lost children because they like children. But if the treat does not achieve the purpose of keeping the youngster in the station house until his parents arrive to redeem him, the sergeant would have to resort to other means of keeping him there.

## THE PROBLEMS / 39

We must now attempt to pull together the several parts of the foregoing discussion in order to show how they bring into relief the main problems of adjusting police function to life in modern society, and in order to elaborate constructively certain consequences that result from the assumption of the role definitions we have proposed. At the beginning we observed that the police appear to be burdened by an opprobrium that did not seem to lessen proportionately to the acknowledged improvements in their practices. To explain this puzzling fact we drew attention to three perceived features of the police that appear to be substantially independent of particular work methods. First, a stigma attaches to police work because of its connection with evil, crime, perversity, and disorder. Though it may not be reasonable, it is common that those who fight the dreadful end up being dreaded themselves. Second, because the police must act quickly and often on mere intuition, their interventions are lacking in those aspects of moral sophistication which only a more extended and more scrupulous consideration can afford. Hence their methods are comparatively crude. Third, because it is commonly assumed that the risks of the kinds of breakdowns that require police action are much more heavily concentrated in the lower classes than in other segments of society, police surveillance is inherently discriminatory. That is, all things being equal, some persons feel the sting of police scrutiny merely because of their station in life. Insofar as this is felt, police work has divisive effects in society. Next, we argued that one cannot understand how the police “found themselves” in this unenviable position without taking into consideration that one of the cultural trends of roughly the past century-and-a-half was the sustained aspiration to install peace as a stable condition of everyday life. Though no one can fail being impressed by the many ways the attainment of this ideal has been frustrated, it is possible to find some evidence of partially effective efforts. Many aspects of mundane existence in our cities have become more pacific than they have been in past epochs of history. More importantly for our purposes, in the domain of internal statecraft, the distance be-

## 40 / POLICE CONDUCT

tween those who govern and those who are governed has grown and the gap has been filled with bureaucratically symbolized communication. Where earlier compliance was secured by physical presence and armed might, it now rests mainly on peaceful persuasion and rational compliance. We found the trend toward the pacification in governing most strongly demonstrated in the administration of justice. The banishment of all forms of violence from the criminal process, as administered by the courts, has as a corollary the legalization of judicial proceedings. The latter reflects a movement away from peremptory and oracular judgment to a method in which all decisions are based on exhaustively rational grounds involving the use of explicit legal norms. Most important among those norms are the ones that limit the powers of authority and specify the rights of defendants. The legalization and pacification of the criminal process was achieved by, among other things, expelling from its purview those processes that set it into motion. Since in the initial steps, where suspicions are formed and arrests are made, force and intuition cannot be eliminated entirely, purity can be maintained by not taking notice of them. This situation is, however, paradoxical if we are to take seriously the idea that the police is a law enforcement agency in the strict sense of legality. The recognition of this paradox became unavoidable as early as in 1914, in the landmark decision of Weeks v. U.S. In the following decades the United States Supreme Court issued a series of rulings affecting police procedure which foster the impression that the judiciary exercises control over the police. But this impression is misleading, for the rulings do not set forth binding norms for police work but merely provide that if the police propose to set the criminal process into motion, then they must proceed in certain legally restricted ways. These restrictions are, therefore, conditional, specifying as it were the terms of delivery and acceptance of a service and nothing more. Outside of this arrangement the judges have no direct concerns with police work and will take notice of its illegality, if it is illegal, only when offended citizens seek civil redress.

## THE PROBLEMS / 41

Because only a small part of the activity of the police is dedicated to law enforcement and because they deal with the majority of their problems without invoking the law, a broader definition of their role was proposed. After reviewing briefly what the public appears to expect of the police, the range of activities police actually engage in, and the theme that unifies all these activities, it was suggested that the role of the police is best understood as a mechanism for the distribution of nonnegotiably coercive force employed in accordance voith the dictates of an intuitive grasp of situational exigencies. It is, of course, not surprising that a society committed to the establishment of peace by pacific means and to the abolishment of all forms of violence from the fabric of its social relations, at least as a matter of official morality and policy, would establish a corps of specially deputized officials endowed with the exclusive monopoly of using force contingently where limitations of foresight fail to provide alternatives. That is, given the melancholy appreciation of the fact that the total abolition of force is not attainable, the closest approximation to the ideal is to limit it as a special and exclusive trust. If it is the case, however, that the mandate of the police is organized around their capacity and authority to use force, i.e., if this is what the institution’s existence makes available to society, then the evaluation of that institution’s performance must focus on it. While it is quite true that policemen will have to be judged on other dimensions of competence, too—for example, the exercise of force against criminal suspects requires some knowledge about crime and criminal law—their methods as society’s agents of coercion will have to be considered central to the overall judgment. The proposed definition of the police role entails a difficult moral problem. How can we arrive at a favorable or even accepting judgment about an activity which is, in its very conception, opposed to the ethos of the polity that authorizes it? Is it not well nigh inevitable that this mandate be concealed in circumlocution? While solving puzzles of moral philosophy is beyond the scope of this analysis, we will have to address

## 42 / POLICE CONDUCT

this question in a somewhat more mundane formulation: namely, on what terms can a society dedicated to peace institutionalize the exercise of force? It appears that in our society two answers to this question are acceptable. One defines the targets of legitimate force as enemies and the coercive advance against them as warfare. Those who wage this war are expected to be possessed by the military virtues of valor, obedience, and esprit de corps. The enterprise as a whole is justified as a sacrificial and glorious mission in which the warrior’s duty is “not to reason why.” The other answer involves an altogether different imagery. The targets of force are conceived as practical objectives and their attainment a matter of practical expediency. The process involves prudence, economy, and considered judgment, from case to case. The enterprise as a whole is conceived as a public trust, the exercise of which is vested in individual practitioners who are personally responsible for their decisions and actions. Reflection suggests that the two patterns are profoundly incompatible. Remarkably, however, our police departments have not been deterred from attempting the reconciliation of the irreconciliable. Thus, our policemen are exposed to the demand of a conflicting nature in that their actions are supposed to reflect military prowess and professional acumen.

of five precincts within the city. The officers meet at the precinct station for roll call before they begin their shift. Roll call is an informal affair at which the presiding officer advises the patrolmen of crimes occurring in the precinct during the past 24 hours and of any possible unusual demands for police services (such as a school dance at which trouble is feared) expected during the coming shift. In addition, the patrolmen are given a fresh list of unrecovered stolen cars and the names of people wanted on new felony warrants. Roll call usually takes from ten to twenty minutes. Once the squad car is on the street, the officers take their instructions from a downtown radio dispatcher. The police radio in Minneapolis operates on three frequencies with three dispatchers, one servicing precincts two and four, another three and five, and another, headquarters or the first precinct. Calls for police service reach the dispatcher in two ways, either by a direct call to the police emergency number in the radio room or by referral from a precinct desk officer who has received a citizen’s call. In both cases, the call is recorded with an abbreviated description of the problem (such as “kids disturbing”) on a card which is handed to the dispatcher. He dispatches the squad car responsible for the district in which the problem exists. If the district squad is busy on another call, the dispatcher, depending on the urgency of the call, may send some other car to handle the call. A typical call by the dispatcher with responses from the squad car is:
    Dispatcher: “555.”
    Squad car 555: “555.”
    Dispatcher: “Car 555 g o to 34—1st A ven u e, dom estic.”
    Squad Car 555: “34—1st A ven u e, dom estic.”
In short, the officers responding to a radio call have only the tersest description of what it is they are expected to handle. Most patrolmen operate on three shifts—midnight to 8:00 a .m ., 8:00 a . m . to 4:00 p. m . and 4:00 p . m . to midnight—rotating shifts at the start of each month. Additional patrolmen, however, are on the street in the evening hours when the demand for police service peaks. These patrolmen start their

shift at 6:00 p.m ., 7:00 p. m . or 8:00 p. m . It is with this evening shift that I spent my time. In addition to these regular precinct shifts, there is a tactical squad of about fifteen cars that is on the street each evening except Sunday.1 They generally take regular calls when the district cars are overloaded, but they are available for use anywhere in the city should serious trouble develop requiring more force than the precinct is able to bring to bear. Also on the street are two cars responsible for making accident reports in traffic accidents involving personal injuries. The material that follows describes the calls and other matters handled by [one] . . . squad car. . . . Much of the time, of course, the officers are simply cruising, looking for traffic violations, stolen cars or unsecured businesses. Where the car was dispatched by radio, I begin by quoting the dispatcher’s instructions.

1. If common hearsay, both police and non-police, is even partially true,
the tactical squad in Minneapolis as well as other cities seems to have had a much higher proportion of instances of abusive police practices. (Complaints against tactical squad members have recently declined in Minneapolis because of the appointment of additional supervisory personnel.) In part this must derive from the fact that they are a separate force, selfperceived to be an elite corps of “super-cops,” sometimes “unleashed” to handle particularly difficult problems. The legal niceties are least likely to be observed by those who are assigned as a special unit to prevent the spread of riot or rebellion. Since that use of their services is rare, and since there appears to be a carryover of aggressiveness in other contexts where its appropriateness is not even arguably proper, it would be wise in my view to make institutional changes to minimize the dangers of such abuse. I would suggest that the tactical squad be a group of officers, otherwise permanently assigned to precincts, trained to handle crowds or large disturbances and available for quick dispatch to such occurrences. The remainder of their time could be spent in routine backup patrol in the precincts to which they were assigned and to which their primary allegiance would be owed.

lies about a mile south of downtown Minneapolis. In recent years, the northern two-thirds of 555’s district has become an area inhabited largely by young single men and women, many of whom hail from rural areas. Older large homes have been converted into apartments or flats. New apartment buildings, both low and high rent, have been erected. A number of old and less expensive apartment buildings also lie within the district. The southern third of the district is similar to most of South Minneapolis. It consists almost wholly of single family dwellings of a value of $15,000 to $25,000. The demand for police service in this section of the district is slight. The northern two-thirds of the district, however, furnishes enough calls to make 555 one of the busiest cars in the city. In addition, since several major streets run through the district, and since many inhabitants of the district are young, traffic enforcement occupies much of the car’s time on the street.

8:30 Customer trouble at a Dairy Queen on Lake Street. On arrival, it was learned that no call had been placed by the proprietor. The dispatcher was so advised.

away with that. While they were not married, they had lived together for eight years and had four children. One officer said to him, “It is no way to handle it by hitting her. Don’t you agree?” The man said no, he did not agree. The officers asked the girl if she wanted to press charges. She said she was afraid to. The man asked if he could leave. The officers said that he could. As he left, he told the officers to watch their houses because he was going to burn them down. The girl was taken back to the restaurant. She was asked if she wished to press charges. She replied, “If I press charges, he’ll just come back and beat me up again.” The officer responded, “Well, that’s the chance you have to take. If he does, we’ll arrest him again. This way is no good either.” Although the girl was reluctant to take any action, the officers made an assault report so that a detective would see her in a couple of days after she had had an opportunity to think over her situation.3 9:10 10—W. Lake, silent alarm.4 There was no evidence of a break-in, and we left after the alarm company employee arrived. 9:12 Dean Boulevard and Lake, P.I.

3. I have not reported generally the time it takes for the officers to complete a call. This can vary tremendously. If only some form of counseling is required, a call usually takes ten to fifteen minutes. W hen it becomes slightly more involved, as in the call just described, it can take up
to thirty minutes or more. If an arrest is necessary, the officers may be “off the air” and unable to provide police service for up to two hours or more. This will depend on the length of time, if any, that they have to wait for a tow truck to remove the car of the person arrested and on the number and complexity of the reports they have to complete as a consequence of the booking. Efforts to reduce the time an officer is not “on the street,” largely a technical matter, are much needed.

no one was injured, and advised the dispatcher that no ambulance was necessary. One of the cars involved in the accident, although seriously damaged, had left the scene, a woman driving. The license number of the car had been obtained. The traffic car then arrived and made the hit-and-run report. We drove around the area and, at 9:35, located the hit-and-run car. A tow was obtained, and the car was held for investigation by the hit-and-run squad.5 9:55 Two cars drag-racing on Lake Street were stopped. Although no clocking had been obtained, they were tagged for speeding at 40+ miles per hour.6 10:00 28th and ^Oakland, car prowler at railroad bridge. We learned that the “prowler’' was the owner who had locked his keys in the car.
10:25 A car tagged for running a stop sign.
10:35 35—Harriet, light on in an unoccupied house. We checked the exterior, finding no sign of a break-in. A neighbor let us in the house, and again there was no visible indication of entry. The light was turned off, and we left.
10:50 A car was tagged for an illegal U-turn.
10:57 12—West Lake, silent alarm. There was no visible sign of entry. We left after so advising the dispatcher and learning that an alarm company employee was on his way.

In the unusual case of a tag without a clocking, such as the one described, something extra is usually present. Here the offense occurred on Lake Street, where drag-racing has become widespread and is the subject of much complaint to the police. Second, the cars involved in this case were particularly flagrant racers, squealing rubber for half a block.

11:00 27—Blaisdell, Apt.—, harassment. We were met by a very upset man of about 35. He told us that he believed that he and his wife were being harassed by her ex-husband. Two years before, when this couple was dating, the ex-husband had threatened to kill the man if he continued to see his ex-wife. Then, after they were married, the man’s car had been burned under circumstances suggesting the ex-husband’s participation. This night, the couple had suddenly been deluged with chicken, pizza, hamburgers and such, all of which had been ordered by phone for delivery but none of which had been ordered by them. In addition, they had received threatening phone calls. There was no evidence, other than inferential, as to who might have been the cause of this trouble. The complaining husband was very distraught, saying such things as, “I’m not going to stand for this. I’ll run him through with a knife. I just can’t take this.” The officers, though very sympathetic, could only suggest getting an unlisted phone and offer to drive by his car several times during the course of the evening to insure that it had not been tampered with.
11:30 A car was stopped, and its driver was advised that he had no tail lights.
     1:05 A car was tagged for parking next to a fire hydrant.
1:20 26—Hennepin, check a drunk. No drunk was in sight when we arrived. W e so advised the dispatcher and left.

I’ll take that car away from you.”8 10:02 Lyndale and Lake, DK (drunk) on the bus bench. We located a 19 year old girl who appeared to have passed out on the bench. It was immediately evident, however, that she was not drunk, although she was giving a good performance of drunkenness. At first, she refused to talk to the officers except to say that she wanted to go to jail. Eventually, it was learned that she wanted to escape her drunken, assaultive husband. “I just want a good night’s sleep,” she said. The officers advised her that if she went to jail she would not be able to sleep because of the noise coming from the drunk tank. They suggested that she go rent a hotel room. She said that she couldn’t afford that. One of the officers then said that if she couldn’t afford a hotel room, she surely could not afford a $25 fine for being drunk. Some helpful bystanders offered to let her sleep in their homes for the night, but she turned those offers down. 10:27 In front of the Silver Dollar Bar, PD (property damage automobile accident). A squad car had been hit by another car. An accident report was prepared. 11:13 25—Dupont, loud party. We were advised by the owner of the home next door that the boys who rented the house were always having parties that lasted long into the night and prevented residents from sleeping. By the time we arrived, however, the boys were gone and the house was empty. We listened, at first sympathetically and then not so sympa7.

The woman was advised to call the police the next time such things happened. 11:13 33—Humboldt, loud radio. Although we received this call at the same time as the call on Dupont, it was 11:40 before we were able to answer it. By that time, we could hear no loud radio in the neighborhood. 11:52 W e were stopped at Blaisdell and Lake by a man who informed us that a bystander had left the license number of a hit-and-run car that had run into his car. We obtained the name of the person to whom that license had been issued and gave it to the man. 12:30 34—Grand, suspicious car. We located the car in question and determined that the occupant was only waiting for the owner of the nearby house to return from work. 12:33 29—Bryant, sick person.

We were also told by a passing police officer that this had happened before and that the driver did indeed have a license but that the state agency could never locate it. We allowed the driver to go with that police officer to his home and obtain his license. He was, however, given a tag for running a red light.

Fundamental to both the research of social scientists and the decisions of police administrators are accurate descriptions of the types of problems police patrol officers confront. For social scientists interested in police research, descriptions of police patrol work sensitize data collection by alerting researchers to the types of problems routinely handled by patrol officers. Police administrators, faced with limited training hours and recurrent personnel shortages, also can benefit from accurate accounts of the types of problems officers confront while on patrol. In the past, however, available descriptions of the nature of police patrol work have been somewhat less than satisfactory. Studies have typically been concerned with a single police jurisdiction thereby limiting the generalizability of the results.2 In other studies, particularistic classificatory schemes have interfered with the easy comparison of the results of various studies.3 Moreover, existing studies have generally foPrepared especially for this volume.

cussed on large, urban departments with a corresponding loss of knowledge of patrol activities in suburban and other types of police jurisdictions.4 Finally, comparative data have only infrequently been reported within the confines of a single study.5 For these reasons it has heretofore been difficult to obtain comparative descriptions of police patrol work. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to provide a comparative perspective on police patrol work. Toward that end, comparative data descriptive of police patrol work in five different police jurisdictions are presented.

tive observational study of police in a city of more than 500,000 (“Midwest City”) and in two suburbs of that city (“Smithville” and “Pinewood”). A group of observers, trained over 3 months, traveled with police on a random-time sample basis, using portable electronic coding equipment and an interaction process code. In all, slightly over 3,300 police- or citizen-initiated mobilizations involving about 9,000 citizens were observed.7 During the course of this research we obtained comparative data descriptive of police patrol work in one large urban department and two suburban jurisdictions. Data descriptive of police patrol work in two other jurisdictions also were collected. During January 1974 a participantas-observer8 spent a total of 192 hours with state police troopers assigned to a station in a small eastern state (“East Coast State Police”). The area served by this station was a mixture of urban and rural, and the observer was present during a total of 150 encounters involving about 350 citizens. The observer sampled all shifts although special emphasis was given to the 3-11 p. m . shift. Data also were collected from June through August 1975 in a township department serving a generally urban area of a large eastern state (“Township Department”). Here the observer9 spent a total of 320 hours observing officers on all shifts. The observer was present during 168 encounters involving over 400 citizens.

7. Unlike previous papers, all mobilizations are counted including those
where a citizen was not present. These “gone on arrival” mobilizations are included in order to render a more accurate portrait of police patrol work.

## Results

In order to ease internal comparisons of the data, and to facilitate comparison with other studies, the problems patrol officers encountered in each of these five departments were coded into one of six mutually exclusive categories. The first, “information gathering,” includes calls to take a report of a criminal incident, calls about missing persons and collection of property, and calls to “see the person.,, “Service” calls include vehicular and non-vehicular accidents, lock-outs, and assists of elderly persons. Calls involving “order maintenance” included barking dogs, loud parties, televisions, or radios; domestic disturbances; juvenile disturbances; landlord-tenant, custbmerproprietor, or neighbor disputes; and public drunkenness. “Law enforcement” problems included assaults, robberies, burglaries, auto thefts, larceny, homicides, rape, and certain less serious offenses including simple assaults. “Traffic” problems included both moving and parking violations. Lastly, there was an “other” or miscellaneous category which included a variety of infrequent problems, such as assisting military police with AWOL and transporting witnesses to court.10 In addition, problems were classified as reactive or citizen initiated versus proactive or police initiated.

## Types of Activities

As can be seen in Table 1.1, the single most frequent type of activity overall was law enforcement. Thus, slightly less than a third of all the activities observed involved criminal incidents. There are, however, several important differences in the frequency of law enforcement encounters dependent upon type of department. Police officers in the Midwest City Urban Department and the Township Department dealt with more criminal incidents than did their colleagues in the suburban

10. As compared to other types of organizations, the constant availability
of the police is probably a factor in this type of encounter.

and state police departments. Reflective of annual crime statistics, these data also suggest the higher incidence of serious crime in urban as compared to suburban or rural areas.11 Overall, then, law enforcement activities were the single most frequent patrol activity. Order maintenance activities also occupied a significant proportion of police time, although they were less frequent than criminal incidents. As noted, the problems that give rise to these activities range from barking dogs to disturbances by juveniles, and together they accounted for about one-quarter of all activities. Once again though, there are several differences in the frequency of order maintenance activities when examined by type of department. Specifically one of the suburban departments, Pinewood, and the East Coast Stat£ Police Station show considerably lower rates of order maintenance activities than do the other departments. In the case of Pinewood it is unlikely that the lower rate of order maintenance problems reflects a real difference in the incidence of this type of problem. Instead, it is probable that this difference reflects an unwillingness or reluctance of Pinewood residents to report order maintenance problems to the police. The comparatively lower rate of order maintenance problems encountered by the East Coast State Police reflects the operational mandate of this department. Specifically, the state police possessed primary responsibility for traffic offenses occurring on state and interstate highways, and residual responsibility for other types of incidents. In practice, the state police officers monitored the radios of city and county departments and encouraged citizens to ignore local departments by reporting all incidents directly to the state police.12 Many citizens, however, continued to rely upon their local departments, thereby reducing the total

offenses known by urban, suburban, and rural police departments.
12. This policy was, of course, a source of friction between the departments involved. A t the time of the research, however, the dispute had
not been resolved and it was not unusual to have state, county, and municipal squads respond to an incident.

## 58 / POLICE CONDUCT

volume of order maintenance problems handled by the East Coast State Police. Moving and parking violations were the third most frequent type of problem handled, accounting for slightly over onefifth of all incidents. Because traffic violations are so frequent,13 and because departments differ in the emphasis given traffic violations,14 there were significant differences in the incidence of traffic violations handled by the various departments. Slightly over half of the problems handled by the Pinewood department, for example, involved traffic violations. This department had a reputation for working traffic aggressively, and officers routinely made large numbers of traffic stops when not assigned other calls. Moreover, the money derived from traffic violations was an important source of income for Pinewood and officers routinely issued large numbers of citations. It is important to recognize, therefore, that the _high rate of traffic violation encounters in Pinewood occurred not because Pinewood residents were poor drivers. Instead, this rate is simply reflective of the importance given traffic violations by the Pinewood police department. The rates of traffic law violation encounters in the other four departments are essentially similar, although there remains some variation attributable to departmental policies. Thus, the mandate of the East Coast State Police Station and the emphasis given to working traffic in the Township Department resulted in comparatively higher rates of traffic encounters in these two departments. In service-oriented Smithville, by contrast, officers were not encouraged to work traffic except as a method of increasing positive public attitudes toward the police. As a consequence, when Smithville officers made traffic stops they did so with the intent of educating the offending motorist. Moreover, citations were issued only for

flagrant or dangerous offenses. Lastly, the Midwest City officers resisted working traffic, which is reflected in the comparatively lower rate of traffic violation encounters.15 On the aggregate level, service encounters were the fourth most frequent type of encounter, accounting for about oneeighth of all patrol activities. Furthermore, the incidence of service encounters was nearly equal in the Midwest City, Pinewood, and East Coast State Police departments. The two exceptions are the Smithville and Township departments which displayed comparatively higher and lower rates of service encounters, respectively. Both exceptions are largely attributable to departmental policies. The Smithville police served an affluent suburb of Midwest City, and residents expected a high level of service from their police officers. Moreover, the director of public safety in Smithville saw service as one of the important components of the mission of the Smithville police. Finally, Smithville squad cars carried special emergency equipment including oxygen, and hence responded to all injuries and accidents. For these reasons, slightly less than a quarter of all Smithville police activities were service oriented. In the area served by the Township Department there was less citizen consensus regarding the police mission. Also, service was not as important a component of the police mission as compared to Smithville. Finally, since there was a higher incidence of law enforcement activities, Township officers had less time to devote to service matters. Information-gathering activities, with the exception of those concerning the East Coast State Police Station, were relatively infrequent accounting for less than 10 percent of all encounters. In general, these are calls to take a report of a criminal incident where the violator is no longer at the scene of the alleged incident. Analysis of the higher rate of informationgathering activities by the State Police officers reveals that these were primarily calls to construction sites to take theft

## 60 / POLICE CONDUCT

reports. In addition, there were several follow-up calls for previous offenses. Least frequent were a variety of miscellaneous or “other” activities. These calls are generally peripheral to the basic police mission and are a function of the constant availability of police organizations as compared to other types of public and private service organizations. In general, then, police officers in all five departments are responsible for a variety of essentially similar activities. There are, however, several important sources of variation. Type of department is important since officers in urban departments are more frequently involved in criminal incidents than are those in suburban or partially rural departments. Departmental policies are also an important source of variation as indicated by the emphasis given service in Smithville and traffic violations in Pinewood. Perhaps most important, though, is citizen willingness to call the police. This issue is explored next.
     Police- Versus Citizen-Initiated Activities
Although it might appear that police patrol officers initiate the majority of encounters with citizens, it is much more accurate to conceive of police organizations as highly dependent upon citizen inputs. Police patrol officers, for example, are legally constrained from proactive observation of private places such as homes or apartments unless they have reason to believe that a felony has been or is about to be committed. Moreover, they are consensually constrained from routine proactive observation of semi-public places such as restaurants and bars.10 Proactive observation, therefore, is generally limited to public places such as parks and sidewalks and it is rarely productive of serious criminality. The extent of police dependence upon citizens is clear in

Table 1.2. With the exception of Pinewood,17 citizens initiated approximately two-thirds of police patrol activities in each of the departments. In addition, for all the specific types of activities save traffic violations,18 citizens initiated the majority. The actual degree of police dependence upon citizen inputs, however, is partially masked in Table 1.2 because of the inclusion of traffic violations. As noted, this type of activity is highly dependent upon departmental policies. In order to achieve a more accurate description it is necessary to eliminate traffic activities. Table 1.3 excludes traffic activities thereby permitting a more accurate assessment of the origins of police patrol work. As is clear when traffic violation activities are excluded, nearly nine out of every ten police-citizen encounters are citizen initiated. In general, then, police officers in all five departments are highly dependent upon citizen reports of criminal incidents and other matters requiring police presence. This is especially the case if police-initiated traffic violations are excluded since it is then clear that nearly 90 percent of police patrol activities are initiated by citizens who use the telephone to call the police.
     Discussion and Conclusion
As noted at the outset, accurate descriptions of the types of problems police officers handle are useful for both researchers interested in the police and police administrators. For researchers it would appear that this research has several implications. Minimally, researchers must be prepared to describe the diversity of police patrol work. Moreover, researchers must be sen17. This exception is a function of the higher rate of proactive order maintenance encounters in Pinewood. This supports the earlier assertion that there is no absolute difference in the incidence of this problem in Pinewood compared to the other muncipalities.
18. An exception is the East Coast State Police who initiated a majority
of their order maintenance encounters. Most of these involved hitchhiking and other highway-related incidents.

sitive to departmental policies regarding traffic violations and the provision of services to citizens as important sources of this diversity. Researchers also must be sensitive to community expectations regarding police activities and to the ways in which these community sentiments are translated into citizen and police actions. In all, the researcher must be prepared to render a complex, multi-dimensional portrait of police patrol work. For police administrators the implications of this research are more numerous and potentially more troublesome. It appears that the expense of routine patrol and the personnel required cannot be justified by reference to the detection of serious crimes or the apprehension of violators. Indeed, it is a rare event when a patrol officer proactively discovers a felony in progress and arrests a violator. As a consequence, it appears that police administrators must document the deterrent effect of routine patrol or demonstrate that response times would be seriously affected in order to continue to devote large portions of their budgets and personnel to routine patrol.
    In addition, it appears that this research should occasion review of departmental policies in the areas of traffic violations
and the provision of services to citizens. Unlike other types of police patrol activities, the provision of service and, especially, the importance given traffic violations are under the control of police administrators rather than citizens. Both, therefore, are areas for either increases or decreases in police patrol activity. Ideally, the changes made would be based upon sound evidence that traffic activities reduce accidents or fatalities19 or that other agencies cannot, or will not, provide the services currently rendered by patrol officers. Minimally, however, past practices in each of these two areas should not remain unexamined.
    Finally, it should be clear that in all communities citizens are
a rich source of information for the police since it is they who provide police with the bulk of criminal and other incidents. In addition, recent research has indicated that many citizens do

19. Such evidence is not likely to be forthcoming. See Ross.

## THE PROBLEMS / 65

not bother to report criminal incidents to the police.20 The temptation, of course, is to encourage citizens to call the police thereby increasing the volume of offenses known to the police. What must be recognized, though, is that if budgets, training programs, and personnel remain unchanged while citizens are encouraged to make even greater use of the police, more problems than solutions are likely to emerge. Once again, rational, conscious decisions are necessary. In conclusion, however, it must be emphasized that even though comparative data have been reported, it is unlikely that they apply in their specifics to departments other than the ones in which they were collected. It is incumbent upon researchers and administrators to continue to collect and report data such as these to facilitate and encourage informed decision making.

X / T h e Encounter
    I PREVIEW OF T H E SELECTIONS
In analyzing police-citizen encounters two points are most important. First, encounters are under the ultimate control of patrol officers rather than citizens. Officers either take charge or stand ready to take charge of encounters in order to protect themselves or respect for police authority. Second, citizen control over encounters occurs within limits imposed by patrol officers and is thus indirect or residual. It exists because patrol officers are dependent upon citizens for information, and because patrol officers shape their actions in response to the actions of citizens. These two points occupy our attention in this second chapter. Selection 4, “Cop’s Rules” by Jonathan Rubinstein establishes that encounters are under the ultimate control of patrol officers rather than citizens. At the outset of each encounter patrol officers seek to ensure that citizens do not possess weapons. They also position themselves in ways that give them a physical advantage over citizens. And, throughout the entire encounter officers remain ready to assert or reassert police authority. Rubinstein’s description of “cop’s rules” thus emphasizes police control over encounters. Selection 5, “Police-Citizen Encounters: A Field Test of Exchange Theory” by Mary Glenn Wiley and Terry L. Hudik, demonstrates that police dependence upon citizens for information restores some controlling power to citizens. Wiley and Hudik note that patrol officers use field interrogations to gather information from citizens. The field interrogation, however, is a “very touchy” type of encounter since citizens do not know why they are being asked for information, or do not place much value in the reasons police give for seeking

## THE ENCOUNTER / 67

such information. The result is that citizens withhold information, simultaneously restoring their control over encounters and making routine policing more difficult. Wiley and Hudik then hypothesize that the tensions surrounding field interrogations can be reduced by providing citizens with an explanation of why they are being asked for information. They also hypothesize that tensions are less when the reasons given for seeking information coincide with citizen conceptions of appropriate police activities. Both hypotheses are supported, demonstrating that citizen control over encounters is residually present, but that it can be manipulated by patrol officers. Selection 6, “Deference Exchange in Police-Civilian Encounters” by Richard E. Sykes and John P. Clark, considers the rule-governed nature of police-citizen encounters. Sykes and Clark argue that an asymmetrical status norm governs many encounters, such that police officers display respect at a point just below the level of respect offered by citizens. This selection also demonstrates that citizens control encounters in an indirect ,or residual manner.

The policeman’s principal tool is his body. He shares with many persons the use of their bodies as a piece of equipment essential to the performance of their trades. He is similar to a mountain climber; to athletes whose success is rooted in physical prowess rather than the skillful use of equipment; to runners, circus acrobats, sexual performers, laborers, and peasants. He also has, in common with people in many trades, a set of skills that are needed for the effective use of tools expressly provided to expand the effectiveness of his body. For him a gun and a nightstick are not simply weapons that terrify some and intrigue others but extensions of himself whose use (and non-use) is linked to his notions about how he uses his body to do his work. But unlike anyone else whose body is the tool of his trade, the policeman uses his to control other people.1 Despite careful restrictions designed to establish firmly the boundaries of his authority, the policeman is endowed with quite extraordinary power. Even in communities where there is intense conflict between policemen and citizens, there is little resistance to the notion that there ought to be people patrolling the streets, licensed to regulate public traffic and even forcibly to restrict and restrain people. The policeman’s power and skills are not authorized and encouraged for the purpose of entertainment or production but for the maintenance of order and the preservation of authority.

ever functions are assigned to him, whatever uses are made of him by the government, the policeman views his work in personal terms. Whether he works alone or in the company of a partner, everything he does is measured in terms of his individual capacity. The manner in which he works, the tactics and techniques he employs are greatly affected by the policies of his department and the attitudes of his city’s government toward its citizens, but whatever style he uses, he is motivated by his need to keep whole his notion of himself as an effective and capable worker. The policeman is a unique kind of user of the city streets. He develops an intimate knowledge of the places he works, a knowledge of his territory not matched by many of the people who live there. He knows it better than his own neighborhood, but he is not “at home” there. He does not know most of the people he sees or is called to assist, but everyone knows that he is a policeman. Every aspect of his appearance has been calculated to assure that there can be no mistake about his social identity. His uniform not only makes him visible to people who wish to find him but limits his snooping directly in the private lives of citizens; it also gives an unequivocal statement to everyone that the person intervening in their lives is not a private person but a cop.2 Out of uniform he betrays a self-consciousness on the streets he polices which expresses his own understanding of the special character of his place in public. When he’s on patrol, people feel free to approach him for advice or help, but if he approaches them, there are inevitably tensions and unease that cannot be masked, even if the encounter is not marked by displays of incivility. The person approached cannot know what the policeman wants of him, and the policeman, if he is suspicious of someone, does not know whether his feelings are accurate. Every encounter the policeman has in public, except when he is called to aid someone, must begin with an abridg2. It is reported that N ew York City patrolmen complain that they are sometimes mistaken for private guards because a number of private agencies have designed uniforms quite similar to the official police uniform.

ment of personal freedom. Regardless of how much experience he has accumulated in dealing with people, reading their demeanor and attitudes, he cannot know how they will respond to him. He is a public stranger whose authority allows him to do things that private persons normally avoid doing at all costs, but whose powers do not diminish the tensions created when strangers meet.
    When a policeman stops someone on suspicion, their relationship closely parallels the contact between a common street
criminal and his victim. While the person stopped may not be surprised by the intervention of the policeman—people in some neighborhoods are stopped frequently—he does not anticipate its occurrence. Once the policeman has committed himself to an investigation, he is also revealing the purpose and intent of his actions, although this is incidental to his main concern. A criminal tries to initiate his contact with a victim covertly, taking him by surprise, but at some point he must reveal his intentions to the intended victim (unless he is a pickpocket, who relies on skill and deception). While the policeman is legally empowered to make a stop (and in some places citizens are lawfully deprived of the right to resist even the unlawful actions of policemen) and the criminal’s actions are sanctioned only by his willingness to risk his liberty and to use force to accomplish his purposes, both are strangers who suddenly intervene in another man’s life, absolutely depriving him of his freedom, at least momentarily. The criminal naturally seeks to minimize the time between the initiation of contact and his departure from the scene, while the patrolman’s purpose is to detain the person for as long as he feels necessary to conduct his investigation. Both must be prepared to honor any actions necessary to carry out their purposes, unless they are willing to fail. A policeman has no guarantee that after he has established contact with someone and even explained the purpose of his stop that the unease and tension created will decline. They may well increase. The person stopped may have something to conceal from the police, or he may object in principle to the restriction of his liberty. The policeman’s knowledge of his legal powers encourages him to proceed with actions that

## THE ENCOUNTER / 71

he knows arouse considerable hostility, but he also recognizes that the law does not prevent people from objecting and even resisting him. A suspicion stop is only the most extreme form of engagement which comprises most of the work a policeman does. When he is hailed on the street or summoned by the dispatcher, there exists between the policeman and the person requesting his aid a consensus regarding his function, but even in these instances, the bonds of agreement do not often run deep and are easily overturned. He assumes that what the dispatcher tells him is the truth as it is known to him, but the patrolman recognizes that he may have been misinformed or misled, or the situation may have changed between the time the call was made and he arrives at the scene. When he is stopped on the street, he is attentive to what people tell him, but he does not necessarily believe what they say. He has been lied to too often and has come to recognize that people are willing to use him in ways they would not use someone they knew personally. When he responds to a call, the action he takes may not be the one that those who summoned him want, and they are not unwilling to express their dissatisfaction to him. Even when he stops people for a traffic violation or some other minor matter, he cannot know whether the person he is approaching will treat the moment casually; he does not know whether he might be stumbling into a situation that is explosive for reasons he cannot anticipate. The policeman may think his actions are not to be regarded with great seriousness, but the other party to the encounter may feel wronged, may misjudge entirely what the officer’s purposes are, or occasionally, when the patrolman’s intentions are to advance his private interests under the cover of public law, may understand him too well.
    The policeman brings to almost all of his encounters some
degree of suspicion and uncertainty. The law formally recognizes that he must assume risks that citizens normally do not undertake and provides him with the means to protect himself. The potential danger that arises each time he places himself in contact with someone suspected of criminal acts or intentions

can be reduced by exercising his defensive right to assure himself that the person is not armed. He may not only circumscribe a person’s liberty by stopping him on the street, he may also completely violate the suspect’s privacy and autonomy by running his hands over the man’s entire body. The policeman knows that a frisk is a humiliation people usually accept from him because he can sustain his authority by almost any action he feels necessary. While he does not frisk people often just to humble them, he can do so; when he feels obliged to check someone for concealed weapons, he is not usually in a position to request their permission, even if this were desirable. The policeman also carries powerful weapons that he may use only to defend himself, to defend others who are threatened physically, or to prevent the flight of persons known to be felons and impossible to halt in any other manner, These limitations on his right to use force are relaxed only in the most unusual circumstances. Only when martial law is decreed is the policeman authorized to exercise force without limitation, and these measures are generally accompanied by the introduction of soldiers, whose training and equipment prepare them to control people by brute force. But when a policeman shoots someone in a dirty, dark alley, no declarations are required. In some cities the entire matter is covered over, while in others there are careful investigations designed to probe the patrolman’s motives and to remind his colleagues that the limitations are real and the boundaries of their authority are being patrolled. In either case, the policeman does not have to request permission to use his weapons. He is authorized by the community, theoretically, to carry them and to exercise judgment about their use. They are not only a protection and a comfort to him (as well as a heavy weight that strains his stomach muscles over the years) but also serve to remind him, if any reminder is required, that each time he knocks on a door, approaches a person, or answers a call, there is potential trouble. He does not go about his work in a constant state of anxiety, but he must be alert for signs of danger and threat. A policeman has many responsibilities and opportunities to perform, but he measures his capacity to “do the job” (and is

## THE ENCOUNTER / 73

judged by his colleagues) by his success in policing people. He gets little comfort and pleasure from being a watchman patrolling empty streets, looking at rows of darkened buildings. That is why many patrolmen hate last out and go to sleep unless constantly prodded bv their supervisors. Those who do not sleep may continue patrolling, but unless they are given a job and kept involved, they too become bleary-eyed and indifferent. However, a single call from the dispatcher awakens all but the soundest sleeper, mobilizing them for action. People interest him, or signs of mistreated or misappropriated property. An empty street offers him no challenge, nor is he comforted by the possibility that its being empty means there is nothing for him to be concerned about. Although a policeman seldom becomes involved in fights, he carefully assesses the physical assets of all the people he approaches. He is always making appraisals of a man as he comes near, deciding whether he can “take him” if he must. This is not an expression of his lust for combat but a recognition of his place in the scheme of things. When he approaches an individual or a group, the patrolman is not only risking injury and pain, he is also placing on the line his capacity to do his job. Since his body is his principal tool, he cannot separate its protection and defense, which are instinctive, from his need to use it in the performance of his work. Each time he does a job of police work, he enters a situation where violent conflict is a possibility. The moment he accepts the responsibility of being a policeman, he assumes the risks of physical combat. Regardless of his personal inclinations toward fighting, he takes it as a matter of course that he will be hit and in turn will hit back. If he has any doubts, they are quickly put to rest in his initial contacts with veterans. “None of you has been hired to go out and get yourselves killed, but you will take your lumps. If you aren’t ready for that, stroll out now and get a job in a shoe store,” a lieutenant suggested to a class of recruits on their first day at the academy. Several weeks later the same class was being lectured on testifying in court when one student asked whether a man who had been assaulted had to appear in

## 74 / POLICE CONDUCT

court. The instructor sensed something inappropriate about the sentiment that prompted the question and, ignoring it, replied, “Listen, if you guys aren’t ready to take your shots, you better quit right now. Because I’m cellin’ you, somewhere along the line someone is gonna lay it to you. I don’t care how tough you think you are. It happened to me, it’s happened to everyone. W ith me it was my own fault, I was takin’ a broad down a flight of stairs and I got a little careless. She jumped me and worked me over with a shoe before I punched her in the mouth. And dealing with a woman is the worst.” Few policemen seek to hide the fact that they have been beaten. While many men conceal embarrassments, failures that resulted from their being outsmarted or from a personal lapse, they do not try to hide admissions of defeat from others or themselves. Perhaps it is a way of reminding themselves of errors made, of things learned and not to be forgotten, a reaffirmation of their mortality. “See that bar? My first night on the street they put me in the hospital. I was out for two weeks. The sergeant took me from roll call and drove me to that garage down the street and told me to stay put until he came for me. Shit, I wasn’t gonna sit inside all night. So I started walkin’, and right in front of this bar I got jumped by four guys. They really beat the shit out of me. I never been beat like that since. But I sticked a couple of them pretty good before I went out. I guess that old sergeant knew what he was talkin’ about,” the sergeant said, with a wry smile. A patrolman approaches people in a variety of situations. He comes upon them driving and walking; he sees them in places where he has responded to calls for help; he is approached by strangers for advice and aid, goes with them into houses to break up fights and settle accounts. He enters crowded public places and deserted private ones, looking for the source of trouble that has brought him there. Since he must constantly confront people under widely differing circumstances, he cannot develop a single approach to all situations. He behaves differently when he is working alone than when he is with a partner who understands his manner. If he is a frightened man unwilling to take the easy way out of his

## THE ENCOUNTER / 75

dilemma by resigning or feigning work, he can allow the fears that assail even the bravest to control him. He may approach every situation with his holster unsnapped and his stick poised, but his colleagues will shun him and he cannot long remain on the job, although he may stay for enough time to cause pain and grief to himself, his colleagues, and whoever has the misfortune to cross his path. He must learn to control his fears and anxiety by looking for signs of danger in the places and people he approaches; he must learn to examine people for signs of resistance, flight, and threat, to limit their chances of hurting him or creating situations he cannot control or can control only with the use of force, which is inappropriate to the circumstances. He must learn to use his body as a tool, positioning himself in an unobtrusive manner so that he is always able to retaliate with force if attacked, while not giving a threatening and provoking appearance. He must learn to use the powerful weapons he carries, so they will do what they are supposed to do and no more. He must learn when to hit people and when not to hit them. He must also learn how to establish and express his authority by cajoling, requesting, threatening, “bullshitting them,” as patrolmen say, to avoid using force. He must learn to use his body to express with his whole self the authority represented by the appearance he presents; he must learn to use it as a weapon when the occasion demands. He must learn when to mobilize his physical resources and when to let them slumber, allowing his legal power to act for him. In all of his actions he must learn to acquire a quickness, resolution, and decisiveness that urge him forward when others withdraw. He must accept and welcome the fact that, as a policeman, he must be in control of the situation lest it be in control of him.3

## 76 / POLICE CONDUCT

Although the police assume that force and violence are an inevitable part of their work, there is a noteworthy absence in their training of emphasis on the techniques and uses of force. There is no way of instilling in a man a set of sophisticated tricks without also encouraging him to use them. While many policemen consider the threat of force to be the most useful technique available to assure their success, the administrators of the police recognize that unless there is careful regulation of attitudes toward force, the men can easily get out of hand. Little time is devoted to physical training or contact exercises. The men are taught a few basic “come-alongs,” handholds,4 which are designed to move drunks, to walk an unsecured prisoner, and to disarm an assailant. There is no special judo training or suggestion that a policeman should develop sophisticated combat skills. The instructors warn the men that they are given only basic moves to be used in emergencies. “We don’t teach anything fancy because if you don’t practice you forget them, and when you get to the district there’s no time for that. Just remember, if you’re rolling around the street with someone and everything else fails, go for the guy’s jewels, that’s the basic rule,” the instructor laconically explained. The essence of physical training is street fighting, and this basic form of urban combat depends almost entirely on a person’s willingness to hit and to be hit.
    “The last thing you want to do is to pull your gun, but
you’ll learn when to pull it and when to leave it alone,” the instructor said, emphasizing the special character of the gun, a theme constantly stressed in police training. “If a guy comes at you with a knife, you must decide whether he is a drunk who can be knocked on his ass with your stick or someone who knows how to handle it. If he keeps shifting it, weaving the knife in front of you, putting it behind his back, you don’t want to fuck with him. You pull your gun and aim for his chest. If he keeps coming, bury him. But you’ll learn when to pull it and when to leave it alone.”

## THE ENCOUNTER / 77

The lack of emphasis on combativeness and physical prowess suggests that the police presume that any man who wants to be a policeman has the physical assets necessary to do the job. The men are told bluntly and often, formally and informally, that they will find themselves in situations where the use of force is necessary, unavoidable, and occasionally desirable. But every time they are taught a technique or introduced to a new weapon, their instructors stress the limitations that the law imposes and remind everyone how easy it is to go over the fine edge between defense and terror. There is never a hint that violence is to be treated casually. “We are trying to make this job into a profession, not some Irish goon with a stick like it used to be,” the instructor said, with a grin. “You can hit a man who resists arrest and you can keep hitting him until he submits. But once he is subdued, you cannot hit him—then it’s brutality. If you hit a man who is cuffed, if you beat someone in the station, even if you give a guy a shot after he gives up because he hurt you, it’s illegal. You’re not much of a man if you do. You’ll see guys out there who do these things, fewer every year, but there are still some, and in this business I guess there will always be some. But don’t you be one of them.” The department also wants everyone to go on the street confident of his ability to meet any challenges, able to stand up and learn the job. Nobody is discouraged from thinking that physical prowess and courage are not necessary elements in the patrolman’s make-up. On the contrary, the men are warned that some of them will not be able to handle the strain of the job and will quit soon after they leave the academy. But they are discouraged from looking for a routine way of handling problems. They are urged to understand the difference between a man who is willing to use force and one who is eager to do so. It is this willingness that experienced policemen look for in new men, and every recruit is made to understand this. One afternoon, a visiting psychologist gave a lengthy lecture on human relations. The supervising sergeant openly slumbered at the back of the room, displaying his contempt

## 78 / POLICE CONDUCT

for the discussion. At one point the lecturer asked the recruits how they would react to being called certain kinds of names. When several responded correctly, saying they would ignore personal epithets designed to undermine their professional calm, the sergeant rose and began pacing about the room. He started to say something but caught himself and returned to his seat. A burly Puerto Rican recruit rose and in halting English expressed his feelings. He was well liked by all for his willingness to take part in any classroom demonstrations and for his bluff attitudes toward the academy, which most men despise by the end of the first month of training. “I don’t care what anyone call me, spick or anything,” he said, “just as long as they don’t touch my body. They touch my body, I care, I care a lot.” The sergeant bounded up from his seat, beaming. “That’s a policeman talking. I want you in my platoon, boy. Keep your hands off my body, I like that. Oh boy, I just can’t wait to see you guys on the street,” he said, beaming.

have reported many incidents in which persons are stopped, interviewed, searched, and finally allowed to continue on their way with no knowledge of why they were stopped. Obviously, the citizen is irate and feels that the police are capricious in the use of field interrogations. On the other hand, police departments feel field interrogations are essential in any attempt to control and prevent crimes. The present study will critically evaluate the interaction which takes place between the police and the public in a field interview. Several different approaches by the police will be evaluated, both in terms of the resulting image of the police and in terms of the level of cooperation the public is willing to provide the officer. These will be related to the citizens’ views on the appropriate role of the police in their community. Black and Reiss (1967:78) found that only 14 percent of the “on view” contacts (field interviews) between citizens and the police resulted in arrests, which would imply that 86 percent of the persons stopped were judged innocent of any major offense by the detaining officers. Each of these stops creates an occasion for friction to develop between the police and the citizen. Bordua and Tifft (1971) report that more than half of the citizens they observed in such situations viewed the encounter negatively, and Groves (1968) reports that at least half of the persons stopped did not wish to cooperate with the police. This hostility on the part of the person stopped may come from several sources.*2 Assuming that he/she is innocent, he/ she has been unnecessarily impeded from pursuing his/her own interests and according to many accounts has not been provided with an adequate explanation for this imposition on his/her time. Hudson (1970) found that the majority of comcommit a criminal offense (Illinois Revised Statutes, 1971, Chapter 38, Section 107-14 and 108-1.01).
2. Bordua and T ifft (1971:163) report the reactions of citizens to similar
encounters with the police. Most of the citizen statements are negative and indicate a misunderstanding of the police officer’s purpose in the encounter.

## 80 / POLICE CONDUCT

plaints filed against the police were not concerned with the actions taken but rather the officer’s lack of explanation. Many of these complaints were resolved when the complainants were given the reason behind the policeman’s actions. Further support for the importance of explanations of police actions comes from Black and Reiss (1967), who found that citizens objected less to what was done in field interrogations than to how it was done. On the other hand, police officers complain most frequently about the lack of respect given them by citizens (Black and Reiss, 1967). Both Black and Reiss (1967) and Piliavin and Briar (1964) found that such respect was a decisive factor in determining whether a citizen was arrested or not. In the black ghetto areas of large cities, Groves (1968) found that police view the residents as basically hostile and complain that they lack public support in pursuing their job. We can see from these reports that neither the citizen nor the officer finds their interactions rewarding under the present circumstances. The social psychological theory of exchange offers a valuable paradigm for the investigation of policepublic interactions in the context of the field interrogation process. If the rewards and costs available to both the public and the police in these situations are evaluated, we can attempt to predict what approaches by the police will lead to more rewarding (less costly) encounters for both the police and the citizen. A central proposition of exchange theory will be applied to police citizen encounters in this analysis. That is the principle of reciprocity (Simmel, 1950; Homans, 1961; Gouldner, 1960; Gergen, 1969), which states that persons respond in kind to the rewards or punishments they receive. If they are rewarded in an encounter, they will reward the other in turn. If their costs are increased, they will increase the costs of the other (punish). In addition, the more rewards one receives or the less cost one incurs, the more highly one will reward the other. The basic format of a field interrogation is “costly” for a member of the public. He/she is detained by the police officer

## THE ENCOUNTER / 81

from pursuing more rewarding interactions. He/she is possibly embarrassed by the situation and treated like an offender. The police officer, in turn, finds the situation costly if the citizen is uncooperative, hostile, or unwilling to spend the time necessary to complete the field interrogation. The only direct rewards the police officer has to offer the citizen would be polite and courteous behavior toward him/her. In return the citizen’s willing cooperation “cuts the costs” (rewards) of the interviewing officer. Assuming a minimal level of politeness on the part of the detaining officer, the approach of the officer may alter the value of the interaction for the citizen. We theorized that citizens would be indirectly rewarded by police officers who explained the reason why the person was stopped. In addition, the reward would vary in value to the citizen, depending on his/her view of the proper role of the police in the community. Therefore, we hypothesized that 1) citizens would be more cooperative (i.e., reward the interviewing officer) when told the reason for their detainment (less costly or rewarding to the citizen); 2) citizens would vary the amount of cooperation given, depending on the value placed on the reason the police officer gave for detaining them. That is, when a citizen perceives an officer doing what he/she, the citizen, thinks is appropriate and important, he/she will be more willing to cooperate.

## Research Design

In order to test these hypotheses, it was first necessary to discover the value attached to the various aspects of the police role in the mind of the community members. The value of the different police roles must be assessed in order to rank their reward for the members of the community involved in field interrogations. Two hundred interviews were conducted with persons having the same characteristics as those most commonly stopped for field interrogations. Since the data on field interrogations available to the authors were collected in a pre-

## 82 / POLICE CONDUCT

dominantly black poverty area on the South Side of Chicago, the persons interviewed were black males, between the ages of 15 and 65, who were on the streets of this area during the same hours as those in which the field interrogations took place, 6 p . m . to 2 a . m .3 The interview subjects were asked to rate the importance of the various police roles in crime prevention, i.e., which crimes they felt the police should be most active in preventing and investigating. These roles were presented in the three broad categories most commonly used in official reporting: crimes against persons (homicide, robbery, rape, battery, assault), crimes against property (burglary, theft, and auto theft), and victimless crimes (gambling, carrying a concealed weapon, various narcotics charges, etc.). In some cases, the replies of the respondents were interpreted in the context of the language peculiar to the residents of the area. The results of these interviews provided a clear ranking of the value of the various police activities according to these representatives of the community. As shown in Table 2.1, 97 percent of the respondents felt that crimes against persons should be the primary concern of the police; 94 percent rated crimes against property as deserving the next level of concern; 97 percent rated victimless crimes as third in importance. This strong consensus among the respondents provided a high level of confidence for the use of these rankings in developing a value structure for the citizens involved in the field interrogation sample. These data allowed us to classify the field interrogations according to the purpose given by the interviewing officer and also allowed ranking the hypothesized reward value of each

3. It is interesting to note that Hudson (1970) found a similar group,
non-white males between the ages of 15 and 45, had filed the largest number of complaints against the police. In addition, this population is probably one of the most sensitive to “aggressive-preventive” police tactics such as the field interrogation. Bordua and T ifft (1971:165) found that blacks were more likely to view such a tactic negatively, see it as a raw exercise of power, be more upset and angry, and more likely to see race prejudice as involved.

approach to the individual. In operationalizing hypothesis two, we could rank investigations of crimes against persons as more rewarding (less costly) to the citizen than investigations of crimes against property, and both of these to be more rewarding to the citizen being interrogated than investigations of victimless crimes.

## Field Interrogations

The data on field interrogations were collected by the second author in the course of his job as a Chicago Police Officer. All of the subjects included in the sample were stopped for a field interrogation in the normal pattern of a night’s work of a twoman patrol car in the area studied. The reason the subjects were stopped for interrogation was one of the following: 1) the person fit the description of someone wanted for a crime committed in the immediate vicinity, 2) the person was driving a vehicle fitting the description of one wanted in connection with a crime, 3) the person was the subject of information received from a citizen or a reliable informant, or 4) the person was engaged in some activity which, given the time and circumstance, appeared suspicious. The reasons, if given, to the citizen were accurate. That is, they were the actual reasons which caused the police officers to stop the citizen and were not fabricated to fit any research design.

## 84 / POLICE CONDUCT

All of the cases included in the sample were stops which did not result in arrests. It was felt that these were the best indicators of innocent citizens’ reactions to such a situation. The data collected for each interrogation consisted of the length of time the citizen interacted with the police officer before making some move to break off the encounter,4 and any comments supportive of the police in general or the officer in particular. The officer’s initial statements, including the reason given, were excluded from this measurement of time. Length of willing cooperation was used as an indicator of the amount of reward provided the officer by the citizen.5 The actions of the citizens which were coded as terminal points of willing cooperation included any comments or actions indicative of a desire to leave the interaction. Comments coded as such included “Is there anything else?” and “Are you through with me?” In addition, signs of hostility or irritation were viewed as terminal points of willing cooperation, as were any answers or comments on the part of the respondent indicating that he was no longer fully answering the officer’s questions. A sample of 200 field interrogations was drawn. The first 50 stops of “innocent” persons for reasons falling in each of the three major crime categories were included in the sample.6 Data on length of willing cooperation were collected for each interview, and the occurrence of comments supportive of the police was noted. In each of these 150 interviews, the citizen was fully informed of the reason for the stop, i.e., similar car, similar clothes, etc. and, most importantly, the type of crime

4. See Homans (1961) on the value of time as a measure of reward.
5. Unfortunately, data were not collected on the frequency of personal
search, and therefore, its influence cannot be assessed. Understandably personal search increases the “cost” incurred by the citizen, leading to more negative reaction on his part when it occurs (Bordua and Tifft, 1971). If the probability of search is not equal for each of the three reason-given categories, it may be contributing to the differences in level of willing cooperation.

being investigated. All of these interviews were carried out by the second author accompanied by another officer.7 The following is an example of a typical field interrogation with the reason for the stop given to the citizen. A man was observed leaving the back door of an apartment building at one a . m . Several burglaries had been reported in the building recently. Before stepping outside, the man looked in all directions, apparently to see if he was being observed. He then emerged carrying a television set which he placed in a nearby car. At this point, he was stopped and a field interrogation conducted. The interrogation began with the officer describing to the citizen exactly what had been observed. He also explained that several burglaries had been reported there in the last month. The citizen was then asked to produce some identification and to explain his actions. The citizen produced identification which indicated that he lived in the apartment building. He also had a registration certificate for the car. He further explained that the television set was his, and he was taking it to be repaired. (It should be noted that T V repair shops in this area stay open 24 hours a day). He also explained why he had checked the area before leaving the building. Under similar circumstances, two weeks before, he had been robbed, at knifepoint, by two men. Since the field interrogation revealed no evidence of criminal activity or intent, the citizen was thanked for his cooperation and allowed to proceed. Data were collected on an additional 50 stops of persons to whom the officer gave no reason for the field interrogation. Due to ethical concerns, these interviews were conducted by

7. Data on other officers using the three reason-given approaches would
have been desirable. However, an informal survey of the officers working in the same area did not reveal any who routinely used this approach. This infrequent use of explanations in field interviews is common even when officers are specifically instructed to give them (President’s Commission, 1967:185). Considering the felt need for naturalness in these encounters, an attempt to manipulate the behavior of officers unfamiliar with this method was considered inappropriate.

a second police officer, who routinely conducts interrogations in this manner. However, the second author was present and able to observe and record the length of these interviews, as well as any relevant comments on the part of the citizens involved.8 In all 50 cases the reasons for the stops were similar to those causing the 150 stops in the reason-given portion of the sample. The interviewing officer was polite in his interaction with the citizen but did not provide the citizen with any reason for his detainment. The following is an example of such an encounter. The name and description of a man wanted for a shooting and considered armed and dangerous was received on the police radio. Shortly thereafter, a man fitting the description of the suspect was observed walking down the street two blocks from where the shooting had occurred. The man was ordered to stop. He complied and asked “W hat’s the trouble officer?” Instead of answering, the officer asked a series of questions concerning the citizen’s identity, residence, etc. The citizen answered the questions and then reached for his wallet to support his statements. He was ordered not to reach for his wallet. Instead, he was searched for concealed weapons. When none was found, he was allowed to produce his wallet and enclosed identification. These verified his earlier statements and indicated that he was not the suspect being sought. At this, the officers returned to their car and drove off without giving the citizen any explanation of the stop or search.

8. The three “reason-given” categories were different from the “no reason” set because of this change in interviewing officer. In spite of this
difficulty, we felt justified in comparing these data due to the naturalness achieved, i.e., the normal style of the officers involved. The ethical concerns of the officer doing the interrogations with reasons given were also a strong consideration. However, the same two officers were physically present at all tw o hundred stops. Both officers are similar in age (25-30) and race (w h ite).

## Findings

The data on the average length of time a citizen spent willingly with the detaining officer show that citizens spent much less time cooperating, willingly, with the police when no reason was provided than when a reason was given (.31 compared to 2.32 minutes). This finding strongly supports H ypothesis 1. In Table 2.2, the data for the three reason-given categories and the no-reason group are presented. We see that citizens in this neighborhood are most cooperative in investigations of crimes against persons (4.73 minutes). They spent less time in willing cooperation when the investigation was concerned with a crime against property (1.78 minutes) and were least cooperative in the investigation of victimless crimes (.45 minutes). However, this was still a greater amount of cooperation than shown when no reason for the interrogation was provided (.31 minutes). An analysis of variance of these data indicated highly significant differences between the four police approaches (p< .001), strongly supporting our second hypothesis. As noted previously, voluntary comments supportive of the police officer or police in general were recorded. These included such remarks as “Glad to see you guys on the street,” “You’re doing a good job,” etc. Tabulation of these comments

gave further indication that citizens responded more positively to investigations of crimes against persons and crimes against property. Twenty-two percent of the 50 persons interrogated with a crime against persons as the stated reason made supportive comments about the police. Of the 50 given reasons in the crimes against property category, 12 percent made such comments. No citizen in either the victimless crimes category or the no-reason category made positive comments about the police.
     Conclusions
We found strong support for the principle of reciprocity in police-citizen encounters. When the citizens’ costs were highest (he/she was given no reason for being stopped and questioned), he/she was least likely to reward the officer either with willing cooperation or supportive comments. On the other hand, when the officer provided a reason for the stop, citizens’ costs were lowered, and they were more likely to cooperate and make positive comments. The breakdown by reason given clearly indicates the quality of the exchange. When the citizen perceived the officer as acting in accord with his/ her’s, the citizen’s, notion of the primary and legitimate role of a police officer, he/she was most likely to cooperate willingly in the investigation. In addition, he/she positively rewarded the officer by supportive comments in nearly one-quarter of the cases. The police-citizen encounter is a two-way exchange. If the citizen acts in a negative or abusive manner, policemen are likely to respond in kind (Reiss, 1971:53). However, the officer often sets the tone for the interaction. A positive relationship can be established by such simple and low cost behaviors as providing explanations. This was clearly demonstrated in the present study. Crimes against persons were seen as the most legitimate cause for stopping persons for field interrogations in the black ghetto area studied. This may not be true of other areas of the

## THE ENCOUNTER / 89

city, where such reasons for field interrogations might be viewed with suspicion. Fewer such crimes occur in other areas, and the reward value may be less salient to the citizen. We would hesitate to generalize the value ordering of the findings to the total community. However, this does not impugn the importance of reciprocity or the value of rewards for both the citizen and the police. Rather, it indicates the necessity for familiarity with the value structure of the community members before predicting citizen response to various police approaches. It is evident from our analysis that the development of guidelines for police in encounters with citizens would improve their image in the community. Included in these guidelines would be the recommendation that a citizen be told the reason behind an officer’s actions. In turn, the officers should be willing to adopt such procedures, since they result in lowered costs for the officers (increased citizen cooperation). From the present study, we can see the value of the exchange paradigm in applied settings. It not only enables researchers to predict behaviors, but also guides participants in encounters to working agreements which are mutually more rewarding. In addition, it provides the researcher with a means for uncovering the basic problems in many interactions. This is not restricted to the present example of police-citizen encounters but can be extended to such problematic interactions as those between doctors and patients, social workers and clients, teachers and students. The work of Hamblin et aln (1971) is an excellent example of such an application. More field tests of exchange hypotheses would not only aid the analysis of actual encounters but would elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of the theory. An accumulation of such work would be of value both to persons working in applied areas and to social psychological theorists.

## Police-Civilian Encounters”

R IC H A R D E . S Y K E S A N D J O H N P . C L A R K
In recent years sociologists have taken an increased interest in natural instances of focused interaction which Goffman (1961) terms “encounters,” as distinguished from “small groups.” In an encounter persons come together to give their attent'icfn to a particular activity and then disperse; they do not attribute an enduring identity to their joint endeavors. A small group, on the other hand, has an identity separate from any particular gathering of its members; an encounter does not. A family or standing committee, for example, is a small group; a noontime bridge game or autumn hunting party is an encounter. If we accept this distinction, then the coming together of police and citizens is more akin to the latter. It is ephemeral, requires the participants’ maintenance of continuous engrossment in the official focus of activity, and ceases to exist when the participants disperse (Goffman 1961, p. 11). Yet on reflection, if a police-civilian meeting is an encounter then it is of a special kind. Unlike most encounters, there is a peculiar contrast in the nature of the roles. On the one hand, some actors enter into the encounter as part of their job and are cloaked with special authority and obvious power. In Goffman’s terms, officers often display role “embracement,” for they are fully seen in terms of its image and confirm expressively their acceptance of it (Goffman 1961, p. 106). On the other hand, citizens often will not embrace their roles, not

only because they are irregular performers, but because they are reluctant performers; this is true even when the encounter is civilian initiated. In fact, every civilian participant displays some of those very properties which are important not to display in focused interaction: embarrassment, lack of poise, distraction, failure to take proper turns at speaking, and disregard of spacing rules. Civilians fail to be properly demeaned (Goffman 1956, p. 489); they are not just citizens altercast as violators, but include accident victims, householders who have locked themselves out, spouses assaulted by husbands who have since hastily departed, or tavern keepers who have been robbed at gunpoint. Even if the actors are composed, the occasion of the meeting is often such as to embarrass the citizen, for, in a certain sense, to be a victim is to have been made a fool, and to broadcast it publicly is to disclose one’s foolishness. Participation in the encounter is even more problematic for an alleged violator. Not only may he lose his freedom by being so defined, but his new status is often created by the reactions of fellow civilians as much as by the police. He has not violated the law as much as some established set of relational rules. For example, by beating his wife too severely or too frequently he may have caused her to complain, thus violating the rules of his family. Or, by displaying intemperate behavior in an encounter with tavern patrons, he may have caused the bartender to call for assistance. While the law may be invoked in these examples, it is often as a kind of pretext, an eternal means utilized because he has not displayed the proper deference toward his civilian fellows. Indeed, the resolution accomplished by police is normally in response to the desires of the citizens present (Black and Reiss 1970).

## ORDERING RULES OF ENCOUNTERS

Even if these encounters are somewhat unusual, it still seems likely that they are, or, from the perspective of participants, should be rule governed, but that the rules should “fit” the situation. In police-citizen encounters, as in others, this order

## THE ENCOUNTER / 93

revolves around exchange of deference and maintenance of proper demeanor. Goffman defines deference as that “component of activity which functions as a symbolic means by which appreciation is regularly conveyed to a recipient of this recipient, or something of which this recipient is taken as a symbol, extension or agent” (Goffman 1956, p. 477; italics in the original). It is our thesis that, in a typical encounter, relations between officers and citizens are governed by an asymmetrical status norm when deference exchange is involved (Brown 1965, p. 55). Such a norm symbolizes some special evaluation of actor, in this case one in which the officer generally has greater social value and influence than the citizen. Brown writes that such a norm may be operative in a relation of direct but temporary subordination (p. 69), and that in contemporary America it is manifested with intonation, vocal quality, and vocabulary selection rather than with the pronouns of address (p. 66). That an officer should expect the encounter to be governed by such a norm should not be surprising. (Note that Goffman speaks of a recipient of deference as being “taken as a symbol, extension, or agent” [p. 477].) Certainly the officer is symbolic of the law, the ultimate Weberian rational legal basis of social authority in modern societies. In this sense he may be said to symbolize the sacred in the Durkheimean sense. On the occasions when he is called upon by citizens (Reiss 1971), those citizens who invited him to be present are obligated at least to express deference in return for his presence (Weinstein, DeVaughn, and Wiley 1969). In addition, when someone alleged to be a violator is present, his very status as violator implies not only to the officer, but to others, that in some sense he is already guilty, if not of a crime, then of failure to display deference toward his fellow citizens. He then is twice obligated; not just to the citizens, but, by showing deference to the officer, he reestablishes himself as someone willing to fulfill his interpersonal obligations and membership in the moral community. For if he refuses deference to the officer, the symbol of that community’s authority, he may be suspected of openly announcing his secession from it: “to be

## 94 / POLICE CONDUCT

pointedly refused an expected act of deference is often a way of being told that open insurrection has begun” (Goffman 1956, p. 480). The obligation is proportionate to the offense; the greater the violation, the more he must defer in order to establish that he really respects the basic social obligations. Finally, it should be noted that since most contacts by police are with working- or lower-class citizens, citizens of no more than equal status of the officer, the asymmetrical status norm may extend to broader dimensions of the actor’s identities than those peculiar to the legal focus of the encounter.
    If the norm is asymmetrical, deference will be expressed differently downward than upward. The higher-status actor is
not expected to show the same regard as the lower. We would, in fact, expect him to show an amount of regard precisely related to the status of his fellow actor. If the citizen is not a violator but his normal demeanor is absent due to the special circumstances of his embarrassment, the proper response of the officer might well be the “rational bureaucratic framework of civility” (Bordua and Reiss 1967, p. 297) which citizens are said to regard sometimes as disrespect. If the citizen is alleged to be a violator, the asymmetry will be even greater. And if the citizen chooses to behave like a violator, that is, like someone deliberately disregarding the social conventions, he will purposely fail to display deference, with consequent effect on the officer’s asymmetrical response. “There are situations where an actor conveys ritual profanation of a recipient while officially engaged in talk with him or in such a way that the affront cannot be easily overlooked” (Goffman 1956, p. 495).
     Such a theoretical perspective does not invalidate the past
emphasis upon the consequences of personality characteristics to events of an encounter, but it does suggest that the more fundamental and pervasive force of a norm may be operating simultaneously.

SPECIAL COMPLICATIONS OF
## POLICE-M INORITY CIVILIAN ENCOUNTERS

If these rules do order all such encounters, they apply to encounters by police with minority as well as with majority participants. But if this is true from the officer’s perspective, from the point of view of a minority citizen it may be difficult to discriminate subjectively between the general operation of the asymmetrical status norm and the special asymmetrical norm governing relations based on ethnic stratification. Orans (1971) suggests that when a group is subordinated by another, and this subordination is internalized, subordination takes the form of a rank concession syndrome: acceptance of oneself as socially inferior and of the attributes of rank of the superior society (p. 90). Thfs syndrome is manifested through special deference, but in a time when upward mobility is arduously pursued and subordination is sharply denied as an aspect of identity, display of such deference is rejected decisively. “Pride, self-help, and militance,” says Orans (p. 121), become especially salient values. Under such circumstances it is not surprising that neither police nor minorities desire contact with one another unless absolutely necessary, for they possess conflicting expectations and obligations. An entirely unprejudiced officer, in expecting general deference, may be interpreted by a minority civilian as indicating the officer’s own ethnic group’s superordination. On the other hand, the minority citizen’s refusal to express deference may be viewed by the officer as refusal to acknowledge normal social obligations of all citizens and the officer’s symbolic status. Thus, it is in encounters between the formerly subordinate and the symbolic representatives of the authority which subordinated them that both tend unintentionally to discredit each other. Even with the best intentions, an officer may become a “racist pig” and the citizen a “wise-ass” if they misunderstand one another’s indications. Each may impose on the other his definition of reality. Thus, we agree with Hartjen (1972), but only with the provision that stereotyping is mutual. Not just stereotyping is involved, however, for to each

## 96 / POLICE CONDUCT

actor the indicators which express the asymmetrical status norm convey a double meaning and place both in a double bind (Watzlawick, Beavin, and Jackson 1967). The asymmetrical status norm, operative in most police-citizen encounters, is difficult to distinguish from the special asymmetrical status norm operative when ethnic subordinates interact with superordinates.

## COMPLEXITIES CONFOUNDED BY SEX AND AGE

These asymmetrical normative expectations may be confounded by two other status factors: sex and age. Police readily admit that they find it difficult to handle a female suspect who “bad mouths” or aggressively resists them. Norms against publicly using the same language or physical means against a woman that one would with a man “cramp their style.” Insofar as public interaction is concerned, the asymmetrical status norm operates in reverse. Men, including police officers, are expected to be as deferent as or more deferent than women. Age is also a complicating factor; obedience and deference are expected from young civilians. On the other hand, an adult officer is expected to treat a senior citizen with due respect for the citizen’s age. The aged may also be correspondingly less deferent toward the officer. An old woman is free to say what she likes, but the asymmetrical norm prevents the officer from responding in kind.

## THE RESOURCES OF STATUS

W e assume a kind of common “coin” of exchange is used to bestow social value, and the tokens of such coin are the niceties of ceremony. Within any particular universe of social evaluation such tokens are distributed unequally, so that lower-status persons have fewer resources with which to express deference and to maintain demeanor. For this reason, the actual level of

## THE ENCOUNTER / 97

deference expressed within any particular social status will vary. The deferential quality of interaction is less within a lower social rank. If the asymmetrical norm is operative, then the officer is obligated to display much less deference toward those of lower status than toward those of higher; since the actual level is lower, he will always be expected to display relatively less. It is as if a regressive tax were levied on the coin of ceremonial exchange.

## Data

## COLLECTION

During a 15-month period beginning in June 1970, we conducted a quantitative observation study of police in a city of more than 500,000 and in two suburbs, of which about 5% were either black or Indian American. A group of observers, trained over three months, traveled with police on a randomtime sample basis, using portable electronic coding equipment and an interaction process code. The data base consists of 1,466 encounters involving about 9,000 citizens. When such calls involved verbal or nonverbal behavior toward citizens, the interaction was simultaneously and sequentially content analyzed. Among the situational factors coded were whether the encounter was an on-scene or radio call, the purpose of the call, the kind of space in which the activity occurred (if indoors, how the police entered), and whether there was conflict between citizens when the officers arrived. The exchange of deference was measured by a wide variety of action and interaction codes pertaining to civility and incivility, giving and following orders, display of anger, and codes relating to specific kinds of violence, aggressive threats, or acts. The specific outcome of the encounter was also encoded. Demographic data were collected from visual and audial observation and coded for complainant, victim, alleged violator, participants, and bystanders. Interobserver reli-

## 98 / POLICE CONDUCT

ability was calculated utilizing Scott’s II (Scott 1955; Krippendorff 1970), and the coefficient for codes reported herein ranged between .70 and .80.

## MEASURES OF NORMATIVE BEHAVIOR

Each statement throughout the encounter was rated by the observers as being either deferring (respectful) or disrespectful. Signs of respect included polite language, neutral or positive tone, and acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the self presented by the other. Signs of disrespect included impolite language, negative tone, and statements of the kind that tended to discredit the self of the other. Existence of an asymmetrical status norm was inferred whenever interaction by officers toward a particular status was consistently less respectful over many encounters. Three indices of the respect/disrespect dimension were calculated: (a) absolute deference level (ADL); (b) index of discrediting mutuality (IDM); and (c) index of unilaterality (IU). The ADL measures the absolute amount of deference by either citizens or police; IDM measures the tendency of police and citizens to be mutually disrespectful of one another; and IU measures the extent to which a relationship between police and citizens is asymmetrical. In addition, the x2 statistic is utilized to test for significant differences in the state of the encounter (mutually deferent, unilaterally disrespectful by citizen or by officer, mutually disrespectful) when distinguished by the status variables. Tests are also made for interaction effects between two or more status variables (Goodman 1971). Measures of status are dichotomized. Citizens who are young, lower class, nonwhite, or alleged to be violators are assumed to be of lower status. Women and senior citizens are assumed to occupy a “protected,” if not higher status. Contacts pertaining to crimes against persons or property are assumed to be more serious than those pertaining to violations of public decorum or which result from needs for police service.

## Analysis and Results

h y po t h e s is 1
As citizen status declines, the level of deference also declines. Status is a function of role and seriousness of violation as well as of class and ethnicity. An examination of Table 2.3 shows that chances of citizens being entirely deferent are less in the direction predicted above. When any three of the four status variables are held constant, the fourth varies in the direction predicted as well. As expected, the highest percent (96.7) of civilian-deferent encounters is characterized as including no violator, in which the civilian is white and middle class and where no violation of person or property is involved. The lowest percent (67.3) of civilian deference occurs in encounters involving a violator who is lower class and nonwhite and is alleged to have committed a violation of person or property.

## HYPOTHESIS 2

The amount of deference displayed by officers will be less than that displayed by citizens. W e infer the existence of an asymmetrical status norm from such ordered, asymmetrical reciprocity. Table 2.4 shows that in every case officers were entirely deferent in a lower percentage of encounters than citizens. After grouping higher-status categories and lower-status categories separately and calculating the mean differences, it is evident that not only are police in every case entirely deferent in a lower percentage of encounters, but that the average difference is twice as great in the lower group (—3.85% for higher; —8.77% for lower). The only unexpected finding is

The differences are negative because in all instances the ADL with police was larger, that is, in all cases the ADL by police with citizens was less than the ADL by citizens with police.

that the difference between the white and nonwhite groups is not in the expected direction, a matter which will be analyzed more fully below. The ADL index confirms that (1) there tends to be a lower absolute level of citizen deference where citizens are of lower status; and (2) police deference tends in every case to be lower than citizen deference. In addition, it appears that the difference increases as the status of the citizen declines. Further evidence of behavior from which an asymmetrical status norm may be inferred is found in Table 2.5. In every instance the IU index shows that police are more apt to be unilaterally disrespectful to citizens than citizens to police. But it also shows that with the exception of nonwhite citizens those of lower status are less likely to be unilaterally disrespectful than those of higher status. As civilian status increases, the IU may be hypothesized to approach equity or exceed it. In fact, evidence indicates that senior citizens and women in certain categories may be unilaterally disrespectful to officers without

N ote.—The IU was calculated by dividing the number of encounters which contained unilateral citizen disrespect by the number of encounters which contained unilateral officer disrespect. The closer the dividend to zero the greater the tendency toward unilateral officer disrespect. Generally, an asymmetrical relationship may be inferred when one status is deferent or disrespectful in a unilateral manner, that is, when one is consistently disrespectful and the other deferent or vice versa.

N ote.—The IDM was calculated by dividing the number of encounters which contained mutual disrespect by the number of encounters which contained only mutual deference. The higher the number the greater the tendency toward mutual disrespect. Generally, a symmetrical relationship may be inferred when either deference or disrespect by one status tends toward a one to one ratio to a similar quality of the other. Deferent mutuality tends to mutual acceptance of selves: disrespect, to mutual discreditation.
any case of unilateral disrespect occurring by officers, which is a reversal of the data shown in Table 2.5. Finally, the IDM index in Table 2.6 demonstrates that in relations with those of high status mutual disrespect is less likely to occur. Police and high-status civilians are most likely to defer to each other. Most likely to indulge in mutual insult are police and alleged violators and police and nonwhites.

## HYPOTHESIS 3

Since police and minority citizens misunderstand the respective indications of the other, their interaction will display much less mutual deference and much more mutual disrespect. An examination of the ADL, IU, and IDM indices in regard to nonwhites shows a pattern somewhat different from that of

## THE ENCOUNTER / 103

the other variables. There is not much difference between the ADL index of police and nonwhites and police and middleclass civilians (see Table 2.4). Similarly, nonwhites are more apt to be unilaterally disrespectful to police than any group other than complainants (see Table 2.5). From these two indices, nonwhites appear more like high-status civilians, but they are also more likely to indulge in mutual insults with police than any group except alleged violators. W e interpret these data as suggesting that in refusing to display special deference minority citizens are interpreted by police as refusing to display general deference and, therefore, as willfully disregarding their obligations. From the officer’s point of view they deserve to be treated harshly. By acting as if they expected the special deference due an ethnic superordinate, the police, from the minority citizen’s viewpoint, deserve to receive indications that the minority is not subordinate, that is, deference is withheld. This explains why on two indices nonwhites are similar to higher-status civilians, while on the third index they are similar to lower-status civilians. On the one hand, nonwhites respond as if they were of equal or superior status to officers. Sometimes officers accept this relationship; but often they do not, and then mutual disrespect occurs. An uneasy relation, therefore, exists in which the normative flow of deference remains problematic.

## Summary

We have hypothesized that the flow of deference between police and civilians is governed by an asymmetrical status norm. Officers expect to be deferred to by citizens occupying a lower or damaged status. Officers are consistently less deferent than citizens, although their actual level is relative to that of the citizens. When the status of a grouping is in the process of change, as is the case with American blacks, the norms controlling the flow of interpersonal deference also gradually change, but in

## 104 / POLICE CONDUCT

the interim the uncertainties disturb the inertia of asymmetrical civility and temporarily result in the breakdown of mutually deferent, if asymmetrical, relations.

    I T h e Decision
## I PREVIEW OF T H E SELECTIONS

If an alleged felony suspect is present when police officers arrive and credible witnesses or sound evidence are available, the officer’s decision has already been made. Almost without exception the alleged felony violator is arrested. In most encounters, however, felony suspects are not present. Police patrol officers work primarily with felony victims or with persons who have violated the law in some minor way. In these more common situations decision making is considerably more complex since there are few inflexible rules guiding police action. In an effort to resolve the situation the officer relies heavily but not exclusively upon the actions and preferences of the citizens present. Citizens thus have considerable control over police decisions, and this point occupies our attention in the third chapter. In their work with felony and, to a lesser extent, misdemeanor victims, the essential issue is whether or not an official report of the incident will be written. Report writing is a tedious and essentially unrewarding activity for patrol officers. In Selection 7, “Production of Crime Rates,” Donald Black examines the factors that relate to the writing of a report of a criminal incident. Black observes that a variety of factors determine whether or not a report is written, including the seriousness of the alleged offense, the preference of the complainant, the relational distance between the victim and alleged offender, the demeanor of the complainant, and the social status of the complainant. Black concludes that the “complainant’s role is appreciable in the criminal process.” Selection 8, “Police Control of Juveniles: A Replication” by Richard J. Lundman, Richard E. Sykes, and John P. Clark, re-

produces an earlier study of police work with alleged juvenile offenders. In the earlier study and in the replication it is apparent that citizens, in their roles as complainants, and alleged violators influence police decision making. Thus, the complainant’s preference and the alleged violator’s demeanor are among the factors that determine whether or not a juvenile is arrested. Selection 9, “The Social Organization of Arrest” by Donald Black, provides a general summary of the factors that affect police decision making in situations where arrest is possible. According to Black, citizens, either as complainants or as violators, have a great deal to say about police decision making. Complainants constrain police actions by expressing dispositional preferences, while the demeanor of the violator is an important determinant of routine police decision making. Other factors, however, play an important role including the availability of evidence, the legal seriousness of the alleged offense, and the degree of intimacy between a complainant and an alleged offender.

## DONALD BLACK

Detection of deviance involves (1) the discovery of deviant acts or behavior and (2) the linking of persons or groups to those acts. Types of deviance vary widely according to the extent to which either or both of these aspects of detection are probable. Some deviant acts are unlikely to be discovered, although discovery generally is equivalent to the detection of the deviant person as well. Examples are homosexual conduct and various other forms of consensual sexual deviance. Acts of burglary and auto theft, by contrast, are readily detected, but the offending persons often are not apprehended. These differential detection probabilities stem in part from the empirical patterns by which various forms of violative behavior occur in time and social space. In part they stem as well from the uneven climate of social control. . . . This paper considers the following conditions as they relate to the probability of an official crime report in policecomplainant encounters: the legal seriousness of the alleged crime, the preference of the complainant, the relational distance between the complainant and the absentee suspect, the degree of deference the complainant extends to the police, and the race and social-class status of the complainant.

## Field Method

Systematic observation of police-citizen transactions was conducted in Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., during the From Donald Black, “Production of Crime Rates,” American Sociological Review, 35, pp. 735, 736-748. © 1970 by the American Sociological Association. Reprinted by permission.

## THE DECISION / 109

summer of 1966. Thirty-six observers—persons with law, social science, and police administration backgrounds—recorded observations of routine encounters between uniformed patrolmen and citizens. Observers accompanied patrolmen on all work-shifts on all days of the week for seven weeks in each city. However, the times when police activity is comparatively high (evening shifts, particularly weekend evenings) were given added weight in the sample. Police precincts were chosen as observation sites in each city. The precincts were selected so as to maximize observation in lower socioeconomic, high crime rate, racially homogeneous residential areas. This was accomplished through the selection of two precincts in Boston and Chicago and four precincts in Washington, D.C. The data were recorded in “incident booklets,” forms structurally similar to interview schedules. One booklet was used for each incident that th$ police were requested to handle or that they themselves noticed while on patrol. These booklets were not filled out in the presence of policemen. In fact the officers were told that our research was not concerned with police behavior but only with citizen behavior toward the police and the kinds of problems citizens make for the police. Thus the study partially utilized systematic deception. A total of 5,713 incidents were observed and recorded. In what follows, however, the statistical base is only 554 cases, roughly one-in-ten of the total sample. These cases comprise nearly all of the police encounters with complainants in crime situations where no suspect was present in the field situation. They are drawn from the cases that originated with a citizen telephone call to the police, 76% of the total. Excluded are, first, encounters initiated by policemen on their own initiative (13%). Police-initiated encounters almost always involve a suspect or offender rather than a complainant; complainants usually must take the initiative to make themselves known to the police. Also excluded are encounters initiated by citizens who walk into a police [station] to ask for help (6%) or who personally flag down the police on the street (5%). Both of these kinds of police work have peculiar situational features

## 110 / POLICE CONDUCT

and should be treated separately. The great majority of citizen calls by telephone are likewise inappropriate for the present sample. In almost one-third of the cases no citizen is present when the police arrive to handle the complaint. When a citizen is present, furthermore, the incident at issue pertains to a noncriminal matter in well over one-half of the cases. Even when there is a criminal matter a suspect not infrequently is present. When a suspect is present the major official outcome possible is arrest rather than a crime report. Finally, the sample excludes cases in which two or more complainants of mixed race or social-class composition participated. It may appear that, in all, much has been eliminated. Still, perhaps surprisingly, what remains is the majority of crime situations that the police handle in response to citizen telephone calls for service. There is no suspect available in 77% of the felonies and in 51% of the misdemeanors that the police handle on account of a complaint by telephone. There is only a complainant. These proportions alone justify a study of police encounters with complainants. In routine police work the handling of crime is in large part the handling of complainants. Policemen see more victims than criminals.

## Legal Seriousness of the Crime

Police encounters with complainants where no suspect is present involve a disproportionately large number of felonies, the legally serious category of crime. This was true of 53% of the cases in the sample of 554. When a suspect is present, with or without a citizen complainant, the great majority of police encounters pertain only to misdemeanors (Black, 1968). In other words, the police arrive at the scene too late to apprehend a suspect more often in serious crime situations than in those of a relatively minor nature.1 In police language, felonies more
1. It is interesting to note that in ancient Roman law the offender caught
in the act of theft was subject to a more serious punishment than the offender apprehended some time after detection of his theft. In the L a w s o f th e T w e l v e T a b le s these were called “manifest” and “non-manifest”

## THE DECISION / 111

often are “cold.” A moment’s reflection upon the empirical patterns by which various crimes are committed reveals why this is so. Some of the more common felonies, such as burglary and auto theft, generally involve stealth and occur when the victim is absent; by the time the crime is discovered, the offender has departed. Other felonies such as robbery and rape have a hit-and-run character, such that the police rarely can be notified in time to make an arrest at the crime setting. Misdemeanors, by contrast, more often involve some form of “disturbance of the peace,” such as disorderly conduct and drunkenness, crimes that are readily audible or visible to potential complainants and that proceed in time with comparative continuity. In short, properties of the social organization of crime make detection of felony offenders relatively difficult and detection of misdemeanor offenders relatively simple, given detection of the act.*2 When the offender has left the scene in either felony or misdemeanor situations, however, detection and sanctioning of the offender is precluded unless an official report is written by the police. Not surprisingly, the police are more likely to write these reports in felony than in misdemeanor situations.3
thefts. The same legal principle is found in the early Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic codes (Maine, 1963:366-367). It could well be that a similar pattern is found in present-day law-in-action. W hat is formal in one legal system may be informal in another.
2. The heavier penalties that the law provides for felonies may compensate for a loss in deterrence that could result from the relatively low
rate at which felons are apprehended. Likewise, the law of arrest seemingly compensates for the social organization of crime that gives felons a head start on the police. In most jurisdictions the police need less evidence in felony than in misdemeanor situations to make a legal arrest without warrant. By a second technique, then, the legal system increases the jeopardy of felony offenders. The power of substantive law increases as procedural restrictions on legal officials are weakened. By both penalty and procedure, the law pursues the felon with a special vengeance.
3. Crime situations were classified as felonies or misdemeanors according
to legal criteria. These criteria were applied to the version of the crime that prevailed in the police-citizen transaction. The observation reports required the observer to classify the incident in a detailed list of cate-

## 112 / POLICE CONDUCT

Reports were written in 72% of the 312 felonies, but in only 53% of the 242 misdemeanors. It is clear that official recognition of crimes becomes more likely as the legally defined seriousness of the crime increases. Even so, it remains noteworthy that the police officially disregard one-fourth of the felonies they handle in encounters with complainants. These are not referred to the detective division for investigation; offenders in these cases thus unknowingly receive a pardon of sorts. Now the reader might protest an analysis that treats as crimes some incidents that the police themselves do not handle as crimes. How can we call an event a law violation when a legal official ignores that very event? This is a definitional problem that plagues a sociology of law as well as a sociology of deviance and social control. How is a violation of the “law on the books” properly classified if “in practice” it is not labeled as such? It is easy enough to argue that either of these criteria, the written law or the law-in-action, should alone define the violative behavior in question. No answer to this dilemma is
gories as well as to write a long-hand description of the incident. The felony-misdemeanor breakdown was made during the coding stage of the investigation. The major shortcoming of this strategy is that the tabulation allows no gradations of legal seriousness within the felony and misdemeanor categories. This shortcoming was accepted in order to facilitate more elaborate statistical analysis with a minimum of attrition in the number of cases. It should also be noted that the tabulations do not provide information pertaining to the kind of official report the police wrote for a given kind of crime situation. Occasionally, the police officially characterize the crime with a category that seems incorrect to a legally sophisticated observer. Most commonly this involves reducing the legal seriousness of the crime. However, there are cases where the officer, sometimes through sheer ignorance of the law or inattention, increases the legal seriousness of the crime. In one case, for example, a woman complained about two young men in an automobile who had made obscene remarks to her as she walked along the street near her residence. She claimed she was prepared to press charges. After leaving the scene the officer filled out an official report, classifying the incident as an “aggravated assault,” the felonious level of assault. Before doing so he asked the observer for his opinion as to the proper category. The observer feigned ignorance.

## THE DECISION / 113

true or false. It is of course all a matter of the usefulness of one definition or another. Here a major aim is to learn something about the process by which the police select for official attention certain technically illegal acts while they bypass others. If we classify as crimes only those acts the police officially recognize as crimes, then what shall we call the remainder? Surely that remainder should be conceptually distinguished from acts that are technically legal and which carry no sanctions. For that reason, the present analysis operates with two working categories, crimes and officially recognized crimes, along with an implicit residual category of non-crimes. Crime differs from other behavior by dint of a probability, the probability that it will be sanctioned in a particular administrative system if it is detected. The written law usually—though not always—is a good index of whether that probability exists. “Dead letter” illegal acts, i.e., those virtually never sanctioned, are not classified as crimes in this analysis. Crime as a general category consists in a probability of sanction; official recognition in the form of a crime report is one factor that escalates that probability for a specific instance of crime. It is worthwhile to have a vocabulary that distinguishes between crimes on the basis of how the police relate to them. Without a vocabulary of this kind police invocation of the law in the face of a law violation cannot be treated as empirically or theoretically problematic. Rather, invocation of the law would define a law violation and would thereby deprive sociology of an intriguing problem for analysis. Indeed, if we define a law violation with invocation of the law, we are left with the peculiar analytical premise that enforcement of the law is total or universal. We would definitionally destroy the possibility of police leniency or even of police discretion in law enforcement.

## The Complainant’s Preference

Upon arriving at a field setting, the police typically have very little information about what they are going to find. At best they have the crude label assigned to the incident by a dis-

## 114 / POLICE CONDUCT

patcher at the communications center. Over the police radio they hear such descriptions as “a B and E” (breaking and/or entering), “family trouble,” “somebody screaming,” “a theft report,” “a man down” (person lying in a public place, cause unknown), “outside ringer” (burglar-alarm ringing), “the boys” (trouble with juveniles), and suchlike. Not infrequently these labels prove to be inaccurate. In any case policemen find themselves highly dependent upon citizens to assist them in structuring situational reality. Complainants, biased though they may be, serve the police as primary agents of situational intelligence. W hat is more, complainants not infrequently go beyond the role of providing information by seeking to influence the direction of police action. When a suspect is present the complainant may pressure the police to make an arrest or to be lenient. When there is no available suspect, it becomes a matter of whether the complainant prefers that the crime be handled as an official matter or whether he wants it handled informally. Of course many complainants are quite passive and remain behaviorally neutral. During the observation period the complainant’s preference was unclear in 40% of the encounters involving a “cold” felony or misdemeanor. There were 184 felony situations in which the complainant expressed a clear preference; 78% lobbied for official action. Of the 145 misdemeanor situations where the complainant expressed a clear preference, the proportion favoring official action was 75%, roughly the same proportion as that in felony situations. It seems that complainants are, behaviorally, insensitive to the legal seriousness of crimes when they seek to direct police action. Police action displays a striking pattern of conformity with the preferences of complainants. Indeed, in not one case did the police write an official crime report when the complainant manifested a preference for informal action. This pattern seen in legal perspective is particularly interesting given that felony complainants prefer informal action nearly as frequently as misdemeanor complainants. Police conformity with those complainants who do prefer official action, however, is not so sym-

## THE DECISION / 115

metrical. In felony situations the police comply by writing an official report in 84% of the cases, whereas when the complaint involves a misdemeanor their rate of compliance drops to 64%. Thus the police follow the wishes of officially-oriented complainants in the majority of encounters, but the majority is somewhat heavier when the occasion is a legally more serious matter. In the field setting proper the citizen complainant has much to say about the official recognition of crimes, though the law seemingly screens his influence.4 Recall that the raw inputs for the official detection rate are generated by the citizenry who call the police. At two levels, then, the operational influence of citizens gives crime rates a peculiarly democratic character. Here the servant role of the police predominates; the guardian role recedes. Since an official report is a prerequisite for further police investigation of the crime, this pattern also implies that complainants are operationally endowed with an adjudicatory power. Their observable preferences can ultimately affect probabilities of arrest and conviction. While the structure of the process is democratic in this sense, it most certainly is not universalistic. The moral standards of complainants vary to some extent across the citizen population, thereby injecting particularism into the production of outcomes. There appears a trade-off

4. Here two general remarks about analytical strategy seem appropriate.
One is that the present approach abdicates the problematics of psychological analysis. The observational study does not provide data on the motives or cognitions of the police or the citizens whose behavior is described. Still, findings on patterns of behavior make prediction of police behavior possible. T hey also offer opportunities for drawing inferences about the impact or implications of police work for social organization. Much can be learned about man’s behavior in a social matrix without knowing how he experiences his behavior. The consequences of behavior, moreover, are indifferent to their mental origins. Secondly, the strategy pursued in this analysis is not sensitive, except in the broadest terms, to the temporal dimension of police-citizen transactions. Thus, simply because the complainant’s preference is treated prior to other variables does not mean that it is temporally prior to other aspects of police-citizen interaction. Like the other variables treated in this investigation, the complainant’s preference is prior in time only to the final police response to the encounter.

## 116 / POLICE CONDUCT

between democratic process and universalistic enforcement in police work. This is an organizational dilemma not only of the police but of the legal system at large. When the citizenry has the power to direct the invocation of law, it has the power to discriminate among law-violators. Moral diversity in the citizen population by itself assures that some discrimination of this kind will occur. This is true regardless of the intentions of individual citizens. When a legal system organizes to follow the demands of the citizenry, it must sacrifice uniformity, since the system responds only to those who call upon it while it ignores illegality that citizens choose to ignore. A legal system that strives for universalistic application of the law, by contrast, must refuse to follow the diverse whims of its atomized citizenry. Only a society of citizens homogeneous in their legal behavior could avoid this dilemma.

## Relational Distance

Like any other kind of behavior, criminal behavior is located within networks of social organization. One aspect of that social organization consists in the relationship existing between the criminal offender and the complainant prior to a criminal event. They may be related by blood, marriage, friendship, neighborhood, membership in the same community, or whatever. In other words, the adversarial relation that is created by a crime may itself be viewed as it is structured within a wider social frame. The findings in this section permit the conclusion that the probability of official recognition of a crime varies with the relational network in which the crime occurs.5 The
5. Hall (1952:318) suggests that the relational distance between the victim and offender may influence the probability of prosecution. The present investigation, following Hall, seeks to predict social control responses
from variations in relational distance. A different strategy is to predict community organization from the relationships between adversaries who enter the legal system, under the assumption that legal disputes bespeak a relative absence of informal control in the relational contexts where they arise (see Nader, 1964).

## THE DECISION / 117

greater the relational distance between citizen adversaries, the greater is the likelihood of official recognition. Citizen adversaries may be classified according to three levels of relational distance: (1) fellow family members, (2) friends, neighbors, or acquaintances, and (3) strangers. The vast majority of the cases fall into the “stranger” category, though some of these probably would be reclassified into one of the other relational categories if the criminal offender were detected. The complainant’s first speculation generally is that a stranger committed the offense in question. Table 3.1 shows that when a complainant expresses a preference for official action the police comply most readily when the adversaries are strangers to one another. They are less likely to comply by writing an official crime report when the adversaries are friends, neighbors, or acquaintances, and they are least likely to give official recognition to the crime when the complainant and suspect are members of the same family. The small number of cases in the “fellow family members” category prohibits comparison between felony and misdemeanor situations. In the other relational categories this comparison reveals that the police follow the same pattern in the handling of both felonies and misdemeanors. W ith the relational distance between the adversaries held constant, however, the probability of an official report is higher for felony than for misdemeanor situations. The highest probability of an official response occurs when the crime is a felony and the adversaries are strangers to one another (91%); the lowest calculable probability is that for misdemeanors when the adversaries are related by friendship, neighborhood, or acquaintanceship (42%). On the other hand, it appears that relational distance can override the legal seriousness of crimes in conditioning police action, since the police are more likely to give official recognition to a misdemeanor involving strangers as adversaries (74%) than to a felony involving friends, neighbors, or acquaintances (62%). Here again, therefore, the law screens but does not direct the impact of an extra-legal element in the production of crime rates.

## THE DECISION / 119

Beyond the importance of relational distance for an understanding of crime rates as such is another implication of these findings. Because a follow-up investigation of the crime report by the detective division may result in apprehension of the criminal offender, it is apparent that the probability of an official sanction for the offender lessens as the degree of social intimacy with his adversary—usually his victim—increases. When an offender victimizes a social intimate the police are most apt to let the event remain a private matter, regardless of the complainant’s preference. A more general consequence of this pattern of police behavior is that the criminal law gives priority to the protection of strangers from strangers while it leaves vulnerable intimates to intimates. Indeed, victimizations of strangers by strangfers may be comparatively more damaging to social order and hence, from a functional standpoint, require more attention from the forces of control. A victimization between intimates is capsulated by intimacy itself. Furthermore, as social networks are more intimate, it surely is more likely that informal systems of social control operate. Other forms of legal control also may become available in the more intimate social relationships. In contrast there is hardly anyone but the police to oversee relations among strangers. Seemingly the criminal law is most likely to be invoked where it is the only operable control system. The same may be said of legal control in general (see Pound, 1942; Schwartz, 1954; Nader and Metzger, 1963). Legal control melds with other aspects of social organization.

## The Complainant’s Deference

Evidence accumulates from studies of police sanctioning that the fate of suspects sometimes hangs upon the degree of deference or respect they extend to policemen in field encounters (Westley, 1953; Piliavin and Briar, 1964; Black, 1968; Black and Reiss, 1970). As a rule, the police are especially likely to sanction suspects who fail to defer to police authority whether legal grounds exist or not. Situational etiquette can weigh

## 120 / POLICE CONDUCT

heavily on broader processes of social life (see Goffman, 1956 and 1963). This section offers findings showing that the complainant’s deference toward the police conditions the official recognition of crime complaints. The deference of complainants toward the police can be classified into three categories: (1) very deferential or very respectful, (2) civil, and (3) antagonistic or disrespectful. As might be expected, complainants are not often antagonistic toward policemen; it is the suspect who is more likely to be disrespectful (Black and Reiss, 1967:63-65). The number of cases of police encounters with antagonistic complainants is too few for separate analysis of felony and misdemeanor situations. When felonies and misdemeanors are combined into one statistical base, however, it becomes clear that by a large margin the probability of an official crime report is lowest when the complainant is antagonistic in the face-to-face encounter. (See Table 3.2.) Less than one-third of the disrespectful complainants who prefer official action see their wishes actualized in a crime report. Because of the small number of cases this finding nevertheless should be taken as tentative. The comparison between the very deferential and the civil complainants, which is more firmly grounded, is equally striking. The polite are somewhat more likely to comply with very deferential complainants than with those who are merely civil. In sum, then, the less deferential the complainant, the less likely are the police to comply with his manifest preference for official action in the form of an official crime report.6

6. The findings in this section present a problem of interpretation, since
no information about the police officer’s behavior toward the citizen is provided apart from whether or not he wrote an official report. Therefore, nothing is known from the tabulation about whether the officer behaved in such a way as to provoke the citizen into one or another degree of deference. Nothing is known about the subtle exchange of cues that takes place in any instance of face-to-face interaction. Other studies of the role of deference in police work are subject to the same criticism. Here, again, no inquiry is made into the motivational dimensions of the pattern. It nevertheless should be emphasized that whatever the motivation of the complainant behavior, the motivation was not the failure of the police to write an official report. In the cities studied the complainant

## THE DECISION / 121

Table 3.2 also shows that the complainant’s degree of deference conditions crime-reporting in both felony and misdemeanor situations. In fact, it seems that the complainant’s deference can predict official recognition as well, or even slightly better than the legal seriousness of the crime. The probability of a crime report in misdemeanor situations where the complainant is very deferential (85%) is as high as it is in felony situations where he is only civil toward the police (80%). Still, when we hold constant the complainant’s deference, the legal seriousness of the incident looms to importance. In felony situations where the complainant is very respectful, the police satisfy his preference for official action in no less than 100% of the cases. The findings in this section reveal that the level of citizen respect for the police in field encounters has consequences beyond those known to operate in the sanctioning of suspects. Here we see that the fate of citizens who are nominally served, as well as those who are controlled by the police, rides in part upon their etiquette. The official response to an avowed victimization in part depends upon the situational style in which the citizen presents his complaint to the control system. Official crime rates and the justice done through police detection of criminal offenders, therefore, reflect the politeness of victims. That sanctions are sometimes more severe for alleged ofordinarily did not even know whether or not an official report was written, since the police ordinarily wrote the report in the police car or at the police station after leaving the encounter with the complainant. During the encounter they recorded the relevant facts about the incident in a notebook, whether or not they intended to write an official report. As some officers say, they do this “for show” in order to lead the complainant to believe they are “doing something.” Thus, in the average case, it can be assumed that the complainant’s deference is not a consequence of the situational outcome. Furthermore, the observers were instructed to record only the level of citizen deference that appeared prior to the situational outcome. A separate item was provided in the observation booklet for recording the citizen’s manifest level of satisfaction at the close of the encounter. It therefore remains reasonable to hold that the complainant’s deference can aid in calculating the probability of an official crime report.

## THE DECISION / 123

fenders who are disrespectful toward the police can be understood in many ways as a possible contribution to the control function. Perhaps, for example, disrespectful offenders pose a greater threat to society, since they refuse to extend legitimacy to its legal system. Perhaps deterrence is undermined by leniency toward disrespectful suspects. Perhaps not. The point is that rationales are available for understanding this pattern as it relates to the police control function. It should be apparent that such rationales do not apply as readily to the tendency of the police to underreport the victimizations of disrespectful complainants. Surely this pattern could have only the remotest connection to deterrence of illegal behavior. Etiquette, it would seem, can belittle the criminal law.

## The Complainant’s Status

The literature on police work abounds in speculation but provides little observational evidence concerning the relation of social status to police outcomes. The routine policing of Negroes differs somewhat from that of whites, and the policing of blue-collar citizens differs quite massively from that of white-collar citizens. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of evidence that these differences arise from discriminatory behavior by policemen. It appears that more consequential in determining these outcomes are aggregative differences between the races and classes in the kinds of incidents the police handle along with situational factors such as those the present analysis examines (e.g., Skolnick, 1966; Black, 1968; Black and Reiss, 1970). Nevertheless, the research literature remains far too scanty to permit confident generalization on these questions. Studies in the discretionary aspects of police work focus almost solely upon police encounters with suspects. The present sample provides an opportunity to investigate the relation between a complainant’s race and social-class status and the probability that the police will give official recognition to his complaint. The tabulation limits the cases to those where the complainant expresses a preference for official action and to

## 124 / POLICE CONDUCT

those where he is civil toward the police. This section concludes that the race of complainants does not independently relate to the production of official crime rates, but there is some evidence that the police give preferential treatment to white-collar complainants in felony situations.
    For all crimes and social-class statuses taken together, the
difference between Negroes and whites in the probability of an official crime report is slight and negligible (see Table 3.3); it is a bit higher for whites. Table 3.3 also shows that this probability is the same for blue-collar Negroes and blue-collar whites in felony situations, though it is comparatively higher for blue-collar Negroes in misdemeanor situations. Evidence of racial discrimination thus appears weak and inconsistent. It should nonetheless be noted that if there were consistent evidence of a race differential it is not readily clear to whom a disadvantage could be attributed. Considered from the complainant’s standpoint, a higher frequency of police failure to comply with complainants of one race could be viewed as discrimination against that race. But police failure to write a crime report also lowers the likelihood that the offender will be subjected to the criminal process. Since we may assume that complainants more commonly are victims of offenses committed by members of their own race than by members of another race (Reiss, 1967), then disproportionate police failure to comply with complainants could be viewed as discrimination in favor of that race, considered from the offender’s standpoint. Race differentials in arrest rates for crimes where there is an identifiable victim necessarily pose a similar dilemma of interpretation. Definitionally, there always is a conflict of legal interests between offenders and victims. Offendervictim relationships tend to be racially homogeneous. The social organization of crime therefore complicates questions of racial discrimination in law enforcement.7
7. It may seem that in criminal matters the costs are slight for the complainant when the police fail to comply with his preference for official
action. However, it should be remembered that crimes frequently involve an economic loss for the victim, a loss that can sometimes be recouped

## THE DECISION / 125

Along social-class lines there is some evidence of discrimination against complainants and offenders. Table 3.3 shows that in felony situations the police are somewhat more likely to comply with white-collar complainants than with those of blue-collar status. In fact an official crime report resulted from every encounter between the police and a white-collar felony complainant of either race. The probability of official recognition drops to about three-fourths for blue-collar felony complainants. There does not appear to be a clear social-class differential in misdemeanor situations, however. Only in felony situations, then, does an inference of discrimination offer itself. In these encounters the police seem to discriminate against blue-collar complainants. Moreover, when both white-collar and blue-collar complainants report felonious offenses, we should be able to assume that the offenders characteristically are of blue-collar status. There is every reason to believe, after all, that white-collar citizens rarely commit the common felonies such as burglary, robbery, and aggravated assault. A possible exception is auto theft, a crime in which youths from white-collar families occasionally indulge. Since this study was conducted in predominantly blue-collar residential areas the assumption should be all the more warranted. It would follow that the police discriminate against blue-collar citizens who feloniously offend white-collar citizens by being comparatively lenient in the investigation of felonies committed by one blue-collar citizen against another. In this instance the legal system listens more attentively to the claims of higher status citizens. The pattern is recorded in the crime rate.
if and when the offender is discovered. In other cases, discovery and punishment of the offender may net the victim nothing more than a sense of revenge or security or a sense that justice has been done—concerns that have received little attention in social science. For that matter, social scientists generally examine questions of discriminatory law enforcement only from the offender’s standpoint. Ordinary citizens in high crime rate areas probably are more interested in questions of discrimination in police allocation of manpower for community protection.

## Overview

The foregoing analysis yields a number of empirical generalizations about the production of crime rates. For the sake of convenience they may be listed as follows:
    I. T h e p olice officially recogn ize p rop ortion ately m ore legally
       serious crim es than legally m inor crim es.
II. T h e com plainant’s m anifest preference for p olice action has a
       significant effect upon official crim e-reporting.
III. T h e greater the relational distance b etw een the com plainant
       and the suspect, the greater is the likelihood o f official r e co g -
       nition.
IV . T h e m ore deferential the com plainant tow ard the police, the
       greater is the likelihood o f official recogn ition o f the co m -
       plaint.
V . T h ere is no evid en ce o f racial discrim ination in crim ereporting. V I. T h ere is som e evid en ce that the p o lice discrim inate in favor
       o f w h ite-collar com plainants, but this is true o n ly in the official recogn iton o f legally serious crim e situations.
On the surface these findings have direct methodological relevance for those who would put official statistics to use as empirical data, whether to index actual crime in the population or to index actual police practices. Crime rates, as data, systematically underrepresent much crime and much police work. To learn some of the patterns by which this selection process occurs is to acquire a means of improving the utility of crime rates as data. It should again be emphasized that these patterns of police behavior have consequences not only for official rates of detection as such; they also result in differential investigation of crimes and hence differential probabilities of arrest and conviction of criminal offenders. Thus the life chances of a criminal violator may depend upon who his victim is and how his victim presents his claim to the police. The complainant’s role is appreciable in the criminal process. Surely the complainant has a central place in other legal and nonlegal control contexts

as well, though there is as yet little research on the topic. Complainants are the consumers of justice. They are the prime movers of every known legal system, the human mechanisms by which legal services are routed into situations where there is a felt need for law. Complainants are the most invisible and they may be the most important social force binding the law to other aspects of social organization.

In 1970, Donald Black and Albert J. Reiss, Jr. presented a se-. ries of eight propositions which they suggested provided “the beginning of an empirical portrait of the policing of juveniles” (Black and Reiss, 1970:76). The propositions were as follows: From Richard J. Lundman, Richard E. Sykes, and John P. Clark, “Police Control of Juveniles: A Replication,” Jo u rn a l o f R e se a rch in C rim e and D e lin q u e n c y , 15, pp. 74-91. © 1978 by National Council on Crime and Delinquency.

## THE DECISION / 131

 1. Most police encounters with juveniles arise in direct response
    to citizens who take the initiative to mobilize the police to
    action.
 2. The great bulk of police encounters with juveniles pertain to
    matters of minor legal significance.
 3. The probability of sanction by arrest is very low for juveniles
    who have encounters with the police.
 4. The probability of arrest increases with the legal seriousness of
    alleged juvenile offenses, as that legal seriousness is defined in
    criminal law for adults.
 5. Police sanctioning of juveniles strongly reflects the manifest
    preferences of citizen complainants in field encounters.
 6. The arrest rate for Negro juveniles is higher than that for
    white juveniles, but evidence that the police behaviorally orient
    themselves to race as such is absent.
 7. The presence of situational evidence linking a juvenile to a
    deviant act is an important factor in the probability of arrest.
 8. The probability of arrest is higher for juveniles who are unusually respectful toward the police and for those who are unusually disrespectful.

Black and Reiss also noted that these propositions adumbrate a general theory of social control. As compared to other studies of this type (Goldman, 1963; Piliavin and Briar, 1964; Werthman and Piliavin, 1967; Terry, 1967; Wilson, 1968), Black and Reiss studied police work with juveniles in three large metropolitan areas1 and utilized qualitative as well as quantitative data collection techniques. As a consequence, their sample was comparatively large and representative and their analysis extensive. Moreover, the impact of their findings was increased by their publication in one of the more prestigious and widely read of the sociological journals. Finally, study of the Social Science Citation Index reveals that their article received the greatest number of independent citations. Thus, in the four years following publication, Black and Reiss were cited three times more frequently than Piliavin and Briar (1964) and six times more frequently than Terry (1967). As is true of all studies, however, a fundamental question
1. The sites were Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.

## 132 / POLICE CONDUCT

which must be asked is to what extent are the data and interpretations advanced by Black and Reiss generalizable? That is, to what extent do their findings apply to police-juvenile encounters occurring in cities other than Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., and to periods other than the summer of 1966? To answer these and other questions, replication data are necessary. Replication increases confidence in research findings and furthers the cumulative nature of sociology (Selltiz et al., 1965; Denzin, 1970). Specifically, only with replication data can we be confident that Black and Reiss have, in fact, sketched the beginning of an empirical portrait of the policing of juveniles and adumbrated a general theory of social control. The central aim of the present study, therefore, is to examine the extent to which the Black and Reiss findings hold for police-juvenile encounters occurring in a large midwestern city, 1970-71.

## Method

During a fiftten-month period beginning in June 1970, we conducted a participant-as-observer study of police-citizen encounters in a midwestern city of more than 500,000 located in a SMSA of over 2,000,000. A group of seven observers, trained over three months, traveled with police on a random-time sample basis, using portable electronic coding equipment and an interaction process code. Without prior notice, observers appeared at a precinct station to ride in a randomly selected patrol car for a full shift. Which car they were to ride in was not known to the police in advance. The data base consists of 2,835 potential police-citizen contacts. When such contacts involved police-citizen interaction, they were defined as encounters (n = 1,978 involving about 9,000 citizens), and the interaction was simultaneously and sequentially content analyzed and coded using the portable equipment. Among the situational factors coded were whether the encounter was initiated by the police or the citizen, the

## THE DECISION / 133

purpose of the call, the kind of space in which the activity occurred, and whether there was conflict between citizens when the officers arrived. The nature of the interaction was measured by a variety of action and interaction codes pertaining to civility and incivility, giving and following orders, and displays of anger; and codes relating to specific kinds of violence, aggressive threats, or acts. The specific outcome of the encounter was also coded. Demographic data were collected from visual and audial observation and coded for complainant, victim, alleged violator, participants, and bystanders. Interobserver reliability was calculated utilizing Scott’s II (Scott, 1955; Krippendorf, 1970), and the coefficient for codes reported herein ranged between .70 and .80. To isolate police-juvenile encounters from other activities, the calls selected for analysis in this study met the following two criteria: (1) An alleged violator was present, and (2) the alleged violator was under eighteen years of age. Of the 1,978 encounters, 200 or approximately 10 percent met these criteria.

## Analysis and Results

In order to facilitate comparison of our findings with those of Black and Reiss, we will follow the format established in the earlier paper. Consequently, we will compare our results with the earlier findings in the following areas: (1) detection of juvenile deviance, (2) seriousness of juvenile deviance, (3) arrest rates, (4) legal seriousness and arrest, (5) citizen preference and arrest (6) race and arrest, (7) evidence and arrest, and (8) demeanor and arrest.

## Detection of Juvenile Deviance

Of the 281 encounters observed by Black and Reiss, 72 percent were citizen initiated and 28 percent were initiated by the police while in patrol (see Table 3.4). Excluding traffic violations, the proportions become 78 percent and 22 percent,

respectively. As a consequence, Black and Reiss concluded that most deviant acts by juveniles are detected by citizens rather than the police. Of the 200 encounters we observed, 52 percent were police initiated and 48 percent were initiated by citizens (see Table
3.4). Excluding traffic violations, the proportions become 34
percent and 66 percent respectively. W hat accounts for these differences is that the police department of the city we studied maintained a monthly traffic ticket quota system for patrol officers, thereby forcing patrol officers to become more proactive.2 It is necessary, therefore, to modify Black’s and Reiss’s conclusion since departmental policy, as well as the moral standards of the citizens (Black and Reiss, 1970:66), determines the detection of juvenile deviance. This modification is as follows: (1) Police have the capacity to change the ratios of police- and citizen-initiated encounters by becoming more proactive; (2) therefore, the ratios of police- and citizeninitiated encounters are dependent upon departmental policy.

## Seriousness of Juvenile Deviance

The Black and Reiss data reveal that only a minority of policejuvenile transactions involved alleged felonies (see Table 3.4). For both black and white juveniles, nearly two-thirds of the encounters observed involved nothing more serious than juvenile rowdiness. They note, however, that, compared to white juveniles, there was a greater tendency for black juveniles to be involved in alleged felonies. Finally, they note that their data do not contain evidence of differential police selection by reference to race. Our data are essentially supportive of these findings. First, only a minority of the juveniles we observed were involved in alleged felony encounters. Although more of our encounters revolved around alleged felonies than those observed by Black

and Reiss, it remains that the great bulk of police encounters with juveniles pertain to matters of minor legal significance. Second, our data are also supportive of the earlier finding that black juveniles are more frequently involved in alleged felony encounters than white juveniles. Specifically, our data, as compared to those of Black and Reiss, show an even greater rate of involvement of minority juveniles in alleged felony transactions. This is the case for both citizen- and policeinitiated encounters, but the differences between the two data bases is especially clear when one examines citizen-initiated encounters. Finally, there is also support for the earlier observation that there is no evidence of police selection of juveniles for involvement in encounters by reference to race. Based upon our data, it is clear that involvement of minority juveniles is much more frequent in citizen- than police-initiated encounters. Although these data do not speak directly to the issue of racial discrimination by the police, it does appear that Black’s and Reiss’s conclusion of an absence of evidence of discrimination is warranted. Because of the essentially supportive nature of our data, it appears appropriate to suggest two subpropositions descriptive of the seriousness of juvenile deviance. They are: (1) As compared to white juveniles, black juveniles are more frequently involved in alleged felony encounters; and (2) the greater involvement of black juveniles in alleged felony encounters does not appear to be attributable to police discrimination.

## Arrest Rates

Of the encounters observed by Black and Reiss, only 15 percent ended in arrest (see Table 3.5). They note that the remaining 85 percent of the cases typically are not included in official delinquency statistics. And, since many juvenile offenses are never detected by citizens (see Williams and Gold, 1972), and of those which are detected, only a minority are reported to the police (Ennis, 1967), it is clear that police staTable 3.5 c o m pa r is o n o f b l a c k a n d r e is s (b r ) w i t h r e pl ic a t io n d a t a (r d ) a s t o pe r c e n t o f po l ic e e n c o u n t e r s w it h ju v e - n il e SUSPECTS ACCORDING TO TYPE OF INCIDENT AND RACE OF SUSPECT,* BY FIELD DISPOSITION

tistics significantly underestimate the total volume of juvenile deviance. Of the 200 encounters we observed, only 16 percent ended in arrest. The juveniles involved in the 84 percent of the encounters which ended without an arrest were, in effect, diverted from the juvenile justice system. Therefore, it seems reasonable to note: Police diversion of juveniles from the juvenile justice system is a common practice.

## Legal Seriousness and Arrest

Black and Reiss note that since only 15 percent of the encounters they observed ended in arrest, a “high level of selectivity enters into the arrest of juveniles” (1970:68). As a consequence, they undertake an extended analysis of the factors which influence police exercise of discretion. The first of the variables they examined in relation to arrest was the legal seriousness of the alleged offense. They found that nearly three-fourths of the alleged felony encounters ended in an arrest, as compared to less than 15 percent of the rowdiness encounters and none of the noncriminal dispute encounters (see Table 3.5). They concluded that the probability of arrest increases with the legal seriousness of the alleged offense. Our replication data are supportive of this conclusion. Thus, all of the alleged felony encounters we observed ended in an attempted or actual arrest, as compared to less than 5 percent of the rowdiness encounters and none of the noncriminal dispute encounters. Thus, the Black and Reiss conclusion that legal seriousness is among the factors which influence police exercise of arrest discretion is supported.

## Citizen Preference and Arrest

A second set of factors examined by Black and Reiss was the relationship between the presence of citizen complainants and

## THE DECISION / 13 9

police exercise of arrest discretion. Black and Reiss reasoned that citizen complainants exert an important influence on police officers by their mere presence. Moreover, they reasoned that certain complainants may prefer arrest and that this preference increases the probability that the encounter will end in arrest. Their data were supportive of both observations. Thus, encounters where only a suspect was present ended in arrest less frequently than encounters where a suspect and complainant were both present (see Table 3.6). And, in those encounters where it was possible to determine citizen preference, it was clear that when complainants preferred arrest, the probability of arrest was significantly greater than when complainants preferred an informal disposition (see Table 3.7). Our data confirm these earlier findings. Thus, encounters where a suspect and complainant were both present ended more frequently in arrest than encounters where only a suspect was present (see Table 3.6). And, in those encounters where it was possible to determine citizen preference, the officers we observed complied with citizen preferences in every situation in which preference was made manifest (see Table
3.7). As a consequence, there is no reason to modify the basic
Black and Reiss conclusion that police exercise of arrest discretion is influenced by complainant preferences. It does appear reasonable, however, to add to this conclusion. As Black and Reiss indicate (1970:72), these data suggest that citizens, rather than the police, determine the total volume of official delinquency. In addition to citizens’ exercise of discretion in the context of calling the police about a delinquent act they have witnessed, in their roles as complainants, citizens influence arrest rates by their willingness to remain at the scene of an offense until the police arrive and by making their dispositional preferences manifest. W e would add the following subproposition: Citizens, therefore, largely determine official delinquency rates.

## 142 / POLICE CONDUCT

## Race and Arrest

A number of studies both before and after the Black and Reiss study have considered the relationship between race and arrest. Piliavin and Briar (1964), for example, reported that with offense held constant, black juveniles were arrested more frequently than white juveniles. Wilson (1968) reached an essentially similar conclusion for the eastern city he examined. In one sense, then the Black and Reiss conclusion of an absence of evidence of discrimination in the context of arrests stands as something of an exception when compared to other studies. Black and Reiss base their conclusion on a number of interrelated observations. They note, first, that encounters involving black suspects more frequently contained (black) complainants than encounters involving white suspects (see Table
3.6). Second, they note that black complainants more frequently lobby for arrest of black suspects than white complainants involved in encounters with white suspects (see
Table 3.7). Finally, they note that the police officers they observed complied more frequently with the arrest preferences of black complainants. Put simply, it is their argument that black complainants account for the higher rate of arrest of black juveniles. Our data are supportive of these observations. Thus, in the encounters we observed, more of the black suspect than white suspect encounters involved complainants (see Table 3.6). Moreover, it was also the case that more black than white complainants lobbied for formal police action (see Table 3.7). Finally, police compliance with the arrest preferences of black complainants was also perfect (see Table 3.7). For these reasons, we concur with the Black and Reiss conclusion that there is no evidence that the police are behaviorally oriented to the race of juvenile subjects. Instead it would appear that the higher rate of arrest for black juveniles is attributable to black complainants who lobby for formal police action.

## THE DECISION / 1 43

## Situational Evidence and Arrest

Black and Reiss note that another variable that should affect the probability of arrest is the nature of the evidence present in the situation. They examined the impact of evidence on arrest decision under three circumstances and, as can be seen in Table 3.8, encounters wherein a citizen linked a juvenile to an offense ended in arrest most frequently. Police witness encounters occupied an intermediate position, while only one of the no-evidence encounters ended in an arrest. As a consequence, Black and Reiss emphasize the importance of situational evidence in police arrest decisions. Our data, with the exception of no-evidence encounters, are essentially similar (see Table 3.8). Citizen testimony encounters ended in arrest more frequently than police witness encounters. Therefore, our data are supportive of the emphasis given the importance of situational evidence. Our data, however, do not support the finding of a low rate of arrest in no-evidence encounters. Specifically, white suspect, no-evidence encounters ended in arrest more frequently than comparable citizen testimony or police witness encounters. Additional analysis revealed an explanation: A minority of the white suspects involved in these encounters were unusually respectful or disrespectful in their interactions with the police. As a consequence, it appears necessary to offer the following by way of clarification: In no-evidence encounters, the demeanor of the juvenile is the most important determinant of whether or not formal action is taken.

## Demeanor and Arrest

A number of studies both before (Piliavin and Briar, 1964) and after (Lundman, 1974) the one being replicated here have considered the relationships between citizen demeanor and police arrest decisions. And, as in the case with [the] Black and Reiss study (see Table 3.9), most have discovered that the

## THE DECISION / 145

probability of arrest increases with level of disrespect. Once again, though, Black and Reiss are unique in reporting higher rates of arrest for unusually respectful juveniles. Our data are supportive of both observations (see Table
3.9). Thus, black and white juveniles who were antagonistic
were arrested more frequently than juveniles who were civil. However, for white juveniles, the bipolar pattern reported by Black and Reiss holds for our data also. Thus, white suspects who were very deferential in their interaction with the police were also arrested more frequently than antagonistic juveniles. The small number of very deferential black suspects precludes meaningful comparison. We would also agree with the explanation by Black and Reiss of this phenomenon. As the data from both studies make clear, the majority of police encounters with juveniles are civil. Only a minority of these juveniles are antagonistic in their interaction with the police and an even smaller group are very deferential. In one sense, deferential juveniles are suspicious because their demeanor is so clearly different from that of their colleagues. In another sense, their extreme deference is illogical or inappropriate given the circumstances in which it is expressed. Therefore: The higher rate of arrest of very deferential juveniles may be explainable by reference to the suspicions their demeanor arouses among police patrol officers. We agree with Black and Reiss, however, that “a good deal more research is needed pertaining to the relations between situational etiquette and sanctioning” (1970:75).

## Overview

We have in this paper replicated the research of Donald Black and Albert J. Reiss in the area of police control of juveniles. Based upon comparative data separated by four years and many miles, we found, in general, that our data were supportive of their earlier conclusions. We have, however, also offered a number of subpropositions, clarifications, and extensions of their basic findings. They, along with the propositions

## THE DECISION / 147

advanced by Black and Reiss and supported by us, can be summarized as follows:

  1. Most police encounters with juveniles arise in direct response
     to citizens who take the initiative to mobilize the police to
     action.
     a. However, police have the capacity to change the ratios of
     police- and citizen-initiated encounters by becoming more
     proactive.
     b. Therefore, the ratios of police- and citizen-initiated encounters are dependent upon departmental policy.
  2. The great bulk of police encounters with juveniles pertain to
     matters of minor legal significance.
     a. As compared to white juveniles, black juveniles are more
     frequently involved in alleged felony encounters.
     b. The greater involvement of black juveniles in alleged felony
     encounters does not appear to be attributable to police discrimination.
  3. The probability of sanction by arrest is very low for juveniles
     who have encounters with the police.
     a. Police diversion of juveniles from the juvenile justice system is a common practice.
  4. The probability of arrest increases with the legal seriousness
     of alleged juvenile offenses, as that legal seriousness is defined
     in criminal law for adults.
  5. Police sanctioning of juveniles strongly reflects the manifest
     preferences of citizen complaints in field encounters.
     a. Citizens, therefore, largely determine official delinquency
     rates.
  6. The arrest rate for Negro juveniles is higher than that for
     white juveniles, but evidence that the police behaviorally
     orient themselves to race as such is absent.
     a. Instead, it would appear that the higher arrest rate of black
     juveniles is attributable to the more frequent presence of black
     complainants who lobby for formal police action.
  7. The presence of situational evidence linking a juvenile to a
     deviant act is an important factor in the probability of arrest,
     a. In encounters where there is no evidence linking a juvenile
     to an offense, the demeanor of the juvenile is the most important determinant of whether or not formal action is taken.
  8. The probability of arrest is higher for juveniles who are un-

## 148 / POLICE CONDUCT

      usually respectful tow ard the p olice and fo r those w h o are unusually disrespectful.
      a. T h e higher rate o f arrest o f very deferential juveniles m ay
      be explainable b y reference to the suspicions their dem eanor arouses am ong police patrol officers.
W e would draw a number of implications from these findings. First, it would appear that we now have more than the beginning of an empirical portrait of police control of juveniles. Although additional research would clearly be beneficial, the essentially supportive nature of our efforts suggests a remarkable uniformity insofar as police control of juveniles is concerned. It appears to us, therefore, that we now have a relatively clear understanding of the factors which determine police actions toward juvenile suspects. Second, we would also agree with Black and Reiss that at some point empirical research must inform theory. And, we see these researches as speaking most directly to the labeling perspective. At the time Black and Reiss wrote, this perspective was still in the ascendency and their data were supportive of basic labeling assertions, including Becker’s that “deviant behavior is behavior that people so label” (1963:9). Since 1970, however, many students of social deviance have become disenchanted with labeling theory. Liazos (1972), for example, suggested that proponents of the labeling perspective have ignored overt institutional violence, while Thio (1973) asserted that labeling theorists are biased in favor of elites. Moreover, recent research has indicated that labeling may not be as consequential as originally indicated. Specifically, there are now reasons to believe that deviant careers do not necessarily nor even frequently follow labeling (Foster et al., 1972; Fisher, 1972). As a consequence, some have asserted that the labeling perspective has exhausted its initial promise (Manning, 1973). W e believe as did Black and Reiss, that our data point to a fundamental contribution of the labeling perspective. Namely, that professional labeling is at least as much a function of the

## THE DECISION / 149

situational contingencies surrounding a rule-violative act as the act itself. Thus, whether or not a juvenile is sanctioned for a delinquent act depends at least as much on who detected the act, whether a complainant is present, the complainant’s preference, and the demeanor of the alleged violator as on the nature of the alleged offense. To ignore this labeling insight in favor of a return to more traditional perspectives (Manning, 1973) or an exclusive focus on elites (Taylor et ah, 1973) is to ignore a fundamental contribution of the labeling perspective. Finally, we, as was the case with Black and Reiss, are unable to precisely determine the extent to which these specific findings might apply to other instances of lay and professional labeling. Paraphrasing Black and Reiss, we are uncertain as to the ways in which these findings might apply to transactions between a mate and a residually deviant spouse or a physician and an addicted colleague. However, evidence from other sources suggests that the situational contingencies surrounding a rule-violative act play an important role in many instances of lay and professional labeling.3 Study of the process whereby persons become mental patients, for instance, suggests that acquisition of patient status is a “socially structured event” rather than the “direct outcome of mental illness” (Sampson et al., 1962:88). Additionally, comparison of the experiences of skid-row excessive drinkers (Spradley, 1970) with those elite excessive drinkers (Roman, 1974) indicates that the probabilities of labeling, arrest, or involuntary treatment vary directly with resources and power of the drinker. Similar differences exist when one compares the experiences of street-level drug addicts (Waldorf, 1973), with those of physician addicts (Hessler, 1974). Therefore, the studies cited along with our replication of the Black and Reiss data yield a single general conclusion: Labeling as deviant is at least as much a function of the circumstances surrounding a rule-violative act as the act itself.

1. These three functional foci of legal control—prescription, mobilization,
and disposition—correspond roughly to the legislative, executive, and judicial dimensions of government, though they are useful in the analysis of subsystems of legal control as well as total systems. For instance, the police can be regarded as the major mobilization subsystem of the criminal justice system. Yet the police subsystem itself can be approached as a total system involving prescription, mobilization, and disposition subsystems. Cf. H . Lasswell, The Decision Process, 2 (1956).

of sanctions in criminal law. See, e.g., Andenaes, “The General Preven-

5. This generalization does not apply to proactive police operations such
as vice control or street harassment, which seldom involve a citizen complainant. By definition, street harassment is the selective and abrasive attention directed at people who are, at best, marginally liable to arrest, for example, a police command to “move on” to a group of unconventional youths. Proactive policing may involve an attack of particular moral subcultures. Compare J. Clebert, The Gypsies 87-119 (1963), with Brown, “The Condemnation and Persecution of Hippies,” Trans-Action, Sept. 1969 at 33, and W . Hagan, Indian Police and Judges (1966).
 6. See Pashukanis, “The General Theory of Law and Marxism” in Soviet
Legal Philosophy, III (H . Babb transl. 1951).
 7. This is true historically as well; legal systems usually have made the
citizen complainant the sine qua non of legal mobilization except under circumstances posing a direct threat to political order. A well-known example was the Roman legal process, where even extreme forms of personal violence required the initiative of a complainant before government sanctions were imposed. See generally A. Lintott, Violence in Republican Rome (1968). A theory of legal control should treat as problematic the capacity and willingness of governments to initiate cases and sanction violators in the absence of an aggrieved citizen demanding justice. See generally S. Ranulf, Moral Indignation and Middle Class Psychology: A Sociological Study (1938).

8. The norm of universalism reflected in systems of public law in advanced societies is a norm of impersonalism: The police are expected to
enforce the law impersonally. But by giving complainants a strong role in the determination of outcomes, the police personalize the criminal law. This pattern allows fellow family members and friends to mobilize the police to handle their disputes with little danger that the police will impose standards foreign to their relationships. A t the level of disputes between strangers, however, the same pattern of police compliance with complainants can, given moral diversity, result in a form of discriminatory enforcement. A law enforcement process that takes no account of the degree of intimacy between complainant and suspect may also upset the peculiar balance of close social relationships. See Kawashima, “Dispute Resolution in Contemporary Japan,” in Law in Japan: The Legal Order in a Changing Society, 41 (A. von Mehren ed. 1964).

distance influences the probability of criminal prosecution. J. Hall, Theft, Law and Society, 318 (2d ed. 1952).

14. For example, in Japan disputes that arise across rather than within
communities are more likely to result in litigation. See Kawashima, supra note 8, at 45. In American Chinatowns disputes that arise between Chinese and non-Chinese are far more likely to result in litigation than disputes between Chinese. See Grace, “Justice, Chinese Style,” Case & Com., Jan-Feb., 1970, at 50. The same is true of disputes between gypsies and non-gypsies as compared to disputes between gypsies. See J. Clebert, supra note 5, at 90. Likewise, in the United States in the first half of the 19th century, crimes committed between Indians generally were left to the tribes. See F. Prucha, American Indian Policy in the Formative Years. The Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts, 88-212 (1962). In medieval England the same sort of pattern obtained in the legal condition of the Jews. Ordinary English rules applied to legal dealings between Jews and the King and between Jews and Christians, but disputes between Jew and Jew were heard in Jewish tribunals and decided under Jewish law. See F. Pollock & F. Maitland, The History of English Law, 468-75 (2d ed., 1898).

22. Of course, “Discrimination” can be defined to include any de facto
unequal treatment, regardless of its causes. See L. Mayhew, Law and Equal Opportunity 59-60 (1968). The evidence in the Article simply indicates that blacks are treated differently not because they are blacks, but because they manifest other behavioral patterns, such as disrespect for the police, more frequently than whites. The question of w hy blacks dis-

proportionately show disrespect for the police cannot be addressed with the observational data. W e could speculate, for example, that in anticipation of harsh treatment blacks often behave disrespectfully toward the police, thereby setting in motion a pattern that confirms their expectations. Despite the Article’s finding of nondiscrimination the police officers observed did reveal considerable prejudice in their attitudes toward blacks. See generally Black & Reiss, “Patterns of Behavior in Police and Citizen Transactions,” in 2 President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Studies in Crime and Law Enforcement in Major Metropolitan Areas 132-39. See also Deutscher, “W ords and Deeds: Social Science and Social Policy,” 13 Social Problems 235 (1966).

societal delegated privilege to exercise non-negotiable coercive force. A secondary aim is to assess the adequacy of the commonweal conception of the police. Specifically, the focus of the present study is on the factors which influence the dispositional decisions made by police officers in their encounters with public drunkenness offenders. Public drunkenness was selected for analysis because it is the single most frequent offense for which citizens are annually arrested (U.S. Department of Justice, 1969:110-111). Public drunkenness is a problem regularly encountered by the police and it is suggested that examination of the factors which relate to the exercise of police arrest discretion in this circumstance allows partial determination of the extent to which the police routinely operate outside the rule of law (Skolnick, 1966).

## Method

During the 15 months beginning in June, 1970, a quantitative participant-as-observer study of police-citizen encounters was undertaken in “Midwest City,” which had a 1970 population of over one-half million and is located in a SMA of over two million. A group of seven observers trained in the use of an interaction code (Sykes, 1973) travelled with the police on a random time sample basis. Without prior notice, observers appeared at a precinct station with directions to ride on a randomly selected patrol car for a full shift. Which car they were to ride on was not known to the police in advance. The data . . . consist of 195 non-felony arrest discretionary encounters wherein the major issue confronting the police officer is the drunkenness of the offender. The logic employed in the analysis of the data is that of Rosenberg (1968) and the manner of data presentation that of Black (1971). The dependent variable is percent of encounters ending in arrest and a (Z) score difference of proportions test is used to determine initially the presence or absence of statistically significant differences (Blalock, 1960:176ff.).

## Results

The police are lenient in their encounters with drunkenness offenders. Of the 195 encounters which could, have ended in arrest, only 31 percent did. It appears that the police are aware of the stigmatizing effects of formal action (Piliavin and Briar, 1964; Bittner, 1967b) and are reluctant to employ arrest in the majority of these encounters. Moreover, the courts and jails already crowded with drunkenness offenders (Mileski, 1971; Spradley, 1970; Wiseman, 1970) exert pressure on the police to hold down drunkenness arrests. A basic initial observation, then, is that it is not the criminal offense of public drunkeness which leads to the arrest of drunkenness offenders. The police are aware of large numbers of eligible offenders and select only a minority for formal processing.

## A. INITIATOR

A-l. Most drunkenness encounters arise through citizen rather than police initiative . The police are primarily a reactive social control agency dependent upon citizens for basic organizational inputs (Reiss, 1971:64). Row A of Table 4.1 shows that the vast majority of these drunkenness encounters (143 or 73 percent) arose through citizen rather than police initiative. An implication of this finding is that involvement in the criminal justice system for the offense of public drunkenness is primarily a result of lay rather than professional labeling (Mechanic, 1962). In the absence of citizen inputs the police would be aware of significantly fewer public drunkenness offenses. A-2. When the police do initiate an encounter with a drunkenness offender, the probability of arrest is significantly greater. Despite police dependence upon citizen inputs, uniformed patrol officers are expected to devote their non-call time to proactive cruising. Row A of Table 4.1 shows that when this proTable 4.1 pe r c e n t o f po l ic e -c it iz e n e n c o u n t e r s e n d in g in ARREST ACCORDING TO SELECTED CONDITIONS OF T H E EN C O U N TER

active policing results in contact with a drunkenness offender, the probability of arrest is significantly greater: 42 percent of police initiated encounters ended in arrest as compared to 27 percent of citizen initiated (Z = 2.00, p C .0 5 ).1 This higher rate of arrest appears to reflect the greater conspicuousness of offenses discovered by the police. Uniformed patrol officers are legally constrained from routine proactive policing of closed private places and consensually constrained from proactive observation of closed public places. As a consequence, the offenses patrol officers proactively discover are the most conspicuous: offenders on sidewalks, streets, alleys, parks, and doorways.

## B. LOCATION

The police are sensitive to the locations of the encounters in which they are involved. Bittner (1967a), for example, has suggested that police practices in skidrow areas reflect the relative isolation of these areas: the police are freer to develop and employ peace keeping techniques apart from legal mandates. Petersen (1971) reported that downtown drunkenness offenders were arrested more frequently because of the effort involved in taking offenders home. Black (1968) reported that the type of place to which the police are called allows prediction of the type of problem which gave rise to the call. B-l. Drunkenness offenders encountered in downtown locations are arrested significantly more frequently than offenders in other locations. Row B-l of Table 4.1 shows that encounters occurring in downtown locations ended significantly more fre1. It was also found that police initiated encounters were “blocked” (Rosenberg, 1968:26ff.) with encounters occurring in the downtown area of Midwest City. Since downtown encounters also ended significantly more frequently in arrest, I controlled for the effects of location. The result was that the relationship remained essentially unchanged: 50 percent of police-initiated downtown encounters ended in arrest as compared to 40 percent of citizen-initiated downtown encounters.

## ABUSE OF ARREST DISCRETION / 187

quently in arrest than encounters located elsewhere (43 percent versus 27 percent, Z = 2.17, p < .05).2 In part, the higher rate of arrest reflects the greater effort involved in returning downtown offenders home. A neglected dimension, however, would appear to be the greater conspicuousness of downtown offenses. Many urban areas confront the problem of maintaining viable center city areas, and public drunkenness offenders pose esthetic, if not criminal, problems. As Chambliss (1966) pointed out in the context of vagrancy laws, it appears that public drunkenness laws are also employed to clear downtown streets of unsightly citizens. B-2. Drunkenness offenders encountered in closed public places are arrested significantly more frequently than offenders in other types of places. Row B-2 of Table 4.1 shows that encounters occurring in closed public places such as libraries and bus depots ended in arrest significantly more frequently than encounters occurring in open public places such as sidewalks (71 percent versus 31 percent, Z = 3.42, p < .0 1 ) or closed private places such as apartments (71 percent versus 23 percent, Z = 3.42, p < .01).3 Here again, the dimension of offense conspicuousness would appear to play a determining role. Encounters occurring on sidewalks or private residences are, respectively, likely to have large unfocussed audiences or small focussed audiences. Encounters in closed, public places, in contrast, are likely to have large focussed audiences consisting, for example, of customers and a proprietor. In this latter instance, the offense is likely to be significantly more conspicuous.
2. As previously noted, downtown location is blocked with police initiation. W hen initiator is controlled, however, location continues to exert an
independent effect on arrest. It is clear, at the same time, that interactive or cojoint effects emerge: 1) 50 percent of police-initiated downtown encounters ended in arrest as compared to 40 percent of citizen-initiated downtown encounters; 2) 38 percent of police initiated non-downtown encounters ended in arrests compared to 24 percent of citizen initiated non-downtown encounters.
3. Detailed elaborative analysis revealed no evidence which leads me to
conclude that the relationship is spurious.

## 188 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

## C. COM PLAINANTS

C-l. The prese?ice of complaina?its is not one of the conditio?is relating to police arrest of drunkenness offenders. A number of recent studies have suggested the importance of citizen complainants insofar as police actions are concerned. Black and Reiss (1970:70), for example, attributed the higher rate of arrest of Afro-American juveniles to the presence of citizen complainants who successfully lobby for arrest. Black (1970:738fF.) similarly reported that the police are sensitive to citizen preferences regarding the writing of a formal report of a criminal incident. Row C-l of Table 4.1 shows, however, that 27 percent of the encounters with a complainant present ended in arrest as compared to 34 percent with no complainant present (Z = 1.91, p > .05). Although the data are not directly comparable, this was the obverse of what was expected, and additional analysis was undertaken to determine whether the relationship was distorted. Of the possible distorting variables, initiator appeared most logical, since in police initiated encounters complainants are rarely present. The relationship between complainant presence and arrest was, therefore, elaborated by controlling for initiator. It was found that 27 percent of citizen initiated encounters with a complainant present ended in arrest as compared to 28 percent with no complainant. It would appear that in drunkenness encounters, exercise of police arrest discretion is not related to the presence or absence of citizen complainants.

## D. OFFENDER DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS

D-l. The sex of the drunkenness offender is not one of the conditions relating to the exercise of police arrest discretion . A number of previous studies (Goldman, 1963) have indicated that female offenders are infrequently involved in the criminal justice system via police arrest. The explanation has been that women commit fewer legally sanctionable acts; and when they do, the police are reluctant to arrest them. The data in Row

## ABUSE OF ARREST DISCRETION / 189

D-l of Table 4.1 provide some support for both propositions showing that drunkenness offenders are infrequently women and when they are, arrest is not likely. Thus, the police arrested 34 percent of male offenders as compared to 20 percent of female offenders. The difference, however, is not statistically significant (Z = 1.10, p > .05). D-2. Age is not one of the conditions relating to the exercise of police arrest discretion. Row D-2 of Table 4.1 shows that arrest of drunkenness offenders occurs more frequently when the offender is over 25 years of age. The difference, however, is not statistically significant: 24 percent of encounters wherein the offender was under the age of 25 ended in arrest as compared to 37 percent of over 25 encounters (Z = 1.83, p > .05). D-3. The police discriminate against N ative American drunkenness offenders on the basis of race. The question of whether the police discriminate against certain citizens on the basis of race has repeatedly been addressed by students of the police. Piliavin and Briar (1964), for example, reported that AfroAmerican juveniles were arrested more frequently than white American juveniles and argued that police surveillance tactics resulting in greater encounter hostility accounted for this difference. Black and Reiss (1970:70) attributed the higher rates of arrest of Afro-American juveniles to the presence of complainants who successfully lobby for arrest. Wilson (1968) suggested that the higher rate of arrest of Afro-American juveniles in “Eastern City” was due to an absence of police professionalism. The essential interpretation, then, seems to be that while minority arrest is more frequent, it is for reasons other than racial prejudice. As is clear, however, the reference is to Afro-American citizens. Row D-3 of Table 4.1 shows that Native American drunkenness offenders were arrested significantly more frequently than white American drunkenness offenders (53 percent versus 26 percent, Z = 3.08, p < .0 1 ) and more frequently, but not significantly so, than Afro-American offenders (53 percent versus 33 percent, Z = 1.21, p > .05). Afro-American offenders were not arrested significantly more frequently than white

## 190 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

American offenders (33 percent versus 26 percent, Z = .54, p > .05).4 It appears that one of the conditions of the relationship between race and arrest is the specific racial identity of the offender. That is, while no evidence of racial discrimination against Afro-American citizens exists, evidence of racial discrimination against Native American citizens does. D-4. The police discriminate against declassified drunkenness offenders on the basis of class status. As with race, class status has previously been identified as one of the conditions relating to the exercise of police arrest discretion (Petersen, 1971; Quinney, 1970; Skolnick, 1966; Silver, 1967; Spradley, 1970; Werthman and Piliavin, 1967). The assertion has been that powerless citizens are arrested more frequently by the police than the relatively powerful. Row D-4 of Table 4.1 shows that for the offense of public drunkenness, arrest is significantly reserved for declassified citizens such as chronic drunkenness offenders and others on the fringes of the dominant culture. Thus, 52 percent of declassified offenders were arrested by the police as compared to 25 percent of blue-collar offenders (Z =
3.32, p < .0 1 ) and 20 percent of white-collar offenders (Z =
2.15, p < .05). Blue-collar offenders were not arrested significantly more frequently than white-collar offenders (25 percent versus 20 percent, Z = .42, p > .05).5

4. Elaborating upon the significantly higher rate of arrest of Native
American drunkenness offenders, it was found that Native American encounters occurred more frequently in downtown locations, involved more complainants, and involved more declassified offenders. As a consequence additional analysis introducing appropriate controls was undertaken. The results were as follows: 1) when location was controlled, Native American offenders continued to be arrested more frequently; 2) when complainant presence was controlled, Native American offenders continued to be arrested more frequently; and 3) when class status was controlled, Native American offenders were arrested more frequently. W ithin the limits of this analysis, it appears that the police discriminate against Native American public drunkenness offenders.
5. Elaborating upon the significantly higher rate of arrest of declassified
offenders it was found that declassified encounters occurred more frequently in downtown locations and more frequently involved Native American offenders. As a consequence additional analysis introducing

## ABUSE OF ARREST DISCRETION / 1 91

## E. DISRESPECT

E-l. The probability of arrest increases as public drunkenness offenders are disrespectful in their interaction w ith the police . As numerous others have found (cf., Piliavin and Briar, 1964; Black and Reiss, 1970), the police are sensitive to the demeanor of the citizens with whom they interact and more frequently arrest those who evidence disrespect for the police. In this section the frequencies of displays of temper, violence, impoliteness, and non-compliance are examined as they relate to the exercise of police arrest discretion. The data substantiate previous findings indicating that police selection of drunkenness offenders relates to the level of disrespect shown the police (see Table 4.2). Row_A of Table 4.2 shows that citizens who evidence “high” (Xi > X) levels of temper6 in their interaction with the police are arrested more frequently than offenders with “low” (0 —Xi —X) levels of temper. The difference, however, is not statistically significant (42 percent versus 29 percent, Z = 1.63, p > .05). Row B of Table 4.2 shows that acts of potential or actual physical violence7 by drunkenness offenders play so small a role in these encounters as to be nearly invisible. Thus, only seven encounters involved citizen violence and four ended in arrest while 31 percent of the violence free encounters ended in arrest. The role of violence in police selection of drunkenness offenders, in short, is negligible.
appropriate controls was undertaken. The results were as follows: 1) when location was controlled, declassified encounters continued to end more frequently in arrest; 2) when race was controlled, declassified class status continued to exert an independent effect on arrest.
6. Temper was considered displayed whenever a citizen raised his/her
voice above a normal conversational level, when anger or hostility was present in an actor’s voice, and/or when a verbal statement contained a threat to normal freedom.
7. Potential or actual acts of physical violence included verbal threats of
physical attack, efforts at territorial or physical restraint, fighting, making weapons ready for use, and/or the use of weapons.

Row C of Table 4.2 shows that citizens who are impolite8 in their interaction with the police are arrested significantly more frequently than offenders who are less impolite. Thus, 44 percent of drunkennness offenders with high levels of impoliteness were arrested as compared to 26 percent of drunkenness offenders with low levels of impoliteness (Z = 2.57, p < .01).

with the orders given them by the police are arrested significantly more frequently than citizens who comply with those orders. The police arrested 44 percent of drunkenness offenders with high levels of non-compliance as compared to 28 percent with low levels of non-compliance (Z = 2.00, p < .05). The data in Table 4.2, in short, confirm the oft reported observation that police selection of citizens for formal processing by the criminal justice system relates to the level of disrespect shown the police. Drunkenness offenders who evidence disrespect by being impolite in their interaction with the police or by failing to comply with police orders are more likley to be arrested; offenders who evidence respect are arrested significantly less frequently. At this point it becomes necessary to deviate from the procedure followed thus far of footnoting results of elaborative analyses. The reason is clear in light of the data just presented: it is possible that the higher rates of arrest of Native American and declassified public drunkenness offenders are attributable to higher levels of disrespect. Piliavin and Briar (1964) and Black (1970), as noted previously, found that the higher rates of arrest of Afro-American juveniles were a function of the higher levels of disrespect evidenced by these offenders. Elaborative analysis permits rejection of this rival explanation. E-2. The higher rate of arrest of Native American offenders is not attributable to the levels of disrespect shown the police. The data in Section A of Table 4.3 show that when level of disrespect is held constant, Native American offenders are arrested more frequently than white American offenders.

frequently than blue-collar offenders. The small number of “white-collar cases” precludes meaningful comparison. Thus:

  1. 41 percent of declassified offenders with low levels of impoliteness were arrested as compared to 21 percent of bluecollar offenders with low levels of impoliteness;
  2. 71 percent of declassified offenders with high levels of impoliteness were arrested as compared to 38 percent of bluecollar offenders with high levels of impoliteness;
  3. 48 percent of declassified offenders with low levels of noncompliance were arrested as compared to 23 percent of bluecollar offenders with low levels of non-compliance; and
  4. 64 percent of declassified offenders with high levels of noncompliance were arrested as compared to 39 percent of bluecollar offenders with high levels of non-compliance.

These data, then, support the earlier specifications of the relationships between class status, race, and the exercise of police arrest discretion. That is, within the limits of this elaborative analysis it appears that the police discriminate against declassified and Native American public drunkenness offenders.

## Discussion

The central aim of the present study has been to determine the extent to which the police abuse the societal delegated privilege to exercise coercive force. The specific focus was on the factors which relate to police arrest of public drunkenness offenders; and it appears that two comments are in order. First, if we look at these findings as a whole, it appears that three factors relate most directly to police selection of certain drunkenness offenders for formal processing by the criminal justice system: 1) offense conspicuousness; 2) offender powerlessness; and 3) offender disrespect. The data provide three indicators of the importance of offense conspicuousness. If the police, given their limited resources, happen upon an offense, arrest is more likely than if a citizen reports an offense to the police. Further, downtown

## 196 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

offenders and those encountered in closed, public places were also arrested more frequently. In drunkenness encounters, then, one of the factors which determines whether or not an offender will be treated formally is the conspicuousness of the offense. Offenders who confine their drunkenness to locations and places not easily observed by the police and/or other citizens are not likely to be arrested—even though involved in an encounter with the police. Offenders, on the other hand, who are encountered by the police in conspicuous locations stand a significantly greater chance of being arrested. The role of offender powerlessness is suggested by two of these findings: 1) the higher rate of arrest of Native American offenders; and 2) the higher rate of arrest of declassified offenders. Until very recently Native Americans have been among the least powerful of American minority groups (Marden and Meyer, 1962:326ff.). Declassified citizens constitute an equally powerless minority within the dominant American culture (Spradley, 1970). Why, then, do the police discriminate against certain citizens on the basis of their perceptions of powerlessness? Arrest decisions must be made quickly by police officers and in the absence, therefore, of careful evaluation of the fragmentary information immediately available. Moreover, the decision to arrest generally evokes vocal and, occasionally, physical opposition by the citizen being arrested. As a consequence, the possibility of making a “mistake” (Chambliss and Liell, 1966) by arresting someone who will make a scene, draw attention to the officer via a false arrest suit, or draw attention to the department via community publicity of the arrest, looms large in the mind of many police officers. To protect themselves against potential mistakes, police officers classify arrests along a continuum from safe to risky. An arrest is considered safe if the offense is minor and the offender is not likely to have the resources to cause the arrest to be a mistake. Stated simply: it appears that Native American and declassified public drunkenness offenders are arrested significantly more frequently because the probability of making a mistake is significantly less.

## ABUSE OF ARREST DISCRETION / 197

The role of offender disrespect, finally, has been documented in numerous other studies; and it was hardly surprising, therefore, that the probability of arrest for the offense of public drunkenness also increases as an offender is disrespectful toward the police. Despite the frequency of this finding, it is necessary to remind ourselves that it is not illegal or criminal to be disrespectful to the police. Police officials have recognized this in theory, if not in fact: “The officer must remember that there is no law against making a policeman angry and that he cannot charge a man with making him angry” (Wilson, 1963:117). As this and numerous other studies make clear, however, citizens are routinely arrested for the offense of being disrespectful. The second point follows from the observation on the relationship between offender disrespect and arrest: all of the above factors are clearly non-legal in nature. As compared to legal seriousness or questions of evidence, for example, nowhere are offense conspicuousness, offender powerlessness, or offender disrespect recognized as legal grounds for arrest. These and other (Black, 1970; Black and Reiss, 1970; Goldman, 1963; Petersen, 1971; Piliavin and Briar, 1964; Skolnick, 1966; Spradley, 1970; Wilson, 1968) findings document the extent to which the police routinely operate outside the rule of the law. In a society ostensibly committed to “equal justice under the law” it has been demonstrated that police arrest of public drunkenness offenders reflects the influence of non-legal factors. From the perspective of the police as a commonweal organization, the conclusion which of necessity must be drawn is that the police are currently abusing the privilege delegated by society to exercise non-negotiable coercive force.

Public drunkenness may appear to be of minor significance to a criminal justice system concerned with major crimes involving property loss and violence. It is, after all, a “victimless crime” (Schur, 1965:265-271). But public drunkenness is important in at least two respects. First, the extensive efforts to control public drunkenness renders it significant in the allocation of criminal justice resources. Arrests for public drunkenness in 1975, for example, totaled over 1,217,000 nationwide (U.S. Department of Justice, 1975:179), more than for any other category of crime. This figure may even under-represent the total extent of legal control, since evidence indicates that informal non-arrest processing is frequent (Bittner, 1967; Black

and Reiss, 1970:64; Wilson, 1972:118-135; Lundman, 1974: 129). Resources expended in pre-arrest handling, arrest, transport, judicial disposition, and incarceration are substantial. In addition, many critics have charged that processing of offenders often violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the law of criminal procedure (Stern, 1967; Packer, 1968:345-349; Wiseman, 1970:90-91; Bahr, 1973:231-238). These critics suggest that procedural violations constitute yet another cost to the criminal justice system: the system’s credibility is undermined by arbitrary processing. . . .

## Mobilization and Public Drunkenness

Although about five thousand public drunks are arrested in America daily, and many more encounters between police and public inebriates end in informal processing, little is known about the situational factors involved in police decisions to invoke or withhold arrest. Some authors have stated that police enforce drunkenness laws indiscriminately, making multiple arrests to keep streets clear of unsightly individuals and using arrests to control disorderly persons even when evidence of intoxication is questionable or absent (LaFave, 1965:441, n. 13; Bittner, 1967; Spradley, 1970:82-83; Wilson, 1972:130). It is difficult, however, to determine how common these practices are, since claims rest on illustrative or anecdotal evidence. Most arrests for drunkenness take place in the “skid row” sections of large cities and involve lower class, unemployed males with prior records of drunkenness arrest (Nimmer, 1971: 1-3). This information provides a profile of those arrested. It fails to provide information about those whom the police encountered but did not arrest, or to indicate why one person fitting this profile was arrested while another was processed informally. For this information, it is necessary to turn to direct observational studies of police contacts with public inebriates. The few studies available indicate that police mobilization in this area tends to be proactive (Black, 1971:1092, n. 3); and that disorderly conduct accompanying intoxifica-

## 202 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

tion increases the likelihood of arrest (Bittner, 1967; Black, 1971:1092, n. 3; Lundman, 1974:134). . . .

## Police Processing

The study was conducted in Seattle, Washington . . . over a period of . . . [six] . . . months in 1973. . . . The . . . cit[y] . . . [is a] . . . major port, . . . the center . . . of . . . [a] . . . large metropolitan area, . . . and . . . public drunkenness arrests are a major percentage of all criminal arrests in the five years preceding the study (thirty-six percent to forty-six percent in Seattle . . . ) . . . . Seattle exemplifies the traditional legal strategy of public drunkenness control. Intoxicated persons encountered by police in a public place were, at the time of the study, subject to arrest under a municipal ordinance prohibiting drunkenness. Those arrested were transported to the city jail and placed in a “drunk tank” until their trial the following day. . . .

## METHODS

The data were collected through participant observation. One observer spent eight months accompanying uniformed officers of the Seattle Police Department (SPD) on routine patrol. In . . . [Seattle] . . . a preliminary month of observation prior to formal data collection helped accustom police . . . personnel to the observer. In addition, during the data collection period, all personnel were observed on more than one occasion to reduce the effects of the observer’s presence. The unit of analysis employed in the study is the “drunkenness control encounter”: an encounter between a control agent and a citizen in which there is an opportunity for drunkenness control (e.g., . . . a police order to disperse . . .) . . . or an actual instance of such control. This encounter is defined as beginning when a police officer . . . : (1) has contact with a seemingly intoxicated subject; or (2) attempts formally or in-

## ABUSE OF ARREST DISCRETION / 203

formally to process a subject as if the subject were intoxicated; or (3) receives a personal request from the subject for appropriate processing. The encounter is defined as ending when face-to-face interaction ceases. The annual total of such encounters in . . . Seattle . . . is unknown. A tentative estimate, based in part on results reported here, indicates that such encounters may exceed seventy thousand per year for the SPD. . . . Because the natural occurrence of these encounters is unpredictable, stratified random sampling of time cells was employed as the major sampling technique . . . (see Reiss, 1971: 9- 10) . In Seattle, police patrol units were also sampled to yield geographic differentiation and the opportunity to observe a crosssection of personnel. . . .

## FINDINGS

The methods described above yielded 740 cases in the Seattle sample. . . . Information was gathered on various aspects of each encounter. These include whether the encounter was reactively or proactively initiated; the age, sex, and race of the encountered subject; the subject’s degree of intoxication;1 whether the subject appeared injured or ill;12 the subject’s demeanor toward the control agents;3 whether the subject was
1. T w o common criteria associated with impaired balance and small motor
coordination were employed in the measurement of degree of intoxication: slurred speech and staggering, unsteady gait.
2. Three categories are employed in the classification of signs of illness
or injury: (1) no apparent illness or injury; (2) slight illness or injury conditions that might cause medical concern but are neither life-threatening nor highly incapacitating such as vomiting, broken finger, cut lip; (3) serious illness or injury conditions of a life-threatening or highly debilitating nature such as convulsions, broken leg, severe bleeding, difficulty breathing.
3. Four categories of demeanor are used: (1) friendly-cooperative; (2)
neutral-resigned; (3) hostile-abusive; and (4) violent. The first category consists of all cases in which the citizen was deferential; greeted and/or addressed control agents in a polite manner; com-

seen by control agents to engage in criminal activity beyond simple drunkenness or public drinking; whether there was a citizen complainant present; the expressed preferences of complainant regarding the processing of the subject; and finally, whether the case ended in formal processing . . .—arrest for drunkenness in the SPD sample. . . . The distribution of cases over categories of these variables is listed . . . in Table 4.4. The data in Table 4.4 indicate:

      1. SPD . . . encounters . . . are overwhelmingly proactive. . . .
      2. SPD encounters [mainly] involve . . . [subjects who are bebetween 30 and 59]. . . .
      3. . . . SPD . . . encounters involve males almost exclusively.
      4. SPD encounters . . . involve . . . [more] . . . non-whites
         than whites.*4
      5. . . . The bulk of the encounters . . . involve highly intoxicated persons.
      6. . . . SPD . . . encounters . . . involve subjects who exhibit
         a neutral or resigned demeanor.
      7. Most SPD . . . encounters involve subjects who exhibit no
         signs of injury or illness.
      8. Disorderly or criminal activity [other than simple drunkenness or drinking in public] on the part of subjects is seldom
         observed; . . . only about one per cent of the encounters involved serious illegal activity.
      9. On-scene complainants are . . . [infrequently present].

plied with agent request/demands, or politely or apologetically refused to comply. The second category includes cases in which citizens answered grudgingly; addressed control agents in monosyllables; and complied with demands reluctantly. The third category covers encounters in which citizens verbally abused or expressed dislike for control agents; questioned their authority or motives; and threatened harm. The fourth category refers to cases in which a citizen struck or otherwise attempted to injure a control agent.
4. Native Americans are the single most frequently encountered group in
the Seattle sample. Their representation in the sample is far greater than their representation in the Seattle population. W hites are the second most frequently encountered group. Their representation in the sample falls below their representation in the Seattle population. Blacks, hispanics, and orientals are under-represented.

   1. Arrest for public drunkenness is unrelated to how subjects

      initiated encounters are about equally likely to result in arrest.
   2. [T]he likelihood of arrest for drunkenness . . . appears to
      increase slightly as the age of the subject increases.
   3. Female subjects are very rarely arrested for public drunkenness in Seattle. It seems the SPD systematically diverts females from formal processing.

## 208 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

      cases according to the expressed preferences of the citizen
      complainants present.

## Factors Predicting Outcome

The findings reported above indicate that formal processing by . . . the Seattle police is most highly related to normative aspects of the encounter situation. In the police encounters, violation of formal, legal norms regarding drunkenness or other minor delicts, accompanied by a state of intoxication, increases the likelihood of arrest for drunkenness. The subject’s demeanor toward control agents—an indicator of conformity to informal, situational norms of interaction— also affects the likelihood of formal processing. In the police encounters, the violation of situational norms through failure to show deference to or cooperate with a police officer increases the likelihood of arrest for drunkenness. . . . Other studies of police-citizen encounters (Westley, 1970:123-128; Reiss, 1971:144-149) . . . report similar relationships between demeanor and formal processing. Perhaps these relationships are characteristic of the “social welfare model” of social control. Social control based on the “social welfare model”—a model which assumes that the good of the community will be defined and enforced by control agents without regard for the wishes of those subject to control (see Black, 1973:138)—tends to sanction uncooperative subjects by intensifying formal processing. This pattern is seen in criminal law settings. . . .
    The basic interactive unit in the drunkenness control encounter is the control agent and the subject. The encounter is
also accessible to third parties whose presence introduces an additional—albeit informal—control element. Citizen complainants are one example. Findings indicate that the likelihood of formal processing increases if a citizen complainant is present. The expressed preference of complainants is also a major predictor of formal processing: . . . police officers . . . tend to process in accordance with complainant preferences. In police encounters, the presence of a citizen complainant is a stronger

## ABUSE OF ARREST DISCRETION / 209

predictor of formal processing than is the complainant’s expressed preferences for such processing.

## Patterns of Processing

Two very interesting findings do not concern the prediction of encounter outcome, but affect overall processing patterns. The first is the relative proportion of reactively and proactively initiated encounters. . . . Police encounters are overwhelmingly proactive: almost seventy-five percent of all SPD encounters occur through police initiative. This finding is consistent with reports of a high degree of proactivity in the enforcement of drunkenness ordinances (Black, 1971:1092, n. 3; Wilson, 1972:118). . . .
    The second notable processing pattern, and perhaps the most
striking finding to emerge from the data, is the proportion of cases formally processed. . . . Only about fourteen percent of the SPD encounters end in formal processing. . . .
    A number of factors contribute to this pattern. The first,
and perhaps the most obvious is the breadth of jurisdiction. . . . Public drunkenness is but one—and one of the least serious—of the categories of criminality for which the SPD is responsible. Arresting all or most of the public inebriates encountered would cause the diversion of resources from more serious criminal activity. . . .
    This pattern is also reinforced by police exercise of discretion. . . . Those who occupy mobilizational roles in law
. . . tend to exercise discretion according to overarching decision rules. In contemporary American criminal law, the rule is: when in doubt, withdraw formal control. This decision rule represents formally stated rules of evidence and procedure which support the legal ideal of presumption of innocence. The legal dictum is: “Better one hundred guilty men go free than one innocent man be convicted.” This constitutes a willingness to tolerate alpha or “false negative” errors. . . .
    Police processing of public inebriates appears to display an
economy of legal intervention consistent with the following

## 210 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

general proposition: “Law becomes implicated in social life to the extent that other forms of control are weak or unavailable” (Black, 1972:1099). This suggests that law will support less formal modes of control and will assume the role of control system of last resort. This proposition accounts for the low proportion of drunkenness control encounters which end in arrest: other forms of control—in this case informal types of processing such as dispersal—are available to officers and often suffice to remove an intoxicated person from public view. The pattern of characteristics predicting the outcome of police encounters is also consistent with the above-stated proposition: police are most likely to arrest the highly intoxicated and the uncooperative. The former are probably unable to obey commands associated with informal control. The latter, it may be assumed, refuse to cooperate. Finally, the presence of a citizen complainant in the encounter situation is prima facie evidence that informal control has broken down: the complainant was either unwilling or unable to control the situation informally.

An essential interpretation to be drawn out of the existing literature on police exercise of discretion is that police officers routinely violate norms emphasizing the consistent or equitable treatment of citizens. The bulk of the existing literature suggests that factors such as2 demeanor, social class, sex, age, and race routinely influence the decisions made by police patrol officers (Bittner, 1967a, 1967b; Black, 1970; Black and Reiss, 1970; Gardiner, 1968; Goldman, 1963; LaFave, 1965; Lundman, 1974; Lundman, Sykes and Clark, 1978; Marshall and Purdy, 1972; Petersen, 1971; Piliavin and Briar, 1964; Rubinstein, 1973; Skolnick, 1975; Wilson, 1968).

police practices. Piliavin and Briar (1964), for example, explained the higher rates of arrest of black juveniles in terms of the attitudes and prejudices of individual police officers. Black (1970), by contrast, reported that report writing by police was largely a function of the preferences of the citizens involved. According to Black (1970), race is unrelated to report writing. Despite this disagreement, common to nearly all explanations of police exercise of discretion is a focus on the actors involved in the decision making situation. And, it must be admitted that such a focus is seemingly logical. Police organizations are somewhat unique in that low level members, street level patrol officers, possess a great deal of latitude in their action. To a large extent, the work of the patrol officer is unsupervised and, to a lesser extent, it is unsupervisable. The individual police officer, therefore, is relatively free to act on the basis of individual attitudes and prejudices. Equally, the literature suggests that police officers are sensitive to the attitudes and preferences of the citizens involved in an encounter (Sykes and Clark, 1975) and that their actions frequently reflect compliance with the stated preferences of citizens (Lundman, Sykes and Clark, 1978). Police exercise of discretion, therefore, would appear to reflect the result of some type of compromise between the preferences of the officers and citizens involved in an encounter. The fundamental purpose of the present study, however, is to suggest an expanded imagery. Specifically, it is the thesis of the present study that police exercise of discretion is a function of relations between organizational norms and employee concerns with autonomy. This thesis will be advanced in the context of an examination of police work with traffic law violators.

## Orientation

Traffic law violations are the single most frequent reason for contacts between police patrol officers and citizens (Ross, I960; Skolnick, 1966; Gardiner, 1968). However, citizen conceptions of the police mission, the perceived innocuousness of

## 214 / POLICE iMISCONDUCT

the offense, and the circumstances in which traffic law violations occur contribute to the individual citizen’s dismay when cited for a traffic offense. As a result, citizens frequently offer opposition to a traffic citation and traffic stops are major sources of friction between police officers and citizens (Skolnick, 1966:55; Rubinstein, 1973:153-155). Further, traffic stops and citations appear to have little or no effect on accident rates or subsequent driving practices. Campbell and Ross (1968), for example, found that an unprecedented crackdown on speeding in an eastern state had no discernible impact on automobile fatality rates. Gardiner (1968:171) noted that there exists little evidence that police enforcement practices have any influence on traffic law violations or accident rates. Ross (1973:79) reached an essentially similar conclusion reporting that there seems to be “. . . no effect on subsequent driver history of appearing in one of the best reputed traffic courts in America, as compared to paying a small fine to a clerk, or even with merely receiving a warning from a policeman.”
    Despite citizen opposition and the lack of evidence that strict
enforcement of traffic laws prevents accidents, traffic stops and citations for offenses are an integral element of the work expectations surrounding most uniformed, motorized police patrol officers. Police administrators, as is true of administrators of other large-scale bureaucracies (Blau and Scott, 1962:65), require easily codifiable evidence that their subordinates are working. And, unlike felony arrests which are largely a matter of assignment, good fortune and rarely a result of individual effort,3 traffic law violations are easily discovered. As a consequence, administrators of most police organizations establish citation quotas for patrol officers (Gardiner, 1968; LaFave, 1965; Petersen, 1971; Rubinstein, 1973).4
3. The fortuitous nature of felony arrests is reflected in the conversation of patrol officers at the scene of an arrest. Thus, it is not at all unusual to observe officers deciding who will get credit for the arrest. Officers who have had a run of bad luck are likely to be included and
several officers are typically credited for a single arrest.
4. In operation these systems closely resemble the “service” expectations

## ABUSE OF ARREST DISCRETION / 215

Citation quotas, however, only direct patrol officers to issue a certain number of traffic tickets. They do not determine the types of individuals to whom citations will be issued in order to meet organizational expectations. It is necessary, therefore, to consider an additional set of organizational norms in order to understand police exercise of discretion in the context of traffic law violations.
    Central to the norms of many watch-style (Wilson, 1968:
140-171) police organizations are negative typifications of, and associated recipes for actions against, minority, lower class, and disrespectful citizens. It has frequently been observed that police officers in watch-style departments maintain negative stereotypical images of minority citizens (cf., Kirkham, 1975; Reiss, 1971:147; Skolnick, 1975:256; Westley, 1970:99; Wilson, 1968:43). Similarly, negative typifications of relatively powerless citizens are characteristic of most watch-style police organizations (Reiss, 1971:151; Westley, 1970:99; Williams, 1975:137). Finally, patrol officers in these departments routinely emphasize that disrespectful citizens are to be treated differently than polite and respectful citizens (Reiss, 1971:136; Rubinstein, 1973:318; Skolnick, 1975:42; Westley, 1970:119; Wilson, 1968:37). In addition to citation requirements, then, organizational norms emphasizing differential treatment of certain types of citizens would also appear to play an important role in police work with traffic law violators.
    As is true of all employees, however, police patrol officers
attempt to retain some degree of autonomy or independence in the face of organizational norms intended to guide their actions (Olsen, 1968). Petersen (1971:358-359), for example, reports that on “one occasion an officer and the writer sat in an immobile patrol car in a deserted parking lot in the city for more than three hours” because the officer had already filled his citation quota.
    In the context of police work with traffic law violators,
therefore, it is suggested that police exercise of discretion is a

function of relations between organizational norms and employee concerns with autonomy. Specifically, if an officer is constrained to act by reference to organizational norms, then police exercise of discretion should result in a disproportionate number of citations for minority, lower class, and disrespectful citizens. If, however, an officer is momentarily free of organizational constraints, then there should be evidence of action undertaken by reference to other than organizational factors. These observations sensitize analysis of the data which follow.

## Method

During a 15 month period beginning in June 1970, a participant-as-observer study of police-citizen encounters was conducted in a mid western city of more than 500,000 located in a SMSA of over two million. A group of seven observers, trained over three months, traveled with the police on a random-time sample basis, using portable electronic coding equipment and an interaction process code. During the 15 months, observers appeared at precinct stations and observed officers in randomly selected patrol cars for full shifts. Interaction between police and citizens was simultaneously and sequentially content analyzed and coded using the portable equipment. To isolate traffic law violations from other activities, the encounters selected for analysis in this study met the following four criteria: 1) the offense was a moving rather than parking violation; 2) the motorist possessed a valid driver’s license; 3) did not have any outstanding warrants; and 4) was sober.5 Of the 1,978 encounters observed, 293 or approximately fifteen percent met these four criteria.

5. Driving while intoxicated (D W I) encounters are being examined in
a separate analysis now underway. T hey are being analyzed separately because they represent a more serious violation of the traffic laws and, therefore, police officers are ostensibly more constrained in the types of actions they can take.

## Results

The police department studied represented a blend of the watch and legalistic departments described by Wilson (1968) and maintained a formal quota of two traffic citations per officer per shift. In order to emphasize the importance of traffic citations, police administrators made and posted citation tallies in precinct roll call rooms at the end of each month. In practice, many patrol officers resisted these quotas by postponing “working traffic” until the later portions of each month. They then worked aggressively to meet their quota. For the analysis, therefore, each of the 15 months of observation was divided in half with the first fifteen days representing a period of low quota saliency and the last half a period of high quota saliency. This operationalization serves as a measure of the importance of the quota system. Table 4.6 shows the zero order relationships of the independent variables to the percent of encounters ending with a traffic citation. As can be seen the quota system is the most important of the independent variables in determining whether a citizen receives a traffic citation: 52% of the traffic stops made during periods of high quota saliency ended with a traffic citation as compared to 42% of the encounters occurring during periods of low quota saliency. Additionally, more traffic stops were made during the last days of each month than the first. The other zero order relationships in Table 4.6 are, with two exceptions,6 in the directions expected on the basis of previous study of police exercise of discretion (Piliavin and Briar, 1964; Black and Reiss, 1970). Thus, more male than female motorists received traffic citations as did more black than white motorists. Similarly, more lower than middle class motorists received citations and citizens who offered verbal resistance received

6. The two exceptions are the absences of any relationships between the
age and style of dress of traffic law violators and percent receiving a traffic citation.

more citations than citizens who offered no verbal resistance.7 Type of offense, a crude indicator of offense seriousness, plays a minor role in citation decisions as traffic stops made for moving violations were somewhat more likely to end in a ticket than stops made for equipment violations.8 A final observation to be drawn from Table 4.6 is that none of the independent variables or predictors exerts a particularly strong effect on the decision to issue a traffic citation. Many of the differences are minor and with the exception of the quota predictor, all are substantively insignificant. It is possible, however, that predictors may occasion interaction effects under varying quota conditions. This possibility is explored next. Table 4.7 shows the first order relationships of the independent variables to the percent of encounters ending with a traffic citation with the effect of the quota predictor controlled. As can be seen a number of interaction effects emerge once this control is introduced. Most, however, are substantively insignificant. There is some evidence that gender interacts with quota saliency to produce somewhat higher citation rates for males during periods of high quota saliency. Similarly, there is some evidence that age, style of dress, and type of offense interact with the quota predictor to produce somewhat higher citation rates for younger, conventionally dressed, and moving violators during periods of high quota saliency. Table 4.7 also contains evidence of complex and substantively important interactions between organizational norms and employee concerns with autonomy. Under periods of low quota saliency essentially equal proportions of black and white

7. Verbal resistance was defined as statements involving aggressive noncompliance, attempts to embarrass, heated argument, name calling, ridicule, or personal vituperation. Motorists were divided into two groups on
the basis of the frequency of these statements: those showing above average levels of verbal resistance and those showing below average levels of verbal resistance. Since the modal level was zero, the latter group is more numerous.
8. Included in the moving violation category is speeding, illegal turns,
U-turns, and the like. Equipment violations include faulty mufflers and tail or head light failures.

traffic law violators received traffic citations. Under periods of high quota saliency, however, race interacts with the quota predictor producing higher citation rates for black traffic law violators. The effects of social class on citation rates also vary dependent upon the saliency of the quota predictor. Under periods of low quota saliency more middle than lower class violators received citations; under periods of high quota saliency, however, more lower than middle class violators received citations. Finally, the effects of verbal resistance are also found to vary dependent upon quota saliency. Thus, under periods of low quota saliency violators who verbally resist the citation receive fewer tickets than violators who offered little or no verbal resistance. The reverse is true during periods of high quota saliency. These three interactions would appear to be supportive of the earlier discussion of the importance of organizational norms and employee concerns with autonomy. Patrol officers resisted quota demands during the first half of each month by making fewer traffic stops and issuing proportionately fewer citations. In addition, officers acted apart from organizational norms emphasizing the differential treatment of minority, powerless, and disrespectful citizens. During the last half of each month, however, it appears that the police patrol officers paid for their earlier autonomy. They made more traffic stops and issued proportionately more citations. In addition, the data suggest that they acted by reference to organizational norms emphasizing the differential treatment of minority, lower class and disrespectful citizens. The tentative interpretation attached to these data is that police exercise of discretion in the context of traffic law violations appears to be a function of relations between organizational norms and employee concerns with autonomy.
Discussion This analysis of police exercise of discretion in the context of traffic law violations raises a number of issues that deserve fur-

## 222 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

ther attention. However, it must first be recognized that although the findings regarding the importance of race, social class, and demeanor are essentially similar to those reported by others, the interpretation advanced is limited to traffic stop encounters. It is obvious, therefore, that organizationally sensitive study of other types of encounters (e.g., public drunkenness or juvenile rowdiness) as well as replication must be undertaken to assess the generalizability of the present argument. For purposes of discussion, however, it will be assumed that the present interpretation is at least partially valid. To begin, it can be noted that these data suggest that it may no longer be sufficient to explain police exercise of discretion solely by reference to the characteristics of citizens (Goldman, 1963), the preferences of complainants (Black and Reiss, 1970), or the prejudices of individual police officers (Piliavin and Briar, 1964). While it is likely that these, and other, factors play a role in police decision making, it is also likely that their priority and intensity are established by reference to organizationally generated constraints. It therefore appears necessary to explore the possibility that organizational norms may be at least as important as the individualistic and situational contingencies previously identified as important in the context of police exercise of discretion. Further, it must also be recognized that police officers are employees who possess concerns essentially similar to those of other types of persons. As a consequence, it is likely that certain of their actions reflect a preference for less work rather than more. Police administrators, of course, recognize this and that is one of the reasons for quota systems, radio equipped patrol cars, and the elaborate paperwork which surrounds most police work. It is perhaps useful for sociological students of police and policing to adopt a similar perspective.

## Conclusion

Keeping in mind the limits of the present analysis, it does not appear unreasonable to conclude by suggesting that these ob-

## ABUSE OF ARREST DISCRETION / 223

servations provide certain of the elements necessary for an expanded image of police exercise of discretion. Minimally, it would appear that it is now necessary to recognize that police decision making is also shaped by organizational norms and employee concerns with autonomy. It is also possible that it is within the constraints imposed by these factors that the effects of individualistic and situational contingencies are likely to be manifested.

          Corruption
       PREVIEW OF T H E SELECTIONS
Police work is exceptionally rich in opportunities for corruption. Because most officers work alone or with another officer of the same rank, supervision is minimal. Coupled with minimal supervision ic rirv/en willingness to corrupt the police. Many citizens prefer to avoid the inconvenience of a traffic citation or the loss of time and money involved in going to court by offering a bribe. Other citizens want to be in good graces with the police because the police are frequently needed (bar owners) or because their businesses are partially dependent upon police referrals (towing companies). Still others can function only if the police ignore their actions (organized gambling). Consequently, large numbers of citizens are willing to provide mongyrgnudspor -services to police officers in exchange for police favors, m is chapter emphasizes that police patrol officers take advantage of these illegitimate opportunities because of their membership in deviant watch-style police organizations. In Selection 13, “Blue-Coat Crime,” Ellwyn R. Stoddard first demonstrates thatjinljrp r.nrmption is not a function of personal moral weaknesses, poor screening procedures, or other individualistic inclinations or characteristics. Then, Stoddard develops a sociological^explanation emphasizing the group and organizational origins of deviant actions ranging from “mooching” to premeditated theft. This selection presents an organizationally sensitive explanation of the origins of police corruption. Selection 14, “Officer Violations of the Law” by Albert J. Reiss, Jr., details the frequency with which police officers were observed violating the law. Reiss reports that roughly

## 226 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

one-quarter of the officers were observed committing crim inal acts with the primary reason for these actions being additional income. Reiss notes that these deviations are supported by peers and, to a lesser extent, by superiors, thereby suggesting the organizational origins of these actions. Selection 15, “Police Corruption in New York,” is a summary of the widely publicized Knapp Commission Report on police corruption in New York City. W ith the assistance of Frank Serpico and others, the Commission found that corruption was widespread and diverse. Of crucial importance is the evidence that police administrators were either aware of or involved in these peer supported actions.

1. This concept is a restricted modification of Sutherland’s term “W hite
Collar Crime”; see Edwin H . Sutherland, “W hite Collar Crime,” A m e r . S o c. R e v ie w 5 (1940): 1-12. However, the stress of Sutherland’s thesis is the lowering of social morale o f th e la rg e r s o c ie ty by the violation of trust by those holding these social positions. The present emphasis is upon the group participating in those violations and th e ir reactions, morale, and behavior, rather than the consequences accruing to the larger society as a result of these illegal actions. The same violation of trust might produce a degree of disorganization and lowering of morale among nonparticipants, while producing a heightened morale and cohesion among all of those in the norm-violating clique.

 16. This dilemma is presently being compounded by recent Supreme
Court decisions involving police powers and personal civil rights. The fear of an emergent police state (which may or may not be valid) leads the present Justices to feel that freedom of the individual will result when police powers no longer encroach upon individual rights. The paradox is that the police are required to fulfill their traditional protection duties in spite of these new formal procedures designed to limit their investigative activities. T o fulfill the social expectations of “catching

      T h e officer needs the support o f his fe llo w officers in dangerous situations and w h en he resorts to practices o f questionable

Such illegal practices which are traditionally used to carry out a policeman’s assigned tasks might well be readily converted to the aims of personal gain.
     In these tight informal cliques within the larger police
force, certain “exploratory gestures”19 involving the acceptance of small bribes and favors can occur.

Once begun, however, these practices can become ^norms'7 or informal standards of cliques of policemen. _A new recruit can be socialized into accepting jthese illegal practices by mild, infoimal TjffiatiyeSanctions * sunh as the withholding of group acceptance. If these unlawful practices are embraced, the recruit's membership group— the police force—and his reference group—the clique involved in illegal behavior—are no longer one and the same. In such circumstances the norms of the reference group (the illegaloriented clique) would clearly take precedence over either

26. Many authors have written of police deviancy as tangential to their
central theme. However, persistent search failed to reveal recent empirical studies focusing directly on the deviant policeman himself.

precaution not without precedent and was a guarantee given by the director of this study in return for complete cooperation of the informant.27 The informant was a police officer for 3 Zi years before he was implicated in charges of robbery and grand larceny. He was subsequently tried and convicted, serving the better part of a year in prison. At the time of these interviews, he had been released from prison about three years. The initial design of this study attempted to correlate these empirical data with two journalistic accounts,28 but the subjective handling of those stories neutralized any advantage gained from an increased number of informants. The present design is based exclusively on the single informant.

## THE CODE AND ITS PRACTICES

Some of these terms used to describe police deviancy are widely used, but because of possible variations in meaning they are defined below.29 These practices are ordered so that those listed first would generally elicit the least fear of legal prosecution and those listed last would invoke major legal sanctions for their perpetration.

27. A graduate assistant from the Department of Sociology, Mr. Ivy L.
Gilbert, approached exofficer “Smith” as a friend, and under guidance of the present author was able to gain “Smith’s” cooperation for a scientific study. Taped interviews over a period of several months were recorded and transcribed by Gilbert. Many of these materials were used in Gilbert’s Master’s Thesis, “A Case Study of Police Scandal: An Investigation into Illegitimate Norms of a Legitimate Enforcement Agency” (June 1965).
28. One article is a composite of personal experience as a police reporter:
David G. W ittels, “W h y Cops Turn Crooked,” Saturday Evening Post, April 23, 1949, pp. 26ff; the other is an account of a former Denver policeman as retold by a news editor, Mort Stern, “W hat Makes a Policeman Go W rong?”

listed by Gilbert, “A Case Study,” pp. 3-4, and discussed by German, Police Personnel Management, p. 173.

. . . the policeman having a free cup of coffee? I have never thought of this as being corrupt or illegal because this thing is just a courtesy thing. A cup of coffee or the old one—the cop on the beat grabbing the apple off the cart—these things I don’t think shock too many people because they know that they’re pretty well accepted.

      I think mooching is accepted by the police and the public is
aware of it. My opinion now, as an ex-policeman, is that mooching is one of the underlying factors in the larger problems that come. . . . It is one of the most basic things. It’s the easiest thing to accept and to take in stride because it’s so petty. I think that it is the turning point a lot of times.

     When I walked the east side beat the normal thing was for
bartenders to greet me and offer me a pack of cigarettes or a drink. When I walked the beat I was pretty straight-laced, there were a few bartenders that I felt were just trying to get along with me, and I loosened up a little with those people. One bartender gave me cigars when he found out that I didn’t smoke cigarettes. I always accepted them; he always pointed out there wasn’t any obligation. Some of the beat men accepted cigarettes, some cigars, some took cash, and these men know when they’re dealing with bootleggers, and why they’re being paid.

        As far as the Mid-City department is concerned I would say
      that 10 percent of the department would go along with anything,
      including deliberate forced entries or felonies. But about 50 per-

cent of them would openly go along with just about anything. If they found a place open or if there had been a break-in or if they found anything they could use and it was laying there, they’d help themselves to it.

      Most of the policemen who shop or go along with shopping
would go along with major theft, if it just happened. I think where you’ve got to draw the line is when you get into premeditated, deliberate thefts. I think this is where the big division comes.
      In shopping, the theft just happens. Premeditated theft~4» a
cold, deliberate planned thing!

     I think in premeditated theft that the general police attitude is
against it, if for no other reason [than] just for the matter of self-preservation and survival. When you get to a premeditated, deliberate thing, then I think your police backing becomes pretty thin.

     When I was involved in it, it seemed like all the people around
me were involved in it and participating in it. It looked more to me like the generally accepted thing then than it does now, because actually the clique that I was in that did this sort of thing

      [Extortion is] something that I would classify as completely
outside the law [here in Mid-City], something that in certain areas has been accepted well on the side of both the public and the police. There’s a long-standing practice that in Chicago if you are stopped for a traffic violation if you had a five dollar bill slipped in your plastic holder, or your billfold, the patrolman then asks for your license, and if that’s in there you’ll very rarely be issued a summons. Now this thing was something that was well known by truck-drivers and people who travel through that area.

     I think generally the Mid-City police department is like every
police department in the world. I think the exceptions are probably in small towns or in a few cities that have never been touched by corrupt politics, if there are any. But I think that

## CORRUPTION / 241

generally they are the same everywhere,30 because I have talked to policemen from other cities. I know policemen in other cities that I’ve had contact with that were in those things. I’ve discussed open things, or out and out felonies, with policemen from Kansas City on. And I know that at least in that city that it happens, and it’s a matter of record that it happens in Denver and Chicago. And I think that this happens in all cities.

Bucher describes a prr>f^gsion ** * rp la te ly horn^ffl^png community whose members share identity, values, definitions of role7_aad interest.

He was a patrolman in a police department totaling about 250 personnel, serving a metropolitan area of a quarter of a million persons. However, other sources have suggested that when a community gets larger than 80,000 people, political corruption and graft are inevitable; see Wittels, “W hy Cops Turn Crooked,” p. 26.

      There are four different requirements to the whole thing. One
is your written test, one is your agility, one is your physical examination, and the fourth is the oral examination which is given by the civil service commission. I really crammed before I took the test. When I took the test it was a natural for me, it was a snap. I scored a 94 on my test for the police department. With my soldiers preference, which gives you 5 points, I scored a 99.33 I passed my agility test and my physical. I could have had a 100 score, I could have been a gymnast, gone through the agility test and made everyone else look silly and still I could have failed in the oral exam. And this is the kicker where politics comes in.
     There are three old men that are aligned with different factions, different people on and off the department, different businessmen that have power, different groups, different lodges and
organizations, and all these things influence these men, these three people that make up the civil service board.

32. One policeman reported having paid $300.00 to take the police examination. H e also was required to pledge hTs family’s vote to the “right”
party. After some wait, he took a “special exam,” then more waiting lists, and a final $300.00 to the party fund was required before he was hired. Then he had to purchase his own uniform on contract at the “right” store. Before this man became a member of the department, by his participation in the recruitment process, he was an involved member practicing the “code.” W ittels, “W hy Cops Turn Crooked,” pp. 105-107, 111.
33. In spite of Smith’s remarkable test level, he was left off a list of the
highest 10 eligible applicants, and some three months later was put on the list through the influence of his father, a respected member of the police department with many years of unblemished service. Otherwise, he may never have been placed on the appointment list.

     The thing that hurt the morale was the fact that a large percentage of the people on the department were involved in illegal
practices to some degree. And actually you take a man that has just joined the department, has good intentions35 and is basically honest, and in this, to a man that’s never been dishonest and hasn’t stepped over the line, there aren’t degrees. It’s all either black or white. And the illegal activity I know shocks a lot of these young men . . . because it was the thing to do. It’s a way to be accepted by the other people. It’s a terrible thing the way one policeman will talk about another. Say an old timer will have a new man working with him and he’ll tell you, “You’ve got to watch him, because he's honest!"

     We’ll take a classic example—Mr. Sam Paisano. Now when I

values when a new soldier recruit is given basic training. T he formal regulations are presented to him, but in company with “old salts” he learns how the system can be worked and what a person must do to participate in it.
35. One writer corroborates this by stating that young recruits who show
traits of being ambitious, as well as those with family responsibilities, are the most susceptible to graft. The pressures toward success and achievement are clearly indicated by either or both of these factors. W ittels, “W hy Cops Turn Crooked,” p. 27.

## 244 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

patrolman on the force knew that. If I had run across Sam doing anything short of murder, I think I would have treaded very lightly. Even if I hadn’t accepted his free meals. Say I had turned it down; still, if I stopped this man for a minor traffic violation, say I caught him dead to rights, I’d be very reluctant to write this man a ticket because I’d suffer the wrath of the other men on the force. I’d be goofing up their meal ticket. Now he in turn knows this. The rest of the officers wouldn’t waste any words about it, they’d tell you right off—“You sure fouled up our meal ticket.” The old timers would give you a cold shoulder. If it came to the attention of the gold braid, your immediate superiors, they’d make sure you had a little extra duty or something. In most cases if you did this just to be honest, just to be right, it would go badly for you.
     This special treatment of Mr. Paisano wasn’t something that
you concealed, or that you were ashamed of because it was the normal accepted thing to do. I’d have been more ashamed, and I’d have kept it quiet if I’d stopped such a man as this, because I’d have felt like some kind of an oddball. I would have been bucking the tide, I’d have been out of step.

      The first thing that I can recall seeing done [which was illegal]
was on the night shift when I first went on patrol. The old timers were shaking buildings down and helping themselves to whatever was in the building. The first time I saw it happen I remember filing through the check-out counter at a supermarket, seeing all the officers grabbing their cigarettes or candy bars, or whatever they wanted and I passed through without anything.
      I got in the car and this old timer had, of all the petty things,
two of these 25- or 30-cent candy bars and he sat them down in the seat and told me to have some. I told him I really didn’t want any. And he asked me if “that shook me up” or something. And I told him, “Well, it sort of surprised me.” He said that everybody did it and that I should get used to that.
      And as it went on it progressed more. Well, in fact, he justified

## CORRUPTION / 245

it at the time by telling me he had seen the same market one time, when there had been a legitimate break-in and one particular detective had been so busy loading the back seat of his car full of hams and big pieces of beef that he was stumbling and falling down back and from the cooler to the alley, and he didn’t even know who was around him he was so busy carrying things out. And he named this officer and I don’t doubt it because I’ve seen the same officer do things in that same nature.
     And this was the first direct contact I had with anything like
this.
The old timers would test the new recruits with activities which could be laughed off if they were reported, such as the 30-cent candy bar taken from the supermarket in the preceding account.
     The old timers would nose around ’til they found out whether
a young guy was going to work with them and “be right” as far as they were concerned, or whether he was going to resist it and be straight as far as the rest of the world was concerned.
If the recruit cooperatecL-the practices-were extended and the rookie became involved. Once he was involved there was*I no “squealing” on fellow pcffiuemen breaking the law. Then heTouId~have somlTpei^Oflal choice as to how tar he'personally wished to go. However, those whn were gtraight-l^^^d and wanted to stay honest had their problems too. Social isolation ^appears to be a powerful sanction as can be seen from Smith’s information.
     There are a few policemen that are straight-laced all the way.
I can remember one policeman who might havs-madc an iasrrergf another policeman taking something. H e had that attitude for the first six months that he was on the force but by that time, he had been browbeaten so bad, he saw the writing on the wall. H e knew better than to tell anything. In addition to browbeating, this man in very short order was put in a position where they had him on the information desk, or kicked around from one department to another, ’cause nobody wanted to work with him. This kind of a man they called “w orm y,” because anything that would happen he’d run to the braid.

## 246 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

     This fellow, I knew, wanted to be one of the boys, but he
wanted to be honest, too. As it turned out, this guy was finally dismissed from the force for having an affair with a woman in his squad car. Just a couple of years before that he would have had a fit if he thought that somebody was going to take a drink on duty, or fool around with a woman, or steal anything. For this reason this man spent a lot of time on the information desk, working inside, and by himself in the squad car.

      This small fraction that . . . are honest and would report illegal activity are ostracized. Nobody will work with them. They
look at them like they’re freaks, talk about them like they’re freaks, and they are freaks.
      The goofs that would talk about doing things the way they
should be done, they had to be ignored or put down. There were older policemen that as they found out I would go along with certain things, pressed to see how much further I would go. And showed me that they went farther, whether I cared to or not. So naturally I went along quite a ways with some of them. And I don’t really remember how we first became aware of how far the other person would go. I think this is just a gradual thing.

But when Smith was asked directly, “W ith the policeman’s low salary, do illegal activities become necessary to keep up financially?” he discounted it as a major factor.36
     I d on ’t think this is the case. I d on ’t think there are very m any

## SANCTIONS FOR PRESERVATION OF THE “ CODE”

Normally, practitioners of the “code” would consist of a united group working to protect all fellow patrolmen from prosecution. However, Smith had exceeded the “code” limits37
36. T o evaluate Smith’s statement on economic pressures, an additional
personal datum is relevant. Smith used most of his money from premeditated theft for his “habit”—a racing car. He later declared he probably wouldn’t have participated in this crime so much had it not been for the “habit.” His response did not seem to indicate that he began theft for racing money, but that he continued it to counter the economic drain created by owning and driving the racing machine.

During a time like this, group consensus is required to preserve the “code.” A certain amount of rationalization is necessary to mollify past illicit activity in light of present public exposure. Smith continues:
     I think if th ey had really gon e b y the b ook during the police
scandal, that 25 p ercent o f the policem en w ou ld have lost their jobs. I’ve talked to som e o f them since, and the w orst violators all n o w have them selves con vin ced that th ey w eren ’t gu ilty o f a thing.

Later, he ran a “vice” raid against a “protected” place, and was back as a rookie on a beat in “Siberia.” He finally took some payoffs and cooperated and eventually became a police captain but, exceeding the “Code” limits, was caught and prosecuted. Either not accepting the “Code” or exceeding its limits had negative effects. Wittels, “W hy Cops Turn Crooked,” pp. 111-112.

Preservation^)^ the “code” occurs when policemen_work with another person whcThas similar intentions and hegiru-to “trust” one another in illegal activities without fear of the a u th c ^ ^ A officers from shift to shift l a given public discussion. To this, Smith reacted thusly:
      I think that the practice o f rotating y o u n g officers w ill serve a
purpose. It w ill elim inate a lo t o f things because y o u just can’t take a chance w ith som eb od y that y o u don’t know . If y o u d on ’t k n ow but w h at the next person th ey th row y o u w ith m ight be a CID . . . short for Criminal Investigation D epartm ent. T h e y ’re spies! Say there are just 10 p ercent o f the m en on the departm ent that w ou ld n ’t g o along w ith anything, and th ey are sw itch in g around w ith the n ew system , y o u d on ’t k n ow w h en y o u ’re g oin g to catch one o f them , and if y o u do y o u ’re a cook ed goose. T h e old system y o u w ere 90 p ercent sure o f the people y o u w ere w ith.
This same process used to preserve the illegal “code” as a group phenomenon is also the same process used to develop and promote the acceptable professional ethics of the police. A situation in which it is “normal” for a policeman to “squeal on his fellow patrolmen” would undermine professional ethics. Personal insecurity would mount with the constant fear ( r T ~ " [ i i s t a r m ^ r l w*th or without supporting evideiicerSuch an anarchical system lends itself to intrigue^suspminn7~~TnH jTrT n f f i r e f j ierng '^framed.’^Tnus, these same procedures which would effectively reduce the continuation of the “code” would also prove dysfunctional to the maintenance of the ethics which are the core of the police profession itself. These concurrent processes reflect the dual standards extant in society at large.

    I think that any law against shopping w ou ld be hard to enforce against a p olice officer. Y o u ’d really have to have the ev idence against him and really make it public, cause it w o u ld be
soft-pedalled all the w a y otherw ise. L et’s say y o u see a police officer in a restaurant taking a pack o f cigarettes or le t’s say it’s som ething other than a pack o f cigarettes, som ething that y o u can prove cam e from the restaurant. A nd along com es a radio new s unit and y o u stop the unit and say y o u just saw a p o liceman steal a pack o f cigarettes or som ething bigger. W h e n other police arrive on the scene the new sm an w ou ld probably pull the other policem en off to the side and tell them that their buddy just took a pack o f cigarettes and that goofb all [th e inform er] wants to make trouble about it.

    It appears obvious that those who are involved in the “code”
will be the least useful instruments for alleviating the problem. Only the professionally naive would expect a “code” practitioner to disclose the “code’s” existence, much less reveal its method of operation, since his own position is so vulnerable.
    Summary of Findings
F r ^ ^ h ^ H f f lk h pfi h y a p a r tic ip a n t informant, an informal C“code” of illegal activities w ith in o n e police deparim&R was
--^documented. The group processes which encouraged ancP
maintained""the “code” were identified. It was found that the new recruits were socialized into “code” participation by “old timers,” and group acceptance was withheld from those who attempted to remain completely honest and not be implicated. When formal police regulations were in conflict with “code” demands among its practitioners, the latter took precedence. Since^h e “code” operates under conditions of secrecy, only those^who^participate m it have accessto evidence^s59krient^. to .reveal itsmetfiocTot o p e r a t l o m R y their very participation they are implicated, and this binds them to secrecy as well. In this study the public indignation of a police scandal temporarily suspended the “code,” but it flourished again when public apathy returned.
     Although some individual factors must be considered in explaining police deviancy, in the present study the sanction of
group acceptance was paramount. This study clearly demonstrates the social genesis of the “code,” the breeding ground for individual unlawful behavior. From evidence contained herein, an individualistic orientation to police deviancy may discover the “spoiled fruit,” but only when the “code” is rooted out can the “seedbed” of deviancy be destroyed.
     From related research in group deviancy, it can be stated
that the social organization of a given community (including its respectable citizens) is the milieu in which a “code” flourishes. Thus, a police department is an integral element of that complex community structure, and deviancy found in an en-

## CORRUPTION / 253

forcement agency is a reflection of values which are habitually practiced and accepted within that community. This was found to be true in the present study.
     The findings of this case study should not be interpreted
as applicable to all police departments, nor should they be considered as a rationalization for the existence of an illicit “code” anywhere. Rather, this case study represents a very limited effort to probe the very sensitive area of “blue-coat crime” and describe its operation and method of perpetuation in one enforcement agency.

on limiting misconduct cannot be assessed accurately. It should be noted, however, that the highest rates of misconduct occurred where officers were observed least often. Counting all felonies and misdemeanors, except assaults on citizens, the rate of criminal violation for officers observed committing one or more violations was 23.7 in City X, 21.9 in City Y, and 16.5 in City Z per 100 officers. . . . Excluding any participation in syndicated crime, roughly 1 in 5 officers was observed in criminal violation of tSe^Taw. There was some varnrrron among The three cities in the crime patterns of police officers and the rate of violation. The types of opportunities and situations that give rise to officers violating criminal statutes are relatively few. Opportunities arise principally in connection with the law-enforcement roles of officers, particularly in relationships with businesses and businessmen, policing traffic violators and . . . deviants, and controlling evidence from crimes. . . . Obtaining m oney nr merchandise illegally is the principal officer violation. A striking fact is that few officers were observed committing crimes against the residential property of citizens, although this may be a function of the fact that they usually were observed policing low-income residential areas. The major exception is the violation of criminal statutes by controlling evidence illegally, as by swearing false testimony or carrying additional weapons for the sole purpose of using them as evidence against citizens. T hese additional weapons were obtained from previous sear^ e s^ -th e^ p erso n , and are used as evidence against other_citizens—who-^^e^iiijur^d^or killed, thereby buttressing the officer’s argument that he injured orkHleTa'CMzerr^ ... '— The fact that criminal violations of the law by officers are restricted to relatively few types of offenses hints at the explanation for these offenses. The bulk of offenses committed by officers provide income supplements derived from exchange relationships. The price exacted by the officer provides something in exchange, generally exemption from the effect of the law. Given the relatively low remuneration of police officers, relative to their prestige and life style, the pressures to supple-

## CORRUPTION / 255ment income are considerable. Many police departments J n
tdifLXInitied^States either prohibit moonlighting or severely restrict its practice to certain kinds ot jobs. In any case, the “easy” money available to the officer with the low risk of sanctioning renders it a highly attractive form of income supplementation when contrasted with moonlighting. ^Though ^clajms are easily exaggerated, some officers said they could earn as much from their violations as from their salary. Where either the pay-offs are regularized—as they often are for the protection offered illegal activity, or where there is considerable opportunity to exact money because the market is large, as is the case for shakedowns of traffic violators—and the pressure to balance income with expenditure is high, as it is for police officers, one should expect this pattern of violation of the criminal law. Gains are considerable relative to opportunity costs, assuming psychic income from exemplary conduct is not too great. Historically, political officials as well as police officers have been particularly vulnerable to this pattern of deviance.
    Parenthetically, it might be noted that the effect of the
criminal violations of officers still sanctions negatively the activity from which the financial gain is made. While the motorist who pays the police officer in exchange for exemption from official processing pays a cost below that which its sanctioning agents normally assess (the fine plus court costs and points), it nonetheless is a cost, and therefore a sanction. Indeed the police officer must make the cost of his sanction competitive.
    The criminal violations of officers against the operation of
the system of criminal justice is explained on altogether different grounds. The explanation of that misconduct lies in the officer subculture as a reaction to the system of punishment for police officers, a matter we shall turn to later.
    A gray-area of offending also exists. Many businessmen in
a community engage in exchanges or practices with police officers that from the standpoint of the law could bring charges of bribery. A variety of such practices were uncovered in our observations of the police including almost daily

## 2 56 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

free meals, drinks, or cigarettes, the profferment of gifts marking anniversaries and holidays, and discounts on purchases. Such practices are specifically prohibited by the rules and regulations of any police department and subject to disciplinary action if “officially” discovered. Within each of the cities, one-third (31 percent) of all businessmen in wholesale or retail trade or business and repair services in the high-crime-rate areas openly acknowledged favors to policemen. Of those giving favors, 43 percent said they gave free merchandise, food or services to all policemen; the remainder did so at discount. When observers were present with officers during their eight-hour tour of duty, for almost 1 of every 3 of the 841 tours (31 percent), the officers did not pay for their meals. For the remaining cases, small discounts were common. Similarly many officers reported large discounts on purchases of durable goods. On most occasions, free goods or discounts are not solicited, largely because officers know well which businesses offer them and which do not. The informal police networks carry such information, obviating in most cases open solicitation. Presentation of self in uniform is all that is necessary to secure many benefits/T hese Transact tions are viewed as “favors” by the line and tacitly approved by their superiors. The fact that mobility within police departments occurs almost exclusively by promotion from the line within a department makes line and staff officers subject to subversion by the line. They readily overlook practices and violations that are common among patrolmen either because they, themselves, engaged in them when they served as patrolmen or many of their friends did so. Jjjot-infrequently, when superior officers investigatc or hear charges in disciplinary proceedings for men in theTine,-their -judgment is subverted because, they served'with them. These facts—the absence of lateral mobility across police departments and mobility within them resting on promotion from the line—are a structural feature of American police departments that renders them vulnerable to many forms of internal subversion and jeopardizes their disinterest in personnel decisions and discipline. The classic separation of

## CORRUPTION / 257

recruitment into staff and line and the use of civil-service examinations is designed to temper subversion in promotion. No such safeguard is built into the typical disciplinary investigation and hearing within the police department. Businessmen regard favors to police officers as guarantees that special attention may be given their business. Most such favors, therefore, do not occur as specific exchanges, characteristic of bribery and shakedowns. Rather, as Dalton points out for American businesses, they represent “favors due” that cannot be exchanged in the course of carrying out regular duties. Although it can be argued, as he notes, that people are being persuaded to violate their official duties by accepting such favors, it can equally be argued that they contribute to the carrying out of official duties.1 Thus, it is the duty of the police to protect business establishments in the community. Indeed, since businesses are highly vulnerable to criminal activity in many areas, special attention may even be officially approved. In Detroit and Chicago, as in some other large American cities, the police department may even provide a police escort at closing time so that businessmen may safely deposit their daily receipts at a bank. Such attention, though not officially acknowledged by either party as payment, can be recognized through favors. J o r the police, then, as for workers and officials in corporations, favorsToften are unofficial rewards tor regular duties.1 2 ~=:?='Stich exchanges may not afford businesses the protection” anticipated. Within each of the police precincts a sample of businesses was investigated to determine whether personal relationships with police officers affects a business’s capacity to cope with crime against it. Examining the businesses in 1966 and 1968, it was found that businesses with personal links to police officers in 1966 maintained them in 1968. However, these personal relationships were totally ineffective in reducing the level of crime against these businesses. Thus, the high de1.

gree of personal links that businesses have with the police cannot be explained by any added benefits to the organization in meeting its crime problems.3 . . .
    Explaining the Deviance of Officers
We have tried to show how the deviant conduct of officers may arise based on the structure and organization of police work as well as police culture. W e have shown that a substantial proportion of officers have engaged in one or more forms of deviant conduct and the annual rates of offending may be high. ^ ^ jw h a t standard does one use to determine whether the rate of offending by ollicersls high or low^------------ -
      This-is~3n important question, because the"police encounter
in their work much pressure and opportunity from offenders as well as legitimate and illegitimate organized interests to deviate from laws and rules governing conduct. Even in such minor matters as traffic violations, the conforming citizen wants a pass, expects special consideration, and often is willing to pay an officer to ignore the matter. Businessmen wanting to violate ordinances for closing hours or serving customers or wishing profit from illegal markets are willing to offer special consideration in return for the opportunity to do business as they wish. In short, there is ample opportunity for subversion of any and all officers.
     All officers are, to a large extent, exempt from law enforcement. T his fact, combined with the pressures on an"Officer to
(leviate in many sirnat-iong make _earh rfime opportunity for- ^4xim a more likely criminal event.

mated by the police subculture and organization. We found t K a t T r a f f i c b r i ^ i n the city where they had long been an institutionalized form of exchange between police and citizens. The exchange became legitimated. At the same time, however, an officer takes a certain risk in making the exchange. Thus, he generally will not do so in the presence of witnesses or when detection is likely. A further element influencing officer involvement in such exchanges is the degree to which these illegal practices are organized, as in a system of exchange with organized crime. Typical of such exchanges is that they get organized as an economy where rewards are distributed on a routine basis. xW hat may be most pertinent here is the legitimacy that ^attaches to the exchange. To deviate on one’s own is to be a criminal, buFwhere the offense is consensual, not only is there mutual implication in the offense, and therefore minimization of risk, but the offense is also easily legitimized. For an officer to share in a payment from illegal gambling is accepted, but for an officer to burglarize an establishment is to step beyond the bounds of what is legitimate. Deviation, we'“observe^often js shared with fellow officers, providing^pee^suppurt-^each^ Furthermore, rules infractions, such as drinking or sleeping on duty, are participated in by several officers at a time, although when this is not the case, they may rely on the subculture to protect them. No doubt, image protection operates here as well, but the punishment system is important, a matter we shall turn to later. To suggest, of course, that the only pressures against deviance are these is to scant the fact that officers do commit themselves to uphold a moral order. Some psychic investment is made in exemplary conduct.

pattern existed in the remaining divisions which we did not investigate in depth. This conclusion was confirmed by events occuring before and after the period of our investigation.

division for involvement in a pad where the nut was $800. After our public hearings had been completed, an investigation conducted by the Kings County District Attorney and the Department’s Internal Affairs Division—which investigation neither the Commission nor its staff had even known about—resulted in indictments and charges against thirty-seven Brooklyn plainclothesmen who had participated in a pad with a nut of $1,200. The manner of operation of the pad involved in each of these situations was in every detail identical to that described at the Commission hearings, and in each almost every plainclothesman in the division, including supervisory lieutenants, was implicated.

Because the bagman may keep the money for himself, although he claims to be collecting for his superior, it is extremely difficult to determine with any accuracy when the superior actually is involved. Of course, not all policemen are corrupt. If we are to exclude such petty infractions as free meals, an appreciable number do not engage in any corrupt activities. Yet, with extremely rare exceptions, even those who themselves engage in no corrupt activities are involved in corruption in the sense that they take no steps to prevent what they know or suspect to be going on about them. It must be made clear—in a little over a year with a staff having as few as two and never more than twelve field investigators—we did not examine every precinct in the Department. Our conclusion that corruption is widespread throughout the

## CORRUPTION / 263

Department is based on the fact that information supplied to us by hundreds of sources within and without the Department was consistently borne out by specific observations made in areas we were able to investigate in detail.

## The Nature and Significance of Police Corruption

Corruption, although widespread, is by no means uniform in degree. Corrupt policemen have been described as falling into two^ basic categories: “lilEat-eaters" and “grass-eaters.” As the names might suggest^the meat-eaters are those policemen who, like Patrolman William Phillips w ho resntierl at nnr hearings, aggressiveI)Tmisuse their police powers for personal gain. .The grass-eater^^ the payotts that the happenstances of police work throw their wav. Although the meat-eaters get the huge payoffs that make tFe ^Headlines, tljev represent!^ small percentage of all corrupt policemen. The truth is, the vast majority of policemen on the take don’t deal in huge amounts of graft. AnTyer, grass-eaters are the heart of the problem. Their great numbers tend to make corruption “respectable.” They also tend to encourage the code of silence that brands anyone who exposes corruption a traitor. At the time our investigation began, any policeman violating the code did so at his peril. The result was described in our interim report: “The rookie who crones-ia^o-the-’Department is faced with the situation where it is easier for him to become corrupt than to remain honest.” More importantly, although meat-eaters can and have been individually induced to make their peace with society, the grass-eaters may be more easily reformed. W e believe that, given proper leadership and support, many police who have slipped into corruption would exchange their illicit income for the satisfaction of belonging to a corruption-free Department in which they could take genuine pride. The problem of corruption is neither new, nor confined to the police. Reports of prior investigations into police corrup-

## CORRUPTION / 265

    Feelings of isolation and hostility are experienced by policemen not just in New York, but everywhere. To understand
these feelings one must appreciate an important characteristic of any metropolitan police department, namely an extremely intense group loyalty. When properly understood, this group loyalty can be used in the fight against corruption. If misunderstood or ignored, it can undermine anti-corruption activities.
    Pressures that give rise to this group loyalty include the
danger to winch policemen are constantly exposed and the hostility they encounter from society at large. Everyone agrees that a policeman’s life is a dangerous one, and that his safety, not to mention his life, can depend on his ability to rely on a fellow officer in a moment of crisis. It is less generally realized that the policeman works in a sea of hostility:” This is true, not onlyliTlUgfrerifne-areav City. Nnhndy, q burglar or a Sunday motorist, likes to have his activities interfered with. As a result, most citizens, atone time~or another, regard the police with varying degrees of hostility'. 1 he policeman feels, and naturally often returns, __ this hostility!" ~—T wrr piincipal characteristics emerge from this group_lo^ altVr^iispidon and hostility directed^iTany outside i nterference with the Department, and a n mtense desire to of the Department. This mixture of hostility and pride has created what the Commission has found to be the most serious roadblock to a rational attack upon police corruption: a stubborn refusal at all levels of the Department to acknowledge that a serious problem exists.
    The interaction of stubbornness, hostility and pride has
given rise to the-so^called —rotten-apple” theory! According to this theory, which bordered on official Department doctrinB»^aiiy--polk^ ^fbufTd~to-bewCorrupt must promptly tih denouncedjis a rot^n-applejn^an otherwise clean barrel.

     The rotten-apple doctrine has in many ways been a basic
obstacle to meaningful reform. To begin with, it reinforced and gave respectability to the code of silence. The official view that the Department's image and morale forbade public disclosure oL-th/> p-vt-pni- of corruption inhibited any officer who wished to disclose corruption snH jnQfjfied any who preT jFerred to remain silent. The doctrine also made difficult, if not impossible, any meaningful attempt at managerial reform. A high command unwilling to acknowledge that the problem of corruption is extensive cannot very well argue that drastic changes are necessary to deal with that problem. Thus neither the Mayor’s Office nor the Police Department took adequate steps to see that such changes were made when the need for them was indicated by the charges made by Officers Frank Serpico and David Durk in 1968. This was demonstrated in the Commission’s second set of public hearings in December 1971.
     Finally, the doctrine made impossible the use of one of the
mdSt^efficctivc teclnriq m^rfo r dealing with an\^~entrenched .criminal activity, namely persuading ^ participant to help proj nde evidence against his partners in crime. If a corrupt policeman is merely an isolated rotten apple, no reason can be given for not exposing him the minute he is discovered. If, on the other hand, it is acknowledged that a corrupt officer is only one part of an apparatus of corruption, common sense dictates that every effort should be made to enlist the offender’s aid in providing the evidence to destroy the apparatus.
    The Commission’s Actions
Thu~€ommission examined and rejected the premises upon rw&eh^the^ rotten-apple doctrine rested. We^concluded that there was no~ justification tor fearing that public acknowledgment of the extent of corruption would damage the image and effectiveness of the Department. We are convinced that in-

## CORRUPTION / 267

stead of damaging its image a realistic attitude toward corruption could only enhance the Department’s credibility. The conditions described in the Commission’s public hearings came as no surprise to the large numbers of City residents who had experienced them for yezr* rhef Department makes it a point to acknowledge fw riqrt^nndirinm the pnblir already knows to exist, it^can hardly damage its image. On the con-
## Ml P TTT l 111' - D ^ p c i r f m p n r ^
good-faith desireto deal with those conditions.
      I he Commission looked at the question of morale in much
the same way. We did not—and do not—believe that the morale of the average policeman is enhanced by a commanding officer who insists on denying facts that the policeman knows to be true. We believed—and continue to believe—that such false denials can only undercut the policeman’s confidence in his commander. If a policeman listens to his commander solemnly deny the existence of an obvious corrupt situation, the policeman can draw only one of two conclusions: Either the commander is hopelessly naive or he is content to let the corruption continue.
      Once we had re)ected-the^reimses-e£>the rotten-apple doctrine, the Commission d e te r m in e d ^tojemploy one of the tech-
^niques that affilerence to the^octrineTiaT lnade impossible,. nai^ty^o-^erstmd^TofmeH S^ornipt police officers to work with us in providingL^vid^nt^of colirmumg corruption.
     TTi^rnere^ecision to use the technique did not automatically produce a body of officers able and eager to assist us in
this manner. Indeed, knowledgeable persons assured us that the code of silence was so strong that we would never find a corrupt officer who could be persuaded to assist in exposing corruption. We ultimately did persuade four officers, including s-D etective^ Patrolmen William Phillips, ^Edward Droge and Alfonso Jannotta to undertake undercover work. Of these, all but Detective Leuci did so under the compulsion of having been caught by Commission investigators. Patrolmen Phillips and Droge testified at public hearings held in October 1971. Patrolman Jannotta was unavailable due to illness at the time of the hearings. The information disclosed

## 268 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

by Detective Leuci was so vital that we did not, since our time was limited, feel justified in keeping it to ourselves. Leuci and the Commission staff members who had debriefed him and worked with him on his initial undercover operations were turned over to the Federal Government for the long-term investigation which was required. Leuci’s work as a Federal undercover agent is now resulting in the series of important narcotics-related indictments being obtained by United States Attorney Whitney North Seymour, Jr.
    Success in persuading these officers to assist in the investigation was a first step in demonstrating that the rotten-apple
doctrine was invalid. Patrolman Phillips’ three days of testimony about systematic corruption in various parts of the Department, corroborated by tape-recorded conversations with many police officers and others, was in itself enough to make the doctrine seem untenable. PatrolmaruDroge^described how departmental pressures gradually converted an ideahstiFrookie into an increasingly bold finder of luibes an‘d“paybffsTFormer Patrolman Waverly Logan, who volunteered to testify about corruption in which he had been involved, corroborated Droge’s testimony and went on to tell about policemen in Harlem who received monthly as much as $3,000 each in narcotics graft. Patrolman Logan also introduced the Commission to two addicts who were willing to work with us in obtaining evidence to corroborate these assertions. The Commission’s work with these addicts produced movies and recorded conversations of policemen selling narcotics. Some of the narcotics were paid for with merchandise the policemen believed to be stolen. Captain Daniel McGowan, a police officer of unquestioned integrity and experienced in anti-corruption work, testified that the picture of corruption presented by Patrolmen Phillips, Droge and Logan was an accurate one. In addition, there was testimony from, among others, a Harlem gambler, Commission agents describing their investigations, and witnesses in the business comiBUjatsOI r ^ ^ police dealings jwith th^4uteU-~and c o n str u c tio n industries. Recorded conversations and movies documented instances of police corruption, including gambling and narcotics payoffs, fixing court

## CORRUPTION / 269

cases and shaking down a tow-truck operator. The cumulative effect of these two weeks of testimony made it not only unrealistic but absurd for anyone thereafter to adhere to the rotten-apple doctrine, either publicly or privately.
    The doctrine did not die easily. Institutional pressures within
the Department seemed to force the high command to continue giving lip service to the doctrine even when speaking out against corruption. Commissioner Murphy in his early statements about corruption regularly included a pointed statement indicating that the corruption in the Department was limited to a few officers. On one occasion he went so far as to imply that there were no more than about 300 corrupt police officers in the entire Department. After Patrolman Phillips had completed two of his three days of testimony at our public hearings, Commissioner Murphy found it necessary to discount his testimony of widespread corruption, referring to him as a “rogue cop.”
    However, one week later, after Phillips had completed his
testimony and had been followed by Patrolmen Logan and Droge and others, the Department, speaking through First Deputy Commissioner William H. T. Smith, forthrightly rejected the rotten-apple doctrine by name. Smith defined it as standing for the proposition that “police departments are essentially free of corruption except for the presence of a few corrupt officers who have managed to slip into police service and also into key assignments such as gambling investigations, despite rigorously applied screening procedures designed to keep them out.” He said that traditional police strategy had been to react defensively whenever a scandal arose by “promising to crack down on graft, to go after the ‘rogue cops,’ to get rid of ‘rotten apples.’ ” Smith said the Department now rejected this approach “not just on principle, but because as a way of controlling corruption it had utterly failed.” He acknowledged that the result of adherence to the theory had been a breakdown in public confidence: “.. . they [the public] are sick of ‘bobbing for rotten apples’ in the police barrel. They want an entirely new barrel that will never again become contaminated.”

Reiss, Jr., examines the frequency and circumstances surrounding unnecessary police force. Utilizing an exceptionally conservative definition of “brutality,” Reiss establishes that unnecessary police force is “far from rare.” The provocations to violence include a deviant status or defiant attitudes and actions. Important are Reiss' observations that these actions are peer tolerated and ignored, if not encouraged, by administrative elites. Selection 17, “Street Justice” by John Van Maanen, also examines the circumstances that provoke unnecessary police force. Precisely as reported by Reiss, Van Maanen notes that the provocations to violence include a deviant status or defiant attitudes and actions. Citizens who are or who do these things are “assholes” in the eyes of patrol officers and such people not only deserve but also require “street justice.” As also reported by Reiss, Van Maanen notes that acts of unnecessary force directed at the deviant or defiant have largely organizational origins.

L. Kobler considers an extreme form of police violence: homicidal assaults upon citizens. Kobler reports that 1500 citizens were killed by police from 1960 through 1970. Of these, Kobler estimates that 40 percent or 500 were unjustifiable and that another 20 percent were questionable. Kobler advances several explanations including the absence of meaningful legal limitations on the use of deadly force, loosely written departmental regulations, and the tendency of the various components of the criminal justice system—police, coroner’s office, prosecutors, and judges—to tolerate police homicide. In all, Kobler emphasizes the organizational origins of unnecessary police homicides.

arrest. M any of them had done nothing to deserve an arrest. In a m ajority of such cases, no com plaint was made. If the victim complains , his charge is generally dismissed. T he police are practically above the law.
This statement was published in 1903, and its author was the Hon. Frank Moss, a former police commissioner of New York City. Clearly, today’s charges of police brutality and mistreatment of citizens have a precedent in American history—but never before has the issue of police brutality assumed the public urgency it has today. In Newark, in Detroit, in Watts, in Harlem, and, in fact, in practically every city that has had a civil disturbance, “deep hostility between police and ghetto” was, reports the Rerner Commission, “a primary cause of the riots.”
    Whether or not the police accept the words “police brutality,” the public now wants some plain answers to some plain
questions. How widespread is police mistreatment of citizens? Is it on the increase? W hy do policemen mistreat citizens? Do the police mistreat Negroes more than whites?
    To find some answers, 36 people working for the Center of
Research on Social Organization observed police-citizen encounters in the cities of Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. For seven days a week, for seven weeks during the summer of 1966, these observers, with police permission, sat in patrol cars and monitored booking and lockup procedures in high-crime precincts.
    Obtaining information about police mistreatment of citizens
is no simple matter. National and state civil-rights commissions receive hundreds of complaints charging mistreatment, but proving these allegations is difficult. The few local civilian review boards, such as the one in Philadelphia, have not produced any significant volume of complaints leading to the dismissal or disciplining of policemen for alleged brutality. Generally, police chiefs are silent on the matter, or answer charges of brutality with vague statements that they will investigate any complaints brought to their attention. Rank-and-file po-

## 278 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

Our observations of police practices show that white as well as Negro youths are often harassed in this way. Frequently the policeman may leave the car and threaten or force youths to move on. For example, one summer evening as the scout car cruised a busy street of a white slum, the patrolman observed three white boys and a girl on a corner. When told to move on, they mumbled and grumbled in undertones, angering the police by their failure to comply. As they slowly moved off, the officers pushed them along the street. Suddenly one of the white patrolmen took a lighted cigarette from a 15-year-old boy and stuck it in his face, pushing him forward as he did so. When the youngsters did move on, one policeman remarked to the observer that the girl was “nothing but a whore.” Such tactics can only intensify resentment toward the police. Police harassment is not confined to youth. One in every four adult Negroes in Detroit claims he has been stopped and questioned by the police without good reason. The same proportion claim they have been stopped in their cars. One in five says he has been searched unnecessarily; and one in six says that his car was searched for no good reason. The members of an interracial couple, particularly a Negro man accompanying a white woman, are perhaps the most vulnerable to harassment. What citizens regard as police brutality many policemen consider necessary for law enforcement. While degrading epithets and abusive language may no longer be considered proper by either police commanders or citizens, they often disagree about other practices related to law enforcement. For example, although many citizens see “stop and question” or “stop and frisk” procedures as harassment, police commanders usually regard them merely as “aggressive prevention” to curb crime.
Physical Force—or Self Defense? The nub of the police-brutality issue seems to lie in police use of physical force. By law, the police have the right to use such force if necessary to make an arrest, to keep the peace, or to

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 279

maintain public order. But just how much force is necessary or proper?
    This was the crucial problem we attempted to answer by
placing observers in the patrol cars and in the precincts. Our 36 observers, divided equally among Chicago, Boston, and Washington, were responsible for reporting the details of all situations where police used physical force against a citizen. To ensure the observation of a large number of encounters, two high-crime police precincts were monitored in Boston and Chicago; four in Washington. At least one precinct was composed primarily of Negro residents, another primarily of whites. Where possible, we also tried to select precincts with considerable variation in social-class composition. Given the criterion of a high-crime rate, however, people of low socioeconomic status predominated in most of the areas surveyed.
    The law fails to provide simple rules about what—and how
much—force that policemen can properly use. The American Bar Foundation’s study Arrest, by Wayne LaFave, put the matter rather well, stating that the courts of all states would undoubtedly agree that in making an arrest a policeman should use only that amount of force he reasonably believes necessary. But LaFave also pointed out that there is no agreement on the question of when it is better to let the suspect escape than ta employ “deadly” force.
    Even in those states where the use of deadly force is limited
by law, the kinds of physical force a policeman may use are not clearly defined. No kind of force is categorically denied a policeman, since he is always permitted to use deadly force in self-defense.
    This right to protect himself often leads the policeman to
argue self-defense whenever he uses force. W e found that many policemen, whether or not the facts justify it, regularly follow their use of force with the charge that the citizen was assaulting a policeman or resisting arrest. Our observers also found that some policemen even carry pistols and knives that they have confiscated while searching citizens; they carry them so they may be placed at a scene should it be necessary to establish a case of self-defense.

## 280 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

Of course, not all cases of force involve the use of unnecessary force. Each instance of force reported by our observers was examined and judged to be either necessary or unnecessary. Cases involving simple restraint—holding a man by the arm—were deliberately excluded from consideration, even though a policeman’s right to do so can, in many instances, be challenged. In judging when police force is “unwarranted,” “unreasonable,” or “undue,” we rather deliberately selected only those cases in which a policeman struck the citizen with his hands, fist, feet, or body, or where he used a weapon of some kind, such as a nightstick or a pistol. In these cases, had the policeman been found to have used physical force improperly, he could have been arrested on complaint and, like any other citizen, charged with a simple or aggravated assault. A physical assault on a citizen was judged to be “improper” or “unnecessary” only if force was used in one or more of the following ways:

  1. If a policeman physically assaulted a citizen and then failed to
     make an arrest; proper use involves an arrest.
  2. If the citizen bein g arrested did not, b y w ord or deed, resist
     the policem an; fo rce should be used o n ly if it is necessary to
     make the arrest.
  3. If the policem an, even th ou gh there w as resistance to the arrest, could easily have restrained the citizen in other w ays.
  4. If a large num ber o f p olicem en w ere present and could have
     assisted in subduing the citizen in the station, in lockup, and
     in the interrogating room s.
  5. If an offender w as handcuffed and m ade no attem pt to flee or
     offer v io len t resistance.
  6. If the citizen resisted arrest, but the use o f force continued
     even after the citizen was subdued.
In the seven-week period, we found 37 cases in which force was used improperly. In all, 44 citizens had been assaulted. In 15 of these cases, no one was arrested. Of these, 8 had offered no verbal or physical resistance whatsoever, while 7 had. An arrest was made in 22 of the cases. In 13, force was exercised in the station house when at least four other policemen

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 281

were present. In two cases, there was no verbal or physical resistance to the arrest, but force was still applied. In two other cases, the police applied force to a handcuffed offender in a field setting. And in five situations, the offender did resist arrest, but the policeman continued to use force even after he had been subdued. Just how serious was the improper use of force in these 44 cases? Naturally there were differences in degree of injury. In about one-half of the cases, the citizen appeared little more than physically bruised; in three cases, the amount of force was so great that the citizen had to be hospitalized. Despite the fact that cases can easily be selected for their dramatic rather than their representative quality, I want to present a few to give a sense of what the observers saw and reported as undue use of force.

## Observing on Patrol

In the following two cases the citizens offered no physical or verbal resistance, and the two white policemen made no arrest. It is the only instance in which the observers saw the same two policemen using force improperly more than once. The police precinct in which these incidents occurred is typical of those found in some of our larger cities, where the patrolmen move routinely from gold coast to slum. There are little islands of the rich and poor, of old Americans and new, of recent migrants and old settlers. One moves from high-rise areas of middle- and upper-income whites through an area of the really old Americans-Indians—to an enclave of the recently arrived. The recently arrived are primarily those the policemen call “hillbillies” (migrants from Kentucky and Tennessee) and “pork chops,” (Puerto Ricans). There are ethnic islands of Germans and Swedes. Although there is a small area where Negroes live, it is principally a precinct of whites. The police in the district are, with one exception, white. On a Friday in the middle of July, the observer arrived for the 4 to 12 midnight watch. The beat car that had been ran-

## 282 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

domly chosen carried two white patrolmen—one with 14 years of experience in the precinct, the other with three. The watch began rather routinely as the policemen cruised the district. Their first radio dispatch came at about 5:30 p . m . They were told to investigate two drunks in a cemetery. On arriving they found two white men “sleeping one off.” Without questioning the men, the older policeman began to search one of them, ripping his shirt and hitting him in the groin with a nightstick. The younger policeman, as he searched the second, ripped away the seat of his trousers, exposing his buttocks. The policemen then prodded the men toward the cemetery fence and forced them to climb it, laughing at the plight of the drunk with the exposed buttocks. As the drunks went over the fence, one policeman shouted, “I ought to run you fuckers in!” The other remarked to the observer, “Those assholes won’t be back; a bunch of shitty winos.” Not long after they returned to their car, the policemen stopped a woman who had made a left turn improperly. She was treated very politely, and the younger policeman, who wrote the ticket, later commented to the observer, “Nice lady.” At 7:30 they were dispatched to check a suspicious auto. After a quick check, the car was marked abandoned. Shortly after a 30-minute break for a 7:30 “lunch,” the two policemen received a dispatch to take a burglary report. Ar^ riving at a slum walkup, the police entered a room where an obviously drunk white man in his late 40s insisted that someone had entered and stolen his food and liquor. He kept insisting that it had been taken and that he had been forced to borrow money to buy beer. The younger policeman, who took the report, kept harassing the man, alternating between mocking and badgering him with rhetorical questions. “You say your name is Half-A-Wit [for Hathaway]? Do you sleep with niggers? How did you vote on the bond issue? Are you sure that’s all that’s missing? Are you a virgin yet?” The man responded to all of this with the seeming vagueness and joviality of the intoxicated, expressing gratitude for the policemen’s help as they left. The older policeman remarked to the observer as they left,
## “Ain’t drunks funny?”

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 283

For the next hour little happened, but as the two were moving across the precinct shortly after 10 p . m ., a white man and a woman in their 50’s flagged them down. Since they were obviously “substantial” middle-class citizens of the district, the policemen listened to their complaints that a Negro man was causing trouble inside the public-transport station from which they had just emerged. The woman said that he had sworn at her. The older policeman remarked, “W hat’s a nigger doing up here? He should be down on Franklin Road!” With that, they ran into the station and grabbed the Negro man who was inside. W ithout questioning him, they shoved him into a phone booth and began beating him with their fists and a flashlight. They also hit him in the groin. Then they dragged him out and kept him on his knees. He pleaded that he had just been released from a mental hospital that day and, begging not to be hit again, asked them to let him return to the hospital. One policeman said: “Don’t you like us, nigger? I like to beat niggers and rip out their eyes.” They took him outside to their patrol car. Then they decided to put him on a bus, telling him that he was returning to the hospital; they deliberately put him on a bus going in the opposite direction. Just before the Negro boarded the bus, he said, “You police just like to shoot and beat people.” The first policeman replied, “Get moving, nigger, or I’ll shoot you.” The man was crying and bleeding as he was put on the bus. Leaving the scene, the younger policeman commented, “He won’t be back.” For the rest of the evening, the two policemen kept looking for drunks and harassing any they found. They concluded the evening by being dispatched to an address where, they were told, a man was being held for the police. No one answered their knock. They left. The station house has long been suspected of harboring questionable police practices. Interrogation-room procedures have been attacked, particularly because of the methods the police have used to get confessions. The drama of the confession in the interrogation room has been complete with bright lights and physical torture. Whether or not such practices have

## 284 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

ever existed on the scale suggested by popular accounts, confessions in recent years, even by accounts of offenders, have rarely been accompanied by such high dj;ama. But recently the interrogation room has come under fire again for its failure to protect the constitutional rights of the suspect to remain silent and to have legal counsel.
Backstage at the Station The police station, however, is more than just a series of cubicles called interrogation rooms. There are other rooms and usually a lockup as well. Many of these are also hidden from public view. It is not surprising, then, that one-third of all the observations of the undue use of force occurred within the station. In any station there normally are several policemen present who should be able to deal with almost any situation requiring force that arises. In many of the situations that were observed, as many as seven and eight policemen were present, most of whom simply stood by and watched force being used. The custom among policemen, it appeared, is that you intervene only if a fellow policeman needs help, or if you have been personally offended or affronted by those involved. Force is used unnecessarily at many different points and places in the station. The citizen who is not cooperative during the booking process may be pushed or shoved, have his handcuffs twisted with a nightstick, have his foot stomped, or be pulled by the hair. All of these practices were reported by policemen as ways of obtaining “cooperation.” But it was clear that the booking could have been completed without any of this harassment. The lockup was the scene of some of the most severe applications of force. Two of the three cases requiring hospitalization came about when an offender was “worked over” in the lockup. To be sure, the arrested are not always cooperative when they get in the lockup, and force may be necessary to place them in a cell. But the amount of force observed hardly seemed necessary.

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 285

One evening an observer was present in the lockup when two white policemen came in with a white man. The suspect had been handcuffed and brought to the station because he had proved obstreperous after being arrested for a traffic violation. Apparently he had been drinking. While waiting in the lockup, the man began to urinate on the floor. In response, the policemen began to beat the man. They jumped him, knocked him down, and beat his head against the concrete floor. He required emergency treatment at a nearby hospital. At times a policeman may be involved in a kind of escalation of force. Using force appropriately for an arrest in the field seemingly sets the stage for its later use, improperly, in the station. The following case illustrates how such a situation may develop: Within a large city’s high-crime rate precinct, occupied mostly by Negroes, the police responded to an “officer in trouble” call. It is difficult to imagine a call that brings a more immediate response, so a large number of police cars immediately converged at an intersection of a busy public street where a bus had been stopped. Near the bus, a white policeman was holding two young Negroes at gun point. The policeman reported that he had responded to a summons from the white bus-driver complaining that the boys had refused to pay their fares and had used obscene, language. The policeman also reported that the boys swore at him, and one swung at him while the other drew a screwdriver and started toward him. At that point, he said, he drew his pistol. The policemen placed one of the offenders in handcuffs and began to transport both of them to the station. While driving to the station, the driver of one car noted that the other policeman, transporting the other boy, was struggling with him. The first policeman stopped and entered the other patrol car. The observer reported that he kept hitting the boy who was handcuffed until the boy appeared completely subdued. The boy kept saying, “You don’t have any right to beat me. I don’t care if you kill me.” After the policemen got the offenders to the station, although the boys no longer resisted them, the police began to

## 286 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

beat them while they were handcuffed in an interrogation room. One of the boys hollered: “You can’t beat me like this! I’m only a kid, and my hands are tied.” Later one of the policemen commented to the observer: “On the street you can’t beat them. But when you get to the station, you can instill some respect in them.” Cases where the offender resists an arrest provide perhaps the most difficulty in judging the legitimacy of the force applied. An encounter that began as a dispatch to a disturbance at a private residence was one case about which there could be honest differences in judgment. On arrival, the policemen— one white, the other Negro—met a white woman who claimed that her husband, who was in the back yard and drunk, had beaten her. She asked the policemen to “take him in.” The observer reported that the police found the man in the house. When they attempted to take him, he resisted by placing his hands between the door jamb. Both policemen grabbed him. The Negro policeman said, “W e’re going to have trouble, so let’s finish it right here.” He grabbed the offender and knocked him down. Both policemen then wrestled with the man, handcuffed him, and took him to the station. As they did so, one of the policemen remarked, “These sons of bitches want to fight, so you have to break them quick.”
      A Minimal Picture?
The reader, as well as most police administrators, may be skeptical about reports that policemen used force in the presence of observers. Indeed, one police administrator, indignant over reports of undue use of force in his department, seemed more concerned that the policemen had permitted themselves to be observed behaving improperly than he was about their improper behavior. When demanding to know the names of the policemen who had used force improperly so he could discharge them—a demand we could not meet, since we were bound to protect our sources of information—he remarked,

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 287

“Any officer who is stupid enough to behave that way in the presence of outsiders deserves to be fired.” There were and are a number of reasons why our observers were able to see policemen behaving improperly. We entered each department with the full cooperation of the top administrators. So far as the men in the line were concerned, our chief interest was in how citizens behave toward the police, a main object of our study. Many policemen, given their strong feelings against citizens, fail to see that their own behavior is equally open to observation. Furthermore, our observers are trained to fit into a role of trust—one that is genuine, since most observers are actually sympathetic to the plight of the policeman, if not to his behavior. Finally, and this is a fact all too easily forgotten, people cannot change their behavior in the presence of others as easily as many think. This is particularly true when people become deeply involved in certain situations. The policeman not only comes to “trust” the observer in the law-enforcement situation-regarding him as a source of additional help if necessary— but, when he becomes involved in a dispute with a citizen, he easily forgets that an observer is present. Partly because he does not know what else to do, in such situations the policeman behaves “normally.” But should one cling to the notion that most policemen modify their behavior in the presence of outsiders, one is left with the uncomfortable conclusion that our cases represent a minimal picture of actual misbehavior. Superficially it might seem that the use of an excessive amount of force against citizens is low. In only 37 of 3826 encounters observed did the police use undue force. Of the 4604 white citizens in these encounters, 27 experienced an excessive amount of force—a rate of 5.9 for every 1000 citizens involved. The comparable rate for 5960 Negroes, of whom 17 experienced an excessive amount of force, is 2.8. Thus, whether one considers these rates high or low, the fact is that the rate of excessive force for all white citizens in encounters w ith the police is twice that for N egro citizens . A rate depends, however, upon selecting a population that is

## 288 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

logically the target of force. What we have just given is a rate for all citizens involved in encounters with the police. But many of these citizens are not logical targets of force. Many, for example, simply call the police to complain about crimes against themselves or their property. And others are merely witnesses to crimes. The more logical target population consists of citizens whom the police allege to be offenders—a population of suspects. In our study, there were 643 white suspects, 27 of whom experienced undue use of force. This yields an abuse rate of 41.9 per 1000 white suspects. The comparable rate for 751 Negro suspects, of whom 17 experienced undue use of force, is 22.6 per
1000. If one accepts these rates as reasonably reliable estimates
of the undue force against suspects, then there should be little doubt that in major metropolitan areas the sort of behavior commonly called “police brutality’’ is far from rare. Popular impression casts police brutality as a racial m atterwhite police mistreating Negro citizens. The fact is that white suspects are more liable to being treated improperly by the police than Negro suspects are. This, however, should not be confused with the chances a citizen takes of being mistreated. In two of the cities we studied, Negroes are a minority. The chances, then, that any Negro has of being treated improperly are, perhaps, more nearly comparable to those for whites. If the rates are comparable, then one might say that the application of force unnecessarily by the police operates without respect to the race of an offender. Many people believe that the race of the policeman must affect his use of force, particularly since many white policemen express prejudice against Negroes. Our own work shows that in the police precincts made up largely of Negro citizens, over three-fourths of the policemen express prejudice against Negroes. Only 1 percent express sympathetic attitudes. But as sociologists and social psychologists have often shown, prejudice and attitudes do not necessarily carry over into discriminatory actions. Our findings show that there is little difference between the rate of force used by white and by Negro policemen. Of the

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 289

54 policemen observed using too much force, 45 were white and 9 were Negro. For every 100 white policemen, 8.7 will use force; for every 100 Negro policemen, 9.8 will. W hat this really means, though, is that about one in every 10 policemen in high-crime rate areas of cities sometimes uses force unnecessarily. Yet, one may ask, doesn’t prejudice enter into the use of force? Didn’t some of the policemen who were observed utter prejudiced statements toward Negroes and other minoritygroup members? Of course they did. But the question of whether it was their prejudice or some other factor that motivated them to mistreat Negroes is not so easily answered. Still, even though our figures show that a white suspect is more liable to encounter violence, one may ask whether white policemen victimize Negroes more than whites. W e found, for the most part, that they do not. Policemen, both Negro and white, are most likely to exercise force against members of their own race: 67 percent of the citizens victimized by white policemen were white; 71 percent of the citizens victimized by Negro policemen were Negro. To interpret these statistics correctly, however, one should take into account the differences in opportunity policemen have to use force against members of their own and other races. Negro policemen, in the three cities we studied, were far less likely to police white citizens than white policemen were to police Negroes. Negro policemen usually policed other Negroes, while white policed both whites and Negroes about equally. In total numbers, then, more white policemen than Negro policemen used force against Negroes. But this is explained by the fact that whites make up 85 percent of the police force, and more than 50 percent of all policemen policing Negroes. Though no precise estimates are possible, the facts just given suggest that white policemen, even though they are prejudiced toward Negroes, do not discriminate against Negroes in the excessive use of force. The use of force by the police is more readily explained by police culture than it is by the policeman’s race. Indeed, in the few cases where we observed a Ne-

## 290 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

gro policeman using unnecessary force against white citizens, there was no evidence that he did so because of his race. The disparity between our findings and the public’s sense that Negroes are the main victims of police brutality can easily be resolved if one asks how the public becomes aware of the police misusing force.

## The Victims and the Turf

Fifty years ago, the immigrants to our cities—Eastern and Southern Europeans such as the Poles and the Italians—complained about police brutality. Today the new immigrants to our cities—mostly Negroes from the rural South—raise their voices through the civil-rights movement, through blacknationalist and other race-conscious organizations. There is no comparable voice for white citizens since, except for the Puerto Ricans, they now lack the nationality organizations that were once formed to promote and protect the interests of their immigrant forbears. Although policemen do not seem to select their victims according to race, two facts stand out. All victims were offenders, and all were from the lower class. Concentrating as we did on high-crime rate areas of cities, we do not have a representative sample of residents in any city. Nonetheless, we observed a sizable minority of middle- and upper-status citizens, some of whom were offenders. But since no middle- or upper-class offender, white or Negro, was the victim of an excessive amount of force it appears that the lower class bears the brunt of victimization by the police. The most likely victim of excessive force is a lower-class man of either race. No white woman and only two Negro women were victimized. The difference between the risk assumed by white and by Negro women can be accounted for by the fact that far more Negro women are processed as suspects or offenders. Whether or not a policeman uses force unnecessarily depends upon the social setting in which the encounter takes place. Of

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 291

the 37 instances of excessive force 37 percent took place in police-controlled settings such as the patrol car or the precinct station. Public places, usually streets, accounted for 41 percent, and 16 percent took place in a private residence. The remaining 6 percent occurred in commercial settings. This is not of course a random sample of settings where the police encounter suspects. What is most obvious, and most disturbing, is that the police are very likely to use force in settings that they control. Although only 18 percent of all situations involving suspects ever ended up at the station house, 32 percent of all situations where an excessive amount of force was used took place in the police station. No one who accepts the fact that the police sometimes use an excessive amount of force should be surprised by our finding that they often select their own turf. W hat should be apparent to the nation’s police administrators, however, is that these settings are under their command and control. Controlling the police in the field, where the policeman is away from direct supervision, is understandably difficult. But the station house is the police administrator’s domain. The fact that one in three instances of excessive force took place in settings that can be directly controlled should cause concern among police officials. The presence of citizens who might serve as witnesses against a policeman should deter him from undue use of force. Indeed, procedures for the review of police conduct are based on the presumption that one can get this kind of testimony. Otherwise, one is left simply with a citizen complaint and contrary testimony by the policeman—a situation in which it is very difficult to prove the citizen’s allegation. In most situations involving the use of excessive force, there were witnesses. In our 37 cases, there were bystanders present three-fourths of the time. But in only one situation did the group present sympathize with the citizen and threaten to report the policeman. A complaint was filed on that incident— the only one of the 37 observed instances of undue force in which a formal complaint was filed.

## 292 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

All in all, the situations where excessive force was used were devoid of bystanders who did not have a stake in being “against” the offender. Generally, they were fellow policemen, or fellow offenders whose truthfulness could be easily challenged. When a policeman uses undue force, then, he usually does not risk a complaint against himself or testimony from witnesses who favor the complainant against the policeman. This, as much as anything, probably accounts for the low rate of formal complaints against policemen who use force unnecessarily. A striking fact is that in more than one-half of all instances of undue coercion, at least one other policeman was present who did not participate in the use of force. This shows that, for the most part, the police do not restrain their fellow policemen. On the contrary, there were times when their very presence encouraged the use of force. One man brought into the lockup for threatening a policeman with a pistol was so severely beaten by this policeman that he required hospitalization. During the beating, some fellow policemen propped the man up, while others shouted encouragement. Though the official police code does not legitimate this practice, police culture does.

## Victims—Defiant or Deviant

Now, are there characteristics of the offender or his behavior that precipitate the use of excessive force by the police? Superficially, yes. Almost one-half of the cases involved open defiance of police authority (39 percent) or resisting arrest (9 percent). Open defiance of police authority, however, is what the policeman defines as his authority, not necessarily “official” authority. Indeed in 40 percent of the cases that the police considered open defiance, the policeman never executed an arrest—a somewhat surprising fact for those who assume that policemen generally “cover” improper use of force with a “bona-fide” arrest and a charge of resisting arrest. But it is still of interest to know what a policeman sees as

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 293

defiance. Often he seems threatened by a simple refusal to acquiesce to his own authority. A policeman beat a handcuffed offender because, when told to sit, the offender did not sit down. One Negro woman was soundly slapped for her refusal to approach the police car and identify herself.
    Important as a threat to his authority may appear to the
policeman, there were many more of these instances in which the policeman did not respond with the use of force. The important issue seems to be whether the policeman manages to assert his authority despite the threat to it. I suspect that policemen are more likely to respond with excessive force when they define the situation as one in which there remains a question as to who is “in charge.”
    Similarly, some evidence indicates that harassment of deviants plays a role in the undue use of force. Incidents involving
drunks made up 27 percent of all incidents of improper use of force; an additional 5 percent involved homosexuals or narcotics users. Since deviants generally remain silent victims to avoid public exposure of their deviance, they are particularly susceptible to the use of excessive force.
    It is clear, though, that the police encounter many situations
involving deviants where no force is used. Generally they respond to them routinely. What is surprising, then, is that the police do not mistreat deviants more than they do. The explanation may lie in the kind of relationships the police have with deviants. Many are valuable to the police because they serve as informers. To mistreat them severely would be to cut off a major source of police intelligence. At the same time, deviants are easily controlled by harassment.
    Clearly, we have seen that police mistreatment of citizens
exists. Is it, however, on the increase?
    Citizen complaints against the police are common, and allegations that the police use force improperly are frequent. There
is evidence that physical brutality exists today. But there is also evidence, from the history of our cities, that the police have long engaged in the use of unnecessary physical force. No one can say with confidence whether there is more or less of it today than there was at the turn of the century.

## 294 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

What we lack is evidence that would permit us to calculate comparative rates of police misuse of force for different periods of American history. Only recently have we begun to count and report the volume of complaints against the police. And the research reported in this article represents the only attempt to estimate the amount of police mistreatment by actual observation of what the police do to citizens.

## Lack of Information

Police chiefs are notoriously reluctant to disclose information that would allow us to assess the nature and volume of complaints against the police. Only a few departments have begun to report something about citizen complaints. And these give us very little information. Consider, for example, the 1966 Annual Report released by the New Orleans Police Department. It tells us that there were 208 cases of “alleged police misconduct on which action was taken.” It fails to tell us whether there were any allegations that are not included among these cases. Are these all the allegations that came to the attention of the department? Or are they only those the department chose to review as “police disciplinary matters”? Of the 208 cases the department considered “disciplinary matters,” the report tells us that no disciplinary action was taken in 106 cases. There were 11 cases that resulted in 14 dismissals; 56 cases that resulted in 72 suspensions, fines, or loss of days; and 35 cases involving 52 written or verbal “reprimands” or “cautionings.” The failure of the report to tell us the charge against the policeman is a significant omission. We cannot tell how many of these allegations involved improper use of force, how many involved verbal abuse or harassment, how many involved police felonies or misdemeanors, and so on. In such reports, the defensive posture of the nation’s police departments is all too apparent. Although the 1966 report of the New Orleans Police Department tells us much about what the police allege were

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 295

the felonies and misdemeanors by citizens of New Orleans, it tells us nothing about what citizens allege was misconduct by the police! Many responsible people believe that the use of physical brutality by the police is on the wane. They point to the fact that, at least outside the South, there are more reports of other forms of police mistreatment of citizens than reports of undue physical coercion. They also suggest that third-degree interrogations and curbstone justice with the nightstick are less common. It does not seem unreasonable, then, to assume that police practices that degrade a citizen’s status or that harass him and restrict his freedom are more common than police misuse of force. But that may have always been so. Whether or not the policeman’s “sense of justice” and his use of unnecessary force have changed remains an open question. Forms may change while practices go on. To move misuse from the street to the station house, or from the interrogation room to the lockup, changes the place but not the practice itself. Our ignorance of just what goes on between police and citizens poses one of the central issues in policing today: How can we make the police accountable to the citizenry in a democratic society and yet not hamstring them in their legitimate pursuit of law and order? There are no simple answers. Police departments are organizations that process people. All people-processing organizations face certain common problems. But the police administrator faces a problem in controlling practice with clients that is not found in most other organizations. The problem is that police contact with citizens occurs in the community, where direct supervision is not possible. Assuming our unwillingness to spend resources for almost one-to-one supervision, the problem for the police commander is to make policemen behave properly when they are not under direct supervision. He also faces the problem of making them behave properly in the station house as well. Historically, we have found but one way—apart from supervision—that deals with this problem. That solution is profes-

## 296 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

sionalization of workers. Perhaps only through the professionalization of the police can we hope to solve the problem of police malpractice. But lest anyone optimistically assume that professionalization will eliminate police malpractice altogether, we should keep in mind that problems of malpractice also occur regularly in both law.and medicine.

police action during a street encounter. This stigmatization process is divided into three stages which, while analytically distinct, are highly interactive and apt to occur in the real world of policing almost simultaneously. For convenience only, then, these phases are labeled affront, clarification, and remedy.
    Throughout this discussion it should be remembered that
the asshole is not necessarily a suspected law violator—although the two often overlap, thus providing double trouble, so to speak, for the labeled. Importantly, the police view of the asshole as deviant is a product of the immediate transaction between the two and not a product of an act preceding the transaction. This is not to say, however, that certain classes in society—for example, the young, the black, the militant, the homosexual—are not “fixed” by the police as a sort of permanent asshole grouping. Indeed, they are. Yet such bounded a priori categories can do policemen little good—except perhaps when dealing with the racial or bohemian obvious—for such stereotypes are frequently misleading and dysfunctional (e.g., the “hippie” who is a detective’s prized informant; the black dressed in a purple jumpsuit who happens to be a mayor’s top aide; the sign carrying protestor who is an undercover FBI agent). And, even in cases in which a priori character judgments are a part of the decision to stop an individual, the asshole label, if it is to play a determining role in the encounter, must arise anew. That is to say, if the asshole distinction is to have a concrete as opposed to abstract meaning, it must in some manner be tied fundamentally and irresolutely to observable social action occurring in the presence of the labeling officer.
    Certainly, a policeman’s past experience with an individual
or with a recognizable group will influence his street behavior. For example, a rookie soon discovers (as a direct consequence of his initiation into a department) that blacks, students, Mexicans, reporters, lawyers, welfare workers, researchers, prostitutes, and gang members are not to be trusted, are unpredictable, and are usually “out-to-get-the-police.” He may even sort these “outsiders” into various categories indicative of the risk

## 298 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

he believes they present to him or the implied contrast they have with his own life-style and beliefs. Yet, without question, these categories will never be exhaustive—although the absolute size of what patrolmen call their “shit lists’7 may grow over the years. Consequently, to understand the police interpretation and meaning of the term “asshole” we must look directly into the field situations in which it originates.
Affront: Challenge
When a police officer approaches a civilian to issue a traffic citation or to inquire as to the whys and wherefores of one’s presence or simply to pass the time of day, he directly brings the power of the state to bear on the situation and hence makes vulnerable to disgrace, embarrassment, and insult that power. Since the officer at the street level symbolizes the presence of the Leviathan in the everyday lives of the citizenry, such interactions take on dramatic properties far different from ordinary citizen-to-citizen transactions (Manning, 1974a; Silver, 1967). In a very real sense, the patrolman-to-citizen exchanges are moral contests in which the authority of the state is either confirmed, denied, or left in doubt. To the patrolman, such contests are not to be taken lightly, for the authority of the state is also his personal authority, and is, of necessity, a matter of some concern to him. To deny or raise doubt about his legitimacy is to shake the very ground upon which his selfimage and corresponding views are built. An affront, as it is used here, is a challenge to the policeman’s authority, control, and definition of the immediate situation. As seen by the police, an affront is simply a response on the part of the other which indicates to them that their position and authority in the interaction are not being taken seriously. It may occur with or without intent. Whether it is the vocal student who claims to “know his rights,” the stumbling drunk who says he has had “only two beers,” or the lady of the evening who believes she is being questioned only because she is wearing “sexy clothes,” the police will respond in particular

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 299

ways to those who challenge or question their motive or right to intervene in situations that they believe demand police intervention. Clearly, overt and covert challenges to police authority will not go unnoticed. In fact, they can be seen to push the encounter to a new level wherein any further slight to an officer, however subtle, provides sufficient evidence to a patrolman that he may indeed be dealing with a certifiable asshole and that the situation is in need of rapid clarification. From this standpoint, an affront can be seen, therefore, as disrupting the smooth flow of the police performance. The argumentative motorist, the pugnacious drunk, the sometimes ludicrous behavior of combatants in a “family beef” all interfere, and hence make more difficult, the police task. Of course some officers relish such encounters. In this sense, ironically, the asshole gives status to the police rather than takes it away. However, since the label is itself a moral charge (and it need not be made salient or verbally expressed), it is open theoretically for rebuttal and evidence may or may not be forthcoming which will substantiate or contradict the charge. Such evidence is gathered in the next analytic stage.
Clarification: Confrontation
Based upon a perceived affront, the patrolman must then attempt to determine precisely the kind of person with whom he is engaged. It is no longer an idle matter to him in which his private conceptions of people can be kept private as he goes about his business. But the patrolman is now in a position wherein he may discover that his taken-for-granted authority on the street is not exactly taken for granted by another. Two commonsensical issues are critical at this point in an encounter. First, the officer must determine whether or not the individual under question could have, under the present circumstances, acted in an alternative fashion. To wit, did the perceived affront occur by coercion or accident through no fault of the person? Did the person even know he was dealing with a police officer? Was he acting with a gun at his head? And so on.

## 300 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

Second, and equally important, given that the person could have acted differently, the officer must determine whether or not the individual was aware of the consequences that might follow his action. In other words, was the action frivolous, naive, unserious, and not meant to offend? Did the person know that his actions were likely to be interpreted offensively by the police? The answers to these two questions, provide patrolmen with material (or lack of it) to construct and sustain an asshole definition. Let us examine in some depth these questions, for they raise the very issue of personal responsibility which is at the nexus of the asshole definition.1 McHugh (1969) argues persuasively that the social construction of deviant categories is a matter of elimination which proceeds logically through a series of negotiated offers and responses designed to fix responsibility for a perceived deviant act (i.e., a deviant act requires a charge before it can be said to have happened). Police follow a similar paradigm when filling, emptying, or otherwise attending to their person categories. Again, the first item to be determined in this process is the issue of whether or not the person had alternative means available to him of which he could reasonably be expected to be aware. For example, the speeding motorist who, when pulled to the side of the road, could be excused for his abusive language if it were discovered by the officer that the motorist’s wife was at the same time in the back seat giving birth to a child. Similarly, juveniles “hanging out” on a public street corner at certain times of the day may be sometimes overlooked if the police feel that “those kids don’t have anyplace to go.” On the other hand, if it can be determined that there is no unavoidable reason behind the affronting action, the individual risks being labeled an asshole. The drunken and remorseless driver, the wife who harangues the police officer for mistreating her husband after she herself requested police ser1. In most regards, the asshole is a classic case of the deviant—although not tran-situationally so. See Matza (1969), Becker (1963), and Cohen (1965) for a systematic elaboration of the ideas which underpin this analysis.

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 301

vice to break up a family fight, or the often-warned teenager who makes a nuisance of himself by flagrantly parading in public after curfew are all persons whom the police believe could have and should have acted differently. Their acts were not inevitable, and it could be expected that they had available to them conventional alternatives. Given that there are no compelling deterministic accounts readily available to the patrolman to excuse a particular affront, the officer must still make a judgment about the offender’s motive. In other words, as the second issue listed above suggests, the policeman must decide whether or not the person knows what he is doing. Could the person be expected to know of the consequences which follow an affront to an officer of the law? Indeed, does the person even realize that what he is doing is likely to provoke police action? Could this particular person be expected to know better? All are questions related to the establishment of a motive for action. For example, the stylized and ceremonial upright third finger when attached to the hand of a thirty-year-old man is taken by the police very differently from the same gesture attached to the hand of a four-year-old child. Loud and raucous behavior in some parts of a city may be ignored if the police feel “the people there don’t know any better.” Or the claim that one is Jesus Christ resurrected and is out to do battle with the wages of sin may indicate to the police that they are either in the presence of a “dope-crazed radical hippie freak” or a “softbrained harmless mental case,” depending, perhaps, on the offender’s age. If the person is young, for instance, responsibility is likely to be individualized—“it is his fault”; however, if the person is old, responsibility is likely to be institutionalized—“he can’t help it, he’s a nut.” Summarily, the police have available to them two principles of clarification. One concerns the means available to a person guilty of an affront, and the other concerns the purposes behind the affront itself. If the affront is viewed as unavoidable or unintended, the person is unlikely to be subjected to shabby or harsh treatment at the hands of the police. The asshole,

## 302 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

however, is one who is viewed as culpable and blameworthy for his affronting action, and, as the next section details, he will be dealt with by the police in ways they feel appropriate.
Remedy: Solution
The above portrait of the clarification principles utilized by police in labeling assholes suggests that certain typical police responses can be displayed by a simple fourfold typology. Figure 6.1 depicts the relationship between the police officer’s assessment of responsibility for the affront and denotes, within each cell, the typical police response given the various possible assessments. Cell A represents the subject case of this essay since it involves a flagrant (inexcusable) disregard for the sentiment of the police. To the police, those falling into this category are unmistakably assholes and are therefore prominent candidates to be the recipients of street justice—the aim of which is to punish or castigate the individual for a moral transgression. Persons placed in this category are also the most likely to be placed under questionable arrest. This is not so because of the original intent of the encounter (which often, by itself, is trivial) but rather because of the serious extra-legal means utilized by the police to enforce their particular view of the situation upon the recalcitrant asshole—“hamming-up” or “thumping” (beating).*2 And, as Reiss (1971) suggests, the use

of force is not a philosophical question to the police but rather one of who, where, when, and how much. The use of such means require of course that the officer manufacture post facto a legally defensible account of his action in order to, in the vernacular of the day, “cover his ass.”3 Such accounts in legalese most often take the form of “disorderly conduct,” “assaulting a police officer,” “the use of loud and abusive language in the presence of women and children,” “disturbing the peace,” or the almost legendary—due to its frequent use—“resisting arrest.” The asshole from this position is subject to a police enactment of double jeopardy—justice without trial in the streets and justice, perhaps with trial, in the courts. And regardless of the outcome in the latter case, there is usually only one loser. I should emphasize, however, that I am not saying the behavior of the asshole may not be brutish, nasty, and itself thoroughly vicious. I am simply suggesting that behavior violating extra-legal moral codes used by police to order their interactions—whether it be inconsiderate, barbarous, or otherwise—will be responded to in which police believe to be appropriate ways. Cell B of Figure 6.1 also represents serious affront to police integrity, and it too may be an affront which calls for an extralegal response. An illustration provided by the remarks of a patrolman is useful in this context: Those goddamn kids got to learn sooner or later that w e w on’t take a lot of shit around Cardoza (a local college campus). N ext time I see one of those punks waving a V iet Cong flag I’m gonna negotiate the little bastard back into an alley and kick his rosy red ass so hard he ain’t gonna carry nothing for awhile. Those kids gotta be made to see that they can’t get away with this type of thing.
makes this explicit when it is suggested that patrolmen must act impersonally without regard to individual prejudice.

described in more depth in Van Maanen (1974). See also Manning (1974b) for a theoretical view of the more general construct, the police lie; and Chevigny (1968) for a presentation of numerous disturbing case studies.

## 304 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

Whether or not such a prediction was actually carried out does not matter, for the quotation itself indicates that “teaching” occupies a particularly prominent position in the police repertoire of possible responses. Thus, the uncooperative and surly motorist finds his sobriety rudely questioned, or the smug and haughty college student discovers himself stretched over the hood of a patrol car and the target of a mortifying and brusque body search. The object of such degradation ceremonies is simply to reassert police control and demonstrate to the citizen that his behavior is considered inappropriate. Teaching techniques are numerous, with threat, ridicule, and harassment among the more widely practiced. Other examples are readily available, such as the morally-toned lectures meted out to those who would atempt to bribe, lie, or otherwise worm their way out of what a policeman sees to be a legitimate traffic citation, the traditional—but vanishing—“kick in the ass” administered to a youngster caught stealing an apple or cutting school. The intent in all these cases is clear. The person must be taught a lesson. And whether the teaching occurs in public or in the back of an alley, the person must be shown the error of his ways. He has acted perhaps out of ignorance, but nevertheless the police feel they must demonstrate that they will not casually overlook the action. However, I should note that the person in this category will remain an asshole in the eyes of the police until he has apparently learned his lesson to the satisfaction of the officers on the scene. Here a display of remorse is no doubt crucial to the police.4 Cell C represents the case in which the police are likely to excuse the affront due to the extenuating cricumstances surrounding the affront. When it is clear to the police that there

ever, police believe that in many cases the asshole will arrange his release before the patrolman will have completed the paperwork necessitated by the arrest. And since the affront was moral, the legal justification to “make the case” in court may be lacking. Thus, the classroom more often than not is in the street. Given the opportunity to teach the asshole either by “turning him in” or “doing him in,” most police would choose the latter.

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 305

are indeed mitigating conditions, their response is to ignore the error—to pretend, as it were, that such an affront never happened. For example, it is understandable to the police that the victim of a mugging may be somewhat abusive toward them when they interrogate him just after the crime (although there is a fine line to be drawn here). Similarly, if a teenage male vigorously defends the chaste and virtuous intentions of he and his girl friend while questioned by the police in a concealed and cozy corner of a public park, it is understood by the police that the boy has few other acceptable alternative lines available. The police response is typically to adopt a somewhat bemused tolerance policy toward actions which under different circumstances may have produced the orb and scepter. Finally, cell D in Figure 6.1 concerns the case of an affront which police take to lie beyond the responsibility of the actor. While such action cannot normally be allowed to continue, the moral indignation felt by police is tempered by the understanding that the person is not aware nor could be easily made aware of the rule-breaking nature of his actions. The police response is to isolate the offender, not to punish him. Thus, the “mental case” is shipped to the county hospital for observation and treatment; the “foul-mouthed child” is returned to those responsible for his behavior; the out-of-state tourist prowling an area close to his hotel but frequented by prostitutes is informed of his “oversight” and told in unmistakable terms to vacate the territory. It is important to note that police feel justified in using only enough force or coercive power to seal off the offender from public (and, by implication, their own) view. To use more force would be considered unreasonable. It has been my purpose here to suggest that much of what the general public might see as capricious, random, or unnecessary behavior on the part of the police is, in fact, governed by certain rather pervasive interpretive rules which lie close enough to the surface such that they can be made visible. Certain police actions, following the model presented above, can be seen, then, to be at least logical if not legal. Further-

## 306 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

more, much of the power of these rules stems from their tacit or taken-for-granted basis. Indeed, were the rules to be questioned, the game could not continue. However, while these rules are applied in a like fashion by all police in a given interactional episode, the specific situated behavior of a citizen that is taken as a sign which leads to isolating, ignoring, teaching, or castigating a given individual is no doubt quite different across patrolmen. Here, the police game continues as it does because, in part, the asshole label swallows up and hides whatever individual differences exist across patrolmen. Thus, language neatly solves the problem of misunderstanding that would arise among the police were the rules to be articulated and standards sought as to how they should be applied.

## Some Conclusions

It is possible, of course, to see the preceding ritualized sequence as an isolated and rarely indulged propensity of the police. However, in this section, I will argue that indeed such a sequence and the corresponding identification and treatment of the asshole is intimately related to the police production and represents an aspect of policing that is near the core of the patrolman’s definition of his task. In essence, the existence of an asshole demonstrates and confirms the police view of the importance and worth of themselves both as individuals and as members of a necessary occupation. However, several other, somewhat more practical and everyday features of police work insure the ominous presence of the asshole in the police world. First, the labeling of individuals as assholes can be seen as a technique (although invisible to most) useful to patrolmen in providing distance between themselves and their segmented audiences—to be liked by the people in the street is, in the defensive rhetoric of patrolmen, a sign of a bad cop. By profaning and degrading the actions of another, social distance can be established and maintained—a guarantee, so to speak, that the other will not come uncomfortably close. Thus, the ass-

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 307

hole simplifies and orders the policeman’s world and continually verifies his classification scheme regarding those who are “like him” and those who are “unlike him.” Relatedly the labeling serves also as an immediate call to action, denoting a consensually approved (by the police culture), means for remedying “out-of-kilter” situations. Second, the label not only describes and prescribes but it also explains and makes meaningful the statements and actions of others. In fact, an entire set of action expectations (i.e., “they are out to make the police look bad”) can be ascribed as motives to the asshole. In this sense, the police function in street interaction is not unlike that of a psychiatrist diagnosing a patient. Both explain perceived deviancy in terms of a characterological genesis. Hence, the label implies that a different, inappropriate, and strange motivational scheme is used by the “type of person” known as an asshole. In this manner, an act is made understandable by stripping away whatever meaning might be attributed to it by the actor. Thus, to mate sense of the act is to assume that it does not make sense—that it is stupid, irrational, wrong, deranged, or dangerous. Any other assumption would be too threatening. Third, the labeling process must be viewed as serving an occupational purpose. I suggested previously that the urban policeman is primarily a keeper of the peace yet he defines his job in terms of law enforcement. Furthermore, as others have noted, many patrolmen try to convert peacekeeping situations to those of law enforcement (e.g., Bittner, 1967, 1970; Wilson, 1968; Piliavin and Briar, 1964). Since real police work is seldom available, marginally legitimate arrests of assholes provide a patrolman excitement and the opportunity to engage one’s valued skills. Perhaps the police cliche, “a good beat is full of deadbeats,” reflects structural support for the assholelabeling phenomena. Fourth, the discovery and subsequent action taken when the police encounter the asshole provides an expressive outlet—almost ceremonial in its predictability—for much of the frustration policing engenders. To the patrolman, one particular asshole symbolizes all those that remain “out there” un-

## 308 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

touched, untaught, and unpunished. Such emotional outbursts provide, therefore, a reaffirmation of the moral repugnance of the asshole. Whether the officer responds by placing the handcuffs on the person’s wrists such that they cut off circulation (and not incidentally cause intense, almost excruciating pain) or pushes a destitute soul through a shop window, these actions release some of the pent-up energies stored up over a period in which small but cumulative indignities are suffered by the police at the hands of the community elites, the courts, the politicians, the uncaught crooks, the press, and numerous others. The asshole stands, then, as a ready ersatz for those whom the police will never—short of a miracle—be in a position to directly encounter and confront. Finally, the asshole can be seen as a sort of reified other, representing all those persons who would question, limit, or otherwise attempt to control the police. From this standpoint, knowing that there are assholes at large serves perhaps to rally and solidify police organizations around at least one common function. Thus, the police are, to a limited degree, unified by their disdain of those who would question their activities. Perhaps one could say that the police represent what Simmel (1950) referred to as an “invisible church” in which the faithful are fused together through their common relation to an outside phenomenon. Consequently, assholes are not simply obscure and fanciful figments of the bedeviled imagination of the police. On the contrary, they define to a surprising degree what the police are about. And while the internal satisfactions and rewards involved in “slamming around” an asshole may seem esoteric if not loathsome to the outsider, to the patrolman who makes his living on the city streets it is not.

## Postscript

The foregoing description and explanation of an overlooked aspect of urban policing highlights the fact that the police officer is anything but a Weberian bureaucrat whose discretion

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 309

and authority are checked rigidly. The collective myth surrounding the rulebound upoliceman-as-public-servant” has no doubt never been very accurate. By virtue of their independence from superiors, their carefully guarded autonomy in the field, their deeply felt notions about real police work and those who would interfere with it, and their increasing isolation from the public they serve (as a result of mobile patrol, rotating shifts, greater specialization of the police, and the growing segmentation of the society at large with its own specialized and emerging subcultures), police-community “problems” will not disappear. And, since the police view their critics as threatening and as persons who generally should be taught or castigated, one could argue that the explosive potential of citizen-police encounters will grow. Additionally, if the police become more sensitive to public chastisement, it could be expected that something of a selffulfilling prophecy may well become a more important factor in the street than it is presently. That is to say, if the police increasingly view their public audience as foes—whose views are incomprehensible if not degenerate or subversive—it is likely that they will also magnify clues which will sustain the stereotype of citizen-as-enemy escalating therefore the percentage of street interactions which result in improper arrest and verbal or physical attack. Thus, the fantasy may well become the reality as stereotypes are transformed into actualities. In fact, the future may make prophetic Brendan Behan’s halfjesting remark that he had never seen a situation so bad that a policeman couldn’t make it worse. To conclude, this essay has implied that there is a virtual—if unintended—license in this society granted to police. In particular, when it comes to the asshole, police actions are not governed at all, given the present policies of allowing the watchers to watch themselves. It would seem that something is amiss, and, if the practical morality in urban areas is not exactly inverted, it is at least tilted. If the asshole is indeed a critical aspect of policing, then there is serious risk involved in the movement to “professionalize” the police. As other observers have remarked, successful occupational professionaliza-

## 310 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

tion inevitably leads to increased autonomy and ultimately increased power for members of the occupation (Becker, 1962; Hughes, 1965). Professionalism may well widen the police mandate in society and therefore amplify the potential of the police to act as moral entrepreneurs. From this perspective, what is required at present is not professional police but accountable police.

The police have unique power. They are the only representatives of governmental authority who in the ordinary course of events are legally permitted to use physical force against a citizen. Other agencies of state power rely upon request, persuasion, public opinion, custody, and legal and judicial processes to gain compliance with rules and laws. Only the police can use firearms to compel the citizen to obey. The police are also in a special category in that they are sworn to enforce the law at all times, on or off duty in most jurisdictions, so that their access to firearms is constant and legal.

the power of life and death over the citizen is facilitated by the unique legal definition of the powers and responsibilities of the police in our society. The research program of which this report is a part considered fatal incidents, incidents where police as police kill and/or are killed. The research ended in 1970 and used records on about 1500 civilians killed by the police and 400 killings of police officers. In examining violent police-citizen interactions the choice of homicidal instances has advantages in research. While “brutality” and “assault” are vaguely defined and poorly reported, death is a clear fact which is officially recorded; and homicides are usually reported to the public through news media. The limited universe too is more suitable for focused study. The present report deals almost solely with police killing. Information about incidents where policemen are killed is easily available (for instance in the annual reports issued by the FBI); whereas even simple data on police killings are hard to find, and details of these homicidal encounters are extremely difficult to locate. Moreover, the system of justice seems inoperative in cases of police killing: Of 1500 incidents, I have been able to discover only three in which criminal punishment resulted (Kobler, 1975). Finally, the killing of civilians by the police, exacerbated by the low probability of just resolution, has produced many periods of intense conflict between the police and the community. This problem is separate from the extremely difficult job of the police, the danger policemen face, the number of policemen who are killed each year and the fact that many police killings are clearly justifiable. It is apart from the general thrust of human relations concerns about policecommunity relationships, based as they are upon misperceptions on both sides of the conflict, upon prejudice, upon class and value differences. Here we are dealing with a specific issue. Procedures for justice must be developed, for without them a constant abrasive exists between the established powers and a large portion of our society. There is some information on police homicide regularly available to the public. The United States Public Health Ser-

vice’s annual Vital Statistics which reports all deaths in the nation and their causes has a category “Violent Death,” with a subdivision specifying police involvement (now called “homicide by legal intervention”). Its data, broken down by sex and by race for males, are summarized for the years 1952 through 1969 in Table 6.1. It is clear that there has been a marked increase in police homicide in recent years. Whereas during the 13-year period 1952-1964 an average of 237 civilians were killed each year by the police, the five-year period 1965-1969 averaged 332 homicides. There has as well been a rise in the number of police officers killed as the comparative figures presented in Table 6.1 attest (FBI, annual). Noteworthy is the consistency of a. 1 to 5 ratio of police killed to police killing. While there was a big jump to 387 police killings in 1967, there was also a marked rise in police killed to a new high of
76. The FBI reported 100 police killed in 1970; from my data
I estimate a police homicide figure of 500. In a sizeable percentage of cases the killing seems of questionable necessity and justifiability. Using the threat of death or severe injury to a person as criteria for justifiability of homicide, information on about 1500 incidents from 1960 through 1970 suggests that two-fifths of the killings were justifiable, one-fifth questionable, and two-fifths unjustifiable. Such judgments are clearly academic, however, for less than one percent of police homicides are legally judged to be unjustifiable. The Scranton Commission, speaking of the police in Jackson, Mississippi, concluded that: A significant cause o f the deaths and injuries at Jackson State C ollege is the con fid en ce o f w h ite officers that if th ey fire w eap - ons during a black cam pus disturbance th ey w ill face neither stern departm ental discipline nor crim inal prosecution or c o n v ictions. (S ton e, 1970, p. 2)
The commission statement is undoubtedly true, but it is too limited. Police officers, black or white, firing weapons at citizens of all skin colors and ages, can be confident that there will be few consequences. As noted earlier, of 1500 homicides only three officers are known to have received criminal punishment.

W hy is this so? Let us look at the dimensions of our system of justice as it applies to police use of force. The reader should be aware that it is the system, rather than the police, that is the focus of critical examination here. Many police killings are justifiable and police officers are often in danger, but it is with the unjustifiable killings that the system fails.

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 315

Laws Regarding Police Use of Force What are the legal limitations on police use of force? States vary, but there is a general thrust of law throughout the nation (Chapman, 1967). A police officer is clearly justified in using deadly force when it is necessary to save himself or another person from death or grave bodily harm. This is so in any situation. He is generally not permitted to use deadly force to protect himself or others from assaults which are not likely to have serious results. This basic “defense of life” rule is sometimes misused. In some areas it seems to be standard practice for the police to report that a fleeing unarmed person, later killed, had moved his hand toward his belt or had a shiny object in his hand. Such a report alone is accepted as justification for the use of firearms—even if the person is fleeing.
    Another general rule is that an officer may not use deadly
force to effect the arrest of a person suspected of being a misdemeanant, someone who has committed a minor crime. In the case of an escaping misdemeanant, the value of human life seems to supersede the importance of immediate apprehension. However, it is noteworthy that in some jurisdictions the very act of fleeing is defined as a felony; under such a law an officer is permitted to use all possible force, including firearms, to prevent the escape of a person fleeing after an arrest has been made, no matter what the original offense.
    One example of the use of this guideline occurred in the
case of T.O., who was killed on December 28, 1968, by Patrolman G.K. in Prince Georges County, Maryland. T.O. had driven to the Mount Pleasant police station at about 1:45 a .ai ., parked his car, and told the police he was too drunk to drive and wanted them to drive him home. He refused a police offer to call a cab for him, became boisterous and unruly, and was charged with being drunk and disorderly. As he was being taken to a cell he hit officer G.K. and ran outside to the parking lot. G.K. followed, fired two warning shots and then a third shot which hit T.O. in the neck; he died in a hospital intensive care ward six days later.

## 316 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

G.K. was suspended and the case presented to the county grand jury. The state’s attorney noted that the patrolman had “apparently deviated” from the prosecutor’s guidelines on police use of firearms and that there may have been a “violation of the law.” Maryland law indicated that a policeman should avoid firing at a person fleeing from arrest on a misdemeanor such as a disorderly conduct charge. The grand jury, however, brought no indictments. A police board was convened to evaluate patrolman G.K.’s action and concluded that “O. became a felon when he escaped from K.’s custody, regardless of the charge on which he had been arrested.” The board quoted Article 27, Section 139, of the Annotated Code of Maryland, which holds that: “If any offender legally detained and confined in the penitentiary, jail, . . . or station, escapes he shall be guilty of a felony.” They added that police regulations permit firing at fleeing felons. On February 26, 1969, Patrolman G.K. was reinstated with back pay and vacation time. There are few statutory limits on police in dealing with people who are defined as felons. In most states it is lawful for the police to risk killing when necessary to effect the arrest or to prevent the escape of a person guilty of a felony if no other means of preventing flight is reasonably available. The laws of states vary; some say that the person has to be a known felon, that the felony has to be seen, or the person has to be known to have committed a felony. Others indicate that reasonable suspicion of the carrying out of a felony is adequate for defining the person as a felon and therefore maximum force can be used if other methods for apprehension are not available. The fleeing felon rule is often stretched beyond recognition by the police and other authorities to justify a police homicide. An example was the case of R.M., 19 years old, who was killed by Riverside, California, motorcycle Patrolman J.W. on February 7, 1967. Early in the afternoon, J.W. received a call reporting a speeding and recklessly driven Chevrolet; he went to investigate but could not locate the car. A couple of hours later, after a second call, he spotted the car and pursued it. The car was going fast for that street and J.W. turned on his red light; about a tenth of a mile later the car slowed and pulled

over. Two young people were in the car. W. asked the driver, R.M., for his driver’s license; he said he didn’t have one. Patrolman W. told both young men to get out of the car and told them they were under arrest. He had them place their hands on the hood of the car and searched them, both young people being cooperative; there were no weapons. W. then began to suspect the car might be stolen and reached through the window for the registration holder. The young men ran. He chased them, yelled for them to stop, said he would shoot, fired a shot into the air, kept running after one young man, and finally killed him. A 15-member jury unanimously decided after 20 minutes’ deliberation that the killing was justifiable under the law. The deputy district attorney who conducted the inquest instructed the jury that “the privilege of justification” extends to a situation in which a law enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe the suspect had committed a felony, even though the suspect, who was shot while “fleeing justice,” or “resisting arrest,” had not been charged formally with a felony. The district attorney later announced his decision not to bring criminal charges against J.W. Samuel Chapman, who did the major research on police use of firearms for the 1966-67 President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice, wrote:
T h e rule that an officer m ay, if necessary, take the life o f a felon in effecting an arrest seem s linked to the ancient law under w h ich all felonies w ere punishable b y death. In recen t years, how ever, various legislative bodies have introduced such n o n -violen t o ffenses as statutory rape, larceny, sod om y, extortion, perjury, fo rgery, adultery, bigam y, incest, pandering, to our crim inal codes and afforded them fe lo n y status. In consequence, the traditional con cep t that an officer m ay use w hatever force is necessary to e ffect the arrest o f a k n ow n felo n has becom e com plicated and open to ridicule. (1967, p. 27)
But the excesses of the fleeing felon rule are not limited to felonies; it is used to justify the killing of a misdemeanant, especially since suspicion alone is an adequate defense. Such use,

## 318 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

particularly in light of the abolition of the death penalty in our nation, makes the killings thoroughly incongruous with our values and legal structure. Moreover, one can question the constitutionality of the usual justifiable homicide statute. An officer can justifiably kill a person if he has probable cause to believe him to be a fleeing felon. Execution, then, is authorized on probable cause alone, and all the constitutionally defined due process safeguards, which at the minimum require proof of guilt before any punishment can be levied, are removed from the affected citizen. It must be emphasized that the suspicion of a felony, even enough suspicion to result in arrest, does not mean that the individual arrested and accused is guilty. In the many situations where police fire at “fleeing felons,” the policemen are taking into their own hands the position of accuser, judge, jury, and executioner. After all, a sizeable number of those arrested in the United States by police officers acting on the reasonable belief that a felony has been committed are released with no charges brought against them.

## Police Administration Rules Regarding Firearms

In addition to the statutory limitations on the use of firearms by police officers, many police departments have regulations of their own. These vary widely. The President’s Commission understated the case in its conclusion: “In most cities police officers receive too little guidance as to when firearms may be drawn and used” (1967, p. 119). Firearm policies in some cities are contained in their entirety by such statements as: “Leave the gun in the holster until you intend to use it,” and, “It is left to the discretion of each individual officer when and how to shoot” (Chapman, 1967). In some cities, guidelines are both clear and humane. A Los Angeles officer cannot use deadly force to protect himself from an attack “not likely to have serious results,” nor can he shoot at a suspected felony offender who refuses the command to halt or at a known felony offender who acts similarly

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 319

“except under compelling circumstances.” A police officer is commanded not to shoot at even the most dangerous juvenile offender unless his own or another person’s life is imperiled. Officers are warned that regardless of the legal justification for firing at a suspect, the policeman’s “basic responsibility is to protect the public” and officers “should be particularly cautious when firing under conditions that would subject bystanders to injury or death” (The Los Angeles Times, 1965). Of course, it is difficult to know how many police officers are limited in their use of guns by such guidelines. What is apparent, however, is that more civilians are killed by police officers in Los Angeles than in any other city (Kobler, 1975), that very many of the killings are in obvious deviance from the police regulations, and finally that few police officers are penalized, at least as far as the public can know.
    Penalties against police officers who have killed citizens
probably occur most often as a consequence of internal police procedures. These are usually, but not always, secret. Some nonsecret discipline has followed public trials of police killers who were acquitted. One was the trial of Officer M.O. in San Francisco, who killed G.B., a 28-year-old black man, in September of 1968. Officer M.O. was off duty, had had a good bit to drink, and after an altercation over a minor incident, killed B., a latecomer to the scene who had attempted to knock the gun out of M.O.’s hands with a stick (a rung from a chair). After a long trial and a hung jury, the police officer was acquitted. Nevertheless, the San Francisco Police Commission held hearings related to charges of M.O.’s unofficerlike conduct. The three-man commission unanimously voted to fire Officer M.O. from the force, finding him guilty of “unofficerlike conduct and breach of the peace,” findings based in part on the policeman’s racial epithets that day.
    Patrolman R.M. killed a 25-year-old black man, L.H., in October of 1965 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. L.H. was one of
about a dozen men shooting craps on the street when the police tried to raid the game. R.M. fired a warning shot at the running L.H., something that was against police regulations, and then shot again and killed him. M. claimed that the second

    Absence of Any Penalty
There are other cases where the killing is irregular and questionable, where the public is actively concerned, where the police officers are tried and acquitted, and where authorities do not act to penalize the officers. The consequences of the killing of C.H., a 26-year-old black man, in Winchester, Kentucky, in August of 1966, point up this fact all too clearly. C.H. was drunk and had been yelling in the street in front of his house when officers came and tried to arrest him. H. went into his house. Not long afterwards, four officers entered the house, all with drawn guns, and the consequence was the unarmed C.H.’s death. The officers were indicted for murder by the Clark County grand jury, suspended from their jobs with pay, and tried. The jury was instructed that acquittal was proper if the policemen were acting within the law or if their actions were found to be in self-defense or in defense of another. All four policemen were found innocent of murder and, after the trial, returned to duty. There was considerable concern on the part of the black community, including direct complaints to the mayor stating that they did not trust the officers, could not respect them, and feared them. Representatives of the black community felt that the entire incident had racial overtones. The mayor said he did not believe that there were racial factors in this issue. He was quoted as adding, “If we punished a policeman for actions in the line of duty when we believe these actions were necessarily taken [sic], it would depress police morale and hamper law enforcement here.”

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 321

So, some get penalized and more do not, but in most all cases the public does not know what has happened to a policeman about whom question has been raised. The public then is in no position to evaluate the functioning of the police department in disciplining their own men. Police departments throughout the country have consistently insisted that they have the right to discipline in their way, have actively opposed all forms of outside reviewing agencies, and have been successful in this opposition. Yet there is no way for the public to know how they operate, and they operate very differently in different places and at different times. In the report of a task force for the National Commission on Causes and Prevention of Violence (1969), severe criticism was made of police internal review in general: “Secrecy and lack of procedural safeguards inevitably foster suspicion about the fairness of internal review” (p. 385). The fact that the findings are seldom disclosed to the public “deprives hearings of their value in promoting community relations” (p. 385). The report continues:
A major criticism o f internal review is that it seldom produces m eaningful discipline o f persons gu ilty o f p olice m isconduct. E ven w h en an officer is disciplined, the punishm ent is o ften so light as to be a token that aggravates rather than satisfies the grievant. B y contrast, m any departm ents im pose relatively severe penalties for violations o f m inor internal regulations. T h u s tardiness or insubordination m ay warrant an autom atic suspension that is m ore onerous than the sanction fo r physical abuse o f a citizen. . . . T h e inference is that internal review is m ore attuned to en forcin g organizational disciplines that redressing citizen grievances. ( p . 385)

## Coroner’s Inquest

In the light of the wide variety of police killings it seems strange that in our democracy approximately 99 percent of the killings are found to be noncriminal. Yet the law and legal procedures have been used to achieve this result. How? What

## 322 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

happens when a police officer kills a citizen while carrying out his duty? A large number of police killings are first dealt with by a coroner’s inquest. Such inquests are an ancient custom, having the purpose of deciding the cause of death of the individual concerned. Inquests generally can be held by the local coroner at his discretion, with or without a jury. In many jurisdictions there are no particular requirements about the character of the jury and people can be picked from the street to make a jury if they are citizens of the area. Coroners’ offices will usually hold an inquest if so requested by a district attorney, sheriff, chief of police, or city prosecutor. Rarely presided over by a judge, an inquest is not a court proceeding. The rules of evidence do not apply. Having no legal effect, the findings of the jury neither dictate nor preclude further civil or criminal action. The proceedings are run by the coroner, or often by a deputy prosecutor from the prosecutor’s office loaned to the coroner for that purpose. There are no mandatory adversary proceedings. If legal representatives of the deceased are present, they may ask questions only at the discretion of the coroner. Thus, in many situations, attorneys for the deceased or the deceased’s family are permitted to write out questions, some of which, at the discretion of the coroner or his deputy prosecutor, are asked to witnesses. No one explains the law to the jury which is supposed to make a decision of some sort even though the decision will have no legal weight. Whatever the coroner’s decision, or the coroner’s jury’s decision, the prosecutor retains the responsibility of deciding whether there is basis for criminal charges to be brought against the killer.
    Prosecutors use coroner’s jury’s decisions. Because of the
structure of the coroner hearings in police homicide cases, a structure in which the proceedings are controlled by the coroner and/or deputy prosecutor, both closely involved with the police force, coroner’s jury’s decisions are almost consistently that the homicide is noncriminal. Prosecutors then, in announcing a decision not to bring charges against the policeman killer, state that they are leaning on the decision of the coroner’s jury. The public, even the sophisticated public, does not

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 323

know the subtleties and the facts of this matter. For example, the San Francisco Examiner (1969) opened a report of the results of the coroner’s jury’s inquest into the death of A.L. by stating “Police Officer G.R. has been officially [sic] cleared of any wrongdoing in the March 30 fatal shooting of A.L., a black 19-year-old.” And unfortunately this is not uncommon. The authorities and the public media tend to deal with the coroner’s inquest as if its decision were an official and final one. In Seattle, L.W., a black veteran of the Vietnam war, was killed by Officer J.H. on May 15, 1970. The inquest jury, by a 3 to 2 vote, found the killing to be criminal, the first inquest finding against a law enforcement officer in the county in at least 20 years. The county prosecutor stated that “the verdicts of inquest juries are not binding [on him], even though all prosecuting attorneys in King County for the past 35 years have adhered to the verdicts returned by coroners’ juries” (The Seattle Times, 1970b). He added that the “split verdict” must be treated as no verdict and is analogous to a hung jury. No charges were brought against Officer J.H.
    Some students of the inquest system feel that it has endured
for two reasons. One is that in many states prosecutors do not have investigative staff and the inquest allows the prosecutor an opportunity to obtain information on which to base his decision whether to file a criminal charge. This may be especially true when a police officer is involved in a death because ordinarily the prosecutor must rely upon information supplied by the police. Yet it is very clear that much pertinent information, even vital information, may not be brought out in the inquest. The system fails on that purpose.
    The other reason why the system has endured is that the
verdict offers the prosecutor an institutional escape route for justifying a refusal not to prosecute. The figures in Seattle, not unlike the statistics in many other cities in the country, point up the issue: For at least 20 years no coroner’s jury had declared a police killing to have been criminal; for 35 years no prosecutor had made a judgment different from that of the coroner’s jury. The L.W. case changed both those figures; the coroner’s jury declared that the police killing was criminal and

## 324 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

the prosecutor refused to go along with the coroner’s jury’s decision. Coroners’ juries may have their purpose and may well have an important part in a state’s legal structure. But in the evaluation of cases of police killing civilians in the United States, it does seem clear that the coroner’s jury is a poor vehicle for discovering truth or for achieving justice.

## Prosecution in Police Homicides

There are other procedures, a grand jury or a criminal trial, but all fall short of our ideals of justice, and almost always the result is predictable—a police homicide is noncriminal. One major source of this near unanimity is the crucial role of the prosecutor. In many instances he alone makes the decision whether to bring charges against the officer or to clear him. Whatever the conclusion of a coroner’s jury—in which he or one of his deputies often plays a central part—the decision to charge still rests with him. The prosecutor leads and guides the grand jury and is the one attorney present at its secret hearings. Finally, if there are criminal charges, it is he who must prosecute the policeman. The prosecutor has a central and highly responsible position in the law enforcement structure. But in cases having to do with the police, his position is confounded by his deep and mutually dependent involvement with fellow law enforcement officers. In most of his work the prosecutor is dependent upon the police for information about and investigation of the crime, and policemen are very often the principal witnesses in criminal cases brought by the prosecutor. The relationship is crucially interdependent, and the complexity of the mutual need is emphasized in states where the prosecutor’s department does not have independent facilities for investigation. The police then are in fact an arm of the prosecutor’s office; all are an intimate part of the law enforcement apparatus of the state. In such a setting, it is almost impossible for the prosecutor to be free and unbiased.

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 325

Paul Chevigny (1969), who studied police abuses in New York City, saw the prosecutor as a central figure:
T h e p ow er o f any district attorney to p rotect the p olice and perpetuate abuses is nearly as great as his p ow er to elim inate them , and unfortunately m ost prosecutors in the U n ited States have chosen to side uncritically w ith the police, (p. 250)
The interdependence that exists between prosecutor and police runs as well through other facets of the law enforcement system. Judges too are dependent on the prosecutor, work closely with him, and in criminal cases are dependent upon police witnesses. Judges have the opportunity to be more independent than the prosecutor; they certainly are not dependent upon the police and prosecutor in the same way that the prosecutor is on the police. But they are part of the same force, whose function is to bring law, order, and justice to the community. Chevigny’s (1969) judgment about the rule of courts is pertinent here:
T h e courts do play an im portant role in protectin g the police from criticism . It is the job o f the trial courts to find facts upon the cover charges brought b y the police. T h e y have the p ow er to shield police officers from effective com plaints b y citizens, and th ey use it all to o often, (p. 251)
Chevigny notes that in ordinary assault cases a judge will consider a defense saying it was the complainant not the defendant who committed the assault. When a police officer is the complainant, however, such a defense is rarely listened to. Judges see such a defense as “an attack upon the authorities,” and “an effort to impeach a witness, the policeman, upon whose credibility he is compelled to rely in thousands of cases.” Chevigny concludes:
If the judges seem doubtful about defenses based upon p olice abuses, the reader can im agine their reaction to an attem pt to

## 326 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

prosecute a p olice officer. P olice officers prosecute citizens for assault as a m atter o f course, but I have y e t to see a citizen take ou t a sum m ons against a p olice officer for assault and g e t his case to trial, (p . 251)
Sometimes cases against police officers for killing do get to trial. Some are formalities. One city which had a policy of bringing policemen automatically to court is Denver. Bert M. Keating,1Denver district attorney, stated that he makes the decision as to whether the case is one of justifiable homicide. If so, it is filed as murder:
. . . and then m y office accepts the first 12 jurors subject to voir dire exam ination b y defense counsel. A t the con clu sion o f the state’s case I join in defense cou n sel’s m otion for directed verdict o f n o t guilty. . . . I have never had a judge, in the 17 years I have been district attorney, refuse to grant the m otion.
Mr. Keating went on to say that the importance of this sort of hearing stems in part from the fact that the statute of limitations against murder does not run in the state of Colorado, “therefore, it becomes important to have a judicial hearing as soon as possible to prevent someone, at a later time when the record is cold and witnesses have disappeared, to demand a hearing.” There are other jurisdictions with similar practices. On December 11, 1969, J.H. was killed by Patrolman P.A. in Shawnee, Oklahoma. He had been suspected of armed robbery, was trying to elude a police dragnet, and was finally cornered in a bus station. He fought with officers and was shot by P.A. when he tried to get one of the officer’s guns. The Shawnee News Star describes the procedure as follows:
T h e D A ’s office, having review ed the evidence and interview ed all w itnesses personally, finds the case to be clearly one o f justifiable hom icide. H o w e v e r , accord in g to the general custom and tradition in cases o f this typ e, the officer in volved in a hom icide under such circum stances is offered an op p ortu n ity to request

1. Keating, B. M. Personal Communication, 1965.

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 327

that charges be filed against him in order that there be a judicial determ ination o f record m ade for p osterity—since, in such cases, the statute o f lim itations runs forever. (1970)
The district attorney added that Officer P.A. had requested that charges be filed against him and the case was set for a nonjury trial. Judges then often join prosecutors in these issues. Attorney Keating’s decisions in Denver may have all been fine but it is striking that in no case did the judge differ with him on the question of probable cause to bring charges against the policeman. In some cases, judges are more explicit. In 1967 P.J., 20 years old, was killed by Sgt. R.H. in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The policeman’s partner had stopped a car after receiving information that two men in the car were trying to sell stolen suits. P.J. had no identification papers but when searched a match box was found. Officer R.H. later testified that he had attended federal narcotics seminars and had seen illegal drugs many times during his seven years on the force. Suspecting that the material in the box was marijuana, R.H. reported: “I said ‘marijuana, huh?’ and he said ‘Yeah.’ ” P.J. fled after being placed under arrest and was killed by R.H. The defense attorney asked for a directed verdict of acquittal, arguing that P.J. was a felon being in possession of marijuana, and that the killing was therefore justifiable. The judge, hearing no opposition to the request from the prosecuting attorney, noted that state law specifically says that a commissioned officer is allowed to shoot in an attempt to apprehend a felon, and that persons who are fleeing from arrest on serious charges must be stopped. He added, “Had the officer permitted the felon to escape he would have been subject to the censure of the public and his superior officers.” A more extreme statement by a judge occurred in the 1969 case of H.W., 32 years old, who was beaten in Clarksdale, Mississippi, by Police Captain L.C. and died the following day. The captain and an off-duty sergeant had gone to a cafe on a duty call; they saw H.W. who seemed drunk and asked him to walk outside. He staggered and was arrested for public

## Trials

There are, however, real trials, where true adversary proceedings take place before an impartial judge and a jury. In studying police homicides I made a special effort to follow up on cases where criminal trials were held, but could only discover three that concluded with criminal penalties. One case, reportedly the first successful prosecution of a law enforcement officer for murder in the state of California, concerned Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff R.S., 25 years old and white, who killed R.M., a 20-year-old black man on August 18, 1969. Four deputies went to a gift shop in response to a “burglary in progress” call, saw a front window broken; three entered the store, one going to guard the back door. R.S. saw M. hiding in the rear of the shop, later testified that he believed that M. attempted to shoot him. The policeman fired one shot, hitting M. in the abdomen and killing him. A 22caliber revolver was found at the scene by homicide detectives. A coroner’s inquest returned a unanimous verdict of “death

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 329

not by criminal means,” the California method of saying that it was a justifiable killing. However, two months later Deputy Sheriff R.S. was dismissed from his post and booked on the charge of suspicion of murder in the killing. A careful statement by Los Angeles County Sheriff Pitchess included the following:
T h e initial investigation b y sheriff’s hom icide detectives revealed that M. reportedly was in possession o f a 22-caliber, 2-inch revolver. U p o n recen tly receivin g n ew evidence, I im m ediately instructed hom icide d etectives to reopen the case and as a result o f hundreds o f hours o f additional investigation, inform ation and evidence w ere developed that resulted in the dismissal o f S. from the sheriff’s departm ent and im m ediate arrest fo r murder.
The new evidence was not to be released for fear of jeopardizing the case, which Pitchess called a very difficult one. The sheriff would only say that the probe was continued “in spite of the coroner’s inquest.” After a closed preliminary hearing, R.S. was bound over for trial in Los Angeles Superior Court on a murder charge. Two detectives from the sheriff’s homicide division explained:
D irectly after the incident took place, w e w ere inform ed that perhaps R .S.’s story as he told it to the inquest jury was n ot true; that perhaps M. did n ot have a gun in the darkened g ift shop. T h ere w ere several allegations that M . w as totally unarm ed. A n investigation revealed that M. had no gun at the scene o f the crim e and that S. had lied to the coron er’s inquest. A t this p oin t it was also obvious that S. had falsified his official report.
Eventually R.S. was found guilty of second degree murder and sentenced to 5-years-to-life in state prison for the fatal shooting of M. During the trial the prosecution contended that S. had planted a gun near M. after shooting him in the stomach. The chief witness against the policeman at the trial was his partner at the time of the shooting. The partner testified that the planted gun was passed around after the shooting to avoid possible negative results on M’s fingerprints. Superior

## 330 / POLICE MISCONDUCT

Court Judge James G. Kolts, on imposing sentence, said: “This court cannot condone unlawful violence perpetrated by those who have the sanction of society to use force to protect and maintain society.” A second case, also a “first instance of an alleged murder-inuniform in city history,” occurred in Portland, Oregon, in
 1969. Patrolman S.S. was charged with first degree murder,
accused of deliberately shooting C.H., a 27-year-old fugitive, from a distance of four feet with a 12-gauge shotgun while H. was crouched on his knees and elbows in a bush where he hid while trying to elude the police. The shotgun S.S. used was an unauthorized weapon. S.S. had deliberately travelled some seven miles out of his district to serve the felony warrant on C.H., and it was alleged at the trial that S.S. was having a sexual affair with the wife of C.H. The jury was instructed it could return one of four verdicts: first degree murder, second degree murder, manslaughter, or acquittal. They found S.S. guilty of manslaughter. He was sentenced to five years on that charge and three years for perjury, to be served concurrently. The third case which resulted in a criminal penalty concerned the death in 1967 in Memphis, Tennessee, of M.S., 48 years old, who died a few hours after being taken to the Memphis. City Jail following an arrest for drunkenness. A few days later, a city jail “turnkey” was charged with murder by the police. The Shelby County grand jury indicted L.B., a 32 year old black, a policeman for four years, on a first degree murder charge in the death of M.S. The trial was marked by charges of racism and frame-up and the policeman denied all accusations of having mistreated his prisoner. The jury finally found L.B. guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced him to one day in jail. These are rare results of not so strange cases; the patterns of fact are repeated time and time again. There is considerable circumstantial evidence that planting of weapons by the police on their victims is not as unusual as public information suggests (Berkley, 1969). For example, a grand jury report on the killings of two brothers, G.P. and R.P., in Groton, Connecti-

## UNNECESSARY POLICE FORCE / 331

cut, in 1969 stated that the four involved Connecticut state troopers lied to the coroner when they denied an informer was involved, and when they stated one of the brothers had opened fire first. The facts, according to the grand jury, were that the brothers were unarmed and, after they were killed, one of the troopers panicked. “All I could think of is what the papers are going to say and what it was going to do to the state police. . . . They’ll kill us, they’ll crucify us, these guys weren’t armed.” So Sergeant R.G. took out his own .45, fired a shot in the wall from where the bodies were, and dropped— planted—the gun on the floor. . . .
There is far too intimate an involvement among police, prosecutor, mayor, and judge, among all members of the law enforcement establishment. The fact that justice is not available, that there is form without substance, that there is talk without meaning gives rise to bitterness, a bitterness which is deserved and understandable, on the part of members of minority groups who are often the victims of police killings. They are urged to respect law and to expect order and justice, but they can see, when they are directly involved, that justice is not available. They see hypocrisy. This often leads to a persistent and generalized suspiciousness of the legal system and of those in power. The suspiciousness and skepticism is reaffirmed every time a policeman is involved in an action against a citizen, particularly when the act is something society says it holds to be heinous, namely, the killing of an individual. Our leaders talk about the need to limit violence, yet in cases where the violence is done by representatives of the state it appears to be condoned. Clearly, if this substantive problem of police killing is not dealt with in more just fashion, it will continue to exacerbate the already aggravated problems between the police and the poor communities in all cities. Human relations efforts alone cannot bring about the trust and respect of law, order, and justice crucial to a democratic society.
